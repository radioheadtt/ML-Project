0,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          mine came in perfect condition  some reviews list some  common  problems but mine is just fine and i couldn t be happier  comes with two needles  i m including a    second video  listen to that audio quality      
1,1.0,                       our son used his two times  and on the third time  it smoked  smelling of electrical burning  and stopped working  luckily  he had not fallen asleep and turned the power off immediately  after contacting the seller to request a refund return exchange  the seller closed the request with a pat message about  the purchase being in the final stages so they re unable to process a cancellation    they did not address the issues presented  nor the refund request  leading one to believe that they knew they had a defective product  but could still keep the money  sadly  they weren t wrong  another reviewer stated that neither the first nor the second player she received some time ago worked   amazon cannot support a refund through their claim process as the item arrived  intact    we now have no turntable   no money  but do feel blessed to still have our family and home safe  interestingly  i was required to choose a star in order to provide a review   i would give zero stars to this product and to the seller  as they must know by now that this product is defective and catches on fire      
2,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          after about    hours of use  it started squeaking like crazy  loud comical squeaks    like i have all sorts of things in my home that turn  rotate  and have electric motors  none of them squeak  but this sounds like a fart every rotation update  i took it apart and discovered a small piece of plastic that had wedged itself into the turning mechanism  i was able to put it back together  but i had to look up tutorials on how to get the belt back on  a slightly complicated repair for something the size of a fingernail  it works fine now  but still keeping the   star review because of the hassle of having to fix a practically new record player      
3,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i love it the sound quality is pretty good to my standards  ships fast  volume is great  to future buyers be careful with the tonearm on any turntable  always use the life and lower feature as well as the arm lock  and there is no slip mat so make sure you have one before playing records  there is also a replacement needle  and don t touch the groves of the records so they ll stay clean     
4,1.0,                       as is usual with most items on amazon  as soon as negative reviews creep up  the item is reposted and the score is somewhat  reset    wish amazon would fix this  but hey  they re making money so they obviously don t care record players are not usually made for travel use  or cheap for this case  because of the heft the arm a record player requires in order to have sufficient and tune able weight on a record   this is important because if enough weight is not placed on the arm  then you get skipping   what can you do   you can ghetto rig it by taping a penny or quarter at the top of the tip and see if this rectifies it   if it fixes it  then it means you have a cheap record player   aka a victrola record player   don t get this   just get a real one   this might be worth it when it drops to      but not any more than that      
5,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i absolutely love it   been trying to get a record player for a while now  i can finally play my records i got from my grandmother      
6,1.0,                       i was hoping to love this turntable  but  i should have remembered that with electronics  we get what we pay for  it arrived in very flimsy box  no outer box for protection  the inside of the turntable had cardboard shavings of some sort throughout  it looked like it had been in a wood shop i packaged it back up and returned it  i have purchased another brand  audio technica  that doesn t have the retro look i was hoping for  but the quality is what i was looking for i would not recommend this unit to anyone      
7,1.0,                       my return window closed   weeks ago and the power quit working today  the speakers were the first to go and now the power won t come on at all  the charger is fine for other appliances  the turn table itself is very cheap plastic  it was cute and fun for the month that it lasted  but i would absolutely not purchase again      
8,5.0,                       i d like to start this off by saying i am not very educated on records or bluetooth  i purchased this because i love all things vintage and i ve been dying to play my mary poppins and sound of music records  i was a bit hesitant to purchase this record player because so many reviews mentioned the speakers being weak and needing to purchase a seperate bluetooth speaker  so i decided to purchase it from a store in case i was disappointed with the speakers and wanted to return it  i bought this record player   days ago and have played    different records on it so far  i am completely satisfied with my purchase  i have a   bedroom ranch and with the volume all the way up i can hear music in every room  i m sure if i had my loud family over for the holidays we would be able to hear the music no problem  also  even being    i m terrible when it comes to technology so i was nervous first setting up this player  it was so easy to do and i was able to listen to music in   minutes of opening the box  this record player completely filled my needs and exceeded my expectations    stars        
9,5.0,                       played it  all night impressive gizmo for under       even the price is historic has almost every bell and whistle   even  line out   rca  red and white  jacks in the back note  you know that popping sound people call scratches   they aren t from sratches at all dust got into the tiny miccrogroves  you can see the little dust bunnies under a microscope you could wash your record  just be careful not to get the label wet   i just used armor all original and then wiped it good with a dry tissue  sounds like new now      
10,1.0,                       absolutely disgusted  and disappointed   i have purchased other  modern  record players  and found there to be poor quality sound  and even worse components   yet i had hoped that a record player with the name of  victrola  behind it   an absolutely  legendary name   in the phonograph industry   would be the exception      my hopes are for naught   the speakers are horrific  and the    speed is too fast  and something that is all too common in electronic devices   the headphone jack does not work properly   if i had a dollar for every time this had happened when i have purchased electronics with headphone jacks  i could put myself through school and learn in depth electronics  and create my own jacks  that actually work   do not purchase this record player  or any other modern  lower price  record player  especially the  retro  looking nostalgia types   they are junk   i want my money back  victrola       
11,5.0,                       this is not the highest quality record player you can buy  but it s still real good  this is a nice  inexpensive little turntable that is more than enough for those of us with small home collection of vinyl albums  i chose pink because it was the cheapest color at the time of purchase  it has built in speakers  which was a requirement for me  but it also has an output so that you can play it through external speakers  this can t be connected to computer like some record players  but it is portable and very nice looking  it has three speeds and it will automatically stop playing once it reaches the end of a record  which is really  really nice  the built in speakers aren t the greatest quality  and they don t get as loud as i d like  but they re still good and more than acceptable  it comes with a back up replacement needle  which is really cool  the biggest complaint is that the record hangs off the side  and it s designed in a way that you can t directly place the record onto the player  if you tried to place it directly down  it would bump into the needle arm  so when you place records on the player  you have to kind of angle it to go underneath the needle arm  but this is just a minor inconvenience at most  i would still recommend this player as it is great quality and relatively inexpensive      
12,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          love it   can t stop playing records   everything was packaged well  easy instructions   great product      
13,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          it s much lighter than i expected  but it was packed in plastic bags and styrofoam so it was well protected in the box  everything has a nice feel to it meaning it doesn t feel cheap and the lid is lined with  velvet  and the  victrola  is raised   nice little touch  i was a little surprised it wasn t in a cardboard shipping box as it was just the regular manufacturer s box like you d buy it in at a store  however  it was in perfect condition  it set up and ran very easy  the only thing i d change is better speakers  but they re as good as i expect for this price and i planned on using bluetooth speakers anyway  i d also change the auto stop function so that the arm returns to the stand  but at least it has auto stop so you can be doing other things while listening to your music and not worry about the needle bumping the label repeatedly until you can get to it  i love the look and it works great  i think it s a great deal for less than          
14,1.0,                       i already had the victrola vintage looking radio with a cd player  radio  vinyl record player  etc  which had a bad needle that would skip relentlessly  so i bought this in hopes that it d be different it sure was different  it was worse the needle skips all the time on all of my records  new and old  it s seriously annoying  also  the speakers have horrible quality and defeat the purpose of buying a record player in the first place      
15,1.0,                       wish i had read the reviews for this product  jeezzz      read reviews later after this happened   plugged it in  red power light did not come on  went to read the instructions in the living room and came back    minutes later to the record player on fire  my classic beatles  st edition sgt  peppers album melting and smoke everywhere and curtain by the window just beginning to smolder  glad i did not leave the house with this  frankenstein  of a product still plugged in it s impossible to make an electronic product this bad with the technology today   what just happened i don t know victrola company  look into this now      
16,5.0,                       this record player is amazing  i was hesitant to buy because some of the reviews were saying it was broken or the speakers sucked but i got this for my boyfriend who is a musician and he is in love with it  it sounds great and plays the records great  so happy with this purchase  i      recommend it      
17,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          first off before i write this review let me just say i did a lot of research on this kind of record player and even a few of my own experiments so i would consider what i found to be pretty credible  i wish someone wrote a review like this for me when i was considering buying it    is this a good record player for beginners or people who only want a few records to play for the aesthetic  absolutely  the sound quality is meh  but i mean what do you expect for      it plays the records no problems  and the bluetooth is great for just whenever now here is how you can upgrade your setup with minimal spending  get an rca to mini jack cable  plug that into a speaker you already have or if in my case you have a practice amp cause you play an instrument  get a mini jack to     converter and plug it into the amp  it works great    will this ruin my records no  it will not  i made a little scale and using pennies weighed out the tracking force to be around  g  now compared to      record players that track at  g this seems like a lot  but be aware  when records were made  they were made to withstand up to   or  g of tracking force cause lots of old players tracked at around   or  g  now tracking heavier like this will yes  wear them out faster  but it will not ruin them  the needle is also a diamond  so the needle is pretty decent actually now you can actually fix the tracking force on this thing  get a small scale  like the kind to bake with  put your tone arm on it  get some pennies and nickels and start stacking them at the back of the tone are where the counterweight should be  one your tone arm reads at about      g  take those coins  tape them together  and tape them to the back of that tone arm  maybe even go for around      g because in my experience these cheap ones skip very easily    is it portable absolutely not  you need to plug it into an outlet  and it could totally break with some throwing around  also the lid is completely useless i took the lid off by unscrewing the screws on the back hinges  the lid is not big enough even when open to run     vinyls  the edge is right under your record  like millimeters under  and if you have any warping  at all it will hit the edge and cause it to skip  this is likely the problem a lot of people have when it skips and just don t know it  just take the lid off its useless    does it skip  does it sound weird no  not at all  i had it skip on me once  and after replaying that section it never did it again  probably was just my fault since i accidentally tapped the vinyl i was playing when getting it out of the sleeve  also i tested the wow and flutter using a phone app  let me tell you that it is bad  like the wow and flutter is really high  but  even so  i didnt notice any sort of distortion in the sound  it might be worse when playing above   rpm but at least for     its fine    is it worth the price      as long as you know what your getting  i didn t expect this player to be good or even great  its okay at best and i m fine with that cause its      if you are looking for a very nice player that delivers great sound quality  dont get this  if you want to really get into vinyl  dont get this  if you want to experience the most you can from your records  dont get this  if you want to just play a couple of records for cheap and have them in your room cause its cool and aesthetic  go ahead  im doin it for that exact reason  also  i purchased an amazon return and found no problems with it  dont be afraid to purchase a used one for less  you can always return it if it is actually broken  but it will probably work anyway      
18,1.0,                       sound is fine  no issues  portability is not great  it requires a plug in and no where to carry it  dumb  my main issue    the genius design team decided the flag should be upside down when carrying and playing  fail  thanks  but no thanks  research what the american flag distress signal is victrola  it doesn t go on your music box      
19,1.0,                       i am so pissed off about this record player   i was sooo excited and wanted to jam out my old records   and i did    day   i didn t use the record player for about a month after that cause i went on vacation and forgot about it   but when i got back  i was pumped to listen to tunes    so  i went to go play a record   and  i swear   i smelled smoke   and    it didn t work at all   the little light didn t even come on   i mean   i didn t even move it from it s spot at all   it had been too late to return it   i never write reviews good or bad really  but heads up on this one   it really made me sad it didn t work after   time    boo to the manufacturer   boo      
20,1.0,                       excited by the opportunity to own a new record player in        i gave my old records from the   s a spin  no problems  they all sound great  rocky iv soundtrack  streets of fire  the psychedelic furs  i was in heaven  so i buy some new records   newly pressed  sealed  modern records  they all skip like crazy  this record player sucks      
21,4.0,                       i purchased this product for my daughter whom had lost most of her possessions in a move   we wanted to replace her record player but didn t want to spend a ton of money   the reviews were ok so we decided to drop the    dollars for this player   the color is super vibrant   the player itself is a pretty good   it has blue tooth capability   which is pretty great   the sound through the speakers is fine for what it is   it is not the best player but for the money it works well   we can hear it fairly well in the bedroom   the packaging was terrible   they just shipped in the original box  i would of liked to have seen it packaged a bit  better with some wrap around it inside another box   i didn t expect it to work to be honest   the box looked beat up a bit   but in the end it works and over all happy with the product i give this a   star     star  nope  do not like it at all    i would either return or throw away this product  it was a waste of my money and not functional  i will never order again      star  think twice before buying   don t like it   i m not a fan of this item and i won t order it again  but it has at least one positive quality       star  it s ok   this item has both positive and negative qualities  it may work for some people  but i wouldn t go out of my way to purchase or recommend it        star  i like it   this item arrived and functions as advertised  i would change a few things about this  including pricing   but is a good product overall  i would use this item         star  i love it    this item is awesome  i will use it and recommend it to others  i just love it  it works as advertised and is an all around great product all of my reviews are written with the hope of helping other amazon customers make the right buying decisions for themselves  to help increase awareness of a particular product it might be positive or negative  but in the end it is honest  thank you for reading my review  i hope it has helped you  i will be happy to answer any questions if that might help you make your decision  have a great day

23,5.0,                       i spent   weeks looking at reviews  unboxings  opinion pieces  i got exactly what i wanted for the best price  if you re willing to spend      on a pair of audiophile headphones  this isn t for you  if you are cool with the sound quality coming off your phone but louder this is for you pros  the top of the case doesn t run on your records  it s cheap compared to every other record player with the same damn components  it has auto stop  bluetooth  line in cons  the reason it sounds  bad  is because the case is open  use a smaller record and close the lid and you ll hear the difference   or just get some cheap ass speakers if you really care that much ps  the reason everyone complains about these suitcase record players and they say they sound bad is because they know nothing about records they don t know that dust gets on them and they get charged with static   just wash the damn things you fools and stop putting your finger all over them  they ll sound miles better      
24,5.0,                       measuring about the size of a small    to    inch laptop pc  but   inches deep  this is the perfect portable and stowaway companion for my    plus years of lps  yes  it also sounds just right through the two small front facing stereo speakers  this victrola is also a bigger eargasm when using my larger stereo speakers or extra bass headphones  to use my medium sized bluetooth speakers  i will soon buy a rca cable bluetooth transmitter for the turntable s rca output connector on the back the build and sound quality reminds me so much like the portable album and      players we had for pop up parties at school or hang outs at a girlfriend s house  yet  it s almost as light as my small laptop pc  this was truly a great buy that i will get a lot of regular use from playing all my    s  and    s  again  and buying some current artists on vinyl  even my dad s surviving    s  also sound awesome  but are rough on the easily replaceable stylus trust this for certain  uncompressed analog audio sounds much fuller and impressive than the compressed digital sound we ve gotten used to over the last    years  don t believe it  well  you ll hear the same distinct similarities that those mostly  old head  jurors heard and knew when listening to the blurred lines song  pharrell and thicke  while clearly remembering the sounds from marvin gayes  worldwide      hit and party jam  got to give it up   old head  ears  like me  are more attuned to hearing a much fuller spectrum of sounds  ranges and rhythms than people who have only listened to compressed digitized music  simply  it just sounds more full  real and live even the price on this   speed stereo turntable was under     perfect  it s well worth buying for all those middle and subtle sounds i ve been missing in my music and comedy albums  buy this victrola portable record player  and finally get your   st century musical head and ears right     at a low cost  your mind  body  soul and ears will thank you      
25,1.0,                       my most recent purchase was the second player i had ordered  the first player did not work straight out of the box  no phono  no line in  no bluetooth  no sound  nothing  i purchased another one and it actually played for about    minutes before it stopped working too  i thought it had perhaps come with a faulty ac adapter but i tried another one and still  nothing wait  i thought i heard some static coming from those speakers  great  nope  never mind  it stopped working again  ugh i love the look and the portability but i am a bit of a utilitarian  i don t want to carry around a neat little box for no discernible reason  it needs to have some sort of function and unfortunately it s not heavy enough to use as a door stop      
26,1.0,                       i wasn t expecting much as far as the built in speakers  as i expected it is poor quality  but when you plug in your own speakers the quality doesn t get much better  my phone speakers actually produce a higher quality sound  even if this were selling for half its price i wouldn t waste my money if i had another chance  i am going to have to get a new record player      
27,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          like that its compact and comes with adapter to play    s   red and white rca outputs in back  i ll plug into a mixer then the skies the limit once i get the replacement  plugged a bluetooth transmitter into headphone jack then paired with amazon echo  be sure to play last song till the end on all size records as  auto off  feature can be defective as shown in video   built in bluetooth is a receiver not a transmitter and worked perfectly   built in speakers worked perfectly   all manufacturers sometimes produce lemons  i will lower rating if replacement is also defective update  replacement works great      
28,1.0,                       first one came and didn t work at all   so we returned and ordered another   the next one worked for about   days  then the arm stopped working properly   now the arm won t electronically move   you have to manually move it and set in on the record  which is dangerous because you could accidentally scratch the record that way   so we are returning the second one  because we are afraid if we keep it we will scratch our records and worse  something else will go wrong with the player after the window to return it closes   to say i am disappointed is an understatement   i love all things british and bought the british flag design  and it s been since the late    s early    s since i operated a record player   the thrill of putting on a record was unsurpassed  for the whole day i used it   i now have to use my husband s record player and not have my own   really mad about this purchase  it s cheap and crappy   do not waste your time buying unless you enjoy returning things multiple times       
29,1.0,                       this   speed victrola portable record player arrived in a box that was not taped shut  that was my first clue that this could to be a  return  that got sent out as good merchandise  i hope  when i opened the box the power supply cord was tossed loosely on top of the player with the twist tie undone  the cord was not even nicely wrapped up  i took the player out of the box and removed the styrofoam protectors and undid the latch and open the player to discover that the plastic needle protector that was so suppose to be on the needle  to be removed before playing a record  was missing  another clued that this could be a return that got passed on to me  then i discovered that the drive belt was lose and hanging out from beneath the turntable  okay  i figured that i could reattach it around the turntable and then around the drive shaft and i did so and was successful  next i connected the power supply and turned the power knob  the turntable spun  so i obtained one of my old lp s and placed it on the turntable and settled the needle down gently upon it  using the needle arm control  and the record started off fine  the sound was perfect and then the sound stopped  i turned the player off and then turned it on again  still no sound coming from the speakers  well  i m not that disappointed because anytime you purchase electronics from amazon  it s going to be a gamble  so  i will be returning this item as usual      
30,5.0,                       i m happy with this little record player  it s exactly what i expected  it s not high end  the speakers aren t the best  but its imperfections add to the vintage sounding experience i wanted from a record player  plays my old records fine  vintage beatles  elvis  etc   as well as my new  it has jacks on the back that i m sure would allow me to hook it up to my stereo if i decide to go for a bigger sound at some point the turn table has a wobble to it  but i don t ever remember owning one that didn t  arm seems weighted fine  no need to tape a penny to it like the one i had back in the day      
31,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i ve had this record player for about  months and i use it every single day  it worked every time  it plays loud and clear and doesn t distort when turned all the way up i also love the design  it s easy to use my kids have now grown a love for my passion of vinyl and they will be getting there own player soon as well easy set up  plug and play  perfect and easy to to move from room to room overall i love my little player   i was not paid or given discount for my review      
32,5.0,                       it s so pretty and works so good  i was worried it wouldn t be loud enough  but it is and it sounds amazing      
33,1.0,                       listen  if you wanna buy your youngster their first turntable so they can occasionally put one or two records on just for the novelty then this is the one for you  if your serious about music and like to hear the mids  bass and treble in crystal clear  awesome quality  skip this for sure  i bought this after reading some obviously paid reviews thinking i could plug in some computer speakers with a sub woofer and get some awesome sound  i was dead wrong  the horrible noise that comes out of this thing would be compatible to listening to a  kbps mp  playing through an old nokia cellphone but much louder and tinnier    i m dead serious  if you buy this thing  do not expect any sort of quality audio from it  speakers won t save it  changing the stylus won t help  cleaning all of your records like a nut won t help    it s like a little novelty toy turntable and that s it  it looks awesome  super portable and neat to look at but sounds like absolute trash  after   days i returned it and spent my money on an audio technica lp  x  about     x better  sounds amazing  has better features and you can plug anything into it  works like a charm  spend the extra     and save yourself the trouble  you ll thank me later      
34,1.0,                       do not buy this   i don t have much experience with record players but i know enough to know that the sound quality is      garbage  it sounds as if the needle is scratching the records  and the speakers are busted  not only is the sound bad  if you look at the record being played  you ll see it s actually warping your vinyl  this is the worst purchase i ve ever made and will be retuning it  update  i returned this item on the   th of this month and never received my refund  when i contacted amazon  they said they had refunded me and tried to pass the blame to my bank  the refund has still not been received nearly two weeks later  don t waste your time on this product because you may not even get your money back if you do decide to return it     
35,2.0,                       i was hopeful  with a mix of good and bad reviews  i was hopeful that maybe for some it just wasn t up to their standard and they were expecting a quality similar to a       turntable once i opened this up and had a look at it  i quickly realized why this is a         turntable the entire top panel that contains the nobs and switches is a cheap looking plastic  this includes the platter  luckily there are soft rubber parts of the platter to keep the record in place  all of this was sort of expected for the price after placing a record on and lowering the needle  the most shocking thing about this product forced its way into my ears    the sound of this product is a b s o l u t e l y horrible  some reviews mention no bass  but i wasnt expecting no bass at all  the sound from this sound like the cheapest speakers they could have possibly placed in this  theyre like the type of speakers that would be on a fast food kids meal toy i dont know if i got a bad egg  but i cannot believe that anyone thinks that this is good quality sound unless they ve been paid or reimbursed to review the product  or have never used anything other than cheap speakers i honestly believe i could go find better sounding speakers at the dollar store this of course is not the end of the world  i just grabbed another bluetooth speaker that i had and plugged in an aux chord and that resolved the speaker issue in addition to the cheap speakers  the platter wobbles quite a bit  and on top of that  one of the rubber spots on the platter was lower than the others  making the record wobble even more  so the sound of the music was very unstable and was very warped sounding i managed to partially resolve this by placing a few pieces of electrical tape on top of the lower rubber piece for anyone looking for a beginner record player  this would be it  but dont expect miracles will be returning to hopefully get a better version of this product and will update my rating if it is indeed betted      
36,2.0,                       arrived in originally unopened box packed just fine  however inside the box was totally useless  the only thing that worked was the led lights indicating what setting you re on  long story short  ended up taking it apart and finding the speakers not even plugged in  but wait  it gets better  the rubber band like belt that turns the table wasn t even on  there was electrical plugs not even plugged in  after a little messing with it  finally got it to work  speakers suck  but you can always buy new ones  works fine now      
37,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          decent record player  definitely not high quality speakers  kind of tingy with absolutely no bass  all treble  that was disappointing  if i turn it up louder it just gets worse  the quality i paid for i guess though  besides being cheaply made it looks cool and does what it s supposed to  i showed some of the features in my video as far as stopping a song  volume  and speeding up the record      
38,5.0,                       i absolutely love this player   it is very nice quality  especially for the price   i m not sure why some of the previous reviews mentioned a dislike to the sound quality   i think it sounds great  and it is loud   a vintage style record player isn t supposed to rattle the pictures off the wall anyway   very pleased      
39,3.0,                       i am giving this three stars because of the ease of returning and getting refunded   if it was difficult my rating would be lower   apparently  records are coming back in style  only now they call them vinyls and they keep them in sleeves   whatever   my daughter is into them so i bought her a cute  cheap record player   it is really cute  but the sound is pretty bad from the getgo   then after the third use  the speed started messing up and began warping the records   fortunately  i was within the    day return period and sent it back   it s disappointing because she was so excited when it arrived   her boyfriend replaced this with a real record player so she s happy again   i would suggest you spend more money for something better      
40,1.0,                       delivered      power stopped working      of course my amazon return window ended       no worries  i wisely bought the warranty   well it s still under manufacturers warranty so they won t help  so now i need to box it up  drop it off at ups  and then once it gets to them wait       business days to inspect and process my return    quite a pain and other reviewers also had short lifespans as for the product itself in the    days i had it  it is easy to use  sound is good for the price  i would avoid buying this for kids or actually trying to move it around  mine sat in one place and broke  can t imagine what any wear would do to it      
41,1.0,                       i had such high hopes for this cool looking record player but it is a huge disappointment  the sound is horrible this thing sounds like a       speaker system from a discount store  the record player arrived popping up from its mounted locaion  stayed away from this thing if they upgrade the sound quality and craftsman ship maybe but in tell then nope      
42,1.0,                       this is my first time owning a turntable  born in the late   s  i don t know what i was thinking purchasing something with included speakers   a huge mistake  even cleaning and deep cleaning a new vinyl didn t stop it from skipping every    seconds  it s not very loud and the sound is crappy  i am not an audiophile  but i should ve known bare minimum money would produce a bare minimum product  this is only for people that want a device to just listen to the songs  not get lost in the songs  clearly i need separate speakers for that  yeah it s more money but     if i m gonna invest money at all   it won t be for this piece of crap      
43,3.0,                       great for the money  but it s true it lacks greatly in the sound department  the speakers belong to a    toy radio but it ll play records just fine  just don t turn it up more than half way and you won t blow out a speaker  invest maybe in separate speakers cause you can t use this for gatherings or everyone will comment on how awful the sound is hahah     
44,4.0,                       i had taken my wife for a date night away from the kids  and the place we stayed at had a similar record player  crosley cruiser    we enjoyed it so much  i decided to get this to surprise her   the first time i used it  it skipped terribly on a new vinyl  causing some permanent damage to the beginning of it   bummer   when i calmed down  i decided to change out the needle with the extra one included with the player   viola   it then played to my expectations  which were not too high   the sound is a bit tinny  but that is actually what makes it more endearing  along with the retro look   i contacted victrola via email  and the same day they said they were sending out a replacement needle for the one that was originally installed   i don t plan to use the bluetooth function  so i can t attest to that  but i did hook it up to a soundbar successfully using rca cables   overall  if you don t plan to start a huge collection and if you aren t concerned about top notch sound  you won t find better for the price   and if you like to open some wine and have a romantic evening at home every once in awhile  this thing is great      
45,1.0,                       so very disappointed to have to give this one star  first of all  i had to wait   months for it to arrive  when it got here  i was so excited  it is absolutely adorable  the color was perfect  and it was just what i wanted  except that it doesn t play a record for more than    seconds before it starts skipping  i tried it in several different locations    hoping maybe it just needed a really flat surface   didn t matter  the sound quality from what i could tell seems ok  i had read a bunch of reviews  both good and bad  and thought there were so many great reviews  i d risk it  unfortunately  i got one that seems to have the same skipping issue as a lot of other folks  i m not saying don t order it  if mine had worked  i d be giving it at least   stars  just buyer beware that yours might be one of the ones that don t work  sending it back      
46,2.0,                       i loved the idea of this product  i bought this for my   year old for christmas   it was and still is his favorite thing   seeing his love for vinyl records and music in general is one of my favorite experiences in life   i could never return it for that reason alone that being said  from a technical standpoint  the build quality is really bad  right out of the box  i noticed that the turntable itself isn t mounted properly on its base  almost like it s warped or something  the tone arm is super loose and makes it a bit tough to position it where you want it at the end of the day  it s a gift that my   year old loves more than anything   however  if i d known that the build quality was going to be so poor before i bought it  i would have passed for something better      
47,1.0,                       this item worked the first time i used it  then  i pull it out a month later to use it with the album i had preordered  and the whole reason i bought this record player  and it won t even turn on  if anyone knows how to fix this   please let me know  thoroughly disappointed      
48,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          let s start with the number one issue with this record player  the speakers on it suck  they suck bad  they sound awful and i was so disappointed when i first played it because i thought vinyl was supposed to sound good  however  that being said  the record player is excellent if you connect it to a good speaker system  and for the price  i don t think you can expect much more  i ll tell you why i decided to keep it  because it s damn cute i got the one with the british flag cover and it s a dor a ble   i mean i really wanted a retro looking record player and this is spot on  once i connected it to my kikburn speaker via an auxiliary cable  not included  i was thrilled in the end i ended up connecting it to a block rocker max system that i wasn t getting much use out of except for parties and i m very happy with the results i m a little concerned that you cannot close the cover while playing you records because i have young kids and i m nervous that they will bump in to it while playing  but i do think it would add considerable bulk to the unit  so i m not sure i d actually choose to change that the auto stop feature is great and pretty much necessary  it s a bit pointless that it has the option to turn it off because i don t see why you d ever want to turn it off the soft needle drop function is also very convenient and makes playing records extremely easy for anyone and again  the look of it is just so darn cute  i can t bring myself to return it for one that say  has a cover or a better speaker etc  over all for the price i think it s great  i m very happy with it  but just know you absolutely will need external speakers to go with your adorable record player      
49,1.0,                       keeps skipping over records that are brand new out of package  makes zero sense  will be returning  i got a replacement and it does the same thing still  the tonearm needs to be heavier  this is a starter record player for our   yr old son so he can live with attaching a few pennies on top of the needle but the fact that we have to do this is ridiculous      
50,5.0,                       this little record player is fantastic and has returned me to the joys of collecting and playing vinyl lps  it is sturdy  has a small footprint and very simple to use  highly portable but i have mine in one place and have connected  nicer speakers via the rca jacks on the back  it comes with pretty good dynamic range speakers built into the cabinet but you are not going to get the full sounds that you probably want unless you hook up other speakers and a sub woofer  i bought the logictec z    system for mine and i now feel like i have the best stereo system i could ever want  rich  warm sound and thanks to the huge number of cheap  old lps out there  i have access to music that either never made it to cds or is too expensive  i really feel like a kid again with this turntable      
51,1.0,                       the device itself looked great until i realized that there was no cable cord included in the box   i decided to contact their customer support and the first time i called it went straight to voicemail  then i put in a request through their google forms  no reply and that was more than a month ago so last week i tried repeating the steps above since i still haven t received a cable cord  same results  i guess i wont e playing my record player anytime soon       
52,2.0,                       partially my fault for not further reading but this player doesn t connect to external bluetooth speakers rather you can connect other bluetooth sources to use the speakers on this  but why you would want to do that i have no idea as the speakers are pretty sorry on this in the first place  now  victrola does make one that allows you to play your records on an external bluetooth speaker unlike this one  i purchased another so i sent this back  look for  dual bluetooth connectivity  or model  vwm    sb lgy you ll be happier      
53,1.0,                       we bought this for a teenager that was super excited about getting into the retro vinyl vibe  super excited when she opened it until we played our first record   initially  we thought we had purchased records that were warped  as the newer vinyl  harry styles in particular   sorry harry   kept skipping  but found the culprit after a lot of googling  which revealed similar complaints about this record player  improper weight and balance to the tone arm  for those like me that aren t audiophiles  translation  the needle isn t pressing down hard enough to hold in the record groove  so it skips in certain spots   as i did more research  this seems to be more of an issue with newer records in particular maybe due to the way they are produced  several of the newer records we bought actually could be seen wobbling slightly up and down on the player as it turned  i now see that in several video reviews   if you really like the look and are determined to buy this  the  fix  is to add a small amount of weight above the needle  we added a penny right above the needle to test  apparently this was a fix in the old days when records skipped  and yeah    immediately eliminated skipping on all records for us  the new issue  you are now potentially adding too much weight and therefore wearing out your record faster  as well as a penny that may fall off ocassionally  bottom line  i would suggest passing on this and look for a record player that has a better balanced arm  or better yet  spend a little extra money and buy a player with an adjustable tone arm  which you set to a specific gram weight to hold the needle down   rock on harry      
54,5.0,                       this summer i enlisted the help of my two granddaughters ages    and    to help me catalog a large amount of records left to me by my deceased mother and father  among the records were    s from the    s    s and    s and    s from the    ss and older  the girls were completely amazed with the  giant cd s   when they wanted to hear them i no longer had anything to play them on  as i told them things about the artists i knew and the times i had grown up in we found most songs on the internet so they could hear the records they were cataloging  how thrilled they were to hear the long  ago songs and the voices of the dead that will forever live  i had offered to pay them for the hours of work they were doing to help me on the project and instead they wanted this  record player and a few of the albums  i was all too happy to oblige them  it arrived in perfect shape and on time  the kids were so excited to hear the first album played   it was the sound of music  it has continued to work well  note  on newer albums purchased today the  vinyl  is a little different and you may need to put a coin on the tone arm to make it a little heavier so it doesn t skip  there has been no trouble at all with the olderalbums      
55,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          if you rarely play records or are not much of vinyl collector  then sure it s probably alright  it comes with everything you need to turn on and play records  and it s as portable as a record player can be but the record player is poorly designed and records will wobble quote a bit  if you buy a lot of records  you ll eventually come across a record that skips a lot or the sound sounds warped  even though the record is fine so a good record player for the rare vinyl listener  or someone who wants to see if it s something that will even gain their interest but if you want to build a vinyl collection  and keep your records in the best shape  you ll probably need to buy a more costly record player  or look into and buy attachments that will help protect the records or get them to play better on this one  if that is even a possibility so i d only recommend it if you really want the portablility  or of you just want something cheap and affordable  and aren t worried about potential warping or damage to a vinyl over time due to poor design of this player      
56,1.0,                       this was a waste of money   i would not recommend this  the sound quality of this is terrible  honestly you barely hear anything it can be in the same room as you are and nope nothing  do yourselves a favor and invest in something else  there are a lot of people who were mixing a power cord  some said they received it and others didn t  i didn t so i guess that s also a hit or miss  terrible  you need the warranty trust me      
57,5.0,                       so my trusty sony direct drive i ve had for years needs some serious repairs   finding myself in this pickle  i ordered an audiotechnica with amazing reviews  however  upon receiving it  the unit was not only faulty  it also damaged two irreplaceable records of mine  i was so furious  i immediately asked for a return  at this point i was just looking for something that would be a reliable backup for the time being and after i fix my sony pros  this thing is reliable as hellit has a ton of very intuitive featuresthe arm is manually operated  no more auto arm failures  and it has an auto stop feature all of the cables are replaceable  i use gold rca cables for sound qualityit s portable cons the needles it comes with aren t great but they re just as good as audiotechnica s needles  i was able to find an elliptical needle that s compatible on a bidding website for under     and the sound quality is even better than units costing  x as much ps  it looks way more classy and timeless in person than it does in the pictures  i got the black version so  whether you re a beginner or an enthusiast  i highly recommend this item  and i highly recommend getting an elliptical needle to replace the stock one also  you will want to cut out some felt to put on the turntable under your records  just to be safe      
58,4.0,                       love this record player  it looks great in a room pretty enough to be decor and it sounds great  i ve received so many compliments from friends and neighbors who all want to buy there own  speaking of price it s such good quality for such a low price it s really easy to use  the bluetooth works great i love being able to play pandora from my phone when i don t want to listen to one of my records i also enjoy playing podcasts on it while i cook dinner  it s portablility is another great feature we like to sit on our back deck and listen to music while watchin the sunset  the white gold is beautiful the gold really stands out and goes with my decor vintage decor it doesn t look cheap at all only downfall is that the inside is like a velvet and i know its going to get dirty from any lil speck of dust and idk how i plan on cleaning it when it does  it s nice to be able to close the lid to keep that from happening it came with a couple small marks n spots on it being that it s white u can see very detail and i notice everything i definitely would not buy white again  i think the player gets loud enough i can hear it very well in other rooms but my husbands would prefer to get some other speakers for when we want it even louder     
59,1.0,                       purchased to finally finish my home theater set up  even bought a bunch new records to add to my very old collection  had the worst experience pros  it s a cool looking red  easy to put together  seller refund was quick  seller has yet to even send a return label after months of asking for one so i basically got a free paper weight cons  took weeks to arrive  sound quality is terrible  ran mine via the rca jacks into my surround sound and also the actual built in speakers are absolutely horrible  still have it in box in garage after i got refund from seller  no return label sent so it s now taking up precious space      
60,5.0,                       i bought this as a gift for my niece for christmas  since i wanted to leave some sort of review i took it out of the box to check for functionality and repacked it to wrap for her  the record player comes very well packaged and has many layers of styrofoam to keep it from breaking  the needle inside is also very well protected with wrappings  the power came on and it appeared to function just fine  it also comes with a handle that makes it super east to carry around from place to place i have since asked my niece if she liked the sound and she said it works and sounds great  and loves playing her records on it  she hasn t used the bluetooth option yet  not even sure she ever will  but i guess it s a nice feature for those that will use it      
61,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i have zero experience with records or record players  i love everything retro  and i got sick of buying all my music digital  even if it s convenient   so i thought why not try out a record player  this was the right price and a pretty color  so i went for it and picked up an amy winehouse album at my local half price books  i m blown away  i had it running in less than   minutes and the sound is awesome  no extra speakers needed  i m just listening to it in my living room   i absolutely recommend for anyone new to vinyl albums  i ve attached a video and a picture to give you a nice view   edit  the turntable on this is wobbly  it s not an even turn  i can notice that the records are unevenly spinning when i view it from the side where i sit on my couch  it doesn t appear to affect the music  that i m aware of  i don t know what s normal vinyl variance and what isn t  but it s really annoying to see and i m knocking off a star for it      
62,1.0,                       our teenage daughter  who is really an   s child at heart  loved the cool designs of the victrola record player   unfortunately this record player seems to be a very poor quality   we bought our first one at kohl s and it was this year s christmas present   after opening it we realized it was missing its needle   we bought replacement needles on amazon and tried again   with the new needle in place we spun a record  omg  the speakers were horrible   they played very softly and the volume knob did nothing   we returned it to kohl s after getting home  we went on amazon smile  everybody should shop via smile and support a charity such as the multiple system atrophy coalition     the reviews on the victrola were among the best so we decided to give it another try  assuming the first one from kohl s was a dud the new vintage victrola record player arrived quickly  our daughter was so excited  we unpackaged it and checked the needle  it was there  we put on a record and turned it on   the music came on at a nice sound level  the first verse was perfect   but then       the record started skipping   we tried a brand new record  more skipping  we could not get a record to play well   we turned it off and the music died two busts and we were done   we returned it hassle free and bought a different brand  similar style   the new record player sounds great and the same records that skipped on the victrola record player play perfectly on our new brand maybe we just got two duds  but we just don t trust the quality and are glad we moved on      
63,1.0,                       nice while it lasted  but after a few months  with very little use  it simply will not turn on   in fact i was using it  turned it off for a bit while i was doing something else  came back and turned it on   nothing   i do have an electronics background   the power supply is fine and power is making it to the main board but that s it  there is no power making it to the platter control board   there are no obvious signs of any shorts or burnt out components and since everything besides the capacitors are sub miniature components any further home repair is not an option you get what you pay for and this appears to be a hit or miss product   you ll either get one that keeps working or you ll get one that dies shortly after arrival   go ahead  spin the wheel    no  i would not recommend this product ps   due to other reviews mentioning problems with the electronics i highly recommend you do not leave this plugged in when not in use      
64,3.0,                       it s a mixed bag    if you re industrious and patient this record player offers great bang for your buck  if you are looking for something perfect  this isn t it    but keep in mind additional cost doesn t necessarily mean better quality bad    quality  like others have mentioned the ac dc adapters that come with these record players seem to have a very high failure rate  my adapter failed after    mins of use  so it seems if you received a bad unit you ll know pretty quickly  the seller mfg seems to stand behind the failure and my replacement is in route to me at this moment  but i m sure it can be frustrating to many expecting initial problem free use    sound   with only    watts of power and small speakers you re not going to blow anyone away with a  wall of sound  but it performs adequately with realistic expectations input   not horrible  but worth noting this for devices already sending powered audio  if you re hoping to plug in an unpowered mic you are likely going to be disappointed the good    simplicity   if a there was a  best case scenario  component to fail on this product    the ac dc adapter is it  the record player is powered by a  v  a ac dc power supply that is plugs into the back via a    mm x   mm barrel plug  the plug is center positive  which is typical  these can easily be found as part of a universal ac dc set  i keep a couple spare universal ac dc adapters on hand for just such occurrence   the low power requirements needed to run this player and generic power plug make it a great candidate for using portable power  i was successful powering the device reliably using a portable cellphone battery backup  to do this  you need a battery that s rated to produce    a or more  although    a is more than player needs  battery amperage rating is theoretical max  and a usb cable  not included  that has usb a  male  on one end and the barrel power tip on the other  amazon does sell these and i would highly recommend this since you could also use a standard usb phone tablet ac adapter in a pinch  a pc or laptop will not provide adequate power via usb    portability   device is pretty light  easily carried by adult or child  the possibility using portable power make the portability option even better    value    for the price it s hard to go wrong    essentially   devices in      record player  bt speaker  wired speaker      
65,1.0,                       i love this record player and would give it a much better rating  except that it arrived without the    adapter   and one of the main reasons i purchased it  was to play the many  many    s i have collected through the years   it s got a nice sound and i love that the needle arm sets itself down  i ve tried contacting the manufacturer and got nowhere with them   amazon sells this  but they can t get me the replacement adapter   i m just so annoyed that i can t get a part they were supposed to have included  in the first place      
66,2.0,                       was looking for an inexpensive  portable turntable with ability to hook up to bluetooth and other speakers  the vst was cute  black velvet  old timey look  and portable  easy to tote briefcase style   also nice to have lp       options  was excited until actually played some lps  a couple of   s and even an old      the sound quality is very tinny  compared to older standalone turntables owned over time    whether this is speaker or needle quality or both is conjecture  although noted as  bluetooth  cannot be connected to wireless bt speaker  tried regular bose small speakers which increased volume but accented poor sound quality  the headphone jack was loose internally so the speaker connection came and went  wanted to really like this item but think for the price the quality was disappointing      
67,1.0,                       this thing skips over the most minor dust particles and it s really really annoying  especially considering you can t close it with the record inside which means while you play the record more dust or hair has a chance of falling on it and makes it skip a ton  i ve wiped every record down before playing and they still skip if there s even one hint of dust  the bluetooth part is nice but definitely not worth the price if you re trying to just play records  complete waste of money      
68,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          love this record player  much better than i expected for the low price and i love that is so colorful  which matches my very colorful decor  i couldn t decide which higher price player to go with so decided on this as a temporary option     but think this is going to be a keeper      
69,1.0,                       i had been using this player for   months and i started to notice skipping and scratches all over my vinyl records  note  i clean and care for my vinyls as i am a big music person  if you re going to invest in the price of the records themselves  purchase something that will last and give good sound quality  also safe to use for vinyls      
70,3.0,                       the look of it is really cute  looks great on our dining room table  the problem is this when you put on a standard    record  the way the top case sits  the record rubs against the velvet insides of the case  because of this rub the record slows down and sounds a little distorted we managed to fix it by putting the    converter piece under the    to lift it up a little bit  that lead to the slight issue of the piece slipping and losing traction under the weight of the    record   so we put a little piece of double sided tape under the piece so it held its traction  so now it technically works  but we had to make our own workaround      
71,5.0,                       i got what seemed like a great deal for this from amazon warehouse  it was described as   like new  missing the output cord  packaging is damaged   that is fine as i wasn t planning on hooking up additional speakers anyway  it arrived and the packaging wasn t just damaged  it was open with no tape to hold it closed whatsoever  weird  also  not just the output cord was missing  the power cord is missing  the extra needle is missing and there was no paperwork  instructions warranty  at all  luckily  i had a power cord from something else that works  the record player operates fine  the sound is what is expected from an inexpensive unit  however  it is annoying that the accessories are missing  them being included is what made this seem like a great bargain  without them  not so much      
72,2.0,                       fixed it psa if you buy a cheap record player and it keeps skipping and popping  put an office clip on it because the actual problem is the tone arm is plastic and just not heavy enough to stay in the grooves properly      
73,4.0,                       the unit came to me in what appeared to be open box  the player itself looked new and perfect  but there was an obviously torn open plastic insert in it that contained the power supply at one time  so to sum up  no power cord included  and i could not use the unit  contacted amazon  and they were prompt to return my money and even said that i could keep the player  thanks for that amazon  but i now have to figure out how to get my  free  player to work  i ordered an after market power supply for it and it worked perfectly  i am happy with the player  it works great  and i can now listen to my classic recordings the way they were meant to be heard  the built in speakers aren t anything to write home about though  please connect it via rca plugs to your music system or get some powered speakers  i didn t rate the bluetooth capability on this because i haven t tested it  and will probably not use it anyway  is this for  beginners   maybe  but it works exactly like the classic record players of old  so if you re a younger person and have never used one  read up on it and or get an older fella like me to help you      
74,3.0,                       out of the box  this record player was limited in the records it could play  i attempted to play records by amy winehouse  radiohead  and ariana grande  but all of them skipped horribly  i was able to play a few classic albums  sgt pepper s lonely heart band and kind of blue  as well as an album by a now defunct local band  when looking through reviews  i found that some people had to replace the needle to something higher quality than the one that comes with the player and that fixed the issues  i ordered some new tips and now the records are all playing without skipping  they are pretty easy to replace  the sound quality from the player is horrible  but i expected that and i have been using my own speaker  the playback is dynamic though at times it distorts a tiny but with some records  especially at louder parts  it really is only a tiny but distorted   if i were an audiophile i would probably hate it but it s not enough to bother an amateur like myself   but honestly i got what i expected   a cute but practical decoration that would hold me off as far as records go until i can find a higher quality player that adds to my home s aesthetic as far as appearance goes  i got the light blue player and it looks exactly like it did in the picture  it is a cute addition to my home office that helps the space feel more relaxing and provides a nice color pop to the room      
75,1.0,                       it worked well for a total of       of light use within   months   after that it sat for a year   when i went to turn it on again it was not working   i contacted customer service a year to the date that when it was purchased   they said it was the power plug   it took them   months to send another one   the turntable still did not work   they refused to work with me aside from saying   take it to a repair shop    buyer be ware   spen a little more for something that will last longer and get better service   i promise you  these machines are pretty on the outside but made with inferior parts and the customer service is evil      
76,2.0,                       i got this for my daughter who is jumping on the vinyl bandwagon and had to have it because some of her friends have similar suitcase turntables and think they are cute  but we quickly found out this player just didn t handle albums well and had a couple albums that would skip bad on  returned and i advised on getting a bigger and more professional turntable  but she wanted to try the crosley cruiser and it was the same  did not handle albums well  finally i went ahead and ordered the lp  x from audio technica and is well pleased with it  no issues playing the couple albums that the other two suitcase style turntables couldn t handle these may look nostalgic  but they are not good to have if you want to take your vinyl records serious      
77,1.0,                       i bought this for my mother in law who is stubborn on having an all in one system  this is hands down the biggest joke for playing records i have ever experienced i have turntables that range from cheap    s plastic  to ion ittusb  vintage    s high end  a music hall mmf    and a       pro ject  i have cartridges that run cheap to expensive  same with speakers and amplifier  i m not a snob  i love music and i know how to reproduce vinyl at all price points  with that  this record player is horrendous the sound either through it s built in speakers or connected to a home stereo is weak and empty  there is no bottom end  clarity or separation  someone stated in a review that the speakers on their phone has better sound  hands down absolutely true lepai amp      dayton audio b    speakers      audio technica at lp             and you smoke the hell out this cheap crap if you are playing records that cost almost as much as this crap table and say  we ll its good enough for me  then so is a booger sandwich  you are bastardizing music  what the artist intended for you to hear and are just plain cheap and ignorant  do us all a favor  stop listening to music and hum or pick up whistling      
78,1.0,                       i hate that so many reviews gave this item  good  sound quality  it s the worst ever  you ll have to add speakers and the product listing should say so  also a silicon mat is too heavy and affects the speed  but it comes with no mat so i had to buy one     oh well  you get what you pay for  lesson learned      
79,1.0,                       i used this maybe twice before i started having problems  it started skipping on every record i played  i changed the needle  but that still didn t work i called amazon support because it was past the return window and they provided me with the manufacturer s number i was able to speak with someone who quickly told me that i should tape a quarter on top of the needle to prevent it from skipping i can only imagine this is a common problem with how quickly he was able to  problem solve i am not sure what i am going to do with this because i don t want to tape a quarter each time i want to use the player  but i also can t return it disappointed   stay away     
80,1.0,                       bought this as my very first vinyl record player experience  i guess that i just expected too much for the price the build of the item itself is plastic  so it is lightweight  as expected and is rather convenient for portability  the tonearm and needle are rather flimsy and the plate that you lay the records on is also made of a cheap plastic i did however expect it to work with integrated or removable batteries  considering that it does have a suitcase form factor to allow it to be more portable  you are forced to use the included power supply now regarding to the main functions of the device  the included speakers are bad  and i mean really bad  there is no depth in them  whatsoever and the overall distortion makes it impossible to enjoy the player suffered from frequent skipping  which initially seemed to be the lp s fault  but after playing back a few more records  it became clear that the tonearm and needle are too light to apply the needed force to avoid such a problem  i stopped using this product immediately after realizing this to set the icing on the cake  it died on me a few weeks ago    i guess i ll be switching to sony s newest ps lx   bt belt drive turntable that is much better built and has a great minimalist design  they re pros when it comes to the good old record players and vinyls resumed  save up some more cash and go with something that cost      or more  anything else just isn t worth it      
81,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          item arrived on time and in good condition  i am new to vinyl and just want something to start my journey   the low price was a factor in the purchase  i read good and bad reviews but thought i would give it a chance  i don t regret the purchase so far so good  i have only played a few records on it but seems to work well  like i said i am new to vinyl and am no expert but have enjoyed it  it amazes me every time i play a record to think something so simple can sound so amazing  with the new age of digital music you can lose track of where it started      
82,1.0,                       want to make  your lps sound terrible  then this is your device  streaming mp  through your iphone s mono speaker sounds better when a quality entry level stand alone record player costs       what do you think you ll get for     when the device also packages in a headphone amp  tiny little speakers  and bluetooth  you get a real crappy sounding  warbly sounding record player with horrible  horrible  all treble  no bass sound  oddly  mp  streamed into the device via bluetooth sounds way better than the lps which points to something horribly wrong with the record player portion of the unit i received      
83,4.0,                       i ordered this as i ve had a much larger  higher quality rca cabinet in the past that my dad sold out from under me  finally was able to get back into vinyl after years of wanting too  so i picked this little player up as a good starter  victrola has always been a bit of a budget player  so this fits their usual build it s very much a basic  starter player  it does have bluetooth  which is a nice feature  the headphone and line in out with rca hookups were a nice touch  once i finally manage to find the same cabinet i had before  i ll likely move on from this one  but it makes a decent bookshelf player  the speakers are tinny  but aren t awful for their size  would recommend singing wood speakers with rca if you re on a budget  and rca vintage wood housed speakers if you re willing to do some leg work and edifier bose if you have enough to shell out  even with the tinny speakers  it still flat out beats mp  quality for some reason  the player works just fine with all of my lps  except for my new copy of david bowie s  no plan   i checked and the vinyl is pressed flat  not any thicker or thinner than bon iver  flogging molly  etc  taped two pennies to the top of the needle for a little extra weight and that did the trick  otherwise  without the additional weight  no plan  keeps skipping purchased some additional replacement needles and will grab a cleaning kit in a bit  works like a dream with the wooden over ear victrola bluetooth headphones  would recommend using them with their headphone jack if you want the best sound quality      
84,4.0,                       i ordered one of these players  when it came the ups box was fine  but the victrola box inside had a huge hole in it  however the packaging inside the victrola box looked okay so i went with it  at first every record i played skipped  this was my first record player so i thought it was the records and not the player that was the problem  there were tears  i was so heartbroken  the player came with an extra needle  so after every record constantly skipped i tried the other needle  that helped  but the records still skipped some of the time  i finally taped a penny to the top of the arm where the needle was and the records stopped skipping  but i thought the record player shouldn t need all of these changes to work right  so i asked for a replacement from amazon  worst case scenario  i d send the new one back and live with my  penny player   the new player came in a different box  no damage to the box  the new player works perfectly  no new needle needed  no pennies either  and every record plays perfectly now with no skipping  the second player is a nice one  easy to use and understand and the sound is excellent  i find myself listening to records all of the time now  and can see myself falling down the vinyl rabbit hole  i look forward someday to having a corner of my home with a beautiful sound system in it including a record player  i registered my first player  the damaged one  with victrola  and they sent me a free needle as a welcome gift  that was nice  they seem like a quality company  first record player aside  i give the product four stars  i m happy with it      
85,1.0,                       this is one of the most textbook cases of false advertising i ve ever seen  had i read the reviews before purchasing i wouldn t have bought this  came with no power cord  and when i finally went out and bought a replacement cord of the exact type and plugged it in  the player started making unholy screeching noises and reeked of burnt plastic until unplugged  then completely stopped working  this was all in the span of a day     very disappointed since i had been looking forward to receiving the package for weeks      
86,5.0,                       my mom loved this record player  she has collected records for years and my siblings and i grew up listening to records    since then she no longer had one so i was happy to get her this one for christmas and she was thrilled and played it right away  being a modern woman she also uses bluetooth now so she was surprised she could do both on this beautiful record player  this has now taken center stage in her bedroom and she uses it every day      
87,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i just got this delivered today  the kids and i opened it immediately  we love it  of course they didn t know what it was   but once i showed it to them and played a record on it  they thought it was pretty cool  the overall product is great  it has a nice look to it  it is very easy to operate  the sound quality is pretty good  it turns up loud and it plays music just as loud if not louder than music plays on my phone and tablets  so i m satisfied with that  the sound is clear and it s just fun to be able to pull out records from my childhood and play for my kids  great record player for the price  it s cute to look at and doesn t take up a lot of space      
88,5.0,                       i bought this for the tune of        for a like new item  and pink camo was the cheapest  so i decided to man up and not pay more for red  or green  the lift arm has a nice glide over feature  and sit on a crib separate from the record plate  i used a mat to create more space for some of my wobblier records  the simple interface on is also the volume knob  you have a second for phono  line in  and bluetooth  i tested the bluetooth this works with my computer  but i don t own by choice a cellphone so can t advise you on that item  this player has a brighter tone  that at first i was like where is the bass  but then you hear the full range of instruments and   or vocals all at the same time  victrola is a name you can get behind  as the style  price  form  tone  and overall sound is really good  originally i noticed significantly less lower tones  but more middle and upper tones  and i thought because my other mono system used one really large speaker  you would then naturally get lower tones  however when using my over the ear headphones  i notices the same sound  more high and mid tones  so i am not sure this has anything to do with the speaker system  as the sound very bass heavy when plugging them into the computer  i tested all sorts of music on this player  classical a golden tone record that really had dynamics     s    s    s music  techno  classic country  pop  rock  electronic  singer song writer  i would like to hear what    s rap sounds like on this machine  everything you put on this sounds nice  and you can hear it at low volume  far away from the unit  what played the best brazil     naked eye s  strauss waltz  heart      
89,5.0,                       i love this record player  i own sever record players and this by far is th coolest looking one i have ever owned  don t buy this if your wanting a high end turntable  my advice is to also buy diamond topped stylus replacements as this comes with a sapphire stylus and and make even new records seem to skip and they do not last long at all  bluetooth works awesome      
90,5.0,                       great sound  cool design  awesome product  totally worth the   month wait  although they should speed up production with the popularity of records      
91,4.0,                       i like the suitcase design and the flexibility to play             records  the auto stop feature is nice  the speakers aren t to the quality i would want but i knew that before i bought it and have a bose blue tooth speaker  my biggest complaint has to do with the blue tooth capability  i thought i would be able to connect my speaker to the record player wirelessly  turns out the blue tooth only works as an input to the players speakers not as an output to an external speaker making the blue tooth function useless  being that the i would never want to use the speakers in the player   but since i will rarely move the player and can plug in the nose speaker manually it is a minor complaint  overall i am please with it and would buy it again      
92,1.0,                       bought this record player for my bedroom as my current record player is being used by a friend  product arrived without a power cord and damaged  hinge for the front of the case wouldn t close and then proceeded to fall off   while i was annoyed it didn t come with a power cable it wasn t a big deal as i have plenty of others around that i could use  as soon as i plugged it in  a popping noise took place and then smoke started pouring out of the headphone jack and bottom of the case  player is adorable but do not purchase  i ve never returned an item so quickly      
93,5.0,                       it took me a year to get into vinyl because i was afraid that i wouldn t get the right products or i wouldn t be prepared to have a collection  while this was true and it was expensive to get started  i have found that this record player is perfectly suitable for people just starting out and even more so for people who aren t concerned with collecting and keeping quality on records if you just want to experience vinyl at a cheaper price this works just fine  there is some concern that it is damaging my records  but i ve also found that people who talk about vinyl s tend to have very personalized ideas of what constitutes good record maintenance and i m just fixing my process myself as i go along  i will say that something about it seems to be off balance  sometimes a record just wont play right without adjustments  otherwise it works fine      
94,4.0,                       fast shipping  i don t mine the sound being a little off  if you re having trouble with the cartridge making the record skip just tape   pennies on top      
95,3.0,                       i haven t had a record player in about    years  so i was looking forward to digging my old vinyl out of the closet without spending a ton of money on an expensive player  i m not so disappointed in this one that i intend to return it  but it does leave a lot to be desired likes  the sound quality is very good considering the price and considering that it has tiny speakers  the whole player is smaller than i thought it would be  it s very compact  and it plays my records well  the rotation on my unit is smooth  not wobbly as others have reported dislikes  there are two modes of powering on the turntable  in the first  the turntable comes on whenever the stylus is moved from its holder toward the edge of the record  unfortunately  in that mode  the table is supposed to turn off when the record is finished playing  my unit turns off with about    seconds of music left    extremely annoying  imagine pulling the power cord out of the wall and hearing the music slooow down and stop in the second mode  the table keeps turning no matter what  that means you can t walk off and forget it with a record playing  or you ll come back to a worn out needle i guess i was expecting the type of record player we had back before compact disks    one that would mechanically return the stylus to its holder when the record finished  no such luck  and i m disappointed that i have to pay so much attention to turning the unit on and off  oh  well  you get what you pay for  at least i have something to play my records on  even if i do have to get up at the end of each    and fiddle with the player      
96,1.0,                       bought  things started skipping right away  returned in exchange for another  second one also skips every record  can t get through one song   if it s such a great turntable  why are there issues straight out of the box  will be returning for a refund      
97,2.0,                       i understand this isn t most expensive model of turntable you can buy on amazon  but there still should be some quality  it s like it pick and chooses which vinyl to play without skipping jumping  am almost to the point well am ready to return it  i tried to put extra weight on the needle and it doesn t help it  in fact it has scratched some of my vinyl  brand new vinyl i have just open you can look at it and see there is nothing wrong with the vinyl  i guess it s true they say you get what you pay for  but this thing barely plays any thing so i don t understand what your paying for      
98,1.0,                       i ve been an amazon prime customer for around   or so years  maybe even     i ve never returned something before  until now  this thing is utter garbage  i m new to the vinyl scene  and thought this would be a good entry level buy  i was wrong  i got it yesterday  but didn t have any vinyls yet    of which arrived today the vinyls i received are brand new  not used  they have no scratches  i cleaned them beforehand  pop one in and first thing i notice is it s constantly slipping  one of the albums i ordered is a   disc vinyl  the other a one disc  i tried all four discs to make sure it wasn t the vinyl records themselves  it wasn t  they all were skipping constantly  frustrated i turned to google  after some investigating i found out this is a common problem with this turntable  i read it you continue to use it it will lead to the needle actually scratching and permanently destroying your vinyls and possibly even warp them to say i m beyond disappoint is an understatement  i m really hoping the my vinyls aren t damaged already  i ordered another turntable  but it won t arrive until thursday due to coronavirus and the extended delivery times for nonessential items  guess i ll find out then if the vinyls were permanently damaged by this poorly conceived product in the end  imo  it s worth paying the extra fifty to a hundred bucks to get a better low end entry level beginner turntable  when it comes to this monstrosity just don t do it  it s not worth the gamble      
99,1.0,                       i bought this while searching for a stack record player like my wonderful old sears silvertone      record player that could play    s     s     s and    s  had great speakers and was portable    it is still working somewhat  but i felt it was ready to go after all these years  i bought this record player until i find a good stack record player   other than only playing one record at a time  the big problem is the dumb cover     it does not close completely when playing    s  and my cats started to  ride  the record  so i had to move it into my closed off sewing room  i do not care at all about the blue tooth  and found it does not work  also the record speed numbers are very hard to read and should be in red   i knew it would not play stacks  but did think the cover closed  no   i am not pleased  but am keeping it because i cannot find what i really want at the moment  i ll just wait until good stack record players come out again to buy another  well  it was cheap and does part of the job for right now  i sure hope to find a great stack player later with a large top that i can move from room to room as i did my old one  i have no interest in  blue tooth   but i am interested in quality  this is not a bad player for a newbie or someone without cats  but it sure is time consuming to change records constantly when doing housework       
100,3.0,                       the victrola vintage is not the best record player out there  but if you need a functional record player with an aesthetic appeal and a no nonsense design  then this is your unit  i purchased this for my    year old son  who loves music  he instantly took to the marvel of how the records work and uses it regularly to listen to old records  the speakers are not the greatest but you do have an option to connect to better ones via rca cable  all in all a great buy for the price  i am only giving it   stars because comparatively to other units out there  this one is in the middle  great starter deck though      
101,4.0,                       if you re looking to play records and don t particularly care too much for good sound quality  then this turntable is for you  don t let self proclaimed turntable  experts  steer you away from this novelty purchase  or make you feel bad for already owning one  this is a perfect novelty record player that plenty of newcomers can enjoy to start off their journey into this side of the music world  in the end  records are meant to be played  enjoy them while you can my recommendations  purchase a diamond needle to replace the stock one it comes with  don t worry  it s easily replaceable  the needle it comes with is very low quality and has a high chance to skip and sound  hissy   if you plan on wanting good sound out of this thing  purchase some powered speakers  that partially ruins the  portability  gimmick  but not by much how s it feel  it feels well constructed  it doesn t feel luxurious  mind you  but it also doesn t feel extremely cheap how s the setup  easy  it s all set up and good to go  right out of the box  practically plug and play hows the sound quality  bad  lol  it s very  tinny  and lacks depth  bass is imperceptible  mids and highs sound okay  the same can be said no matter if you re using the speakers or the headphone output  that s what should be expected at this price range  it can get very loud however  which is a good thing  it can fill a medium room with its loudness how s the bluetooth  fine  works as it should  easy to connect  no problems so far how s the portability good  it s got the body of a suitcase  perfectly portable in that regard  one complaint i have however  is the fact that it doesn t have some sort of battery it runs off of  it  needs  to be plugged in  so its portability is only useful if you ve got an outlet to plug it into      
102,1.0,                       these things are nothing but junk  i order two of them  the first one had a bent turntable that ruined a few records  the second had a turntable that didn t even work and came in a smashed box with nothing to protect the item from shifting around  in not sure who is in charge of qquality control or testing these items  but someone needs to do better  would have really liked to own a working unit  but at this point these things will only be regarded as trash     
103,5.0,                       i got this as a christmas gift for my parents who have a decent record collection but haven t owned a record player in ages  the outer design is super cute and i love the different color options  and the overall size is just right  not to big  not too small  setup was very easy  the design of the mechanism itself is simple to use and seems to work really well with both the smaller   s and the larger standard sized records that we tried with it  it has settings for   different types of records  the sound quality for both the actual records and the bluetooth option were excellent  but is not overly bassy  the volume is more than loud enough to enjoy listening to in the same room or from another  overall we had such a nice time listening to old records and making new memories with this victrola  and i highly recommend this product for folks of all ages looking for an affordable and easy way to listen to their records      
104,5.0,                       this gorgeous record player is worth every cent i have previously purchased a record player for my father in law and it was garbage  the speakers were crap  the built in radio was cute but impractical  we had to purchase giant speakers and hardwire them into his record player just to get a decent volume and i m not exaggerating when i say this  the built in speakers in this record player are much better than the      two we bought for his dads record player  i was shocked about how clear and loud it all is  but in balance  the music doesnt get thin  and you dont lose the base layers of the music when you turn the volume up  it is all equalized extremely well it s cute  it looks very vintage  it plays very nicely and smoothly  and i love the lowering lever on the arm  because i am notorious for dragging the needle on my records and i m glad it s very precise now i m buying one for my mum and brother  and i will never purchase another record player if it isn t a victrola  they know what they re doing  and care about their work and sound quality      
105,1.0,                       dead after   months and only a few uses  plugged it in to use tonight and smoke came out of the machine  smelled like burning plastic  wouldn t turn on eta  we had purchased the additional warranty with this product  we submitted that and it was refused because apparently the additional warranty protection is only good after the manufacturer warranty of one year  we have been emailing back and forth with the manufacturer providing forms and receipts as requested only for them to tell us that we are responsible to mail the unit across the country with an additional printed copy of the receipt  this would cost half the cost of the unit this is ridiculous hoop jumping and cost to the customer      
106,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          do not buy for your main record player if you re really getting into vinyls  now that i ve said that  this is a great little record player for moving around the house or taking with you on trips  i bought this for our bedroom  and to use on our patio  and the sound is really good  but nothing like our main turntable that is powered by a receiver through a home theater system  so do not go into purchasing this with crazy expectations  we love ours and i m glad i bought it  bought a warehouse deal and it was in perfect condition  although they did ship it in it s original box with no protection      
107,5.0,                       so  as a young boy and then teenager  this type of record player was the go to device everyone had  when i plugged this one in  at first  i was a little disappointed in the sound  but after trying a few other    s  it seemed better  i had forgotten that    pressings can vary from label to label when it comes to sound   i then tried a    size and the sound was even better  don t expect great quality sound  but do expect ease of use and a quality built product  it s handy to just pull out and put on something you haven t heard for years  i did so  and the record jolted me back    years to the last time i heard the song   and it was great to hear it again   note  this was the second one i tried  the first one was dead on arrival and i have to send it back  so glad this second one worked well   very well priced  decent product  just not deluxe sound or bass      
108,3.0,                       so for the price  i guess it s ok  i ve read some horror stories about how eventually this player will wear down your vinyl  so i was wary of that  the purple color with the rose gold hardware is very cute  the speakers are kind of terrible  but that s to be expected  my main problem was with the sound quality  even when connected to nicer speakers i hooked this up to my soundbar and listened to a record  the sound was kind of rough and wobbly  i then played the same record on a vintage turntable and it sounded    times better  removing all the noise and strengthening the overall sound  then i played it on an audio technica turntable and again  the sound was even better  i decided it was worth a little more money to get a turntable that sounds better and has less of a chance of wrecking my records  admittedly i m not super concerned about damage over time to my records  since i don t buy expensive vinyl and mostly purchase from thrift stores  but it was still something to consider the sound just doesn t compare  if you really don t care about sound quality  record longevity  or just want something that will play records and look cute and vintage  by all means grab one of these  the price is good for a trendy piece of home decor      
109,1.0,                       i was super excited to get this as a relatively affordable turntable  i paid for   day shipping but received it in   days  when i finally got it  i set everything up  placed my record  moved the needle into position annnnd nothing  figured the belt came loose during shipping so i checked and reset it  still nothing  the table wouldn t even turn  i went through everything again just to be sure i didn t miss anything  still no action  i figure the motor was bad  i checked the bluetooth feature to see how it sounded and a majority of the reviews are right  the speakers sound terrible  not worth my time  i will be returning this and getting a audio technica one  just should ve spent the money on a nicer one      
110,5.0,                       i got this for my dad for christmas  he loves it  he kept saying he couldn t believe i found one  a record player  because he d been seeing vinyls popping up in stores everywhere but couldn t find a player  it s easy for him to fold up and put away when the grandkids come over  he also liked that he can hook it up to his phone and listen to pandora  and it s loud enough that he can play it in his bedroom and hear it in the kitchen      
111,4.0,                       the sound quality coming out of this when playing a record is phenomenal that being said  using the speakers via bluetooth connection is absolutely worthless   playing music directly from my phone s speaker is indescribably louder than playing via bluetooth through the record player s speakers  even at full volume   i thought the bluetooth feature was to transfer the record s sound to another device  which would be awesome  though obviously unlikely      
112,3.0,                       i had jumped off the vinyl train several years ago  but lately i got some    singles that have songs i can t find elsewhere  and decided i should probably get a turntable so i could actually hear them  if you are looking for something to occasionally play old records on  and don t care that much about superb sound quality  this is a decent choice  it plays just fine  but the speakers greatly limit the bass  if you are an audiophile and really care about great sound quality  be prepared to dish out a lot more money  and if you re buying new records  you should be able to afford that   so  for a  beginner  or someone who just wants to pull out a record every so often  this is a nice affordable choice  the one i got was just a little over           
113,1.0,                       worked a week  then speed was erratic   contacted manufacturer under warranty and they require     to look at it  they asked for receipt and then never responded again   you get what you pay for i guess  thanks for the junk record player and no customer service   buyer beware      
114,1.0,                       terrible product  first one that came in was defective and came with a power cord that was rusted and had exposed wires  when i got my replacement the box was damaged  the top of the record player wasn t screwed in and worst of all the spinner bounces around and causes records to not play properly      
115,5.0,                       great product especially for the price  very pleased with condition since it was well protected  works flawlessly without any problems  the sound from the speakers are clear from using records  when using bluetooth  bt as it s abbreviated on device  it doesn t sound as great as it should so that could improve a tad bit  maybe adding more bass into the speakers will make it improve better  as a whole  it worth the value      
116,5.0,                       when i was     some idiot my husband  at the time  knew and apparently owed money to broke into our house and stole my entire record collection that i had been building since i was     i never got any of the records back  and i divorced the loser husband  but for many years  i went without records  eventually i had cassettes  and then cds  and then computers phone playlists  but i never forgot all those records  and they were such a huge part of some of my best memories  and a whole soundtrack to my life that was missing  so that i began to wish i had those records again  i just wanted an easy to use record player that didn t take up too much space  didn t cost too much  and was nice looking  this one checked all the boxes  it sounds decent  although i did end  up buying external speakers for it but i could have done without them  i just wanted to be able to turn my music up a little more if i choose to do that  i think it s beautiful  and the wood feels good  everything was there and worked perfectly  i am completely satisfied  and really looking forward to building my record collection back  it looks like i can t afford any of the many  many albums i had originally  they are apparently collector s items now and most of them have prices in the triple digits these days instead of the handful of dollars i paid for them back in the day  but i love music and i am building up a new collection  now  it s having a major healing effect  i am thankful for this record player starting all of that      
117,5.0,                       i was concerned because of many of the negative reviews on here  but i really like the victrola portable suitcase record player  first of all  the sound is great  i have played vinyl records and songs from my phone using the bluetooth feature  and the sound is actually pretty loud  the speakers don t sound tinny  the only downside is that there s not too much bass  but you could hook up more high quality speakers  but i don t feel the need to do so  this record player s sound quality is much better than a jensen record player i had a while back i also like that there is a knob to switch between bluetooth  line in  and phonograph  the light even changes color to indicate which mode you re on  my phone easily connected to the record player via bluetooth  and the sound quality is excellent lastly  the look of the record player is really great  the material doesn t feel cheap  and the turquoise color really pops  the suitcase look is very vintage  i highly recommend this record player      
118,1.0,                       i got this record as a christmas present and if i wrote my review on day    i would have been raving about it  it looks adorable  it was easy to set up for a beginner and for the first few days worked just fine  however  i started to notice my record skipping  in parts sounding like it s on slo mo and instead of looking flat as it spun  would look like it was on a wave naturally  i thought it was the record i purchased so i brought it back to the shop  when they tested the record on their record player  the three above mentioned issues were resolved  the store owner asked me if i had a victrola or crosley record player with built in speakers  he explained that this happens commonly with these record players and that often  they do a number on the records themselves  what a disappointment  also  fyi   this has nothing to do with the rating  purely an fyi  the volume is fit for a medium to large room  it won t fill a floor of your home with music and definitely not a house full of guests      
119,2.0,                       i received some records and wanted a player with built in speakers and this was perfect   it worked well for the   times i played it and when i went to use it again nothing happened   i had set it up in its home so i hadn t moved it i just plugged it back in   it seemed not to get power and when i tried a different adapter it lasted for like    seconds   i really enjoyed this while it worked so i m taking a chance on a replacement and if that fails its a total return update may       they didn t replace the item they fixed the one i had and sent it back in the box i sent but didn t reseal it   i m amazed it got to me with everything inside   let s see how long this lasts      
120,1.0,                       this is my second record player from victoria   the first was a christmas gift  and i excitedly put on a brand new record   and it skipped   i tried an old record   skipped   it skipped on every record i tried so  i returned it   i ordered a different record player  it was so shoddy  and felt so cheap that i returned that one   but  at least it played my records in full then i started researching   i m not enthusiastic enough to spend over       so i started searching for  best record players under       and this one was the top of multiple lists   i figured my first one was a fluke  so i tried again  and surprise  i have the exact same issue   and even when it does play  the static is wild  and if i turn the volume up too high the sound starts to distort      
121,5.0,                       this thing is great  the output is great  very loud and clear with no distortion  i put the first record on it this morning and the audio quality and overall functionality is awesome  it also makes a great bluetooth speaker as well  the briefcase design makes it great for moving it room to room or traveling places with it  i highly recommend this turntable to both the beginner who s looking to get into vinyl and even the hardcore collector that s just looking for something more portable with some good sound      
122,2.0,                       buying a  bluetooth turntable   you d assume that the  bluetooth  feature would allow you to stream the record player to another bluetooth speaker or headset  right  nope  the  bluetooth features  on this mean you can send things from your phone to the speaker on this turntable  even if the speakers on this turntable were good  this wouldn t make much sense  but the speakers on this turntable are trash  so it s a completely asinine feature i cannot recommend this product      
123,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          despite all the bad reviews  i decided to go ahead and buy this because it was the cheapest one i could find  i was actually very pleasantly surprised  i ordered it yesterday and received it in the mail today  the color is correct   nothing is broken or malfunctioning so far  the sound quality is actually pretty nice and i haven t heard and crackling or squeaking no matter how high i turn the volume up  i haven t tried the bluetooth functionality yet but i ll update my review when i do      
124,3.0,                       i really wanted to love this  my daughter was so excited to get this for christmas  authentically  we had little techie errors from day one  the cord was finicky  the record arm was also finicky  we didn t return it because my husband is handy and it was easy to fix here and there for our family but i wouldn t recommend it to someone who doesn t have that skill  the sound quality was ok  however  i have a portable bluetooth speaker at home that has better sound quality and output that i paid half the price for  she stopped using the record player because it skipped constantly  even after we replaced the little end piece  and uses it strictly for the speaker to play music from her phone  it s still a good looking piece for her room so she s kept it but i will be purchasing another brand in the future for the record player option  i would give it     stars     
125,2.0,                       the bluetooth function does not allow you to play a record through an external bluetooth speaker  you can only use the record player s speakers to input music from an external source  and the record player s sound quality is lower than a typical iphone  not knowing this  after unpacking unit  i switched it to bluetooth and paired with my iphone  the turntable stopped and music from my iphone playlist began  faintly  playing through the record player   thought it was broken until i read another review from a few days ago and realized that you cannot use this to transmit music from the record player to an external bluetooth speaker   might work with aux cord  haven t tried    the product description  obliquely  says so but i didn t catch this before buying   i will keep it as it s cute and only purchased to play some very old childhood records that have sentimental value only      
126,4.0,                       i bought this refurbished by the seller  which came out to be essentially like new  the sound quality on the phonograph is alright  it plays records in a lofi sound quality  but it s still perfectly fine listening to it  if you re into listening to your records in the highest quality possible  you already aren t looking to buy this  this product is aimed at people who simply want to have an inexpensive way to listen to records  or even to get into the hobby the build quality is alright  i m not taking it traveling  so i m not to worried about it holding up to force  mine was pretty tough to get to the insides for tinkering  i had to take a razor blade to split the seams enough to lift the wooden panel up  the tonearm on mine came down pretty fast  which threw me off since the same model i replaced with this had its tonearm take a comfortably slow lowering to records  i had to add elmer s glue to the tonearm mechanism to get it to ease on the speed  and now it falls much softer what really surprised me about this player was the bluetooth functionality  it s an okay phonograph  but a surprisingly amazing sounding bluetooth speaker  with the lid closed  i was shocked how good music sounded from its built in speakers  the speakers don t really do records justice  but with spotify and youtube connected to it through it from my phone  it s a full  high quality sound  the size of the entire case really helps give it that quality sound  when the lid is opened  it still sound fine  but not as good as it is closed i paid around     for mine  and at that price i think it s fair  don t pay much more for it though  you can get better players than this      
127,1.0,                       sounds awful  and scratched some of my records  i wasn t expecting a lot for price but i got even less than i expected      
128,2.0,                       i bought this with low expectations  but they weren t low enough because the sound was unlistenable on these speakers  i tried to connect it to my bluetooth speaker and still the sound quality was terrible  it wins the portability contest  it s very portable  but it has no way to control the pitch or tone and the sound stinks  i returned it and bought an audio technica at lp  xbt turntable that has a bluetooth connect feature and the sound is great  i am very happy with the purchase  if you already have a bluetooth speaker  this turntable has a good enough built in pre amp to transmit a great sound  spend the money and get the better stuff      
129,5.0,                       added a video   ice portable product  no tom control  nice listening to vinyl again  i did order some inexpensive speakers that r  quality along with a subwoofer   equalizer  when i did the demonstration in the video u u can t hear me for a few seconds  i got some great speakers woth a small sub woofer and an equalizer to take more control over the sound being produced outof this until   the way this one sits tho  the sound fills my very large bedroom  and itis decent sounding  but i am extremely picky in sound and record a lot of things and work with video production so that is why i want to add bigger speakers and a receiver this will go with me frlm placeto place when k get away for the weekend with my best friend  my english bulldog ethel mae   and yes  she digs the new portable player too this would make a great inexpensive gift  my daughter got one years back  it is fun to see her get into lp s now      
130,1.0,                       i was so excited to give this christmas gift to my spouse  who is a true music lover  i could barely wait for her to open it and her eyes lit up like a little kid   she immediately grabbed it and set it up   the sound was great for a few minutes   then it started to skip   and skip   i had read the reviews and purchased an accessory to help with this problem but unfortunately it did not stop the skipping at all   the hardest thing was watching the light go out of my wife s eyes as she turned this thing off and moved on there are no words to express how disappointed i am in this product   i will be returning it for a refund and i guess now that i have all of these albums  i will invest in a more expensive model  as i should have in the beginning  this was such a cute product  i was really hoping that the quality would be as stated   so bummed      
131,1.0,                       after having this product for   months  i am officially done with it and trashing it to buy the sony ps lx   bt model  i will say this  if you re looking for something to play the stash of records you found in your fathers attic  this will play beautiful  however  that is where the good of this device will end  if you buy new records  maybe you ll get a song or two that plays properly  but the rest of your album will skip  any new record is doing this for me  i am passed the return window so amazon agreed to return  but were charging me a restock fee  on a     unit   it s not worth it  i should have researched more into turntables before wasting my money   time with this unit  i suggest  if you want to listen to newer records  start shopping for new records  stay far far away from this cheap record player      
132,3.0,                       i ve only had this item for about an hour and a half and i m not satisfied  i watched some other photo reviews and the sound seemed so much better  but now that it s here in person  the sound quality isn t all that great  now it s not terrible   but let s just say my crappy iphone speaker sounds better  the bass isn t captured well  the item itself is a tad flimsy on the inside  don t push or pull anything too hard or it will probably break  as far as the look   it s lovely  if this is something you re buying for decoration  then it s probably a good fit  the color is nice and the record player buckles up well  i don t use headphones but there is also an aux and headphone jack in case you want to connect it to other speakers or your headphones  but honestly  i bought this thing in hopes it could make it s own decent sound  so i will be asking for a return as the quality of sound and music is not good  also  the speed goes up and down during the songs  so it will play super fast and then super slow randomly        
133,4.0,                       while this is no means for an audiophile  it is a great record player for majority of listeners  it has great portability so you can plug up at a cookout or your friend s house  the speakers don t have amazing quality but that s not why you d buy this one  i use my audio technica and my stereo system for hq sound  but it has a headphone jack so you can listen in great quality  this makes a great player for anyone who doesn t care about audiophile sound quality so this makes a really cool gift for like     of people  i ve bought   so far  one for me and two for gifts to family members  the bluetooth function is great as it allows it to be used to play music from your phone  hard to carry    vinyls to a picnic   all in all  this makes a great record player for its price and makes a wonderful gift to anyone who maybe wants to play records but maybe doesn t want to shell out    plus bucks for a full blown stereo compatible player  my grandpa and mom loved these as gifts because they love the nostalgia of records but also don t know how to set up and hook up a stereo and speakers for a full player  i still keep mine for its portability as most full players are not portable by any means  great product      
134,4.0,                       just tested this out for my    yo first turntable for xmas  sound quality is as expected for a portable starter player  reminds me of an old walkman type radio reception  music comes through just fine  we ve all gotten use to top of the line tech and this just isn t it  again  as expected  shipping was swift  no damage and item was very well packaged  protected needles  plastic wrapped the turntable piece is a little bit questionable as far as quality  cheap plastic  yet with care the device will be great for a child s first experience      
135,5.0,                       this little player is giving me a lot of listening pleasure  the sound wasn t quite good enough  so i hooked up the edifier g     speakers to it  i also got a diamond needle  and a silicon slip mat  the quality of sound  and volume  are surprisingly good  i made a few trips to goodwill for records  since i had none at all  i bought a few brand new  but the sound just wasn t as good as vintage records provided  apparently  new records are recorded from digital music  i haven t used the blutooth yet  there wasn t any difficulty in setup  i just plugged it in  plugged in the speakers  and turned in on  i now listen to records all day long  classical  jazz  big bands  british invasion  gospel  chorales  etc  such fun      
136,2.0,                       don t buy this if you think you think you can connect your bluetooth speaker to it to play your records and hear them on your bluetooth speaker  this stupid thing has bluetooth so you can stream your music to its crappy speakers why would i buy a record player with bt just so i can stream music from my device on super low quality speakers why would i lug around a record player just to use its super lame speakers  and not play records   you can spend the same amount and buy an awesome jbl portable speaker  this product makes no sense  yes  it plays records  at least that is true to form  also  the case top when open has not latch to keep it open so it can fall shut right on top of your record as it plays  we will have to unscrew the lid to keep it from falling down      
137,5.0,                       my grandson recently discovered my extensive collection of old vinyl and was determined to listen to them   when he realized many of them had belonged to my grandfather and pre dated vinyl he became more determined to hear them   classical orchestras     s    s old time country  big bands  plus my own    s    s collections   his mother refused my offer of letting him have our old glass fronted stereo cabinet so this was the smaller solution that made them both happy   the sound is not the greatest but he easily hooked it up to his own bluetooth speakers and is thrilled with the sound   i admit it makes me happy to know he appreciates  my music  as well as his great grandfather s   i think i ve created a new vinyl freak and it s fun to see his enthusiasm   the price was right on this product and he enjoys using it daily      
138,2.0,                       i bought this turntable thinking it d be a good starter for me  something to have while i saved up for a really good quality one   i might as well have saved my money and just waited longer to get a turntable i m fine with all the plastic since this was supposed to be a temporary starter one for me  but the low quality sound is ridiculous      
139,1.0,                       i purchased his items as a birthday gift   the item stopped working within a couple months   it was too late to return through amazon but should have been covered under the manufactures warranty and amazon provided me with the contact information   i do love that amazon is helpful however  customer support for victrola advised that i should try to  use a different power cord with the same specifications if i had one available  and see if the unit powers on    if it did not work  they would  arrange to have a replacement power cord sent  however  since receiving that email on       they have not returned any emails i have tried calling a couple times but do not get to a person it is very frustrating      
140,2.0,                       bought   months ago as birthday gift for daughter  nice style and design   some of my old lp s played  other s didn t   i figured the records were old and scratched   fast forward to december   daughter received a few new vinyl records for xmas and two wouldn t play without skipping   again  these are brand new records   i tried the same lp s on my vintage player and they played perfectly   i assume the included stylus  needle  is too crude to play the records properly   i ve tried to contact victrola via both email and telephone and have received no answer two stars is generous for this player and the company   i m giving it   stars for customer service    for playability and   stars for the tie dye finish      
141,2.0,                       this is hand s down the worst record player i have ever heard  it would turn on  have a long pause  and then begin playing  the records would constantly skip and albums would randomly stop playing altogether  sound quality was subpar at best  for the times i could actually hear enough  the only thing i can positively state about this thing is that it is indeed portable  if portability is your main criteria here then you re golden  if you re looking for more than portability  i d look elsewhere      
142,5.0,                       i know this isn t a brand  audiophiles  like  but as a millennial looking to play my parents old records and make my own discoveries  this is pretty dang awesome  it only took about    minutes to get it up and working  it s nice and loud  and for the records that were in good shape  it played them properly and clearly  plus  it looks nice  it s not super heavy  and it satisfied an itch to be a hipster i never knew i had      
143,4.0,                       remembering the album collection that my parents have and the record player from so many years ago that no longer works  left me craving the vintage sound from back in the day  this new school record player with bluetooth is a perfect mash up of old school and new school the sound is clear  the connection was easy  the only minor issue i had was the needle skipping in the beginning  i did a little research and just like my parents did back in the day  directly from customer support   a couple of quarters to weigh the needle down and no more skipping  i am very happy with my purchase      
144,1.0,                       works  but it sound quality is horrendous  i m not an audiophile snob either  i d be satisfied with  passable   this is unlistenable  there is no low end at all  even with decent external speakers  it s all high end and extremely harsh to listen to  when using bluetooth  the sound is passable with the external speakers  but do not buy this for playing records  it s awful  if i could return mine i would  but it s long past the return date      
145,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          review of   victrola vintage   speed bluetooth suitcase turntable with speakers  black  this is a very reasonable priced portable plug and play system that allows you to play your lp s in          rpms   the case is sturdy and light and the arm and needle are very sensitive   the sound quality is fantastic for a system this size and you have the option to line in using an aux cord or use bluetooth with the system to play music or sound   i am very impressed by this system   after having sold my multi component onkyo sound system and massive speakers years ago to include my turntable i can once again play my vinyl   it is wonderful   the sound and features of this small system rank high   five stars      
146,2.0,                       the sound that is produced is not in stereo  i thought i could connect external speakers but the outputs aren t working  bluetooth doesn t allow you to connect to a bluetooth speaker  but does allow you to play music through the record player  and sounds wonderfully mono  i was so excited to get this and i m very disappointed      
147,1.0,                       this player has the absolute worse sound   everything played  new records  sounds like a cat fight  my granddaughter asked me to please get her something different so she could enjoy her new records      
148,4.0,                       for the price this is a surprisingly good record player i purchased it for my teen who is interested in playing old vinyl records with auto off mode  the table stops spinning too soon before a record is over  this is more annoying when spinning    size records  with the auto off feature disabled  records do reach the end  so that s a workaround the sound from the small speakers is also surprisingly good  taking the sound out of the earphone jack into a portable  more robust speaker works well too it s a belt driven turntable without the ability to adjust the speed  but  it s a great entry level turntable for a teen wanting to experience music the old fashioned way mine is enjoying playing the full albums and reading the liner notes and lyrics     the way it should be      
149,4.0,                       i ll just say flat out that i am pleasantly surprised at how good my unit sounds  for the price  i certainly expected worse  i have been listening to miles davis   kind of blue for the last couple hours  and my klipsch s are making this thing sing  it really does sound quite good  and for what this cost  i have absolutely   complaints on that end of things  as far as the built in speakers  i only heard them for a minute before hooking the player into a much larger separate system  but from what i did hear  the built in speakers were adequate  thought certainly not outstanding  if you have a separate system of decent or higher quality to plug this into  i strongly recommend you do that if you mainly plan to listen to it at home the only thing that caused me to dock a star is that the unit i received does have an immediately noticeable amount of wobble on the platter  this is not affecting the sound quality and it still appears to be operating within spec  but the leveling of the platter is still something that certainly could be done better  but again  for the price you re paying here  you really can t go expecting perfection  overall  this is great first foray into vinyl  and i never thought i d enjoy it as much as i am      
150,4.0,                       it s cute  it s very basic  and it plays lps  so it does what it says it ll do  four stars because the sound isn t great but honestly i didn t expect it to be  i think you could connect it to a stereo but tbh i don t listen to albums like in the old days  one after another after another  it s fun to pop an album on from the   s or   s and listen to it then flip it over and listen to the other side  one gets used to endless streams of music with all the digital stuff we have nowadays but there s something satisfying about playing an lp you used to play ages ago oh and the needle drops quite lightly on the album  not fast like one might expect on a cheaper turntable like this      
151,4.0,                       pros  great for beginners like meeasy to use and very portablea price practically anyone can affordgreat color choicescons  cheap feeling plastics on the insidebuilt in speakers suckyou need to hookup speakers to get good soundthe bluetooth is pretty much pointless because i cant use it with a bluetooth speaker and the record wont spin in bluetooth mode anywayswith all that being said the cheap plastics can be expected at this price point so i ll let that pass but i don t get the point if having a bluetooth mode if you cant play the music through a bluetooth speaker plus the record only spins when its in phono mode so even if you could pair it to a speaker it would be pointless anyways  that being the main reason i only gave it   stars  but for the price this is an amazing record player  i bought a mini amplifier and i used some old bookshelf speakers that i had and i hooked them up to the record player and it sounds great and is the perfect little setup  as seen in the attached picture      
152,5.0,                       wife bought this for me for christmas along with a handful of new records to supplement an old stash inherited from my grandma this turntable is super cool  clean looking  and a great conversation piece   naturally  you can spin vinyl and it sounds great    but you can also bluetooth in and push tunes from your phone  so it doubles as a really nice bt speaker it s very user friendly and comes with great instructions  should you be new to vinyl  and a replacement needle there are plenty of higher end tables out there  but this one is compact  low profile  and pushes very good sound   i recommend it      
153,2.0,                       very  very poor sound  not worth any money when it promises to be a good sound  sounds like you are playing records that are     years old   came without ac adapter which we had to buy separately  really a product comes without all the parts and over a month late  and the buyer is responsible to search and pay for the adapter that should have bee part of the order    terrible customer service terrible  can t be used and not worth buying  would have gotten a better  more expensive one but i believed what was written  gift for daughter  but she does not want it because the sound is so so bad   so sorry i bought it  expected better from amazon which we use all the time  need to rethink that for sure   dont believe what you read        
154,1.0,                       turntable seemed very easy to set up   once an album was played  you immediately hear poor tinny sound quality for the internal speakers   doubting the internal  i connected external speakers to the rca jacks   same tinny result   so i decided to connect to bluetooth with my iphone   that made a difference   this leads me to believe they are using a cheap stylus and cartridge   i have asked tech support if there is a higher quality stylus and cartridge that can be used on the player   i have yet to hear back from them  it has been almost a week      
155,5.0,                       our unit worked as expected out of the box  the turntable rotates completely flat  the needle arm picks up well with the lifter and drops very quietly onto the record   at the end of the tracks it stops the turntable with the needle in the center of the record   the sound is quite loud enough for a single room very similar to the original units that we played in the       s   certainly not hifi but considering the tiny speakers it s very good  more treble than base   plugging in the rca or headphone outputs to another speaker system gives better sound with more bass   note that the bluetooth is only a receiver and so you ll need to plug in a bt transmitter into the rca or headphone jacks if you want to play records via bt to another bt speaker system the black case looks nice and  retro  on top of our wooden stereo cabinet and we like the idea that we can shut the case and keep the dust out or just snap closed the latch and pick it up like a mini suitcase and take it with us to someplace else   great value for the money  a good  novelty  gift for someone who has a stash of old    records that they haven t listened to for    years      
156,4.0,                       this isn t a bad record player  it has decent sound quality and does what it was made to do  it is a pretty good starter or budget player for listeners branching out or getting back into vinyl  that said it does have its own issues  out of the box this record player would skip on older vinyls and there was a strange scratch noise when i played any of my collection  after a few minutes of scrutiny using an inherited scratched record  something i keep for diagnostic tests for any new player   i found that the skip was because the arm didn t lower enough to maintain contact with the vinyl  the fix was a rubber disc that i had left over from a broken record player  the rubber disc raised the record high enough to maintain needle contact even on slightly warped records  the second issue of the scratching noise turned out to be caused by a plastic guard at the base of the arm  this small piece of plastic would rub at the edge of the vinyls while spinning producing the scratch noise  that fix was simply using a fine fingernail emery board            grit  to remove just enough material to put a stop to the noise but not impede the function of the plastic guard  after those simple fixes i had no problems with the record player      
157,1.0,                       i purchased this record player  and all it did was skip  i tried several different records and had the same results  i cleaned the records  made sure the needle was good etc  i finally called the technical support number where i was told that any records purchased after the year      will not work properly on this player  there is nothing about this mentioned on the product details page   support said i could put a penny or nickle on the arm base to see if that helps  i did not spend     to rig it to work  i expect a working product or to have been told up front what works and what doesn t so i wouldn t have to waste my time to purchase  please do not waste time or money on this      
158,1.0,                       the one star was for how beautiful the exterior was   had really high hopes for it   the turn table itself was total crap   skips more than a high school senior   we tried two classic heirloom discs and one brand new press          the skipping was all over the place   we also found the rca output sound was flatter than drywall   if you want your eyes to bleed with unabashed rage  this is the product for you          
159,1.0,                       will be returning this player  it was enticing at first with its cute color and design but the proof is in the pudding and this player is not worth the money  wobble is pretty severe and even brand new records sound distorted in places just making for a very poor listening experience   on a side note  i suppose foolishness on my part but i thought that the bluetooth feature would allow me to play records through my nice marshall speaker  nope  you can however a connect your phone to the crappy speakers of the record player  so if you want your music to sound like sharing one ear bud with three people than its a great feature      
160,1.0,                       i was really looking forward to receiving this turntable as a present to myself for christmas  it is very small  cheap looking  and not worth the money i spent on it  the sound is not clear  it doesn t look big enough for a    lp record which barely fits sticking out over the edge  everything about it looks false and low quality  it s an insult to consumers  i am very disappointed  and of course it is made in china      
161,1.0,                       i m just really disappointed in this turntable  i don t know very much about sound quality and which speakers are the best to purchase   but i assumed that a well known brand like victrola would make a decent product  the case is beautiful and everything inside is functional and easy to use  which i love  but it s hard for me to get excited to play or buy a new record when i know that the record player won t deliver a decent quality of sound to match a beautiful record  i got this as a present for my dad on his birthday so that he could listen to some of his old records  but i wish i had chosen a different brand      
162,4.0,                       i ve had it for all of    minutes and love it so far  the box came in good condition  and it has just enough volume to fill a small medium room  which is exactly what i wanted  my parents  record player can be heard throughout the house  but deafens the room it s in  clear instructions  plug it in  turn on via volume control  remove plastic cap over needle  lower arm over record    listen    there is a good      cm gap between record   back of the player  so no issues there  from what i ve observed on this player  unless using a non standard record  record length should be a non issue  if anything changes over time  i ll modify this review      
163,4.0,                       despite all the reviews i loved the vintage map pattern of this and didn t have a record player  i figured for the price and the brand that it would be similar to the fischerprice one i had when i was a kid   soundwise yes  quality wise no pros  small  portable  lightweight  nostalgic  looks absolutely adorable  got the matching vinyl holder   case is durable cons  tiny delicate parts  needle attached was messed up but the extra needle works fine  speakers are subpar but slightly better than i expected  seems cheaply constructed on the inside      
164,1.0,                       this thing sucks  the sound is really bad and comes out sounding thin or like a tin can speaker if that makes sense  even when i plugged it into my home speakers the signal still came out thin if you want a turntable for your home but don t need a crazy expensive one i really suggest going the route after returning this product and went for the audio technica at lp  bk turntable  it s a bit more in price but you will be much happier      
165,1.0,                       turn table is wobbly and speaker quality is horrible  on the way to be returned the look of it is cool and small to carry anywhere but it should play a record without being so wobbly  tried to go old school with a penny on top to keep it steady but didn t work      
166,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          really love this  i been looking for one just to play the few albums i have and this is great  all parts arrived and the next day      
167,1.0,                       bad quality speakers  records get scratched  knobs break easily  and a year later mine won t turn on anymore  the speakers sound like a tin can  so you re not getting the crackle of the vinyl desired  the needle scratched some brand new records i bought because the turntable is not flat  the plastic knobs like the tonearm lifter snapped off     months after buying this product and it won t even turn on anymore      
168,1.0,                       i knew when i purchased this record player the sound wasn t going to be the best  which i was right   and i was okay with that since this was for my daughter and we could hook up better speakers to it   however  the turntable squeaked every time we played a record and it wouldn t finish playing a    rpm record   it would stop right before the song ended i would spend more money on something with better quality or find a nice used record player at a thrift store like we did      
169,5.0,                       very nice record player it very easy to use  not to much hassle its as easy as plug in and start playing records i would like to point out that the seller has awesome customer service  whe i got my unit i sent some questions their way via email since my bluetooth functionality as well as de aux was not working  i could not use bluetooth or even headphones with it  but the records would play perfect with the built in speakers  in less then a day they wrote back and apologized for the inconvenience  and they were  nice enough to send a replacement unit  its the one i m using now and it s wonderful  if what you are looking for is sound quality i would recommend pluggin in a speaker since it s super easy to do  you just need a rca cable with a     mm to put into your speaker and the magic starts  i would definetly recomend      
170,4.0,                       didn t work  plugged it in and it won t turn on  will return and try again  not to mention the actual product is a different shade of blue than is in the picture  the actual record player is a deeper blue and has more green in it update  returned and got the black one and i love it  mainly got it to replace a crosley that was giving me problems and i wanted something that had bluetooth so i could use it a speaker too     
171,5.0,                       this is a fantastic product  i had little to no knowledge on how these work  and it was pretty easy to figure out  the manual is thorough  there s an extra pin for playing once one wears out  the sound quality was so much better than i expected  even the bluetooth was wonderful  there s also a plug for an aux cord and for headphones  the speakers are located below the handle on the outside  and when using the bluetooth  it sounds best when the cover is closed  the acoustics are fuller   i was super pleased with this purchase  will probably buy another in the future for family friends      
172,2.0,                                i have changed my review after using it a few weeks   it looks very cool  and if you are looking for something trendy this is a good bargain   however  if you are a beginner looking to get serious about vinyl  this unit is a huge disappointment   the sound is garbage  even when run through quality speakers or a sound system i wasn t expecting it to sound great on its own  but i was not expecting it to sound as bad as it did when i ran it though several different setups if you want a good quality sound of your vinyl  stay away from this unit and spend more money on a better turntable     i will most likely keep it for its portability though  moving it around the house or garage   that s the only good thing about it      
173,3.0,                       prepare to adore it  but understand it won t be perfection  it is cuter than cute  the vinyl cover has some  rough edges and isn t as elegantly constructed as an actual vintage item  but it s so wonderfully vintage looking and it s blue tooth is surprisingly practical too  don t expect too much from the speakers  they do sound small and tinny  i plan to use it most usually with external speakers as soon as i can figure out how to get them to work   there is some awkwardness with putting the needle arm back into non use position  but still and again  the cuteness wins me over  bluetooth connection was easy to find but is a bit shaky right now  i am happy to have a way to listen to my old records again      
174,5.0,                       love this little thing i ll be honest   my purchase was     for aesthetics and     wanting to use the vinyls that we re collecting dust in my office  this did the trick  i ve been playing music non stop  occasionally a song will skip a little but i m thinking it s more to do with dust on the vinyls than this record player if you re not super serious about records and music  this little thing will do the job  if you re a collector or value the sound quality  maybe spend the extra money on a higher quality one      
175,1.0,                       the fact that it s a suitcase but has to be plugged in is contradicting but i ended up removing the top half anyway  the sound quality is garbage  the headphone jack is fiddly and the aux out not only has interference but the audio still plays out the terrible speakers while external speakers are plugged in anyway  i thought the quality would be better through external speakers but it s just as terrible  the table skips on occasion and could ruin records  this is not even worth buying if you only have a couple records  i highly recommend getting something else      
176,1.0,                       i bought this unit thinking it would be cool to take my vinyl collection with me sometimes  i was hoping to share the listening experience of old music  as i have records from the      s  when i got the item  i unpackaged it right away  it was exactly what was pictured  it looked great excited to try it out  i play one of my vintage christmas records on it  this was a regular    vinyl record  so  nothing special  and did not require the special stylus for the    records  oh boy  i thought while shaking my head in disappointment  the sound was horrible       absolutely horrible  i have    bluetooth speakers that sounds better than this the description for this product states  additional features include a custom tuned pre amp for improved audio clarity and bass performance   the was not the case  the custom tuned pre amp has the high tones up way too far  so much that the speakers peak  there is absolutely no bass tones  the mids are muffled i figured i would try to connect it to a bluetooth speaker  thinking the quality would be better  nope     it was the same     absolute garbage      trust me  my bluetooth speaker is high quality  i took it a step further and plugged in some high quality in ear headphones that i use as a musician  they have   drivers in each ear  so the sound should be amazing       nope     again  complete garbage secondly  i would like to add  that the stylus on this player can be harsh on your records  looking at an independent review  they advise not to use this unit for everyday use  as it will wear out the grooves in your records  what good is a record player if you cannot use it to play your records as much as you want on the tech side of things  most records are made or vinyl  a    vinyl record has a groove that is     mils wide  a    has a groove that is     mils wide  if you use the wider stylus in an old    record you will ruin it  the stylus on this product is metal      that s right  metal  what happens when you place metal on plastic  kiss the record good bye  most stylus back in the day were made of diamonds or sapphires  they would fit in the groove exactly and produce a high quality sound  over time a record will break down  that s normal  but using the wrong stylus  you will accelerate the breakdown  oh  and you cannot change out or upgrade the stylus  the cartage and stylus is sold as one unit and only fits this unit  no other aftermarket parts will fit stop       and do yourself a favor  look for other record players with better quality  as for me  i m not going to ruin my collection because of a low quality product  garbage           
177,1.0,                       maybe something is wrong with mine  but the sound was awful  worth noting that mine had no victorola branding on it  instead it was innovative technology so i m not sure if that s the cause of the awful quality i m not an audiophile  i ve had several of those portable crosley players and been perfectly fine with the quality  this really needs a pitch adjustment knob more than it needs bluetooth  it s too bad because it s cute and affordable but not worth it in the slightest even at          
178,1.0,                       there is no method of balancing the tone arm  this pos bounces like a cheap stripper in a north florida bikini bar  the best you can do is tape two nickles to the tone arm and that slows down the rotation  it has refused to respond so i have a record player with a couple of nickles      
179,1.0,                       worst purchase i ve made  i bought this in march for my daughter  but because of the pandemic it was in storage until she moved out in the fall  when she finally opened it  it did not work at all  since i was past the return deadline  i tried working directly with the manufacturer  they sent me a new cord which turned on the power  but only produced a high pitch whining sound  very disappointed that they would not follow up  we re out the full cost with no option i know of except throwing it in the trash  such a disappointment      
180,5.0,                       i love this victrola record player  i m so happy to be able to play my record collection now  it s a beautiful player and it works great  the sound is ok  but you can add speakers if you want to  bluetooth speakers will work if they have an auxilary input  the player does not send bluetooth signals but will receive  like from your phone   extra note  the autostop works perfect with albums  big records  but stops a little too soon with some   s  small records   but there is an off on switch for this  so put it off while playing   s  it seems to be well made and i m very happy with it  it comes with an extra needle and if you register it on victrola com registration with the model number and serial number  they will even send you another replacement needle as a gift   at least they are doing that at the moment lol  it s always good to have backups      
181,5.0,                       got this for my husband for christmas  he absolutely loves it  i was able to play my led zeppelin vinyl albums i haven t heard in over    years  now in the evenings we have something to talk about because he plays his new portable turntable and all the old classics from the   s   s and   s that we loved  thank you for creating this wonderful piece of nostalgia for us      
182,1.0,                       the sound of this awful machine is an insult to recorded sound   it s pretty difficult for a scratchy  old    from     years ago to sound worse than it does on an actual     year old acoustic victrola  but this item fits the bill do not confuse this with the excellent product now being produced by the successor to the victor company  who is now producing american made phonographs in camden  nj under the victrola label      
183,1.0,                       if i had written this review when i first received this turntable  the review would have been glowing it was a warehouse bargain but the only noted damage was to the box i ve been using this for a little over a month  a few hours a week when i work from my home office  and it has already stopped working  it will no longer turn on i m so disappointed  this was a birthday present to myself so that i could enjoy the vinyl records i ve been collecting for years without having to fire up our big stereo system  there should have been way more than a month of service for the price i paid  it s worth spending a little extra to get a nicer  more recognized brand it s so unfortunate that i m out of the return window and stuck with just a little red suitcase      
184,2.0,                       i love the design and the functionality of this as a speaker  but as a record player  it is terrible  most of my records don t play without skipping  and it is especially true with records that are newer releases or have any coloring to the vinyl  but even older vinyl has issues  too  i do not own a single record that plays without skipping on this machine   but all is not lost   it does work really well as a speaker  and it is usually very easy to connect to devices via bluetooth  but i didn t buy this to use as a speaker   i bought it as a record player  and it absolutely fails at that      
185,5.0,                       the record player i used previously has issues playing some of my heavier weighted records  but this player handles the heavy records very easily  in addition to that  i hadn t noticed  when i purchased the player  the little switch or lever that moves the tone arm over the record and slowly drops it into place  that was a nice surprise since i always have issues dropping the needle accidentally  the color of the suitcase is just as advertised  the speakers are good quality  but can have some unpleasant fuzz when the sound is turned too loud or a particularly intense part of the record is playing  the music coming out of the speakers is soft and creates a nice ambiance in my room  i would definitely purchase this player again and recommend it to those looking to purchase one  regardless if you re a a novice or experienced record listener  this player will satisfy  it comes with a replacement needle  power cord  and    adapter      
186,1.0,                       this is really  really not a quality record player   i understand why people are drawn to it   the case is really nice looking in a vintage way  and it s cool to think that you re tapping into the long history of victrola   the sound is ok for what it is  when it works unfortunately  that name is all this player has to do with victrola   the player uses a needle and turntable assembly that is very  very cheap and low quality and is used in almost  all  portable suitcase players    there are videos out about this if you look around    mine worked fine for about two months  and then decided to stop spinning records at the right speeds   if you have any experience with record players you can tell how flimsy it is when you use it   also  this doesn t have bluetooth connectivity in the sense that you can use a bluetooth speaker with the player   it means that you can use the speakers on the player with one of your other devices like a phone or a laptop if you want something portable  there are much more reputable companies out there making much better players in the low     s      
187,4.0,                       this is a great little record player plays my records without any problems or scratches build quality is better than i expected quick bluetooth connection front speakers arent too bad  they re loud but    although the bluetooth connection is almost immediate  it does lack low end  bass  when streaming music vs a record not a deal breaker though  the only con i have found is when speakers are connected to the back ports   the front speakers are still active and audible  came with a replacement needle and    adapter when needed i highly recommend this record player for anyone of all ages  and will be purchasing another in the near future for the family room       
188,1.0,                       i ordered this product and it was sent back by usps because the box was so damaged  amazon gave me a quick and full refund  so i ordered the product a second time because i like the way it looks and really wanted to play my records  when the product arrived today  the second time  it was not in a protective box  just the actual product box with a bunch of packaging tape on it which was clearly covering up a huge hole in the box  when i opened the box the product looked fine  it actually looked cool  i read the directions and plugged it in  and turned it on   the  on  light came on but when i went to put the tone arm on the record the turn table wouldn t spin at all  there was nothing plugged into the aux in out so that wasn t the problem and the belt was on fine  i assume it is a motor issue  anyhow im sending it back now      
189,5.0,                       i ve always wanted one of these small record players  so after seeing the very reasonable price on this one i decided to try it out  the sound is amazing for the size of the speakers  and the slight crackle just adds another layer of vintage to whatever you re listening to  it s very easy to use  and the color is stunning  overall  it s a fantastic little record player and i could recommend it to anyone who s never owned a record player and doesn t really know how to operate one  and it s super easy to find vintage records at antique shops for cheap  which just makes the whole deal even better      
190,5.0,                       i own a dumont console record player    it stopped working awhile ago  needs to be looked at and see what s wrong with it  therefore  just wanted something inexpensive and decent to be able to listen to my records in the meantime   looked at many brands and saved countless on my amazon wishlist   there is actually another victrola player i want and probably will get   but let me tell you this little suitcase player works phenomenally well for the price point  i ordered the brown color only because it was cheaper    for what it is the sound is actually pretty good  i mostly like to listen on record players jazz singers and jazz music   and this little guy resonates the music really good   i was thinking of attaching my vintage speakers to it  but may not need too   i have it located in a small bedroom and fills the  room just fine   i read the reviews and many were mixed  figure  let me take a chance  for the price  you can t go wrong    my player arrived in perfect condition and packed nicely and everything works like it should   greatly satisfied with the product      
191,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this is my first record player and i couldn t be happier  the speakers have nice sound for the size and price of the unit  the unit feels fairly sturdy as well and i never noticed in tininess and am someone who often finds themselves annoyed by audio equipment in this price range  obviously if you have some good speakers you ll want to use those over the built in speakers but if you want something portable to use around the house or just to see if records are for you this is a good place to start and has a headphone out for pc speakers as well as the red and whites for traditional speakers      
192,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i really liked this  i was a bit skeptical because after researching  a lot of audiophiles hate these  but as a beginner and a broke teenager  it s amazing  i included a video of it  though  the speaker are really bad  it s not bad for how much it s worth     
193,1.0,                       i bought this for my daughter and a new record it skips and doesn t play clear at all you can barely make out what the record is playing  played the record on our other record player and it plays fine so i know it s not the record      
194,4.0,                       the sound quality isn t as good as i was expecting  it kind of crackles and sounds like the sounds coming out of a laptop  when playing records that are recordings it sounds better but live records  forget about it  i wanted to hook up my own speakers to it  but that seemed to be more of an issue than it was worth  i couldn t find speakers that had the right hook ups for the connections this player has  i like it because it s basic and does what it needs to and it is good for a budget buy  but i definitely wouldn t buy this one again      
195,4.0,                       this is my  st record player  after reading the reviews and how popular this brand is i bought it  plus  all the color options are great  i bought this brown one because i liked how it looked like leather  the brass pieces also give it an authentic suitcase look  it was easy to open and use  i just plugged in the cord and done  the only downside would be that it does not have a clear lid to cover it when playing the record  so i am careful to put the player in a place where it won t get bumped or messed with  great product  price and i would buy more for other rooms  perfect for a house warming gift      
196,1.0,                       stopped working after    days  it just won t power on  no power light amazon won t replace it good luck reaching anyone with the manufacturer  now i see the have a limited    day warranty  i think we are screwed  it s too bad  i am waiting for a response this is not something i should of bought online  i should of gone to a local store  this teaches me a big lesson  i ll be extremely careful about buying electronics or tech items online  not worth the small savings if you get a lemon like we did      
197,5.0,                       our kids in their    s      s bought this for my husband for fathers day  my daughter had asked my oppinion    i was like  oaawwwhh  the speakers will probably be tinny  low quality  just a trendy gift probably not worth it  my husband will think its a waste of money  he s very practical   our adult kids bought it anyway all that i thought was completely wrong  it s adorable  like the portable size we had in the    s      s  we love it  brings back the days of sitting near a turntable listening to records over   over  changing them out   listening to faves etc  it s the whole experience  the speakers were sharp   incredibly good  unlike the old portables and the volume filled the room  we played my husband s abba albums first   it took only minutes for the dance moves to begin  great time and we ll be going through some of those old abba  beatles  sha na na  joni mitchel  james taylor and more  albums we haven t touched to play in over    years  oh goodness  that makes me sound so old and we re not  a delightful item all around   an experiencial trip into the past       
198,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          exactly what i was looking for   perfect size   light weight  travels well  speakers great for intimate party   bluetooth feature is a nice plus  love itttt  comes with an extra needle  yay      
199,1.0,                       i bought this as a gift for my daughter for christmas  but did not take out and put in her bedroom at her home until later  no power cord was with the turntable   so i cannot tell you anything besides it looks pretty  when my daughter called amazon  they said it did not come with a cord   i highly doubt that is the case  so i give it a   star because i have no clue if it works until i buy the power cord and some other cords we were told it needs      
200,1.0,                       power cord plugged in the first time and i used the bluetooth  absolutely terrible sound  i could make a better sounding speaker   second time i plugged it in i heard a bunch of feedback then the power went back out  wouldn t stay on for more than a few seconds after that rickety toy  not a record player      
201,2.0,                       i really like this record player and i wanted to work as long as possible  i m disappointed though that after only about a year having it  the power cord overheats and it shuts down  i m not going to have to buy a power cord and makes hopefully it will still work  also  it would be super convenient if there was a compartment at the back to put the power cord in when it s being stored or transported      
202,1.0,                       so upset just got this today in the mail and it doesn t work please don t buy this     waste of money     
203,1.0,                       absolutely sounded horrendous   put a few records on  sound was flat  no bass   played through the system speakers  then played through edifier speakers which usually sound incredible   not with this  flat sound  horrible   changed records  changed needle  put on new record  same   conclusion  it sucks   i really wanted it to work   based on all the reviews  i m guessing they made some manufacturing changes recently   lots of bad reviews  but all recent  so i m guessing it changed and now sucks      
204,2.0,                       i m so bummed about this  a family member recommended this record player to me and i m disappointed by it  it plays old vinyl just fine  but it does not play newly pressed vinyl without skipping  i even returned a vinyl record thinking that was the cause of it  but it still skipped on the replaced one  i saw someone mention in a review that they added some pennies onto the tone arm  which helps the record not skip  but then the record plays slower so you re not getting the true sound   i was able to easily return it  but again  was sad i had to      
205,2.0,                       i was excited to get one of these because the reviews were pretty good  i love the color  and it s very cute  i made sure to follow all instructions before turning on  i made sure to put it on a flat surface and everything  i don t know if it s just mines or if this is how all record players sound  but the music sounds like it s vibrating too much  and choppy  i try putting it on a lower volume but it s the same problem  my sister has a different brand record player that looks similar and hers does not have this issue  it s almost like the speaker can t handle the loudness of it and it sounds extremely muffled and choppy  does anyone know if this is how it s suppose to sound      
206,2.0,                       i wanted this to work so bad  i got it so i could listen to records with my  yo  set it up right away   i was scared for the record player because it came shipped in the actual box   just some styrofoam on either side of the player  but it looked great and i love the aqua color  put the record on and it sounded crappy  but it s probably pretty old  so i tried bluetooth music  sound was so scratchy  the speakers are crap  i also tried a podcast  just to be sure  same  totally returning it and i will look for something with better sound quality  super bummed      
207,3.0,                       such a clever design and made me remember the record players of my youth   oh yes there were boom boxes and more  then too  i m not that old     and it was our teenage son who was the one who was requesting this  spoiled by modern electronics  i thought the sound left a lot to be desired and our son says it s better listening to recordings while wearing earphones ear buds      
208,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          arrived the day it was supposed to  and i wrapped it up as a gift for my father for christmas  i was so excited  excited is probably an understatement  he opened it and absolutely loved it  and grabbed a record to play  i immediately noticed the deck was not properly glued down  i was already disappointed in the purchase  then the little hook where the neck rests disintegrated in my hand at barely a touch  i can t take it away from him now since he loves it so much    but i will never purchase ever again  i was going to buy one for myself  but after seeing the quality  i won t be making that mistake  the only pro is that i got it to play      
209,2.0,                       i hate writing negative reviews on anything   truly   but i don t want anyone to make the same mistake that i made   i bought two of these   one for me and one for my mother in law hers came first   i set it up for her   she loved it then she came to me and said all of her records are skipping so she s going to have to only buy new records   i didn t think much of it as she has a very old collection that she hasn t looked at in    years i got mine   i played  or tried to play  a few brand new  never before played records  and most of them skipped   i brought them upstairs to my really nice expensive record player   they worked perfectly the problem seems to be in the player   i would not look at this one   per haps i did something wrong  but i can t imagine what i could have done sorry that this didn t work out      
210,1.0,                       i was initially quite pleased with the price and performance of this machine   however  after just a few periods of occasional use  the lift lever   arm damping mechanism has jammed  making the machine inoperable   it has not been mistreated in any way   very disappointed that the machine broke so easily      
211,5.0,                       this was a gift for someone special  and it definitely was well received   i loved the fact that there is a large variety of colors and prints to choose from  and this british print was perfect   it plays vinyl very well  good sound quality  and we like the fact that we can use the bluetooth feature to play tunes from our phones   excellent product      
212,1.0,                       started using this about three days now  it work just fine in the first two days  the sound quality isn t great but i can bare with it  but sometime the arm will not move but it will work   secs later  the three day suddenly there is those noises coming out from the speaker  and then some how i think i smelled smoke  i m not sure  i unplugged the power immediately  when i plug in again the next day  the speaker stop working  very disappointed  i was so happy to get this speaker when i ordered it      
213,3.0,                       it arrived broken with the center portion of the record player dropping  this caused the records to rub against the open top part of the case and play too slowly  it did not have instructions   i was able to open and repair the support lip that held the center of the record player up and it now plays beautifully   the bluetooth connects to your phone which is really handy  i like the basic product but selling it as used and  good condition  was a small stretch   regardless  i do enjoy it      
214,1.0,                       birthday gift for my son  did not power up out of the box   i verified  v dc coming from wall plug adapter   pulled inside panel  and the printed circuit board that has the power switch  bluetooth  headphone jack etc  doesn t even have the connector plugged in to provide power whoever assembled at fault i would suggest   the power cable was wrapped around another cord an laying close to where it should have been plugged in very disappointing   poor quality control      
215,5.0,                       had it for   months and love it  i don t listen to may records  but it works well when i do use it for that  i ve found myself using it for the bluetooth speaker a lot  i take it to family get togethers for us to play music on  my whole family has asked where i got it and are really impressed when i tell them how inexpensive it was i m not a musician  so i m sure people have stuff to say about speaker quality  but to me  it seems really good i especially love how portable it is and how it looks like a decoration when i m not using it      
216,3.0,                       it looks beautiful  very easy to use  sound quality is not at all what i thought it would be  i ve bought victrolas in the past and was therefore expecting it to sound clear  rich  and full  when i used it it sounded very tinny  muddled  and gravelly   as if someone threw sand into the speaker  hopefully you have a better experience than i  i thought i would be able to connect it to an external speaker  my alexa  via bluetooth so i could hear the vinyl quality but through different speakers   nope  the record player itself acts as an external speaker  though i recommend against it given the sound quality  and you cannot connect to bt and play your record at the same time      
217,3.0,                       this is a good buy for under     if you aren t overly concerned with audio quality   however  i think most of us who buy this expecting it to be able to connect to bluetooth speakers are disappointed   the speakers are really poor   the bluetooth functions do not allow you to play the phonograph over bluetooth speakers as i believe most would expect   rather  the phonograph acts as a bluetooth speaker   and a poor one      
218,1.0,                       this product looks really nice  but that s about it  as previously mentioned  the arm has no counterweight  so it will put too much pressure on the needle and scratch up your records  the turntable is made of thin plastic and extremely flimsy  my thicker   s were extremely wobbly on it  which could lead to damaging your records  the sound was pretty bad  i m not sure of the speaker quality was the problem or the cheap setup was the culprit for it  but the sound was fuzzy  the bluetooth does not allow you to play vinyl on other speakers  it allows you to use the record player speakers to play music from other devices  such as your phone  this is disappointing this thing is a nice decoration  but the low quality will end up ruining your records      
219,2.0,                       this should be purchased for children only  it does not have quality sound  the speakers are very tinmy  and there s only one port for an additional speaker   we knew this before purchase  but to reiterate  it is bluetooth only in the sense that the tenny speakers will broadcast whatever you have playing on your phone or other device  not the reverse  it s a cheap little thing   i guess you get what you pay for   it turns records and functions even though amazon did not pack it within another box  the original packaging was beat all to hell  but the thing works anyway      
220,1.0,                       do not waste your money  this is crap if your an audiophile and even worse for a beginner  the lid is prone to drop on the album  a simple locking hinge would have been a cheap fix  the needle is so bad that it s skipped constantly on the three new albums i played  the experience overall was disappointing i would not recommend at all      
221,2.0,                       first off  my    year old loves this   it s her first experience with records and she doesn t seem to notice or care about the awful  tinny  distorted  low fi sound   i did plug it into an external powered computer speaker which helps some   so i guess this is ok as a starter turntable for a kid  but if you care even remotely  and i mean even the slightest  about sound quality  skip this model   it sounds about as good as a      s am transistor radio   it does look cute though      
222,1.0,                       as soon as i got this turntable  it wasn t working  i tried a bunch of different records  old  new  different sizes  etc   and no matter what  it was skipping constantly  there is no way to balance the arm on the player  so i tried doing it myself with coins and small weights  still skipping  i tried changing the needle with the replacement they sent  still skipping  i contacted customer support for victrola and their advice to me was to attempt to balance the arms myself  as i had already tried   their advice is to tamper with their product in order for it to work  they sold a product that literally will not do the bare minimum  play music  without tampering with it using fishing weights i had to buy separately  they also told me it s not compatible with         gram records  i could not find that information anywhere in the product description before buying it  this is false advertising  i m waiting to hear back again from customer service about this  hopefully they will attempt to refund or replace the product but i m not sure they will considering they re already sneaky enough to sell a brand new product that is useless      
223,2.0,                       its super cute looking and i think it d be good for a child but it skips a ton and slows down randomly and the whole thing is poorly constructed  i knew better because of the price but i don t listen to vinyl a ton so i thought it would be fine  not worth it  spend the money on a decent set up or just forget vinyl and stream youtube cuz the sound quality is so bad  vinyl isn t cheap so spend the money to get something decent      
224,2.0,                       i wasn t expecting a premium piece of equipment  but due to the brand i thought i would at least be happy  it skipped all over the place  i played the records on tower turntables and they were fine   it s very cheap  the sound was really really bad  and i thought the bluetooth would allow to send the sound to another speaker  not only receive  maybe that was my fault for not knowing  but the quality was terrible  i would say get it for a kid only      
225,4.0,                       arrived fast and was in great condition  this was my first record player and the original needle it came with made the records skip  luckily they provide a backup with it and that needle works just fine   as for the speakers there are alot of mixed reviews  for a portable speaker they are pretty good  about as good as a mid grade phone or a     bluetooth speaker from walmart  if you are an audiophile looking for really good quality sound you need to have some of your own separate speakers to hook this up to  it has stereo plug ins on the back and i have it hooked up to an amp and it sounds great  if you don t care too much about sound quality and just want a cheap small record player i would definitely recommend this  the records wobble a little which i have heard is normal and doesn t affect the sound  for the average person this player is perfect but if you are looking for something high end that will be stationary in your room then you will need to spend way more than      personally i love it and use it all the time  the colors are very pretty too  perfect for a first time record player and would make a fantastic gift for anyone who enjoys listening to records      
226,5.0,                       very nice for the price  i didn t think i would like the compactness of this product but actually do  it s so easy to pull out and entertain and put back on the shelf out of the way  nice sound and hooks to my phone with ease  turntable is smooth with no vibration  i d buy again      
227,1.0,                       at first  i was a little disappointed with the overall sound quality the product produced  it s akin to listen to music thru your phone without any headphones    sounded ok  but unbalanced with little to no bass  i didn t really mind too much  considering how much i spent on the product  but while listening to my  th record  the speakers stopped producing adequate volume in the middle of a song  i didn t pick it up  move it  hit it or shake it    the volumed just cut almost completely out  i have it turned up all the way and i can barley hear anything  i can obviously only speak from my own experience  but i think you might be able to find something a little better for the same price      
228,3.0,                       received this turntable today   very nice but just a few issues       i had to take off the lid coz the record albums were rubbing on the lid as they played   mostly the     gram albums   removed lid now sounds great       the sound may not please everyone   again luckily i bought speakers which would advise people to do   even so you will save money   if you are in small room or apartment this will work wonders   it feels so good to use records again after    plus years   very much memories since very early childhood   if you can live with things i mentioned then this is a fantastic deal   soon we will get a better one for living room and use this in the bedroom   happy new year one and all   be well healthy and safe       
229,5.0,                       this earns   stars because of what you get for the price  to start with the bad  the sound sucks  everything about it feels cheap the good  it s a less than a     record player  it has built in speakers  bad speakers  but speakers none the less   plays   different speeds  rca or    mm output  and it s compact  i have mine connected to a vizio soundbar set up  rca   and it sounds just fine for the money  this thing is amazing  as good as a       record player  no  definitely not  if you have      for a good record player and another      for the necessary sound system  do that  all seriousness  do it  your records and ears will thank you   but if you want a cheap and compact way to play your records  this is the way to go      
230,1.0,                       product is very attractive but that is the only good thing i can say about it  the sound quality is terrible and i was worried my record was actually being damaged while it was playing  even with it hooked up to an external amp and speakers it sounded awful  sound was tinny and scratchy  also the platter wasnt flat so the record sounded warped as it played  very disappointed with this item      
231,2.0,                       i m no audiophile  but this things sounds awful  the tone arm seem to be way too light  any heavy base barely comes through and turning the volume up to compensate vibrates the plate  adding more issues  you don t get better sound from plugging in headphones  curiously the music still faintly comes from the inside the unit when headphones are plugged in  not worth almost    bucks  spend more and get a better turntable  i regret this purchase      
232,1.0,                       easily portable with the exception that you have to keep it plugged in to use it  so you have to carry the charger toosound quality was alright with the exception that my bar was not heavy enough so i had to weigh it down with some coinsi couldn t connect to anything with the bluetoothdoesn t work any more  even if i plug it in  it won t  charge  rendering it useless  unfortunately missed the return window on this  would have been nice to be able to actually listen to a full record on this      
233,2.0,                       well now  let s start off with  the records won t play well without gluing the base of the table down  i ve had two of these things and it s the same every time  not only that but on one of them  the speakers have gone dead and it s not like i ve played it on full tilt  ever  i ve had it for maybe a year  the other  more recent one is still working fine  but if you need a record player for any vinyl  maybe use one that would be more reliable  might be more money  but will last much longer      
234,1.0,                       i was so disappointed with this purchase  i love my records and bought this one for my office  the sound was horrible and it was so wobbly that i was afraid it would actually damage my records  i returned it      
235,3.0,                       i liked that this recorder player is portable  the color was cute  i liked the features but i ended up returning it due to design and sound  i didn t like that the vinyl record sticks out beyond the case which means the top can possibly fall down in the record  there is no safety latch to keep it propped open  the sound wasn t great for us either  i got another model of the same brand that encloses the record fully and sounds better      
236,1.0,                       did not expect much for the price  at first  it played lps just fine  then it began skipping   note  we did not use it excessively  only played it a couple dozen times  at most   tried taping a penny or two to the stylus arm  but to no avail  could not return to amazon because return window had closed  contacted vendor  and after much difficulty  they agreed to let me return at my expense for them to evaluate  unfortunately  the cost of shipping was as much or more than value of the unit  buyer beware      
237,3.0,                       it s an alright beginners lp player  the sounds quality via the built in speakers sound cheap  if you have   particle of dust on your vinyl then expect your music to skip  i ve used brand new lp s on this and it still skips when connected to another audio source you can still hear music coming from the built in speakers which is just odd i do love how it s built and portable  you can plug this record player into a battery pack and it ll play great record player for kids      
238,5.0,                       i love this record player  it s my first one and i bought   records already  i recommend this product to anyone  great sound quality and you can hear it from several rooms away even if the volume isn t all the way up  great price and great size  it fits perfectly on my small shelf and the records all are underneath it  i will be buying more records      
239,5.0,                       i bought this as a christmas gift to my mom who hadn t listened to her records since the      s  she teared up when it started playing and danced around the house like she was    years old again  we easily got it hooked up to her stereo system using an aux chord and it really sounded phenomenal  plus her favorite color is purple so it really was the perfect gift  even the built in speakers don t sound terrible  thank you so much      
240,4.0,                       if you think your going to have great sound quality or be able to connect this record player to wireless bluetooth speakers  you are sadly mistaken  i thought the same thing    you have to connect some good quality speakers to the rear connecting ports  the small speakers in the front do play the music and sound decent  but they are not the greatest  also if you want to play music from your phone   amazon music  pandora  etc  then you can connect to the record player via bluetooth      
241,3.0,                       i realize you get what you pay for  but you would expect a record player would be able to do one fundamental thing   play records without them skipping   the sound quality  even through headphones  is pretty abysmal   my daughter loves the union jack design and puts up with the lo fi sound quality since this isn t her primary means of listening to music   it s more of a novelty because it s more decoration than anything else did we decide to keep it   she knows that if she wants something that actually works  she ll have to spend some real money      
242,4.0,                       for the price  this is a very good buy sound quality is on the mediocre to poor side  could add some base for a much better audio experience  i m judging this against my parents old   very old record player that is     years old  not the new dolby digital  and the sound quality is much better than this new record player  twin speaker set up against twin speakers  my parents old system blows this one away for quality ease of use is great on this system  very adaptable seems to be made of good quality material but haven t had it for long so can t say anything concerning longevity my daughter loves it and that is the most important rating of all but for the money  i don t think you can go wrong with this i do recommend this product      
243,3.0,                          star for mediocre sound  maybe its a speaker quality issue  as others have raved about the sound they get    star for lack of a useful bluetooth connectivity  as others have mentioned  bluetooth is only for audio input  not output  why anyone would want to connect their phone tablet ipod to these mediocre speakers is beyond me go spend     on a bluetooth transmitter that connects to the    mm headphone jack any you ll finally have the inexpensive turntable you re looking for   stars for portability  storage  price     
244,5.0,                       i lost all my records in a house fire while i was in college  and recently got gifted a vinyl record from one of my favorite artists  so obviously had to buy a record player  this one was small enough to fit in my bedroom  and i m a sucker for these little suitcase style turntables just make sure you buy a   inch slipmat for it  i thought something was wrong with the turntable or that my records had something wrong with them  but it was just the height on the player without a mat at first  bought one that was too big  and it didn t sit correctly on the frame  but after i got my   inch mat  which was luckily cheaper  and was able to return the larger one   it played like a dream really missed having the pop and crackle of a vinyl record coming from the corner of my room      
245,4.0,                       it was very easy to set this record player up  and within minutes  we were listening to music   the sound produced by the built in speakers is pretty clear  and although some of the previous reviews recommend a slip mat  this doesn t seem necessary because the turntable has small rubber spots that hold the record in place   we also didn t have any issues regarding the records skipping as some of the other reviews pointed out   one thing to note is that the record player does seem very fragile  and needs to be handled with considerable care   in my opinion  this is definitely not something for children   however  even though it doesn t compare to my      gemini turntable  i wouldn t expect it to   it s a cool  relatively compact device to put in a place that your traditional record player set up may not fit      
246,4.0,                       i purchased this for my    year old son  he absolutely loves it  i was afraid the speakers wouldn t be up to par  but they sound great and are loud enough to hear  i only gave it   stars because the    adapter which should have been included was missing and  except for putting in for a total exchange  i can find no way to contact anyone to have that one little piece sent to us  i had to lay out more money to purchase the discs separately  i was not pleased about that at all  but  the product itself is more than i expected      
247,3.0,                       beforethis is how it arrived  i m afraid to open it  i don t think anything else needs to be said  refer to the photos first afterso i decided to open it an to my surprise everything worked perfectly which is why ima keep it at    but tbh it is unacceptable to ship something and have it arrive like that even just putting that box in a box would of prevented a lot of the damages      
248,5.0,                       just got this and have used it once  but so far it s great  very easy to set up and comes with detailed instructions inside the player  the speakers aren t amazing or anything  but they re decent for record player speakers  and it s nice to not have to hook it up to external speakers if you don t want to  haven t tried the bluetooth or line in functions yet so will update  but the plain old record player function is excellent so far  super light and portable  and love the color      
249,5.0,                       i was hesitant to buy this because i had purchased a crosley some years ago and didn t get much use out of it as it did not have the bluetooth capability this one does  i gotta tell ya  i couldn t believe the quality of this little doo dad for the price  they actually did the victrola name proud  it plays records just dandy  has an automatic off for those of us who don t remember you need to remove the needle from the record  has plugs for connecting to bigger speakers  and of course  the bluetooth capability that lets you stream your itunes through this snazzy looking retro gizmo  i d definitely buy it again for a gift if i knew another soul as anachronistically inclined as myself      
250,4.0,                       cheap way to spin your old vinyl   i got a great deal on it as i ordered the camouflage record player  it was about half the price of the nicer looking colors   mine arrived in perfect condition   the unit is well built from canvas covered  wood  with steel corner protection   when i played my first couple records on it  it skipped a little bit  i solved that by putting a small weight on top of the needle   maybe an ounce or two  couple nuts    sound is tinny and no bass from the built in speakers   it is acceptable for some   other than that  it played very well   extremely portable and easy to set up i m going to hook it up to my big stereo system so that should take care of the audio quality   i will eventually buy a nicer unit but grabbed this because of the deal      
251,3.0,                       on my  nd one  same issue  doesn t play newer even unopened  rand new records  or colored records  only plays    s and older records  the rest just constantly skip   junkupdate replaced the needle and my skipping problems have gone away for now  very cheap fix  got the needles here on amazon https   smile amazon com gp product b  k  diso ref ppx yo dt b asin title o   s   ie utf  psc       
252,1.0,                       i bought this against my better judgement  thinking that the difference between a cheap record player and a more expensive turn table wouldn t be significant   my records all skipped like crazy on this   it was not even enjoyable to listen to anything because of the skipping and poor sound quality   i thought the issue was my records   were they all just that dusty   i was gifted a much higher quality turntable from another brand and tried the records that were almost impossible to listen to on this device   no issues at all on that one  everything sounded great    so the issue was      this device   sad i wasted the money on it   it s a cute little thing  but it doesn t do the job      
253,5.0,                       i wanted a small table top record played for my bedroom and didn t want to spend a ton of money  this player is perfect for my needs  the sound quality is good for what it is  clearly this is not a high end sound system but for someone who usually just plays music on my computer or phone  i think this record player sounds great  i haven t tested out the bluetooth function  and don t know if i will anytime soon  so can t speak on that  i will say if you are looking for a compact personal player to enjoy your records  i think this one is a good choice and i m very happy with my purchase      
254,4.0,                       great value   amazing features incl stylus lift  auto stop   speakers are a bit small   tinny  as expected  but output jacks allow bookshelf adders   easy to use   very pleased   book doesn t id all the shipping protection   most are obvious  but note   the arm has a hold down clip  and the stylus has a removeable cover   only diappointment is no bass treble control  didn t expect an equalizer at this price      
255,1.0,                       although the sound quality was great for the price of the item  it is pure crap other than that  the turntable was wobbly in play causing my records lps to skip  no there was nothing wrong with my lps  any record that i put on the turntable they skipped or repeated the same section  i would not waste my time or money  just a poor quality record player      
256,3.0,                       this is very deceiving  you are not able to use the bluetooth function to hear your album on good speakers  but  you can connect another device to  vintage speaker  that shows up on the bluetooth list and play music from your device with the speakers on the record player  when i bought it  i thought the album would play through my bose speakers via bluetooth  so   this was disappointing to say the least  i think you can line in an external speaker though  it plays very nicely and the speakers on it are sufficient for our    year old to use for her introduction to record albums      
257,3.0,                       let s cut to the chase  the speakers are horrible if you want sonic range and depth  but that doesn t mean this product is useless  you didn t really expect bose quality speakers for the price  did you  ah but that s where this product can be saved  go buy some bose or jbl portable speaker and then you can line out from the record player to the speaker to have some quality  let record player do it s job and spin the vinyl and get some real portable speakers for the sound   it s only way to save the music  you will then be happy with this product if you were aiming for the whole portable  i m gonna subject my friends to neutral milk hotel on their back deck gathering  record player thing if you however want a record player for your home and you are serious about playing vinyl on a regular basis  go get a real turntable with a quality tone arm that as the counter weight and anti skate features  your records deserve better on the home front  happy spinning       
258,1.0,                       have to return item because it is defective  it does not turn on yes i followed instructions  i also do not like how it came packaged just in its manufactured box  there was no other boxing or assurance it was just the retailer box like you buy at a store in person  its unsettling because shipping an item overseas there should be better product protection  with that being noted i was so ecstatic now just im just disappointed      
259,2.0,                       we have bought and returned   albums that either sounded warped or skipped on this player  there is no way we just got   bad albums  as a blue tooth speaker  it sounds great and looks cute  but horrible as an record player  wish i could return but past the window by the time we realized it was the player and not the albums      
260,2.0,                       came in the mail with a hole in the box  plugged it in to see what the sound quality was like and it had no sound at all  took it apart to find the speakers were unplugged and out of position  fixed that and it works  but the sound quality is poor  ended up plugging in my bose speaker for a better quality  ok system for someone just getting into vinyl      
261,1.0,                       i was really excited to buy this product because my brother got me my first vinyl for christmas  i didn t do much research before looking on amazon  but i knew since it was my first record player i wanted something on the cheaper side  i found this one and the reviews were good  so i wanted to give it a try  setting it up was easy to follow and the color is very pretty  i was really delighted at first  but then the sound quality got really weird  there was a buzzing sound  and that sound was still apparent when i turned the volume down  then  it skipped  i was really disappointed and did some research on how to fix this  i found that i needed to adjust the anti skate control  well this cheap record player doesn t have that  i thought maybe there was some dirt or dust stuck in the record so i invested in the boundless record brush  i recommend   nope  both problems were still there  honestly  even if it is your first record player  buy something a little more expensive  it s cheap for a reason      
262,1.0,                       i have had   victrolas all of my needles have been weak and scratches some of my vinyl from this brand  i have had to sadly switch brands to a more expensive option to save my collection  this last purple glitter   speed i bought couldn t fit a    lp and hindered the record from playing  i thought it was going to chip      
263,1.0,                       i was so excited about this product  it is so cute and the perfect size  comes with built in speakers  the product description sounded great  however does not come with a platter mat or a slipmat  the arm is lightweight  i have not been able to use it without it skipping immediately  i think this is because of the cheap  lightweight arm  all of my records are brand new and i haven t been able to play a single one  i recommend paying more for a better product that includes everything you need up front because in buying the platter mat and the slipmat  i ended up paying an additional     and still it doesn t play      
264,5.0,                       i love it  love it     it s old and new put together  i can play music off my phone by bluetooth or buy records  it was all very easy to operate  i was surprised it took less than   mins to get the music playing  it s made really well and i m so pleased the sound quality has that old ring to it that travels to a time i only see in movies i tired to download a video but it wasn t letting me  trust me it sounds amazing     
265,1.0,                       do not buy this record player  i bought it thinking it would be an okay starter record player  wasn t expecting fireworks or the best player but at least a decent record player and i certainly expected the record player to function without damaging the vinyls  i was wrong  this player has ruined one of my vinyls and is not worth buying  get a different player do not make the mistake i did  i even attempted to clean the needle and the record was new so it s      the player     
266,4.0,                       good beginner budget deck  to improve sound you must immediately do the following  best value upgrades  install banpa flip stylus       if you play real   s  change to bsr needle stylus st    st    st   d st   st  d st  dlp st    st   st    st         see youtube videos for tips   buy   rubber slipmat from amazon to reduce static  record player  victrola suitcase vsc    bt  improves sound as much as you can on a budget  flip head reduces changing cartridges  replace your belt  use a record weight  hook to real speakers   enjoy  upgrade later to a better player      
267,4.0,                       i m kind of new to the vinyl scene so i m by far no expert  but for the price this record player has everything i need  speakers have a good sound and the volume adjusts fairly high  plays the vinyls fine far as i can  bluetooth works with no issues  has a headphone jack and an aux cord jack  also  you can connect external speakers to it  it s smaller than it appeared in the pictures to me  but that s great because it s very portable and easy to carry move  i think for the price it s a fantastic piece      
268,1.0,                       arrived broken   it was supposed to be a  gift for my    yr old on her birthday   so not only did she have to cancel her party because of the corona virus  but her big gift didn t  work      
269,1.0,                       awful sound  the sound on this item was really bad  the volume button won t let you turn music lower  just med and high volume  the turntable stops for no reason and the volume stops during playing for no reason  so frustrating  i would give this zero stars if i could  i don t leave negative reviews lightly  but in this case  i feel the quality is so poor that i have to do it  buyers beware      
270,1.0,                       we have not been able to use it yet   we ve spent more than an hour very carefully trying to fit the black cartridge holder into its slot in the arm  as received  this part  with the red stylus installed  was hanging loose from the arm  inside a small plastic bag   during the struggle to install it  the red plastic piece that holds the needle popped out  and is presently safely waiting for us to get the black carrier popped into its slot in the end of the arm   very careful examination using  bright lights and a magnifier show that the black plastic slot tin the end of the arm  that the black needle carrier block is supposed to fit into  is ever so slightly too small to receive the piece  we have tried applying a small bit of force to pop it in  but so far to no avail  i am happy to write a good review if and when this issue is resolved  right now i am taking a break  super frustrating      
271,1.0,                       sorry but the sound quality is awful  it sounds like you are under water no matter how loud you play it  i m really gutted because i was excited to buy records for this but it would honestly be a complete waste of money     
272,5.0,                       we grandparents purchased this turntable for a  yo granddaughter  it is much too delicate for her  this statement is actually a compliment  the quality is excellent but delicate  a  yo needs guidance in how to lift and set the delicate arm  this player seems way better than its inexpensive price  the player has ports for external speakers and headphones  i ve downgraded the sound quality because the two included stereo speakers are too small for full           hz reproduction  but fine for portable listening  except for the two small speakers  the platter  needle  arm  lift are near professional quality      
273,3.0,                       this is a great record player for beginners  the sound is decent  the moving parts are smooth  my big disappointment was with the color  the color that was delivered was nothing like the color i chose online  as you can see in the photos  it s hideous  being that it s part of our decor  the color was one of our main considerations when purchasing  and i m extremely disappointed      
274,1.0,                       i bought this one year ago   it s hardly been used  but now that my daughter has a few records  we ve discovered that it skips badly  even on new records   i just submitted a complaint to the company  so we ll see if this gets resolved   but right now  it s just looking like it s too late to return it  and that i might have an unusable turntable   this makes me think that you may just get what you pay for      lots of bells and whistles  and pretty colors  that won t matter if you cant actually play records on it      
275,1.0,                       i was going to rate this   but back in august when i ordered it it worked well when i went to use it yesterday         it stoped working i m upset about it and i did call customer service and they r refunding me witch is great but i wish i could ve just got a replacement but i am thankful i m getting my refund   so a will say i give the customer service a  on there help on correcting this situation now just waiting on my refund       
276,1.0,                       this is designed to play older vinyls  most vinyl now is     grams  this junk has a super light arm so to even attempt to play modern records  you have to tape a penny to the arm  if you re lucky  they play through the first time  but have no fear by the  th play through  the record will start skipping  if you aren t lucky  this will just damage your records so  if you only have records from the   s or before you should be fine  but if you re living in this century and half your records are the heavy duty new ones  enough not listening to half your collection      
277,2.0,                       sadly disappointed in the product  it has a rattle inside like something is loose and it came without the    adapter  the vinily wrap it has is peeling off from the corners without any use  sound quality is good but no exceptional  the packaging is very nice and the overall exterior look  but it ends there i was expecting a little more for the price if i had to buy another record player i would go with something with a higher quality bottom line   i do not recommend it     
278,4.0,                       this product seemed to work just fine  but now it doesn t play very well after about a week of use  there isn t much control over the speed  which is good for beginners  but it becomes a problem when neither of the settings  fast or regular  play the correct speed  it might be because of an error in manufacturing but it looks like their might be something wrong with the mechanism when it spins making it sound strange  still a nice looking record player and good for a temporary replacement  but not the greatest for an everyday use      
279,5.0,                       my daughter is getting into vinyl records  she s used my turntable here at my house but wanted something for her dorm room  i got her this and she was quite pleased  i remembered the suitcase record players of the   s and thought this might be some of the same  but the sound quality is actually quite good and the head weight of the cartridge isn t excessive enough to hurt her record collection      
280,5.0,                       if you re thinking of buying this  go for it  after shopping around for one of these i started to get a little overwhelmed by the options and decided to pick one i felt a little confident in and just go for it  i m so glad it was this one because i m so pleased  the sound is phenomenal and the blue is super adorable  it s easy and pretty straightforward to use so no worries there  some of the other options i looked at were super confusing on the how to use terms   so far i m loving it  i d definitely recommend this     
281,3.0,                       they really should take new photos  i was surprised to open the box to a very bright saturated turquoise  nothing like the robin s egg color shown in the images  for the price  surely it s not worth returning  so i ll settle even though it doesn t match my living room color scheme  the speakers are ok       it s a beautiful piece  though and should work just fine for what i need it for      
282,5.0,                       i bought this to give my kids some appreciation for the sound of music on vinyl during this pandemic  they were thrilled  there has been some varied success with some of the vinyl purchased through amazon  which i suppose is to be expected      
283,5.0,                       victrola was always a quality manufacturer from years ago  nice coloring  sleek style make it a welcome addition to a room  when you register it online  the company will even send you an extra needle  lets me listen to my old records from the   s and   s  wish it had a cd player however  have so many old discs that i would like to listen to  all in all a quality product  great sound      
284,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i love this victrola  it plays my records perfectly and everything is already set up nicely  so there s not much you have to do to start playing right away  the sound quality is very good  it plays music clearly  maybe slightly screechy at first but it adjusts  plus it gets loud  i really enjoy it  it s not an automatic tone arm  you ll have to manipulate it manually but it rocks      
285,3.0,                       i ve been wanting one of these for a really long time  and decided to treat myself for a birthday present  it arrived way earlier than expected because i thought the color i ordered was on back order  it took me about   minutes to figure out how to use and not gonna lie i m not impressed  i m not sure if it was just a flaw that mine has or if it s every single model  but the sound quality is awful  the speakers are crackly  to the point where it sounds like they ve been blown out   if it weren t for that i d absolutly give   stars on everything      
286,1.0,                       when i bought this  bluetooth record player  i foolishly assumed that the bluetooth connection would allow the user to connect the player to a set of headphones to listen in privacy  wrong  the bluetooth connection works in the wrong direction  it allows you to play an outside source through the record player s speakers  but does not allow you to play the record player out to another headset or speaker  this is the most idiotic use of bluetooth that i ve ever seen      
287,5.0,                       great father s day gift   our    year old dad wanted to enjoy his albums and when researching this player it had so  many great reviews we decided to go for it   the cost was very reasonable   what surprised us was that we thought we would need to connect our bose and we didn t   dad uses it every day and because it is portable he can bring it to any room in the house   last note if a record was even a bit scratched or warped we did not try to play it as extra precautions      
288,1.0,                       i purchased this item and gave it to my daughter for her bday  the table is in even so the records skip  the website doesn t load and i can t get thru on the number  it didn t come with any info so now i don t have a way to replace it or get my money back      
289,3.0,                       so im just going to be straight up honest    i was super excited about getting the record player in the mail  i waited day by day for it to arrive  when it finally did i saw the mail lady carrying it to our front step and i immediately saw the box was destroyed  the mail lady even said    i was super careful with it  i hope its okay   that upset me because there was holes and i looked like a disaster waiting to happen  once i opened it i was surprised that everything was there and in good shape  the only complaints i really have is that the record does sound a tad scratchy and skips parts of the records put on it  also when i first opened it there was a few small stains on the white parts but it wasnt to big of a deal  i like it and thinks it looks really nice in my room and a cool way to listen to my favorite artists      
290,1.0,                       we bought this not expecting much and we were still disappointed   the sound quality is really poor   we ve had it for not quite   years  have only used it less than once a month because it sounds so bad  went to use it today and it will no longer even turn on      
291,5.0,                       i love this little victrola suitcase record player  i recently inherited all of my dad s old records  and i needed an reliable but inexpensive record player so i could listen to them to remember my childhood  this turntable completely fit the bill  not only does it work very well with pretty good built in speakers  but i flipping love the retro look  i ll try to add a photo later  it s pretty handy that i can also play my digital music through this  but all i really want to do is listen to my vinyl like i did in the old days  to say i am happy is an understatement  i am in serious love      
292,1.0,                       my husband i used this record player once and it worked beautifully   however  we went to use it a second time and the cue lever is stuck   this is just not acceptable   a cue lever should not stick after one use   we did not move the unit at all   it has not been jostled in any way   we will be returning this unit for something better      
293,1.0,                       i know it probably doesn t deserve the   star rating just for not having the    adapter  but now i have to go through all the hassle of either returning it or just not having the ability to play my    speed records      if you are going to state that it comes with certain parts  it should come with those parts  otherwise it makes it a pain          
294,5.0,                       this was a christmas gift for my cousin who was missing her late dad  she wanted to play some of his old records and she loves the color purple  she was almost in tears when she saw this  pro tip lol when trying to connect to this device via bluetooth  you have to be ready to pair it right away  if you miss the window turn the device to phono or away from bluetooth and then back and you should see it show up in your bluetooth scan  the speakers are not very loud but they are crisp  vinyl should sound very nice through this  you also have a mic input as well as rca out in the back of the unit so you should be able to pump this through your home audio system      
295,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i got this record player especially for the color and rose gold detailing and that s literally the only thing i still like about it   other than that bad buy for a beginners player  i purchased this one specifically twice in row first time had to return it since it had horrible skipping defect  that actually ruined my brand new vinyl  the second time same problem  on top of a nasty dent on the back side since it was delivered to me in just the old used looking victrola package box with a sticker label on the front  i don t understand why amazon would ever do that but anyway  overall really upset that i had such a bad experience both times  and wish i didn t have to return it because i love the color      
296,4.0,                       this is an awesome little turntable  but guess what   the sound isn t that great  whoa    yea because the speakers are like    wide   i can t believe some reviews are complaining about  no bass    lol  yeah because the speakers are like    wide    geez   for     what did you expect    anyway  great little turntable  sound is decent  hopefully it will last a while      p s  the speakers are like    wide    lol         
297,3.0,                       yes  this is definitely an entry level record player  for some reason i thought the sound would be decent enough but  like everyone had said  you get what you pay for  the player has a nice look to it but this is essentially a toy  i m no audio snob but i need my records to sound close to what i listened to as a kid   i m trying out the at         
298,4.0,                       i bought this record player for my partner for his christmas  and he absolutely loved it   the record player is easy to use  and also has support for bluetooth  and auxillary   however  you ll definitely want to use external speakers for this player as the sound quality isn t the best after two weeks of using the record player  it stopped working     we were able to get a replacement shipment quickly   we haven t had any issues with the new record player since overall  this is a great product if you are buying it as a gift for someone who wants to start a record collection   if you re purchasing this for audiophiles  you may want to consider a product with better quality      
299,1.0,                       i was satisfied with purchase but after a few months the record player would no longer turn on  the company told me it was probably a bad power supply and they sent me a new power supply  i have written them multiple times to inform them that this did not fix the problem  they do not bother to respond  my one year warranty ends dec       i assume they are just waiting to say my warranty has expired  very disappointed in victrola   they do not stand by behind their warranty      
300,1.0,                       gifted this to my dad  broke within   days  reached out to victrola support  they said hold the product and we will ship you another power adapter to ensure the power is working  after   weeks i get the adapter during which i was no longer for amazon refund  tested with the new adapter  the issue was not the adapter but the power unit within the device  i responded back with this and they just ignored my   attempts to reach out for next steps to either give me a refund or ship another device waste of my time and money   never again shall my family or i buy another victrola product gifted https   www amazon com gp product b  pbld qn ref ox sc act title   smid atvpdkikx der psc   to my dad so he can continue to enjoy his gift  he loves the sony ps lx   bt and still working after several months      
301,5.0,                       amazing quality record player  i have zero complaints  love the vintage look of this compact record player  our family looks forward enjoying the use of this player for many years to come  every aspect of this device seems to be top quality  plus comes with an extra needle  you will love this record player  it is a must have for your entertainment  the nostalgia is perfect      
302,5.0,                       very easy to use  especially for a novice like me  and the sound quality was excellent   docked a star because mine didn t come with the    rpm adapter  when i contacted customer support stating that the    rpm adapter was missing they said they would send one out   about   weeks later i received an ac wall plug adapter and they haven t returned any followup emails update  they sent me a    rpm adapter     
303,1.0,                       really disappointed  i got this as a birthday gift from my husband   i basically shop on this site alot   and never really do reviews   but when you get irritated from after spending alot of money   and your item dont work right its upsetting   i wanted to start a record vinyl collection as well   not as cheap as i remembed  anyways my record player is perfact like picture   but my record wobbles a bit during play time    and skips vinyle records   brand new   ive only tried      but every record ive gotton skips   i dont recommend this      
304,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          it has bluetooth but i do not use it to preserve the vintage aesthetic   i love it  and it took some time to learn just a day or less and i was jamming eventually  each deep line is a song  maybe you knew this  i didnt know  just put the needle before the deep dark groove line and that should be the beginning of each song      
305,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i was super excited but it skips like crazy  i thought it was maybe the vinyl was damaged so i replaced  it and nope it s the player same exact issues  honestly i m more disappointed than anything     
306,1.0,                       so disappointed in what we received  there was no packing material inside the box so our product was bouncing around  the merchandise box was opened and ripped  no instructions no manuel and missing parts  did not turn on and was hot after    minutes plugged in and us trying to figure out how to turn it on  it should turn on when we turned it to on but it did nothing  no light turned on  it was for my son and he researched watching videos and searching manuel s  highly disappointed in the way the product was packaged and came defective  i can t even rate my disappointment      
307,2.0,                       i bought this for my dad as a christmas gift in      and he absolutely loved it  it was perfect  had the retro look and feel that he likes and it worked great  sounded great  now  a little over a year later it has suddenly stopped working  when you try to play a record  it plays it way too fast even on the lowest setting  he doesn t even use this that often for the belt to have gotten super worn  very disappointed in this  especially since my family has worked to build up his record collection because he loved it so much  will definitely be doing more research before i buy him a new one      
308,4.0,                       the device itself works fine  looks good and it s relatively easy to use  the bluetooth functionality is cool and it even includes a   mm adapter the speakers are by far the weakest point  even my laptop  macbook pro     or my     mono bluetooth speaker  jbl go  sounds better and louder  so just connect it to a decent set of speakers      
309,5.0,                       i love love love this  i have been flirting with the idea of getting a suitcase player for about a year  i have another one but its big and i love the suitcase model  the shipping was super fast  it looked gorgeous when it got here  and i was kind of surprised by how loud the speakers were able to get  overall  this is definitely one of the best purchases ive made in a while      
310,1.0,                       the product didn t work  this was the  nd one my fami y bought and both had the same problem  the first one was a christmas gift and when she opened it on jan    no light and no spinning  my mom thought it was too late to return the first one so i purchased my a sister another one  it arrived jan    and opened it jan   th  this product had the same issue  we check both products in various outlets and even tried a diffferent cord  i am returning the jan    one but just stuck with a lost on the first purchase      
311,5.0,                       i always wanted my own turntable for vinyl records  and victrola has provided me with this wonderful turntable  it comes in a suitcase  compact enough to have all of the things you need to play a record   the sound is great  but i speak as someone whose first experience is with this particular turntable without any other speakers  it s a great turntable for everyone  especially if you re looking to have it set in your bedroom for personal enjoyment      
312,2.0,                       purchased this item for portability and easy  affordable access to playing vinyl records that i m quickly amassing from thrift stores and estate sales   price was very attractive and victrola brand is legendary  so thought i couldn t go wrong   novelty british flag design was an added plus received incorrect style of the item  no british flag rather  a solid  black velvet case    but nevertheless gave it a spin     of the    records i played skipped horribly   particularly on the first half of each side   i suspect it has something to do with the design          lp records actually extend out beyond the record platform and cabinet  so i think lack of stability underneath the vinyl is an issue   and results in needle kicking up   particularly if there is a slight warp to the record  which many vintage records have    returned the item and purchased another victrola model  vta     that has better support underneath lp s and so far have had no issues with skipping   all the records that skipped on this model didn t on the vta         
313,5.0,                       i was a bit worried ordering this because the reviews are somewhat all over the place but was very relieved to find it works fantastically  looks good  sounds good  also works with bluetooth very easily  only things i can say for some of the reviews saying there was no proper sound is possibly getting a defective one or maybe they didn t take off the protective piece over the stylus  or needle  also make sure your records are dust free as bits of dust can create pops and crackles  oh i forgot to mention this thing can go pretty dang loud and thats awesome      
314,1.0,                       so upset  ordered this as a christmas gift and when they put in the record the sound was horrible    it made the background music sound distorted and  wavy  anyways  i wouldn t recommend this  i m returning it and going with something different  i guess you get what you pay for  but really  what a piece of crap also  how embarrassing to give as a gift and hear that it is no good      
315,2.0,                       this is good for anything   but a record  the motor does not keep up and it sounds bad  i still use it a decore and to play bluetooth but i rarely ever use it for my records but that s what i excepted from a cheap record player      
316,4.0,                       i bought this for my niece for christmas  along with a few records  to pass along the vinyl bug  it worked   maybe too well  i definitely created a monster who will need to be fed with new records and musical equipment for the rest of her life  yay the price point should tell you that this is no technics       but if you re looking for a fun gift  a record player for someone just getting started with vinyl  or a supplemental player for yourself  that s also highly portable   you won t go wrong here  there are an abundance of great colors and designs to choose from  and the bluetooth option is nice  you can also supplement the sound with additional speakers if you d like  or use your headphones or earbuds  as always  you get what you pay for  but this is a decent value for the low price  one quick caveat   consider buying a decently sturdy slipmat  the felt  fabric  or cork piece that sits underneath the vinyl on most turntables  to use with this player   it doesn t come with one  i was lucky that i already had backups on hand to include with my niece s gift  because i was uncomfortable with putting vinyl directly on plastic  a slightly thicker slipmat seemed to provide the most stability to balance out the lower cost components with which these turntables are made  happy listening      
317,1.0,                       i bought this because of all the good reviews   i have a pretty good collection  and want to be able to play in my office  away from my full stereo system   i know that suitcase players are the trash of the audio industry  but held out hope that i could get something small and convenient   every record skipped   i have brand new  unopened records that i wanted to give a first spin   flawless  no dust  nothing   skipping   no way to adjust anything with the arm   i dont want the possibility of damaging some of my vintage records  so i am returning this   will look into a system to put in my office instead of this portable option   dont waste your money   i should have known better      
318,3.0,                       i gave a   star rating   why  because the value exceeds to price  you get the best bang for your buck  i ve brought it with me to the park and plugged it into my car  sound quality is      considering the size of the speaker but who is looking for deep bass anyway  the vinyls play well   i have it on an auto setting  this is a plug and play machine  no exterior speaker needed though you can plug them in  it also gives you an aux port to listen via headphones to get the full vinyl sound  great product updated    months later and my victorila has stopped working  it stopped spinning the records  won t be purchasing again  you get what you paid for      
319,2.0,                       my wife was really looking forward to getting this bit of nostalgia and to look at it the product fulfilled her expectations  but the sound that came out of it was absolutely awful  tinny with no bass  in these days of tiny beautiful sounding speakers why the company couldn t be bothered to use a good speaker in its box was astounding when the  quality  of the speaker was discovered we thought we d try to use the bluetooth to run the sound through other better speakers and the bluetooth only allowed for receiving and not broadcasting  why would we want other system s sound coming through this awful speaker      
320,5.0,                       i bought this as a gift for my husband and it s perfect  it worked right out of the box with very minimal setup required  and is so easy to use  the sound is great and it s extremely user friendly  love it      
321,5.0,                       this record player is awesome   based on some the reviews  i was really expecting bad quality sound from speakers   much higher quality than i had expected  sound is quite good actually i spent    mins thumbing through records today  which was very nostalgic in itself super easy to use too   if you re on the fence for      don t be   totally worth it      
322,5.0,                       for the price i bought this  it works fantastic   the multiple features including bluetooth make an old style feel up to date  the speaker quality was surprising much louder than expected  the knob on mind never goes past       the sound quality is not the best  but the needles  there is a replacement  are good enough quality i don t need to worry about wear and tear on my vinyls      
323,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          it arrived on time  i assembled it in about    seconds  and right away it worked exactly as described  for beginners just getting started with listening to records  or people who simply want to listen to a few records without spending much  this is a great deal there are a few reviews complaining about the audio quality  and all i can think is  what did you expect for this price   the sound quality is pretty good certainly good enough for me to enjoy some old used classical music records like the one i attached here  if you want the sound quality to be  great  you ll just have to plug in your headphones or spend more more money on high end speakers  for the price  i really don t know how you can beat this      
324,1.0,                       the sound quality is horrible   it skips as the record plays   not happy with this purchase at all  do not waste your money      
325,5.0,                       haven t used it much yet but so far so good  i bought old christmas vinyls to listen to this christmas  sound quality seems great  i don t have much experience with record players but so far i m happy with it      
326,2.0,                       i only had it for about for about a month before it completely shut off and never turned back on even after troubleshooting  they sent me a new one at no additional charge  but i m very nervous that it s going to do the same thing  it makes me wish that i had gone ahead and spent the money on a higher quality record player that might not have had those issues      
327,1.0,                       pure junk   i connected the audio out jacks to my stereo and quite frankly it sounds like a garbage disposal  you can barely make out the music it s that bad   cheaply made  and they are bastardizing the name victrola  thank goodness i m a prime member because amazon can give me my money back as in yesterday  avoid         
328,4.0,                       pretty cool beginner setup  got the matching record case as well  wish it had an auto return arm but kids can t have everything be too easy these days lmao  after the first record finished she sat on the couch looking stumped  i asked her what was up  she said she was trying to figure out how to remotely get it to skip songs      
329,4.0,                       pretty nice little record player for the money  i just use it once in awhile when i get in my record playing mood  so it is fine for me  the sound isn t too bad but if you really are a fan of playing records i would suggest a higher quality  but just for using now and then or foray first time record player for a kid or    it works just fine and it s really cute      
330,4.0,                       i was not happy to receive it in the original packaging  it could easily show what was inside  and it s a lot bigger than i had thought  the sound quality is good pretty loud  but it will sometimes skip parts on the record i have noticed not sure why it s happening  it had happened on a couple of my old records and then it happened on my new ones and i knew that it must be the record play so be aware of that      
331,1.0,                       automatically stops before record finishes  i was playing old children s books  which are the size of a     but play at     it stopped with a good minute to go  once the arm reaches a certain spot near the spindle  it just stops also  the sound was awful  i have purchased  cheaper speakers that sound better than this      
332,5.0,                       he said the sound could be better  but that s expected since it s so small  he likes the adjustable speed and it reminds him of when he was younger  he very excitedly showed me the old songs he used to listen to on the records he had  if anything changes i ll update the review  but so far he s a happy camper      
333,3.0,                       not the worst record player out there for someone who is just starting off  but the problems with it will quickly make you upgrade  the sound quality is very tinny  which can be really nice on things like swing music to really give a retro feel  but when you ve just paid over     on an album you really want  then the sound is a problem  worse is the skipping  since there is no counterweight on the tone arm  this thing has a really bad tendency to skip  i had one     gram record play in about ten seconds because the tone arm skipped over the whole thing  if you do end up getting this  be ready with a quarter to place on the tone arm and glue or tape it in place  otherwise you ll be resetting it over and over again honestly  it s best to just save up and get something nicer      
334,5.0,                       i had researched a number of players and selected this one because it was portable  had few parts that could break and there were a lot of positive reviews   judging by the look on my granddaughter s face when she opened her present  i would say it was well received   i was very glad i purchased this as my granddaughter and i spent quite some time setting it up and playing albums      
335,4.0,                       nothing fancy but it does work well  has that slightly tinny sound that most of the small portable players had when i was a kid  can only play one record at a time  only issue was that i did not see anything in the instructions about removing the cover from the needle before attempting to play a record  unpack it  put an album on  remove the needle cover  white  release the tone arm  lift the lever to the back of the player next to the tone arm  gently move tone arm over to album  lower with lever and relax while you listen to some good ole elvis      
336,5.0,                       my girlfriend and i love this  it s very easy to use  we didn t have this little black piece which is a spacer  i opened it it was under the spin disk things and was not spelling correctly and made everything sound slow  at first i thought it was broken until i expected it and saw it  pulled it out and put it in its place  everything sounded great afterwards      
337,1.0,                       the quality sound of this is awful i bought   brand new discs to play and it keeps skipping is awful the only way i can get good sound out of it is actually connecting my phone in bluetooth to it and plying the cd in my phone i m so disappointed        
338,5.0,                       i bought this for my grandfather for christmas  i made sure it worked before wrapping it in the christmas paper  the sound quality seemed to be quite well  though i haven t any idea how old records are supposed to sound  my grandfather has a large collection of old records he can no longer play because they no longer produce the needle for his old record player  i quite love the fact that victrola includes an extra needle in the packaging  i didn t rate the quality of the bluetooth because i hadn t tried it      
339,5.0,                       the quality of this victorola is excellent   my daughter is in love     and it has really great features with the blue tooth hook up and a place for headphones   talk about nostalgia   we have been listening to old records and laughing and dancing since it arrived   it has opened up communication about what it was like to grow up when i was young  in a much simpler time   i can t say enough how happy she has been since she opened it   if you are looking for a great christmas present for your kids  this is it         
340,4.0,                       it s beautiful very    s esque  the sound quality is okay since the volume differentiates between the bluetooth and actual vinyls  it has the perfect aesthetic for listening to anything and everything from t swizzle to my boys da zombies  totally fab  would def get again so mine can have a buddy  i would for suresies play two records at the same time and make the devil s music come to life but don t   me because i m all about my homie jesus because  catholicism  anyways    haven t traveled with it but i m sure it would be ever so delightful  i once saw a video where a girl had like a portfolio in which she would put all her records in and i think you need one of those if you want to travel with it you know for convenience purposes  yeah    i think she had some pretty banging records  including the original      disney cinderella s soundtrack which we all know is a banger  she also has some   s which are the little records  i haven t tried one but it has the little piece for it so i m sure it works  fingers crossed lol  haventtried  willtry  needtogetone  thinkingaboutit  butter     
341,1.0,                       have had for just    months  i plugged in and it started smoking glowing orange from the inside     very concerning could have burned the entire house down      
342,1.0,                       beautiful player  but when i received it the original box was badly damaged  and i know it didn t happen in shipment because that packaging was fine  but i thought it d be okay still  but when i went to play something the turntable doesn t spin  i tried a few things and still nothing  and then when i went to try again this am  it won t even turn on  super upset and i was really excited for this and bought the matching vinyl case  hoping i can get a matching replacement that actually plays      
343,1.0,                       the sound quality from this turntable is hard to describe  not loud enough and keep skipping my records are brand new and i have collected them for so many years  but now they were hurt  obviously  the stylus is so cheap that it hurt my vinyl i will not buy the cheap turntables to display my record the product is bad and i can hear some voice from the inside box  i don t use it anymore return it to amazon  never believe victrola anymore      
344,5.0,                       you pretty much get what you pay for with this product  so i can t really complain about the materials they use  i think the speakers are alright  my main complaint is that there is nothing that holds it open  oh and as a warning make sure the needle is at the right angle  otherwise just replace it with the spare  because it your records will skip like crazy if the angle isn t right  overall great product  i have no regrets buying this     
345,5.0,                       really pleased with this  i bought this for my art studio space in our attic  it s perfect for that purpose  keep in mind that it is a suitcase record player and the speakers are what one would expect for a suitcase record player  not a wide range but a decent sound  if you re looking for a more dynamic sound  and lots of bass  then i would suggest finding some auxiliary speakers at the goodwill and hooking them up  the mechanics feel solid  the tone arm has some weight to it  bluetooth mode works seamlessly pleased as punch with this  i would buy it again in a heartbeat      
346,1.0,                       i bought this because my old record player wasn t working  i was excited to have a portable record player that i could take back and forth from college  home  when i first got it i thought all of records were warped  everything kept skipping  some of my really old records will sound okay but any newer record skips large portions of each song  after days of trying to get the table to stop wobbling i decide to return it  save your money and your time  don t buy      
347,5.0,                       i have a few big record players that are not very travel friendly  so  i decided to purchase this portable record player  i love it so much   it s very lightweight  the sound quality is excellent  it s also a bluetooth speaker  and connects easily i ve had this for awhile and it still plays excellently  not to mention  the map design is beautiful perfect for anyone      
348,4.0,                       to anyone who thinks this is going to sound like crap  you are correct  all small record players like this sounded like crap back in the day or they wouldn t have invented digital sound  it s still decent to listen to  but that s not the goal  it looks very nice and it has that staticky  tinny  vintage sound vibe of old vinyl records  so it hits all the marks for a vintage record player      
349,2.0,                       did not have a    adapter when unpacked   sound quality is substandard  very tinny  absolutely no bass  the blue tooth would not connect this reminds me of a toy record player i had as a kid  don t expect much and you ll be happy   yes it s portable  it will play records and you ll be able to hear them      
350,4.0,                       for the price you do get a decent product  the onboard speakers adequately produce a vinyl sound but do not have a wide range to carry full high  mid  and low db clarity  the tone arm and stylus head are lightweight and will occasionally  float  across your vinyl  this sounds like you re missing skipping through the song  i do have a fix for this though    place a penny or nickel on the stylus head  this adds the extra weight needed to keep the needle in the groove and greatly increases clarity and accuracy while playing a vinyl      
351,4.0,                       i love this product  it s a great record player all in all  my only issue was with the shipping condition upon arrival i assume this was an isolated situation  but mine arrived with the power adapter plug sticking out of the box  first i rolled my eyes  then i opened it up and noticed it had indeed gotten bent  luckily  however  i was able to bend the prongs back and i plugged it in and tested it all  and it works fine  the product itself is great  the sound is great  etc  i just hope this shipping packing issue doesn t happen to anyone else  i worry that it could somehow create problems as i continue to use it more and more  but fingers crossed it doesn t      
352,1.0,                       i received my victrola turntable with no power cord  i now have no way of charging it or turning it on  seeing as it is a christmas gift  i am completely stumped on what to do when i only have five days left to figure this out  i also have no way of contacting whoever sold this  very cute product  but i am horribly disappointed      
353,5.0,                       bought it because i wanted my kid to have a hobby that doesn t involve a screen  he expressed that it would be cool  i guess he misconstrued as i will buy a record collection and not just a few to get him on his way      
354,5.0,                       i adore this record player  it s beautiful and fun  the only down side i have found is that it doesn t have a plastic box cover  like the old ones  to protect the record from dust and dander in the air while the record is playing  if a piece of dog hair or a particularly large speck of dust lands on it while it s playing  it skips every time  but other than that  i love it        
355,3.0,                       to listen to lps i have not listened to for many years  just arrived home from work  i have not had time to open the box  i hope it plays very well tanks amazon team members be safe  and  happy holidays      
356,4.0,                       this is not for audiophiles  but  it works good enough for everyone else  the sound quality is good  crisp  and what i expected  the platter is smaller than a      so i suggest getting a    slip mat for better grip on the vinyl   the speakers are not great  so don t crank it up  it will only blow out the sound  headphones are great or bluetooth or audio jacks  it s a tight unit   perfect as a first turntable  do make sure to use the lock down clip and the pick up lower lever   makes it last longer      
357,1.0,                       remember the little record players you had when you where a kid  well these are even worse  great great for a use once or twice and then throw in the trash  plays records just fine  sounds awful  and the line out buzzes like nobodies business     
358,5.0,                       i m obsessed with my new player  i ve been using it almost every night  it is very user friendly and easy to use so would suggest for someone new to record players  comes with   extra needles which is wonderful and an instruction booklet which is helpful  overall the sound quality is great and would definitely suggest to purchase  i haven t tried the phone connection yet but would expect the same quality  happy customer      
359,5.0,                       i ve wanted a record player for years and this one is amazing  light  and the sound quality is great  the records sound good   i love that you can also connect your phone      
360,3.0,                       much better for looks than for use  the quality its pretty poor  but at the end of the day it does work  the sound is overall pretty low and distorted when playing records  and sound it basically blown out when coming from bluetooth  the aux out port to connect your own speakers didn t work on the one i was delivered  it wasn t worth the effort to return the device  if your just looking for an aesthetic piece it s great for the price  but i wouldn t recommend it for anyone looking for anything close to good playback quality      
361,1.0,                       not even a year old and will not work  used it   weeks ago and it worked  shut it off and unplugged it  now no power  don t waste your money      
362,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          turntable was purchased as a cheap solution in restoring a      truetone stereophic console that was on it s way to the landfill  couldnt be happier with the sound it produces  rca jacks   audio is ran thru a bluetube   w tubed amp which in combination with the turn table produces an authentic vintage vinyl sound  the bluetooth is a nice bonus to the cabinet      
363,1.0,                       i had this sent to my daughter for her birthday  this is what she said i waited all that time for the record player to show up and it doesnt turn on work  also  there is plastic wrapping  garbage  from a jonas brothers record inside the plastic bag with the instruction manual in it  i cant send it back without all the info  there was no packing slip or return label or anything and i would need that stuff plus like am i supposed to pay shipping then i am very dissatisfied since this was a gift for her      
364,4.0,                       i was ecstatic with this player when it came a month ago  sound quality was great  bluetooth worked great  it was a fantastic player for about a month and then all of a sudden it just doesn t work  it won t turn on at all    stars pending customer service and some troubleshooting and see where we get update  victrola customer service was the absolute worst customer service i have ever experienced  ever  thank god amazon customer service is amazing and my issue was just the ac dc cord had gone bad for some reason  still a great player and i m super happy with how amazon handled everything  sooo zero stars for victrola and   for amazon        
365,5.0,                       my husband loves to play his lp records on this player  it reminds him of when he was a kid  the sound quality is good and can t beat the price  we had purchased another brand at first but it broke right away and we had to send it back  glad he got a victrola this time  had it for about a month and doing well so far      
366,1.0,                       i purchased this for a christmas gift   it was given at christmas   used a few times  it is jan     and it already broke stopped working   the lift lower mechanism only lowers the arm about     to      over the record   will not set the needle down on the record    will return  or try   we ll see how amazon steps up     update   amazon did not stand by this product because i bought it in late sept   sue me for doing my christmas shopping early  worst customer service ever  now trying to get replacement thru manufacturer victrola   we ll see if they stand by their product   i purchased   of these with matching cases for my granddaughters and gave as christmas presents  expected them to function for more than a couple of uses        
367,5.0,                       this is an extremely good turntable for beginners who are just getting into vinyl or for someone who isnt quite ready to blow the bank on a full system  this is actually my second victrola  the first one i had for well over two years and never had a single problem  sound quality is good and the prive is awesome      
368,1.0,                        rd day of listening and brand new records are skipping  we are sitting not dancing  and the speed is already starting to fluctuate  hooking it up to a reciever is a bad idea because the cheap components sound even worse amplified not surprising the tiny speakers sound bad  but you can t expect much from something that size so we were hoping hooking up to our home theater would bypass that big christmas disappointment      
369,5.0,                       husband and i have dug out our old vinyl and are enjoying their sound again   this player is compact and easy to store away after enjoying listening through built in speakers      
370,4.0,                       this victrola turntable is a simple  yet usable purchase for both the avid record collector and the casual vinyl listener  the turntable is easy to use  and comes with detailed and understandable directions  it is bluetooth enabled  for the times when you d rather listen to a song thats on your phone or tablet  as the description notes  it is portable   so you can turn it off  snap the top closed  and take it wherever an outlet is  with it s handy handle   this also makes it super convenient for storing  if you don t always have space for a turntable  it would easily fit under most beds  or stashed in the closet  however  do not worry   just because this model is simple  and storable    it still packs the same punch of nostalgia  the sound quality is good  and the table can be turned up loud enough to rock out to your favorite classics  i would recommend this item      
371,5.0,                       i bought this for my wife who has some old albums she wants to play   she was pretty amused that i bought the camo case version but luckily she has a sense of humor   i wasn t expecting a lot from a     turntable but i was very pleasantly surprised   the unit is nicely arranged  the build quality seems excellent and the sound quality and volume is quite good   okay  it s not the boston philharmonic  but it really is quite acceptable   we even played some old christmas lp s on it and were amazed at how well they sounded   money well spent   buy one      
372,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          search the q a for  wobble   and you ll find that many people reported concerns about having tio much wobble  i didn t notice those reviews concerns prior to our chasing  the wobble can contribute to skipping or changes in playback rate   i m guessing some buyers got lucky and have less wobble than mine does      
373,5.0,                       received the product  set it up in    minutes  following directions  only a few  and using audacity software i already had on my computer  was able to take an old album    rpm  recorded it and edited out the noise  and saved as an mp  file   sent that file to another email  account   the playback was great   i need to find a cable to connect from the audio out jacks on the turntable to the computer inputs   i have to play the album out loud and voice capture via my computer s open mic so everyone needs to be quite quiet while i am recording      
374,1.0,                       i was super hyped to get this  i was going to surprise my parents by playing one of their old lps but the original ac adapter did not work  i replaced it and it would turn on  but it does not play anything and the bluetooth doesn t do anything either      
375,1.0,                       horrible tone  sounds tiny  bought two  both have problems  one skips constatntly  the other has off speed sound on certain lps  both very poor speakers with a very tiny sound  i d pay alittle more and shop another turntable      
376,2.0,                       the sound quality on this is terrible  comparable to a     kids amp from the early     s  the needle skips horribly making this product essentially useless  the actually frame of the table that rests inside the casing is made from extremely cheap plastic and will flex with the slightest amount of pressure  they basically threw together the cheapest vinyl player imaginable and jammed it into a cool psychadelic case to sell it for way more than it s worth      
377,1.0,                       this record player does not work  do not buy this  we bought it and opened it up for my daughters birthday and it sounds like the speakers are blow  we spent    dollars on new speakers and it still did not work  bad product      
378,1.0,                       purchased for my    year old daughter for christmas  at first she loved it since it played our old records  but the sound cranked up wasn t loud  and the bluetooth would not connect to play the music louder on our blue tooth speaker  after using only   times it stopped powering on  i purchased   cords and none would work  so disappointing  hoping i can still return it  enough though it was purchased before christmas  it was not opened until after ugh     
379,1.0,                       i haven t had much of a chance to use this since i purchased  today and maybe the  th or  th time over months  when i started the record  the power shut off and i smelled a burn smell  it s coming from inside the machine  though it s not hot  anyway   point is the record player is busted after minimal use  so disappointed  this was a real waste of money      
380,5.0,                       fantastic quality for the price  everything works well  i don t know anything about turntables and my friend wanted one  she doesn t know anything either  so it was a great way to get into it without really having to make to much of an investment  i m going to have to get myself one next      
381,5.0,                       it was a gift for my daughter and that s why i gave her the tie dye one because she has all my albums from back in the tie dye age so i had to bring it together to make her understand my bell bottom jeans day and anyway the album she put on first just worked perfectly so i m so glad i bought this     
382,2.0,                       i had high hopes for this player because the other reviews looked good  maybe the bad ones are buried idk  but this record player was a let down  i tried playing vinyls that were brand new and they skipped soooo much  i couldn t even listen to it  it was horrible  i thought maybe just the vinyls were bad so i put on a vinyl that i ve had for a while and know for a fact is in good condition with no scratches and it did the same thing  avoid    do yourself a favor and just find a record store near you  most of them sell record payers  urban outfitters also sells two brands that i ve found to be pretty good   boytone and crosly  but avoid victrola  don t waste the         
383,3.0,                       this is a christmas gift for my daughter and it was delivered in a victola box showing exactly what was inside  i never check the gift box because my kids don t open my packages  her surprise was ruined because of this  disappointed but i m sure she ll love this turntable  i suppose i m checking the gift box from now on        
384,1.0,                       the sound quality is pretty bad  by bad i mean i will never listen to it which defeats the whole purpose  i was pretty wary about buying it but read that other people hook it up to a different speaker since we have a couple around the house i gave it a go  but  no matter what my boyfriend and i try  we cannot get it to connect to anything else  read the instructions     times  i should have just returned it but didn t want to go through the process  more decoration now than anything      
385,5.0,                       this thing is too cool   it does what it s supposed to do  it plays your records and oozes retro vibes whilst filling the room with sounds of yesterday   i m completely smitten with this simple  lightweight  portable piece of hardware   it takes me back really quickly to a long since passed time in my childhood   it s just really cool and reasonably priced   i m quite looking forward to a picnic now  lol      
386,4.0,                       sound quality was definitely not the best  and the needle kept skipping so much even though all my records were fine  i switched to a new record player and all my older records  which i used on this one  sounded perfectly  so if you re a beginner  please don t buy this  it will scratch your records and will not sound good  please save up for a better record player and do some research         
387,4.0,                       all in all it s okay  you get what you pay for  it s kind of cheap  mine arrived with the needle partially popped off and it won t play records with closely spaced grooves  not sure if these are related  i plan on ordering a better one from the same company  this is the third record player i ve had from them and this is the only one i ve experienced a problem with but it s still good for travel and very compact which helps me a lot at the moment      
388,5.0,                       we wanted a record player for our young son  so we didn t need something with amazing sound quality  just something simple   fun that works  and this fits the bill  the sound quality is mediocre through the small speakers  but the player itself seems to work well  except one of our records with smoother grooves does skip   definitely recommended considering the price point  and our son loves it      
389,5.0,                       if you are looking for retro this record player is it  right out of the box i plugged this in with my daughter and was very disappointed when i saw the speaker plug in the back thinking this was the only way to hear sound  low and behold this is just an additional way  the sound reminds me of records playing back in the day  this is a great affordable piece of nostalgia and i do not regret this purchase  one additional this is it comes with the adapter for the    s with the wide hole  enjoy      
390,1.0,                       this bluetooth turntable looks nice   and that s about it   mine worked once and then stopped   and it specifically stopped working just when i needed it to work victrola customer service suggested the following  go out and buy a new needle  add a counterweight to the arm  try to balance another way amazon support suggested bringing it in for repairs second time i went to use it  turntable would rotate    degrees  stop  rotate another    degrees  and then stop    power light would go on and off   no sound whatsoever you get what you pay for      
391,1.0,                       we were really excited about this record player but didn t get a chance to use it until recently since we didn t have a place for it  bought it as a christmas gift   the first time we used it  it worked great  we went out and bought a bunch of records  the second time we used it  the sound was completely off  the mechanism that moves the arm does not adjust  despite adjusting the speed settings  we still get too fast or too slow  it s  useless now  and the return window has closed  super disappointed      
392,4.0,                       this is a great record player  except i ended up having to tape a nickel onto the stylus to add weight and keep it from skipping  before i did that it would skip constantly and made it painful to hear my favorite songs so butchered  but after adding the nickel  i haven t had any skipping issues  so yeah  it just needs a little love    cents and tape     
393,3.0,                       ordered for a christmas gift  wanted to check the sound quality  sound quality was okay  loud was not that loud for a regular speaker  order arrived on time  everything was good about the order it was just the product itself that i found did not work for the price  i d suggest buying from a different seller if looking for something with more quality  could have just been my product with the sound deficit   the price may be higher  but it is worth it      
394,5.0,                       plays vintage vinyl well  has an additional needle  great if you are an intermittent listener of records  very well made and good sound for the money      
395,4.0,                       it s been fun to have the victrola to play old records that we had in the house pros it s easy to use and understand it s fun to use cons the sound quality is not great the bluetooth connectivity is to play music from your cellphone through the victrola  and not to pair it with a better sounding speaker i had to connect it with an aux cord to a speaker using the headphones jack to have better quality  for some reason  a little sounding music still comes out from the victrola when connected to the aux cord  but nothing that affects the overall sound i would recommend it if you are not looking for the best quality  but more to have some fun and rediscover old records      
396,5.0,                       i purchased this for my little brother s birthday  he is     has autism  and loves records  i am pretty sure this stopped the show for him  it was very easy for him to use  we didn t even need to look at the instructions  he takes it all over the house  the only down side is that it still has to be plugged in somewhere  however  as long as there is an outlet  there is music      
397,1.0,                       i ll start by saying i saw a review about this same problem  but thought  what are the odds it happens to me  most reviews are good   but on literally my first use of the record player  smoke started pouring out along with this terrible electric urning smell  i naturally unplugged it  and hoped it was just a fluke  when i went to try a second time  the record player stopped turning on altogether  can t even begin to express my disappointment  i didn t even get one use out of this piece of crap  do yourself a favor and don t waste your time or money on this junk  and also how is victrola even allowed to continue selling these at this point    this is a major fire waiting to happen      
398,2.0,                       i had hoped this would be a nice addition to my art studio so that i could play my old vinyl records while painting  sadly  i have to agree with those who have said the sound quality is poor  there is no way to adjust for treble and bass and it just sounds tinny  very disappointed      
399,5.0,                       i just wish the bluetooth would let you listen to the player via bluetooth headphones   instead  you can send your music to this player  which doesn t have the greatest speakers for this       
400,5.0,                       the turntable is light weight and super user friendly  just plug it in and enjoy  the the built in speakers are good for your older records  my little portable speaker plugs right into the headphone jack if i want to listen to something bass heavy  multiple options for audio if you have a sound system  the case is thick and it s packaged well  comes with an extra needle and a    adapter  love love love this turntable  and it s a really good price      
401,4.0,                       i couldn t find a belt for my old record player so i bought this instead   i m so happy with it   i finally get to listen to my records again   it s volume is quite impressive for smaller record player   it didn t come with a power adapter but i had one lying around my house that worked perfectly   the bluetooth works well but i personally like the sound of the record player much better   the bluetooth makes it sound too perfect where i like the feel of the record player old school sounds      
402,3.0,                       disappointed this came in original package only   no extra box or protection    box came damaged with a hole in the side   son had volume issues when playing his new vinyls after opening for xmas   bluetooth volume worked fine so speakers are good   hopeful replacement is sent more protected and we have better luck as original reviewers shared        
403,2.0,                       the only pro about this record player is that is highly portable  most everything about it is terrible  sounded very thin through the speakers themselves  so i hooked up the rca to my bose system  this thing takes out every bit of low end  there is literally no bass  and the thing sounds like its coming through tweeters  i will be returning this item  in hopes of something more true to the music      
404,4.0,                       i ve read other reviews saying their turntables die over time  for now it s really great  it plays as its supposed to  the speakers aren t amazing but honestly as long as i can listen to it i really dont care  as for portability it would be portable if it could be used without being plugged in but its more portable than a turntable with the entire setup so i guess theres that i ll update in a week then a month to see if it s still working as well        
405,1.0,                        i cant find a plus for this item  bad quality  bad package  bad sound quality and bad customer service it stopped working after   days  and maybe it should be a toy instead of a electronic product definitely return       
406,5.0,                       i bought this as a present and they absolutely love it  it looks great and works great  they loved the diversity of playing vinyl and using it as a bluetooth speaker  as for the sellers  amazing and very responsive  we had an issue with the  st one and they took care of it and sent us a replacement right away  we thank you for caring about your customers      
407,1.0,                       ordered from the amazon warehouse  gave to my husband for christmas so he could play his late father s records  we were so excited to use it but to our disappointment there was no wire in the box to plug it in  now we have to order the wire separately update  i ordered the correct wire and the record player does not work at all  i do not recommend at all      
408,5.0,                       i bought this for our   year old granddaughter  she absolutely loves it   she changes the records and dances around singing all the time at her home   she is so excited to share her musics with everyone   her little brother is       and he loves to come into  her room and dance around with her while she sings and played her albums   her favorite album is mamma mia soundtrack from the movie      
409,1.0,                       it s obviously cheap  so there s no question that it s not going to produce top notch sound  but the sound is terrible  even with external speakers hooked up to it  so if you re at all interested in quality sound  steer clear from this thing it does look kinda cool and trendy when there s a record on it  but because of the heavy arm on the player due to cheap parts  it ll do more damage to your vinyl and cause more distortion  so either use it with records you don t give a damn about or put your microwave plate on this instead and let that spin if you just want something to display in a room as a decoration piece  this is perfect      
410,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i recently destroyed an older portable phonograph during a move and purchased this as a replacement  i tested out the bluetooth connection and it worked without a hitch  the built in speakers are loud without much bass  the arm is so light it skips quite a bit but i solved it with a very small and light glass figurine  a nickel also works      
411,1.0,                       as some of the reviews mentioned  the quality is not great  the record will skip and sound warped  i had to exchange for a different player and having the same exact issue with this one too  disappointing  because i ve purchased victorella record players in the past and they worked great  something about this model is just off  so be careful      
412,4.0,                       good quality overall  ok sound from the built in speakers  they do well for what they are  headphone quality was great with both my open ear headphones and ear buds  have only had it for a week  but it has not had any issues the one con i would say is  the wrap on the unit looks and feels like duct tape  it s cute  but kinda felt like it was a teenager s record player that their parent gave away when they found an alice cooper vinyl in their pat boone holder      
413,1.0,                       this product is advertised as a bluetooth record player  the obvious implication of that is a record player that can play through bluetooth  there s not what this product is  it is not a bluetooth record player at all  it is a record player that also happens to have a bluetooth speaker  this is incredibly misleading to the point where you can reasonably say it s false advertising  and if i knew this was going to be how it functioned  i would not have bought this product  i will be reporting this to amazon      
414,2.0,                       phone quality speakers and cannot play an entire record without needle skipping  my first disappointing  amazon choice  purchase  i should have known better for the price point  but for some reason amazon is backing this low tier item  spend the extra money and get a better machine      
415,5.0,                       i love this so much  i asked for it for christmas and was so happy to see that i got it  it plays my harry styles record beautifully  the sound quality is very sharp and smooth and it s also easy to connect to bluetooth  making it sound way better than just using your cell phone s speaker  the set up  fyi  is much easier than i thought it would be  it s also a beautiful color  i love it so much  now i just need to buy some records     
416,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          originally gave it a   star bc i thought it didn t come with the power chord and no one from customer service had gotten back to me  now i m back  we found the power chord and thought everything would be fine but no  it  doesn t  work  i m so annoyed and upset that i wasted my money on this      
417,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          the record player is as described and it is extremely portable  if i weren t able to hook up speakers to it i would be sending it back  imagine your phone speaker but being able to turn it up louder that is the sound quality  i can t complain because it did not advertise robust sound however i will be connecting better speakers to it  other than that it does everything it s advertise to do and for that i can t complain  it s    bucks      
418,4.0,                       it gets way too  static y  when you turn the volume past the half point  it s a great and fantastic vinyl record player  i ve had a couple in the past and this one is the best  the first was a victrola vinly to cd player converter  that was too large and bulky to set anywhere  so i gave to my grandma  second one was a cosby and it was a hunk of plastic crap  but this one  this one is a show stealer  with its bright and vibrant colors  and it s retro style look with its brief case  well  case  it s makes its mark as center piece in my room  allows me to play music i could very well play on google or spotify  but it s gives me pleasure to hear so clearly and beautifully on this machine  fantastic product  victrola never ceases to amaze me      
419,1.0,                       purchased for my daughter  the first one worked great but stopped spinning after one week  i purchased another while that was being replaced  that one never worked  not even out of the box  hopefully the replacement works since she s got a large vinyl collection now but a huge disappointment regardless  just put a few extra dollars towards one that works      
420,5.0,                       i gave this to my   yo dad for christmas   and he loves it  he s been listening to records he hasn t heard in almost    years  i m not sure about the sound quality as he immediately figured out how to hook them up to a bose speaker his girlfriend gave him via the aux port      
421,4.0,                       this record player is a lot of fun   i love the color and it s a great size for my living room bookshelf   i like that i m able to play a variety of record speeds and it s very user friendly    thankfully  because it s my first record player   the bluetooth connection took some time initially  but it works well   the only drawback is i wish it had a bit more bass in the speakers   for older records and classical music  it s fine  but for music where i m expecting a bit more of a punch  i find it lacking   otherwise  it s been a great purchase      
422,1.0,                       i purchased this item for my grandchildren along with some nostalgic records i had when i was a child  when i played the    rpm record  the player stopped     of the way through the record  i tried over and over to play the record  same result  the record was not damaged  support was unable to help me so i returned the player as defective      
423,2.0,                       i bought this as a gift for myself  i waited until i bought a record stand to set it up the sound wasn t that loud  so that was a little frustrating  after listening closely  i realized that the right side speaker doesn t even work  i spent a lot of time trying to find a record player that had a good brand name  okay sound quality and was of a light blue color  so this was very disappointing to me   this was also after shipping issues  it was sent to the wrong address  i went to the address the postal carrier dropped it off to and it wasn t there  i had to call and request for another to be sent  only to have someone bring it to me because my address was on it  i canceled the new one being shipped  so after shipping issues and then product issues  i don t think i ll be buying electronics from amazon again      
424,5.0,                       don t waste your money on high end record player this is amazing   great sound easy to hook up   i bough a     dollars record player and it was so painful to put together then hooked it up to speakers  and amp on high volume it was like being at my grandma house no sound     had to return   i bought this one no complaints       
425,5.0,                       this was a gift for our granddaughter and she is quite happy with it  all works as described and it has performed flawlessly thus far   would highly reccomend it to whoever is thinking about a portableplayer as this  there is a real movement back to vinyl lp format so don t wait  this is a very economical way to help your friend or family member to step back in time and forward to to the future again      
426,1.0,                       we got this for my daughter for her birthday and it skipped all over the place on all records played   and these were albums that play just fine on my turntable  different manufacturer   after contacting the manufacturer for advice we ended up returning this piece of junk  it s very poorly made   cheap  light plastics throughout  it looks nice  but isn t worth it      
427,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          where can i start  i m honestly in love with this thing  i bought a few records with it m and immediately set it up when it got here  it s lightweight  portable  great construction  great sound quality  and very easy to set up  i would definitely recommend to anyone starting out with record players     
428,5.0,                       love the look of it both open and closed   i got a separate speaker and connected directly because i wasn t sure how to get the bluetooth working with existing speakers i had   the built in speakers work well but you don t get a lot of volume   it sounds great on my speaker and i have a vintage look in the room   its an excellent purchase for those new to vinyl      
429,1.0,                       as soon as i took it out of the box  i loved the white and rose gold color  i knew it wasn t the most expensive record player but i expected it to work  the record wobbles   i was told this is common with free standing floating   but the needle just skips across the whole record  i then bought a cork underlay non skip mat  still wobbly  still won t play the record  i m at a loss      
430,1.0,                       do not buy it  i ve never purchased my own record player and based my choice from the overwhelmingly good reviews  that was my big mistake  this item is a low quality product that will ruin your records  at first i thought the product was just defective but after i did some research i found it was cheap   poorly made  save your money and buy a more reputable brand      
431,1.0,                       broke after   week   stopped suddenly  distorted sound turn on the turntable and no sound came from it even i turn it up to full volume  i tried another new adaptor but it was still not working  they sent another one but the  nd one was also broken after a few week s uses    plan to buy another brand      
432,4.0,                       i like the looks of the player  easy to carry  the sound is lacking  not very loud but it is good enough for my husband to sit in the same room and hear it  i gave it four stars for sound quality  we like it because it serves its purpose for us without investing a lot of money      
433,1.0,                       i gave this to my daughter over a year ago and at my request she finally opened it up  we plug it in and put a       record on  the turntable does not go a the correct speed  too late to return so i called the manufacturer s customer service  they told me to enter my phone number and they would call back   never heard from them      
434,1.0,                       i m so annoyed because i literally bought this and had to get a return for another one because it wouldn t even turn on  then my replacement came and the table is warped so it skips and jumps the whole time  what a hassle      
435,2.0,                       while the record player worked  it was great  bought this for my daughter as a christmas gift and it worked great and had great sound until   months later it just quit powering on  with the craziness or quarantining and everything i am just now reaching out to victrola for a replacement since it s still under the one year manufacturers warranty  fingers crossed but i m not hopeful after reading other reviewers comments stating it the worst customer service ever   i will update my review as it changes      
436,5.0,                       i ordered this to play my old vinyls and bought some new  qualified for free shipping and it came in two days  the tye dye color is absolutely stunning  i m plying new lps and old  no skipping  the sound is incredible  i thought i would use bluetooth speakers but do not need it  this is perfect  compact  easy to set up  comes with a    adapter  it s programmed to stop at the end of the record  i have a small apt and can hear it in all rooms  and it s barely turned up  highly recommend  also you can connect your iphone or ipad to it to listen to music via bluetooth  it comes with an extra needle  i just love it      
437,1.0,                       item would power up  but turntable would not turn   i bought it early and as a result  missed the return window   ugh  what a disappointment   box was pretty beat up upon arrival too   i ended up going to best buy to purchase one on my friend s actual birthday after she was gifted several records that she could not play     once i opened the new one  i realized that the one i bought from amazon was likely a return as many smaller protective components were gone  cover on needle  paper over the turntable  etc      
438,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i have another record player and it s nothing compared to this one i m very happy with my purchased also for you flocks that love to read while listening to music   the sound is one point with a nice relaxing sound not over powering like some record players can be  enjoy and become a happy customer like me     
439,4.0,                       i bought this record player for the portability factor and the brand  it s overall a nice little record player  the original needle had a defect and caused poor sound quality  switched it out with the spare one it came with and it seems ok now  the speakers are by no means high quality  do not expect great sound like you do with a radio or car system  but they do sound ok for enjoying a record and that s all you have  what is disappointing is when you hook up external speakers you can still hear sound out of the record player speakers  but overall it s not too bad for the price      
440,4.0,                       the record player works great for it s intended purpose  however the speakers are absolute junk  unfortunately  it doesn t broadcast to bluetooth speakers  so i was forced to plug in some marginally better computer speakers  i don t know why you d ever use bluetooth to broadcast to this device considering how horrible the speakers are  might as well left the bluetooth function off since you can t use it with bluetooth speakers      
441,5.0,                       i am happy with the functionality of this product   take advantage of the built in bluetooth setting just as often as i use it to play my vinyl  the sound quality lessens a great deal once you turn the volume to greater than      it is disappointing not to be able to enjoy the pleasantness of joni mitchell s high notes   bob dylan on the harmonica  but i suppose it will work well with other musicians   i guess i would suggest purchasing your own speakers if you are going to buy this product overall very cute and aesthetically pleasing  everything else is marginal      
442,1.0,                       we purchased this product over a year ago and never used it due to not having any records for it  so when we just recently purchased a record we were so excited to finally try it out only to find no cord with it and when we did purchase a replacement cord  that was for this specific product with matched watt  it wouldn t even turn on  because we waited so long to use it all the support told us they can t do anything for us  i loved the initial look of this but i really wouldn t recommend purchasing  there s no reason a brand new product that was never used shouldn t have worked      
443,4.0,                       the bluetooth connection is purely for connecting to their low grade speakers coming out of the case  you would think that the bluetooth would connect to something else but as far as i can tell it only receives bluetooth   not transmits  but for being a cheap record player it does the job   i had to tape a quarter to the headshell though       
444,4.0,                       we loved the product over all we just had an issue that we received the wrong color  no biggie right   i contacted amazon so they can replace it with the right color and we sent that one back  in a few days we received the new one still in red   my daughter wanted grey  she ended up just keeping it because she had been wanting one for a long time and didn t want to wait any longer  other than that we loved the player  it s awesome and works great       
445,1.0,                       it wasn t working right from the beginning  when the turn table finally turned for more than a few minutes  it started smoking and died completely  in a panic  my husband grabbed it before if caught fire and threw it out the door  never returned because it was horribly damaged and my husband threw it away      
446,1.0,                       i bought this maybe   months ago and just opened it now  my bad however the vinyl or the holder the vinyl sits on is wobbly so the vinyl is not playing properly  it just sounds like a broken radio station with everyone tuning in will continue to test  if the next vinyl i try sounds like this and wobbles as much  will have to keep   star and try a different player      
447,3.0,                       this is the first record player i have bought  my boyfriend had a bunch of vinyls with the plan to sell them so i got this to test them out  make sure they played  it worked really well in my opinion but only for about   weeks  it stopped turning on randomly one day  i could turn the power knob and hear it click like it was trying to turn on but nothing else would happen  i read in the reviews that the power adapter could be replaced to possibly fix that problem but that didn t work for me  a new adapter didn t make any difference  this review has three stars because like i said  it did work well for a little while  it s nothing fancy  but i do wish it had lasted longer      
448,1.0,                       i bought this for our new apartment since i have always wanted a record player  i plugged it in once and it worked just fine  the next day i tried to turn it on and it would not turn on or work at all  i tried plugging it into multiple outlets but it still did not work  i ended up ordering a replacement  v ac adapter and it still would not turn on  it seems i have received a defective player  i am currently in the process of returning it      
449,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          well    it doesn t work  hopefully the return goes smoothly  i bought this for my in laws for christmas so this is disappointing  spent about    minutes trying to get it to do anything and finally it just did what s in the video      
450,2.0,                       i literally just received my package with this item in  it i immediately set it up  all i needed to listen to was one song and i then took it apart and repackaged it because it s going back  the sound quality on this thing is no better than a tiny bluetooth speaker that you can get at five below or something  very disappointing  but it was very cute      
451,5.0,                       i ve had several record players over the years with varying price tags  this being the cheapest of them all  and while many may think less price equals less quality this is certainly not the case with this product  this is a high quality three speed record player with built in speakers  very convenient  and the bluetooth compatibility is a huge plus  all of the color options are very cute and i love how compact it is      
452,4.0,                       this is a great option for a suitcase player  i m generally very happy with this purchase   it s a good affordable starter record player for people just getting into vinyl  my only issue was that the needle was broken  not just displaced  when it arrived  so glad i t comes with a spare so i was able to change it  i just wish i could have saved the spare needle for when the first one wears out     
453,1.0,                       ordered one style of turntable   but received a completely different one in the mail was expecting the all red turntable but instead opened the box and found an american flag turntable  really doesn t make sense  this package also arrived in a damaged victrola box      
454,4.0,                       the price was cheap and it doesn t require much space is why i like it  the sound is poor  but i only purchased it to occasionally play old records after my better victrola died  it is ok  but i would purchase better if i had realized the sound quality      
455,5.0,                       this record player is awesome and has a classic sound  it is great for playing old records i have some old records from the     s   inch    rpm it makes them sound great  as for the volume i have hearing issues and have no problem hearing this player throughout the house  possibly one of the best audio buys i have made in a while  for what it is  don t expect extra high quality sound just nice mellow analog sound and you are set  great for some ambiance   background sound while doing work around the house or just relaxing     
456,1.0,                       the victrola arrived with no damages  however  the sound on the actual record player did not work  it was very muffled  only coming out of one speaker  barely  and didn t change in volume regardless of what level the volume was set  everything was plugged in correctly  sent it back immediately for replacement  hoping the next one works  but my first impression was terrible   look elsewhere for a higher quality record player      
457,1.0,                       it sounded like a good deal  but it didn t end up that way   no trauma or damage occurred and yet the turntable  integral part  no longer moves after a month       
458,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          what to do with your parents  classic albums that you heard over and over when you were a kid    play them    this record player is inexpensive  stylish  and very retro cool  it blends perfectly with our recently renovated mid century home  the turquoise color is fabulously nostalgic  sounds great for the price      
459,5.0,                       this record player is adorable  it looks amazing with my room  it s really intuitive  and i get compliments on it  thank you      
460,1.0,                       i bought this as a gift for my husbands birthday  i purchased in june and his birthday is sept          we took out of box  set up according to instructions  the bluetooth hooks up   but turn table will not more  if we turn knob back to phono no bluetooth   have tried several time with several different blue tooth compatible equipment  all works  its just not allowing the turn table to work while in bluetooth mode and no bluetooth is we turn back to phono mod   i know i am past my return date but would like to as anyway for a refund       
461,5.0,                       my    year old recently discovered a record player with broken speakers in my parent s basement   while i wasn t convinced he would love lps long term  i was tired of watching him intently listen with his ear to the needle of my parents record player   i bought him this record player and he can t get enough of it   it has decent sound and he really enjoys using it as a bluetooth speaker when he wants to switch to his digital music      
462,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          worst christmas gift ever  easy to set up but the sound quality is horrible  the needle would jump all over the place even using a brand new record  returning right away and buying and audio technica brand instead      
463,5.0,                       i purchased this for my grandchildren         yrs  old    i kept their mom s records from her childhood for them to play   they absolutely love it   i had it as a surprise when they came to visit and they did take it home with them   i was just there for a visit and my grandson was playing with it and enjoying it      
464,1.0,                       do not waste your money on this record player  sound is terrible  i am two days too late to return this  darn it  i thought i could route it through an external speaker and had to wait for cord to arrive    not only did cord not work but now i missed my opportunity to return this poor excuse of a record player     
465,5.0,                       plays well   the telescopic arm was great when we got it but for some reason we have to move the arm to the record now   i am not for sure if it is us or the record player   it is still a   because it did not cost much and it plays very well      
466,1.0,                       the plastic plate was broken and the needle moved in all directions this sound was horrible and it seemed like the internal part of the record player was either poorly manufactured or broken     
467,4.0,                          update    i was able to contact the manufacturer via amazon  they were helpful suggesting the cord might be bad  they wasted no time sending me a new one and it works just fine  i still only did   stars because i m still mystified why you would want to run bluetooth into the record player as opposed to out of it  i am happy and it is good for a kids record player original review  stopped working after    days with no abuse to the player in the least bit  of course it was outside the return window so now i m stuck with poop  it also has a bluetooth but you would think that it would be so you could connect to a better speaker  it s actually the opposite  you can connect your phone and whatnot via bluetooth to play through the speakers  why on earth anyone would want to use these speakers other than for the record player itself i ll never understand  the speakers suck and not much better than your phone speaker  find a better player and spend a little more if you have to      
468,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          it s almost a little difficult to hear in the video  but the sound quality on this turntable is absolutely horrendous  my brand new vinyl records sound lower than i usually hear them and distorted  i m so disappointed  as i ve wanted one of these for some time      
469,1.0,                       very disappointed as this was a christmas gift  the durability is poor  two of the metal corner covers on the outside come off upon opening and taking the player out of the box   an expensive item to purchase only to receive defective and poor quality      
470,5.0,                       i bought this to replace a dud i d bought locally  this one works great  it s sturdy and the design colors pop  it doesn t look drab and washed out  we bought it for our daughter  and she flipped when she saw the design  also  it doesn t feel rickety when you move it around  everything just feels so solid and well built      
471,5.0,                       wow  i am impressed  for the price this is a great record player  i seldom write reviews  but i made this an exception because of the  fit and finish  and quality of the sound for the price  i have only used it for a few days  so at this time i can t really speak to the quality  but by what i can evaluate  it is a quality item  now the fidelity and base would not compare to a         system i have heard     but for the price  it is equivalent to some much more expensive systems seldom do i recommend products  but at this point in time  this item is an exception  i have not yet tried the bluetooth connectivity  thanks victrola vintage for a well done product ps i did buy the service agreement      
472,2.0,                       horrible sound quality  my    year old record player and needle are better which i was trying to replace  i heard the motor through the speakers of the stereo i plugged it into  don t recommend unless you re trying to mimic old tinny radio sound  didn t even try the blue tooth cuz  who cares if the record player sucks      
473,1.0,                       the player constantly skipped  no matter which record was playing   tried several brand new records  and a different needle   they all skipped   also  i found out that the needles these inexpensive players use ruin your record albums      
474,1.0,                       can t handle any record pretty much without skipping  staticy sound  or just terrible audio quality  don t waste your money      
475,5.0,                       i was hoping to sink this with an external bluetooth speaker to augment the sound quality  instead it can act as an external bluetooth speaker which is odd because i wanted to use it to play records  which it does fine  although it can skip  just like the old days      
476,5.0,                       not really sure about sound quality   plugged it in  turned it on  put a record on     seconds later it started smoking and sparks were coming out from under the record  thankfully my son is a firefighter and was able to quickly shut the lid  get it unplugged and out of the house before the fire spread      
477,3.0,                       returned for refund i gave this as a gift  i was embarrassed when i heard how poor the sound quality was  figured it would improve witha bluetooth connected speaker  could not get it to synch with any of three speakers  to their credit  the seller refundedmy purchase amount quickly  i do not understand how this has so many positive reviews      
478,4.0,                       i have an extensive vinyl collection from my teenage years that i wanted to dispose of and my husband insisted i get this turntable so he could listen to them   i am not crazy about the sound quality but he likes it so mission accomplished     
479,5.0,                       this is a really nice record player  the sound quality is what it is for the size of the speakers so don t expect hi fi sound  however  there are a stereo pair rca phono jacks output on the back of the player that you can connected to an external sound system for much better quality sound  you can also use the player as a bluetooth pass thru  it s a very nice looking player that comes with a spare needle good for    hours according to the documentation  unfortunately we decided to return it because my son thinks dealing with records is too much hassle      
480,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          shipped super fast  like in less than    hours  beautiful color  so far i played   different records and they played well  no skipping or issues   sound is ok i will try it with different speakers  so far so good for me  i will keep you posted      
481,5.0,                       i got the british design one   my husband was soo shocked and excited when i gave this to him for christmas   he loves it  i love it   easy to use   sound quality   noise level is great for any size record and better than expected   he loves the look of it     
482,1.0,                       this record player is affordable and if you just want it for decor it s great but if you try to listen to anything on this record player you will be very disappointed  very poor sound quality on mine  get the higher priced item and do yourself a favor      
483,5.0,                       this is my very first record player ever and think it s really good  the build quality is very solid and it actually sounds pretty good  the only complaint i have about the sound is i wish it got a bit louder but other than that the sound is very clear      
484,4.0,                       i bought this as a christmas present for my mom to play her old beatles albums on  it was easy to set up and she was playing records instantly the sound isn t perfect but you can connect it to a better sounding bluetooth speaker for optimum quality  i expected as much from this so i purchased a speaker to go along with the record player overall i am satisfied with this product  it does what it says it s going to do      
485,5.0,                       this is an awesome little portable turntable   my husband and i literally threw away dozens of vinyl albums in the     s and have started to replenish with a few classics   i would say if you re a very serious vinyl collector then you should go with something a bit more  hardy    but for the money and occasional use it is just perfect  cute color   too      
486,3.0,                       ordered the american flag design and received the dark red design  i could return it it but it s not worth the hassle and i don t care that much about the color  other than that it is exactly what i expect  it s a great product for the price      
487,1.0,                       i do not know what the issue is with this world map design album player  but i have two other designs that work perfectly unlike this one  the upsetting part is this is a christmas present my granddaughter picked out because it matching her bedroom  but i refuse to go thru this again for the fourth time to have to return it also      
488,1.0,                       purchased for granddaughter end of july   played old vinyl great   just purchased new vinyl for christmas and it will not play without skipping   company advised it s not made to play new vinyl grade albums and to try to switch out needles  still skips  it doesn t state that exception on site  description on amazon  or in manual      day warranty up now   bought second one for my other granddaughter for christmas   returned it because it skipped   replacement received   it skips too   guess it s going back unless someone has any suggestions to get this to work       
489,5.0,                       i bought this for my grandfather because he has a old collection of records but he did not own a record player  he adored this gift  he uses it several times a week and has recently purchased a victrola record case to match the record player      
490,5.0,                       my first vinyl player and i love it  there was a piece that had been dislodged during shipping so the vinyls would not spin  a plastic piece to the circle part next to the turn table  but i got it and put it back and it works great      
491,2.0,                       for the first few uses it works great   but then it breaks  you don t even have to do anything for it to break  one day you just try to use it and it doesn t work  i ve been building my collection and i was using it regularly and when i tried to play a new record  it wouldn t work  this is the third time it s happened in less than a year  you d be better off not buying this at all      
492,5.0,                       i ve been wanting a record player for a long time  had a great time listening to all the new and old records handed down to me from my family and sharing that experience with my   year old son   the sound quality is what you would expect out of the tiny speakers  but i had no problems hooking it up through my surround sound  very pleased with this purchase      
493,5.0,                       for this price the number of functions you get the sound quality cant be matched  victrola blows crosley out of the water on build and sound quality  probably every other tiny table maker as well  yes   star sound  because its not an audiophile system  hut for what youre buying it is   star sound for sure  you can actually dance to the bass from these tiny speakers  and it tracks better as well  just bought   more as gifts      
494,1.0,                       made in china  cheap junk  played three records and then  the speed got stuck  that is  no matter what speed i changed it to  it spun on the    speed  tried everything  followed the manual  forget it  don t waste your time or money      
495,5.0,                       great product  i love the vintage modern style and it plays my aged and new vinyl records very well  if your looking for a quality record player to get you started in listening to vinyl i highly recommend this product      
496,3.0,                       highly dissatisfied  the bluetooth connectivity has been nothing but staticy and it constantly disconnects from my phone through the day  i was originally looking forward to this as i ve been working from home and love listening to music all day  during the day i use the bluetooth to play music while being at my desk all day long  didn t have many issues the first few days but a now the bluetooth is no longer working  i waited   weeks for this to ship and this is what i get      
497,5.0,                       i bought this for my daughter for christmas so that she could listen to her grandparents old lp s and she loves it      
498,2.0,                       the portability of this record player is great  it s also really cute but those   pros are out weighted by the fact that this is a cheaply made product  all of the vinyls are played on it skipped like crazy  some even got stuck  the lift needle broke after the second use so this is basically useless and i had to return it      
499,3.0,                       this thing would be the  pop  crackle and skip  of turntable cereals  i ordered despite the reviews hoping id be one of the lucky folks to get one that functions well  and at best i got something half decent  it pops  crackles and skips like nobody s business  it s definitely a  you get what you pay for  situation  but i suppose it does fine as an introduction to turntables  if you re ignorant to this sort of thing  at the very least now i know what to look for in reviews  wouldn t recommend this one  although it s got some fine portability to it  it s quite small and very light  definitely not a pain to carry around at all  downside is that it needs a powerplug to work  so you re kind of limited where you can set it up  overall it s   decent for the price  so if you re looking for something to just get you into the scene without having to shart out big dollars  this would be the one      
500,5.0,                       this record player is amazing  it s super cute and it s played all my records without problems  the sound quality is obviously not the absolute best  but it s not horrible by any means  i ve had this for about three weeks now and i love it and use it every day      
501,1.0,                       i bought this unit because i figured i just needed a turntable again  after my previous one broke  other than there being poor sound quality with the built in speakers  the arm of the player does not add enough pressure  causing it to skip during every song multiple times  i could add a penny through the old hack but i don t want to gouge my records  overall  i would not suggest this unit  spring for something more quality      
502,3.0,                       i would have given this   stars if it hadn t been in pieces right out of the box  it looked great  but it would not work  and i couldn t figure out why  finally my brother unscrewed the cover and found that nothing was connected inside  all the little wires and plugs were just hanging there  he s very smart and was able to put it all together and now it works great  but without him i would have ended up sending it back      
503,5.0,                       i got this for my mom for christmas a year or so back and she loves it  she uses it almost every day and she was so happy that she gets to listen to her old records again  the only complaints she s had is that the max volume isn t super loud and it could use some more bass  but overall it s a great gift to give      
504,1.0,                       got it for christmas but didn t have a record to use it   orders some records to try it out and the speed it off   really disappointed   too late to return it      
505,4.0,                       bought this for my son who decided he might like to get into vinyl  so i got him this simple record player with bluetooth  remember this is a simple player  sound quality a little tinny  this is not a stereo phonic player so it is great  for what it is  perfect price for someonestarting out   hint  if the needle slides over the surface of a record but does not play  tape a nickel on the head  it adds enough weight to the arm to play but does not drag      
506,2.0,                       i was really disappointed with it  it was super cute  but when it came time to actually play my records  the sound was super distorted  i tried   different records and each one sounded weird  i didn t have high expectations considering the price  but i at least wanted to hear the music the way it was supposed to be      
507,2.0,                       received one as a gift and the player wobbled during playback  thought it was just damaged in shipping so we tried again  the second unit was better but still has a lot of wobble  caused skipping on brand new records as a cute toy player sure  but that s all i can say  save your money and get something else      
508,5.0,                       this is a really nice  good beginner record player  great packaging and everything works well  the speakers are a little bit tinny  but they still have a nice loud sound  i love how when you put the needle over the record  it automatically spins  neat feature  comes with an extra needle  always helpful  and the bluetooth feature works amazing and fast      
509,1.0,                       it will not power on  not sure if the power cord is defective or the record player itself but no power right out of the box      
510,5.0,                       this was a christmas grift and it has been well used for the last two months  the sound quality is awesome  i was a little nervous after reading some negative reviews  but it has worked wonderfully for us  it is used on a daily basis and we haven t seen any issues with it  it was a great purchase  now we just need more records      
511,5.0,                       for an entry level turntable  this one is just peachy  i use mine semi regularly  and haven t encountered any problems with the needle or the motor or anything  if you aren t super serious about sound quality  then you most likely won t mind the sound quality  it s  well  it s just ok the added functionality of the bluetooth and auxiliary capabilities are definitely an added bonus  it s an easy to use  low maintenance player that also adds to the look of any room      
512,1.0,                       won t play well on any portion of the record that hangs over the edge of the table  the whole side with the arm pushes down a good      easily with the slightest pressure  horrible quality  the bluetooth is the only part that actually works well      
513,5.0,                       this is awesome  i bought to play some old records that were recently returned to me  after     years  and wow  i am impressed  this is    x better than the record player i had as a kid  the sound is great  too  my kids couldn t believe i used to spend hours and hours listening to and changing records  would recommend to anyone who loves records      
514,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          sounds is ok good for starter   the head better had a guide pin for slide into start track      
515,1.0,                       the first one i received didn t work never turned on  no light  no sound  the replacement i received didn t have a power chord  and then when i got one  it didn t work either  i ve made two trips to ups to drop off defective record players and i still have no way to listen to my vinyl      
516,5.0,                       this is the perfect starter system for someone interested in playing their record collection i purchased this for my    year old son who s obsessed with all things vintage  it was super easy to teach him how to use it and required little set up  he loves the portable  sleek design as well as the fact he can use an additional speaker for more sound since the system is not loud enough in his opinion  the easy open and close suitcase design is the cherry on top we would definitely purchase again      
517,5.0,                       nice product  daughter absolutely loved it  sound quality is good  convenience of bluetooth capacity and would highly recommend     
518,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          as seen in video   this record player makes all the records appear warped while playing  the turn table is very uneven  so much that the arm is actually moving up and down a ton while playing  i ve tried it on about    brand new records  out of the packaging  and they all do this  the records themselves are not warped at all  it looks terrible and i worry about it actually warping my records  very disappointed  no evident damage in shipping   it was packaged well  just poor quality  maybe i got a bad egg  now it s too late to return it though amazon because i ve been trying to fix the problem myself and cannot     
519,5.0,                       this neat little turntable has everything you need  except a spare needle  and nothing you don t  the stock speakers sound surprisingly good  bought it as an x mas present and have used it probably     hrs since then with no problems  would recommend      
520,3.0,                       i bought this for my   year old so i m not that picky  i wanted something portable  purple with good sound  so far that s been met  however the turntable makes a scraping sound with every revolution  it doesn t sound like it s hurting anything  like it s coming from underneath  not from the record  i don t think my kid would notice with the music playing and i don t want to go through the trouble of returning  but still  for     it shouldn t have a strange noise      
521,1.0,                       the record player doesn t include a dac worth its weight  so it s practically useless if you re going to hook it into external speakers  i returned the product and purchased an audio technica model instead  which is significantly better  the only use case i can see for this is if you really need a portable player      
522,5.0,                       it s great  my boyfriend loves it  we ve been using it for over a year now and it still works amazing  we just got speakers to make it even better      
523,5.0,                       this is my first record player  so i don t know what the usual sound quality is  but it seems to be good  i haven t used the bluetooth yet  because i already have a speaker  i love this and can t wait to get more records  as of right now i have two records and the beatles album plays beautifully  this was a christmas gift from my mom  i have heard these scratch your records but since i m a beginner i don t want to spend to much money for a record player  i will eventually get a better one though      
524,5.0,                       what a bargain   i bought this for myself   an adult    just to have something to play some old records on   no  the sound quality isn t  studio quality   but for the price you can t expect it to be   to me  it reminds me very fondly of the days when i was younger  listening to my parents records on my record player in my room   theirs was too fancy   expensive for a young person  ha ha   the bluetooth is nice also   overall  super satisfied with it      
525,3.0,                       lots of options for output  none of which are particularly high quality  yes  some of that does have to do with the vinyl  but the sound coming from any of the speaker options is tin can like  i ll experiment with some other options to improve the range adjustments and so forth  but let s just say it s not going to sound like your old sound system from the    s      
526,1.0,                       i m only giving it a bad review because it s already broken  it won t turn on     
527,2.0,                       i really need to send this back  the needle does not stay on the record  it is not weighted properly  it s in a cute case and the concept of transporting it easily in its compact case is wonderful  however  it does not work  the turntable and needle may fall apart in the transport  not a good choice unless you plan to keep it in one place  not durable enough for a child under         
528,5.0,                       for some reason it would not connect to my bluetooth headset  the speakers are very small so the sound is not that great so i would recommend hooking up to a receiver using some rca cables  but it is very easy to use and it does not take up a lot of space      
529,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          it s true that it looks a bit on the toy side but hey  it does what its promised to do  i love the color  sound is not bad at all  bluetooth works and i can enjoy my dad s  old vinyls and my new ones      
530,5.0,                       this record player works amazingly  especially for the price  but the most useful thing about it is the size in weight  when the package first arrived i doubted the fact that the package was correct because of how light it was  then when opening it seems to be too small to hold a regular sized vinyl  but i was proven wrong in both aspects      
531,5.0,                       bought this for my son because we all know that old is new and vinyl records are in  my son wanted a player for xmas and i didn t want this to be the new shiny toy he d play with for   min and never touch again  it was very affordable and i was very surprised of how good it played      
532,2.0,                       i wish i would have dived into the reviews a little more before i purchased   i was looking for something at a reasonable price to play my    s vinyl collection   what a disappointment  almost all my records seem to skip to the point it makes the music just not notable to listen to and the sound itself yikes    no bass built in at all  sounds like your listening to am radio   very bad sound quality   wish i hadn t purchased it but i m too lazy to take time and box up to return for          
533,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this is a very cool record player and the stereo sound is better than expected however the product is defective      i tried   different    records and it is warped or stops playing during the last    seconds of the song   see video   will update review once it s replaced      
534,4.0,                       this is my first record player  i don t know the technical stuff associated with record players yet  so i went for cute and cheap with the pink turntable  the sound quality isn t very good  but i love that you can hook up external speakers to it  the unit is actually very light and i m pretty careful when moving it around  for the cost  i am happy with it although it will not serve as a long term record player i think      
535,2.0,                       i was very excited about this purchase  it was a gift for my daughter  she has long needed one  i loved all the features this record player had to offer it was a hit but unfortunately it was lacking it s power cord  the refund process went smoothly  i will be reordering same one and hopefully can give a better review     
536,2.0,                       i was so excited to receive my first record player  and felt i couldn t go wrong with a name like victrola after using my grandfather s antique one i immediately unboxed and set up my favorite vinyl  the second the sound came through  i was incredibly disappointed   the sound quality was absolutely abhorrent  i ve had cheap jelly headphones with better sound quality than this speaker  which is saying a lot  i ve already boxed itup and will return it after the holidays  very  very disappointed in the quality of this record player  and do not advise anyone purchase this      
537,5.0,                       i love this record player  it s very stylish and portable  and also easy to plug in and get set up  the sound quality for records is excellent  for bluetooth it is less so  but that doesn t matter to me a lot as i wasn t planning on using it as a speaker  setup was so easy it almost didn t require a manual  but it comes with one  and both the box and case for the player were undamaged and clean  i would recommend this to anyone looking for a reliable  cute  and crisp  sounding player at a relatively low cost      
538,1.0,                       this packaging is terrible  this item was supposed to be brand new   not refurbished or used  and it was supposed to be a gift for someone   how can i gift something that looks like this  sounds quality is okay  easy to assembly  i do like the overall aesthetic of it update  hasn t been a month and it stopped working  it will not turn on and stopped playing music mid song      
539,5.0,                       i ll be honest   i really bought this as decor and to play the fun records i have on vinyl every now and then  but i have been pleasantly surprised by how much our family has enjoyed this record player  the volume goes much higher than i anticipated it to reach  but when really loud the sound is not the most clear  however  for what i paid for it i am thrilled with the purchase  if you are looking for something to look cool in your living room and play some fun records or even use the bluetooth feature  this is the record player for you      
540,5.0,                       excellent victrola   reminiscent of my teen age years and vinyl   make sure it is the original from victrola  with clasp hook on case and white markings on knobs inside   had to have my second purchase  got it as a gift for my son  sent back and replaced from an authorized amazon dealer   check against the photo   it is a wonderful vintage like product and works beautifully     a conversation starter and excellent tech tool      
541,2.0,                       i wanted to like this  when it worked it sounded ok and i probably would have even kept it even though the speakers were just subpar  however  the  st one i received had a broken arm  sent back  got a new one  worked for a day before speakers stopped working  done lol on a positive  amazon s returns process is great      
542,5.0,                       i was so fascinated to have one vinyl record player for my bar and i checked this with this device  this is very quality and portable vinyl player the sound quality in this device is not so great but you can attach bluetooth speaker and play them on it overall this is a good product to have      
543,5.0,                       this thing is awesome  such a great little record player  works and sounds great  absolutely love it  easy to figure out and use  great bluetooth features  sound quality is so clear  highly recommended  bought one for my daughter s boyfriend and had my sister buy one for my niece      
544,1.0,                       it says bluetooth but what they dont tell you and trick you on is that it connects bluetooth with your device to play thru the cheap crummy speakers on the turntable   it is made very poorly and very cheap   i called the support line because the bluetooth wasnt working and that is when i found out that your bluetooth device can play thru the turn table speakers   i had to leave a message and then got a call back and while i was talking to him he hung up on me when i said that he misled me   i called again and left another message for them to call back to no avail   dont but this item   it is a rip off     
545,5.0,                       love everything about this record player  sound is great  can listen to albums i haven t heard in years and can use bluetooth also  great deal for the money  ended up buying another for my granddaughter who was fascinated with mine      
546,5.0,                       i bought this for my    year old granddaughter   she loves it   her mom and dad are already complaining how she plays it nonstop   i love it because she is not glued to headphones   nice to see old things coming back into style      
547,1.0,                       i don t usually write reviews  but this product was really disappointing  the sound quality of the built in speakers was not terrible  but there was a huge issue with playing my new records  it would consistently skip parts of every song  not even a few times  full songs wouldn t be playable because it would keep skipping around  i have   vinyls  just started collecting  and   out of the   were not playable on this because of the skipping     
548,1.0,                       bluetooth mode won t allow record to spin   it will only work in phono mode   this is especially disappointing because the built in speaker is lackluster at best  and it was for use as a bluetooth speaker   it fails as a product   i have tried everything and it just fails as a product      
549,1.0,                       this entire experience is a nightmare   i have boxes   some large  that i didn t even order i can t open any thing because i don t want to be responsible for paying for it   get these boxesout of my house   i should not have to be responsible for returning them to kohl s  one isvery large      
550,5.0,                       i found the turntable record player to be all that i needed   i own a few vinyl records that i had not heard in a long while  this was an affordable and positive way to enjoy those sounds again   is it professional    no  but the value is perfect     
551,1.0,                       i purchased this as a sweet    gift and the original and replacement skipped on several records  i tried the records on my record player and fine  but on both record players we tried unfortunately both turned out to be a disappointment as a gift giver and gift recipient  total bust      
552,5.0,                       i saw this on ellen and i thought how cool  i bet it is way to expensive  i was so excited to find out there was a       version   my husband is the hardest person to surprise please for christmas  this made him so happy and it works fabulous   he has a huge vinyl and digital music collection   so it was the absolute perfect gift      
553,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i bought this as a gift and obviosuly was a little nervous because the price was very low but when it got here and my boyfriend started playing music on it i was shocked it sounded sooo good  he s had it for   months now and it works just great  we haven t played an actual vinyl disc yet so i ll try to update this review once we do    until then  the bluetooth is awesome and the  record player effect  gives it a nice touch       recommended      
554,3.0,                       the record player itself is great but  when it arrived it was missing the power cord  i got this as a gift for my husband and we are past the return date  i had to go buy a power cord for it which is disappointing as it was almost as expensive as the record player itself  i did request a new one through amazon and it told me the product wasn t eligible  so don t understand what that is about      
555,5.0,                       purchased this for    year old daughter for christmas was very happy with it for beginners it s perfe t it s not the best on the market but unless your a album junky and know a lot about records and the players this is greati even purchased a second one for our dining room for fun and grabbed a few albums sowe have been happy with it     
556,4.0,                       very cute style   my    year old absolutely loved it   it looks cheap compared with the originals from back in the day  but that s life   the speakers do not have a great sound  but it suits the purpose of an all in one unit   because the sound is thin  i wouldn t pay extra for the bluetooth version   you ll want a better speaker for that   there is a matching album storage case which is also nice      
557,1.0,                       bought as a gift and promptly returned  it was not good at all  the sound was even worse than i anticipated  the album also wobbled the entire time it spun  just not a good product      
558,5.0,                       this was the perfect gift for my   yr old son  he was totally surprised and thanked me over and over again  i ve seen him leave the house with this product on numerous occasions  so i d say it travels well  haven t heard him complain one bit about how the record player operates  the sound is not exactly great  but it s what you d expect if you remember what records sound like back in the day  good news is that you can connect it to other speakers  so the quality of sound is enhanced      
559,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          literally the biggest piece of s    i ve ever been gifted as a gift it doesn t work at all you didn t work either the times that it was bought for me we even tried to replace it and we were sent another faulty product literally the biggest piece of s    i ve ever gotten in my entire life     
560,1.0,                       i ve never purchased my own turntable   based my choice from the overwhelming good reviews  that was my mistake  the victrola is a low quality product that will ruin your records  at first i thought the product was just defective but after i did some research i found it was cheap   poorly made  the price should have been a dead giveaway  i upgraded to audiotechnica   couldn t be happier     
561,1.0,                       i was so excited about this record player and wound up very disappointed  the color was really pretty and the sound quality was pretty good  however  after about    minutes it turned off and wouldn t turn back on  i was in the middle of an album  and the power light went off and the record stopped spinning  i tried to turn in back on  plugged it in to different outlets  and tried everything i could think of  it still didn t work  i m very disappointed  i returned it  and will be buying a record player from a different brand      
562,2.0,                       no matter what i tried  the needle was misaligned and skipped songs on all the records i had  that worked perfectly on all the other players i have   i got this for my wife  who had never owned a record player before and while it was easy to use setup  she couldn t listen to any of the records we had because of this issue  i should have listened to the many reviews online and from colleagues that told me they also had this issue and its a common problem with the brand  while the sound quality was fine  it s ruined by the fact that it s unusable right out of the box      
563,5.0,                       this product was purchased as a gift for my grandson  who had no idea how to use one   we facetimed at christmas when he opened his gift   he was able to begin playing the lps and connect his bluetooth devices to it   he loved it      
564,5.0,                       bought this for my dad as a father s day gift along with   records he loves it  perfect crisp and clear  made my heart fill with joy to see him smiling and happy as good ol  johnny cash was spinning and playing   bringing back fond memories for my dad i m sure      
565,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          beautiful retro gift  love the case  quality of sound and music is great    makes sound more nostalgic  looked at various other record players on amazon and happy with this selection      
566,2.0,                       this is a cute cheap turntable that looks great on your kid s room  the audio quality of the little speakers is terrible and the bluetooth function is passable  if you want good quality tones invest a little more cash for a better unit      
567,1.0,                       it s made of cheap plastic because of the crack cover and the the top record holder is not attached to the case  it must be a defective item also  there s no power cord  please check carefully before you deliver this product to customer waste my time and money      
568,2.0,                       overall  this is a good record player with decent sound quality  my issue is with the care during shipping and delivery  the box came with a massive hash in the side and the record player mechanism was broken off the mount inside  it definitely did not live up to expectations      
569,3.0,                       doesn t cost a fortune  you can move it around the house  overall happy w product  i think it s for a kid  or someone who is not expecting alot from it  if you just want to play records  and not dj   this is for you      
570,4.0,                       perfect starter record player  doesn t take up very much room  even comes with an extra needle and tie die       
571,5.0,                       i was scared to spend this much money but im happy i did  there were cheaper ones but this brand looked trustworthy and im happy i got it  the sound quality is great and i really loved how good it was for begginers  i dont know anything about records but yet it was managable  it comes with instructions and a manual so that was great and it explains everything      
572,4.0,                       i absolutely love this record player  one problem was that  since i got the grey one  i couldn t see the words beside the switches since it was all black  my sister got a blue one and the letters beside the switches on hers were white  so be in mind of that  it doesn t cost a lot of trouble it s just kind of bugging that i have to sort of look closely when trying to read the words      
573,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i got this as a gift for my    yr old daughter who has a love of vinyl music  i will say i am not disapointed in this purchase and she loves it so much  it is convenient   sound is good  instructions are understandable for all ages  plus victrola is a trusted name to me      
574,5.0,                       just want i wanted   something compact to play records   also has the bluetooth capability which is awesome   volume control works great   very happy with purchase   already ordered another as gift for someone     
575,1.0,                       crap  shakes  doesnt turn steady  the speed switch operates backwards  dont bother      
576,4.0,                       this is a great product for an inexpensive player and will provide hours of entertainment  it will produce plenty of volume for a large room   i had to send my first one back after only about   hours of playtime  as the turntable would not stop turning  obviously as it should   other than that  we have enjoyed it very much   i have yet to put as much time into the replacement to see if it will have the same issue      
577,5.0,                       my  usa flag  turntable was delivered today and i have nothing but good things to say about it  first  it was packaged firmly and safely  and within   minutes of taking it out of the packaging  i was spinning my vinyl lp s  this turntable is so user friendly  and the speakers sound just fine  the bluetooth works perfectly and for the price being under      you cannot go wrong  i started collecting vinyl lp s again so i can re live the memories of my younger years  and so far  van morrison  bob dylan  elton john  and creedence clearwater revival still sound awesome        
578,5.0,                       i got this for a       year old to listen to record books and they loved it       it was the biggest hit this year at christmas   sturdy  easy to use  not so delicate that little hands got frustrated   excellent buy      
579,1.0,                       really disappointing  it clicks when it plays  the deck bounces  we had to play our    on the    setting  it was clearly messed up  it s cool looking and a great idea  suitcase style   but was a huge dud      
580,1.0,                       it was cute and it connected to my daughters phone and it was easy to move  but the sound was terrible so exchanged it  new one also had horrible sound  so sent it back     that was in january    still waiting to get my money back  very disappointed  bought a different one at walmart it worked great      
581,5.0,                       great little player  especially for the price   i love the ability to play any of my records  including   s from the   s and   s inherited from my grandmother   sound quality is adequate for my non connoisseur tastes and i like that i can use the built in speakers or plug in headphones earbuds   i m going to get another for my mom s birthday      
582,4.0,                       this phonograph is  a good deal for the price   nice for my daughter who has gotten interested in playing actual records   my only complaint is that the item showed up on our front porch with no outer amazon shipping box   it was like someone purchasing the item in its box and putting it on our front porch   first of all  the box was beat up and even open at the top   second  it was supposed to be a birthday surprise   i cannot remember ever getting anything from amazon in its original box and no other box to protect and conceal the item   the phonograph seems to work all right  but i am disappointed in the shipping method      
583,2.0,                       blue tooth only for incoming and speakers so bad you don t want to use this feature turntable wobbly it looks cool and it is portable would be great for children      
584,1.0,                       purchased this product in dec      as a christmas gift  it would play some records and then not some  we assumed and returned several records  thinking it was records  finally  we decided to check the last record we purchased by playing on another player  the record worked  this player is not worth purchasing   taking a risk to see if you will get a good one or a bad one  now we are beyond the return april           that s not very long for something to be bad    very disappointed       
585,4.0,                       his old record player stopped working so i got him this and it works great  everything is easy to use and its portable  the speakers are crap but you can hook up other speakers or use bluetooth which is neat     
586,1.0,                       i bought this product in september       i travel for work and i love listening to my vinyls  i came back home december       plugged it in and the player no longer works  i tried switching outlets  i checked to see if the a c was plugged in correctly a number of times  i guess i get what i paid for      
587,1.0,                       it spins a record but product is a get what you pay for maybe just got it the table and arm section have a lot of play in it the arm lever doesn t work properly it will lift the arm but when you put it down the part that lifted sticks and you have to use your finger to push it down or the arm will not touch the record thinking about going to store find a better one and return this one     
588,1.0,                       i got this for my mom for her birthday and i think she s used it twice  her birthday is march   th   the bluetooth doesn t work as i came to realize yesterday and i can t return it because it s not mine so  money wasted  i don t care how cool these are  i m not getting one for myself because vinyls are super expensive and i have spotify premium  if you still want one  don t buy this brand  it sucks      
589,1.0,                       it s not very often i feel the need to write a bad review but i feel this deserves just that   got this for a gift  used handful of times and now   months later the record player won t turn on  we have tried different power outlets and it s the player  the base that the turn table sits on is cheap plastic and very loose  i wouldn t be surprised if something is loose inside with the wires  very disappointed  in this purchase  i didn t want to give it one star but you have to choose one  lol     
590,5.0,                       bought this as a birthday gift and now i m going to order me one  plays at a nice level   love the bluetooth capability to it      
591,1.0,                       amazon is shady  beware   nowhere did it say that this item was used  much less that it was damaged  no directions  no extra stylus  no    adapter  this item loaded without stating used  and if amazon describes their used items as  like new  this is an outright lie  obviously nobody bothered to inspect this item  now bezos gets to make interest off of my money for the     days it will take them to refund my money for this piece of garbage     
592,5.0,                       good sound  easy use  speed was a little off  good quality     
593,1.0,                       quality of the sound is horrible turntable wheel will not turn in less you started with your hand and then it turns regularly  speeds up and slows down  this product is junk      
594,5.0,                          yr old son loved this   we couldn t figure out what to get him   he loves music so we bought him this and some vinyl albums   it s not a  stereo  quality and for what it is  we are very satisfied and so is he      
595,2.0,                       very disappointed   my daughter opened it up on christmas eve and we had got her some record albums in a    but the adapter was missing so she couldn t plan a thing and we were all so bummed   omg seriously   you get what you pay for  now i have to contact the company and try to get the damn adapter       
596,1.0,                       very disappointed   this was a gift i purchased for someone     months ago   as the title states  it worked twice   since then  every record skips  and nothing seems to fix it   we re going to contact victrola for trouble shooting help   i ll update this review on the outcome   sadly  not recommended      
597,2.0,                       i wasn t expecting much at this price point   the turntable works nicely but the speakers are terrible   my phone s built in speakers are better than these things   external speakers are going to be a necessity  update   external speakers are not much better  louder yes  but still sounds bad  don t bother wasting your money  spend a little more for a better player  dropping a star from   to        
598,1.0,                       makes for a cute decoration but unless you re just spinning some old dinky records you got at a yard sale for five dollars you need to invest in a better player  this model has no counterweight  no antiskate and a very small platter  since it hangs off the side the disk will end up bending as it s spun  so your records will be damaged  this is a guarantee  if that isn t enough because there isn t a counterweight the sound will be warbled and skipping  audio technica has a good one for a hundred bucks  just use theirs      
599,5.0,                       my son said he wanted a turntable   i wanted something that wasn t a huge investment  while he figures out if he is really going to be in to vinyl   this is a really good looking turntable   plays great   seems very durable   super easy for him to pack it up and take to a friend s house   the speakers are not great  but they are serviceable  and there is a jack  if you want to buy speakers to improve the quality   i have not tried the bluetooth  so i don t know about that      
600,1.0,                       plastic housing arrived loose from box   drive was off and sound quality was not up to expectation   i returned and opted for a component to attach to my receiver in lieu   go the extra step unless this is a gift for a    year old or younger      
601,5.0,                       my dad and i used to jump on the couches downstairs listening to vinyls  so they have a special place in our hearts  his player broke long ago  so i got him this  and he is just in love    the speaker is pretty good  and my only complaint is that we can t like take it in the car because it needs to be plugged in  i love it and would buy it again      
602,2.0,                       this turntable skips a lot especially on newer vinyl   the tone arm doesn t seem well   the tone arms skips more and more as the record plays on and it moves toward the center   i ll be returning mine and getting a higher quality player      
603,3.0,                       record player was a gift and was not shipped in a box to  protect it at all     it was shipped in the box you would buy at the store with a label slapped on it   someone could have seen what it was  and it should have been protected more  however record player works good and looks nice      
604,4.0,                       we play lots of music and wanted a record played that was still small enough to not take up too much space since we also use cds and radio a great deal  this small speaker is doing the trick      
605,1.0,                       sadly sound is horrible and the player just skips on most vinyl records   bluetooth is badly designed  you cannot send the signal to a bluetooth speaker as it only takes incoming signals so you are stuck with the awful sound from the built in speakers      
606,1.0,                       item came with the screws that hold turn table in place rattling around inside  put them in ourselves  but table is cheap and wobbles the sound  not a good purchase  gave as a gift  by the time we realized i had no return options         
607,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          love it     just what i wanted      
608,1.0,                       ordered one for my daughter for christmas  however when we put a record on it  the record wobbled and skipped  no matter how many records we tired so she couldn t use it   we exchanged on amazon for a replacement and the replacement was worse   the turn table made a grinding noise and would come to a complete stop any time the needle touched the record on it i am done with this brand and will be shopping for a different record player without these issues      
609,5.0,                       great record player  great price  it has inspired me to collect more vinyls  good sound  and can be loud  very stylish  as well  the material it is made of seems to be quality      
610,5.0,                       i am really enjoying this little record player  records play well   the sound quality is heavy on the treble with no knob to balance treble and or base  but for an  i haven t played my albums in years  experience  it is fun      
611,5.0,                       i absolutely love this turntable  i couldn t be happier  it s original looking  sleek  and even portable  love that it folds up to look like a suitcase  it s protected and sturdy  not super lightweight and cheap  no issues and have listened to a variety of records on it      
612,1.0,                       this is a waste of time  go digital with your books and movies and music  i can t believe how much money my girlfriend and i have wasted on two different quick to break garbage record players  stop buying vinyl like it is cool people  digital if you actually care about anything  like if it produces zero waste and takes up only memory space on electronic devices    why are we wasting our time on ancient outdated obsolete obtuse grandpa tech  let the bad ideas die people      
613,4.0,                       love it  not as much volume as i d like and can t pair to sound bars or other volume enhancing tech  but cute as heck in the u s  flag case and having a lot of fun spinning vinyl as a pretty cool attention getter during party fun  guests love picking and spinning our old classic vinyls  score      
614,5.0,                       love this record player  i ve been listening to dozens of records over the past week or so  i read some reviews about people being disappointed in it  but mine works perfectly  it is super easy to use  and the sound quality is impressive considering the size of it  it s the right size not to take up too much space and i can take it with me to a friends house easily if i wanted to the records play really well  just use it correctly and be careful with the needle and not scratching your records  if your records are scratched  then obviously it will sound scratchy when you play them definitely recommend it  especially because they come in a variety of color options for the case      
615,2.0,                       my turn table skips so much it s frustrating  i got it two days ago and i ve only used it twice  i read that the record could be dusty but it s a brand new record with no dust  was hesitant to buy because of the bad reviews     
616,3.0,                       purchased for a gift   the case and turntable are nice and usable  but the sound is something to be desired   overall an average rating at best      
617,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          just received my replacement  i was hoping the first one was an anomaly but sadly no   i bough   new lps and had some vintage  every single one skips on the first track   customer service was great and quickly got me a replacement but it did the same thing  every record skips including the   i took straight out of the package  will be asking for a refund    sigh      
618,2.0,                       the machine is cheap for a reason  the speakers sound terrible throughout the sound range and have nonexistent bass  the needle skips on most of the records used causing it to be unusable mostly  the build quality is cheap but expected from a viynl player at this range  the device looks pretty but i would highly recommend looking into other devices      
619,1.0,                       everything was fine with this for a year and   months  went to use it and it caught fire  warranty is only   year  i d find a different one  we won t be buying another one from this brand      
620,5.0,                       purchased black version of this for myself  purchased red version as gift  very good quality for price  sound and playability is very good with blue tooth streaming ability of music  nice retro item      
621,5.0,                       super neat  first i have ever bought and i love it  when you don t have a big vinyl collection the blue tooth helps out with that  all in all this is a good first timer buy and it packs up and stores super easy      
622,1.0,                       i bought this for my son for christmas thinking it would be a good starter record player  i didn t have any expectations of it producing great sound since it is a cheap record player  we put a record on at half volume and part way into the first song the sound stopped coming from the speaker  i own a couple of other nice quality turntables and figured i could troubleshoot it but it is clearly overall defective  larger records are also very wobbly as the platter is very small      
623,1.0,                       we used it   times and it broke  when customer service was connected   they are not helpful  i don t want a refund  i just want a record player that works   they identified issue  but don t inform you how to fix it      
624,1.0,                       not a good product  very cheaply made  doesn t even play the records right  it is so cheaply made it doesn t even rotate the records and play them properly  returned      
625,1.0,                       i bought this two months ago   i needed to replace the needle and when i did the sound wasn t right  i thought it might just be the replacement needle so i tried a different one  the problem persisted  the music plays but it s very muffled and it s not smooth  i m not sure what the problem is  i ve tried different albums  very frustrating because i just bought    new vinyl albums and will now have to buy a new  but better  record player for them  waste of      invest in a better product  it worked great for two months   i m glad i waited to write a review      
626,5.0,                       this was on someone s christmas wish list   it was very well received   appreciated  she s interested in vinyl recordings  better sound quality   more info on the album covers than on little cd s       
627,5.0,                       i bought this as a gift for my father   he commented on how many records he had and how there was nothing to play them on   he was excited enough when i brought it over and set it up   it sounded ok   well  probably good considering   it should last for many years because after i left him with it  he never touched it again   the only time it gets touched now is when it is dusted      
628,5.0,                       great little turntable   some of my favorite vinyl is in    format and the fact that the victoria had this speed setting was a big driver for me   i also really like that it s a self contained  easily transportable unit   the integrated bluetooth was a nice  modern technology touch to this retro device   the price point is excellent too      
629,1.0,                       this is not a good record player  no matter what record you get this turntable will not play it correctly because the actually turntable that turns and plays the vinyl is smaller than the vinyl causing it to wobble  and since vinyls have grooves in order to play the music the vinyl will just skip or have a warp sound to it  i do not recommend buying this unit      
630,3.0,                       i didn t expect the best sound quality out of this product based on the price  but i thought the bluetooth and aux options would allow me to play the albums through another speaker  that isn t the case so there isn t a way to expand the sound of albums leaving me with these two sad speakers      on a good note  it looks really cute sitting on our bar and gives me a feeling of nostalgia      
631,1.0,                       wouldn t turn  didn t even get a chance to see how it sounded broken right out of the box  either a factory default or the delivery person dropped it  absolutely ruined my birthday so thanks for that      
632,1.0,                       i got this as a birthday present for a friend of mine and she used it once and then it crapped out and stopped working  not happy at all  especially since i couldn t return it  not a good quality product  please look elsewhere  felt so guilty that her present didn t work after a use     
633,4.0,                       victrola vintage   speed bluetooth suitcase turntable was a very nice gift  works very well  arrived on time for the party  unfortunately  the outside of the package was destroyed and re taped with a large quantity of packing tape  there was no outside wrapper to protect the product box      
634,1.0,                       i have boughten two of these turntables  one from fry s and it was broken out of the box  unforunately  this one also came broken this manufacturer seems to be unreliable and i would not recommend this item the worse part was i bought this for my mom   and now i m stuck with two pieces of junk that don t work the funny part is i think it ran once before no longer working  i was told that the sound quality was also not great when it did work all and all do not buy this product      
635,2.0,                       it s super cute  but the sound is really bad  i hardly use it because i can get better sound straight from my phone or computer  i just resort to my old player if i want to listen to albums      
636,5.0,                       i ve got a crank victorolla from      and wanted to get a more modern one  i love this little thing  its clear and the volume is decent  side note  if you re having problems with it skipping tape a penny on the needle head  it will weigh it down enough to keep it from happening again      
637,4.0,                       first off  i love this record player  i purchased the bright red color and it looks awesome that being said  the sound quality of this record player without any kind of external speaker set up is just okay i think it s fine for a record like the times they are a changin  by bob dylan  but for rock and roll records  in which bass is essential  the bass is barely audible  i would advise anyone who wishes to purchase this record player to also purchase an external sound system that you can connect to this record player to give your records more volume and power  other than that it is a great buy and i have had no problems with it whatsoever  since i do have an external speaker system       
638,1.0,                       bought the record player and has already stopped working in less then   months  plugged it in and immediately started to smell a burning smell  only used   times  waste of money      
639,1.0,                       this is the single most worst purchase that i have ever made from amazon  it is not the unit that i purchased and the power cord that was shipped with it doesn t belong to it  cannot even begin to describe how upsetting this is  can t send it back fast enough  horrible  horrible  horrible      
640,1.0,                       bought this for christmas for my son  he tried three records on it and thought they were all warped only to learn it was the quality of record player it was not a good gift snd we were very disappointed      
641,1.0,                       i d love to say this was a great product  but the moment my daughter plugged it in the power adapter exploded in her hand  she was not injured  but it scared her and she burst into tears  luckily we were home and it didn t burn the house down  this is a dangerous product  warranty info in the manual states that i have to send the manufacturer   for a warranty repair  i will be returning this product      
642,3.0,                       this either came broken or a piece was missing  the needle is extremely delicate and has to sit just right on the hinge otherwise it slips off and can t play  when you set it up just right it plays magnificently though and the sound quality is amazing  still recommend it     
643,5.0,                       got this for my boyfriend for christmas and i dunno i think it s really cool  totally works as soon as you bust it out  sounds great  i m excited to keep using it i couldn t figure out the bluetooth but i really think that s a me problem      
644,5.0,                       got this as a gift for someone this christmas  until i could afford the one they really wanted  i was super nervous as they are super into tech and music and nice things and have expensive taste  they loved it  they immediately called me to show me how much they loved it and they loved the sound quality  such a great idea      
645,5.0,                       oh my goodness  i love this record player  it s a great throw back to my childhood  playing christmas albums with the little crackle sounds is so comforting and memorable  such a treat to teach my    year old all about it too      
646,5.0,                       i thought the boy was gonna cry  he loves old records  the was a great purchase for him  sounds great  just like i remember them to be      
647,5.0,                       this is amazing  i got it as my graduation gift and have used it almost every day since the sound is amazing and it works great both with vinyl s and as a speaker when connected to bluetooth the color is very cute and i also love the aesthetic of it when not in use        
648,3.0,                       i should have read the description better   why victrola would make a record player with only line in bluetooth capability is beyond me   you will most certainly not want to listen to your vintage records thru the sub par speakers that are on this portable player   if connected to better speakers it would be a hit  this goes back immediately   do not buy if you want to output to bluetooth speakers         
649,5.0,                       we have loved listening to our old albums with the kids  building a new collection with our kids from antique stores is so much fun  finding albums from our era and our parents era is so exciting  plus we get to find new gems of years gone by  and they still use it when we re not around to listen to  their  music  hearing music from their rooms is priceless  brings back our memories of being young  sound is comparable to what we heard years ago but clearer  doesnt get too loud  can hear the  scratch  so if you like that u will love this player      
650,5.0,                       bought this victrola for my son as a christmas gift as he and friends have been interested in acquiring   listening to the sound of vinyl records  he is very pleased with the design and portability of this player  also  he was surprised that the speakers carried so much volume      
651,4.0,                       plays all my records  the only thing i have a problem with is that i thought the bluetooth would broadcast the record being played on it  instead the record player works like a bluetooth speaker for something like a phone playing music  i would say it s built in sound quality isn t great  but it gets the job done      
652,1.0,                       i got this for my husband for christmas this year  i knew it wasn t top quality as it was only      but i figured that it would work well enough for him to experiment with a record player and decide if he wanted to invest in a more expensive product down the road  it is only barely over   months later and despite excellent care on his part  the sound has become incredibly wobbly and the quality is so distorted it isn t even worth using  very disappointed and would return this product if i could      
653,1.0,                       i ve had this record player for over a year  in the beginning i had no issues with skipping as they were older records  i ve ordered some brand new vinyl recently and all of the new records skip  there s no anti skating on this record player  as soon as the music picks up it will skip  not worth the money because the standard fixes  a penny or a quarter  did not fix this      
654,1.0,                       sound is horrible  and on the one i received  the speed was off  too slow    returned for refund      
655,5.0,                       my    year old granddaughter is a music lover  she wanted to experience  vinyl  and this was a great way for her to do it  she especially loved the denim fabric look      
656,1.0,                       received a broken product today  it didn t come in a shipping box it was simply the product box that the table came in   the lift lever is completely broken and the turntable looks like its suppose to be glued down but it lifts completely up  trash will be sending back     
657,1.0,                       item stopped working after a       years   not bluetooth      
658,2.0,                       veri nice finish  the on board sound is ok  the sound in the head phones are ok too but the rca sound is terrible  so if you are planning to send the audio to a external amplifier  look for something else      
659,5.0,                       this product is wonderful  i bought the used like new and it arrived a day earlier than expected  the record player truly is like new  it didn t have any marks  still had some of the plastic on it  and works wonderfully  i m sure the used good condition are just as great  i appreciate the solid packaging and speedy delivery  thank you  this record player is more for beginners and its looks which is why i got it  i am not an expert  if you have a serious collection i m sure a more     one will be better for you   but if you simply enjoy listening to records for fun  this is perfect      
660,5.0,                       my    year old granddaughter wanted thisvictrola for christmas and i was not sure we would get it by christmas  we got it in plenty of time and she loves it  her and my daughter play all my mothers old records  what a great gift         
661,4.0,                       will not work with my bluetooth speaker alone   haven t figured out a way to go through my computer first and then to my speaker   but it s loud enough that it s not really an issue in my apartment   it s a great turntable and sounds good  but i wish the bluetooth interface was simple and universal      
662,1.0,                       my daughter received this for christmas  and several records would skip and repeat    we returned the records and the replacements did the same  we replaced the record player with a much nicer model and the records play perfectly  beware this is more of a novelty then practical      
663,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i absolutely love this little record player  cute as can be  sound isn t great but i wanted it to sound more like what i heard from my record player in the     s as a kid  this does that perfectly and brings back great memories      
664,1.0,                       bought by one click  order never showed a refurbished item   no power cord and no speaker cables means we can t tell if how well it works   manufacturer was of no help   wouldn t take a phone inquiry  referred to website and never responded   will not buy another of these because of that alone   amazon pulled a fast one   be cautious using one click   we didn t see that amazon provided a refurbished product at their option  not ours      
665,1.0,                       didn t work  the record didn t spin  don t order this     
666,5.0,                       i bought this to play some of my modern records  i brought to my parents and my dad played some of his old records  it brought back memories for him and he was amazed how clear the sound was  so worth it      
667,3.0,                       very disappointed  my daughter used her own money to buy this   was very anxious to get it and when it arrived the locking mechanism is broken  it looks like it will be fun to use  and love the color  but very disappointed in the quality control   chances are she will set it somewhere in her room and not move it  but if she wanted to take it to a friends as an example  she can t lock it up to carry it  the speakers are ok but sound quality is tinny  not enough base      
668,4.0,                       functions exactly as you would expect a small portable turntable in this price range to function  bluetooth is cool and the ability to hook it up to better quality speakers makes it very versatile  love the color and feel of this style  unfortunately i found a few bubbles in the vinyl coating of mine  which i m a little disappointed by  not bad enough to return it  but i m a bit picky so i ll probably end up trying to fix it myself  which is frustrating to have to do on a brand new item      
669,1.0,                       i bought this record player for my nephew as a birthday gift  he was so excited to get it  he opened it and i helped him set it up and it only worked that first day  the next day there were several problems with it  i called the company and they said it sounded like a power cord issue but they couldn t send a new power cord because the warehouse was closed due to the pandemic  so i went to micro center to get a new power cord and it didn t fix the problem  poorly designed product  i do not recommend it  go with a different company      
670,5.0,                       really love the color  sound is great  not staticky or anything   obviously not like a super professional sound system  but very good quality   doesn t feel cheap  pretty sturdy  the only thing is my roommate always leaves their bluetooth on  so it automatically connects to her phone instead of mine  which makes it kind of annoying to fiddle around with  other than that  connection is a breeze  the record player has   different speeds for different records and plays very smoothly  i wouldn t really take it anywhere  although i suppose you could because it does securely latch and has a sturdy case and handle      
671,5.0,                       my    year old wanted a record player  this was perfect sized and at the right price  it s easy for her to use and she s working on expanding her record collection      
672,4.0,                       i was thinking in line ment i could connect my speakers too it to make it lounder   but that was not it  it ment you can connect to listen from other machine through speakers in the box     
673,4.0,                       the first record i tried skipped a bit  to fix it  i just tape a dime and a penny to the top of the needle bit  and now it play perfectly  annoying that it didn t work perfect on its own  but an    cent fix isn t too bad      
674,1.0,                       arrived broken   pieces were sitting in bottom and apart  black piece broken off and sitting on bottom      
675,5.0,                       bought as a gift for my    yo daughter  she loves it  i have owned a few older record players and didnt think this one would be as nice as it was  the mechanics seemed decent and the speakers are clear and provide good sound  i did not try the bt feature  just played a carpenters album      
676,2.0,                       really wanted to like this product  especially for the price  i know it s not the most well made record player  but the sound was fine  all of the sudden it just stopped working  i ve contacted amazon a few times and the manufacturer  haven t gotten a possible response yet  just a simply  i m sorry   i would recommend spending a bit more money to get something nicer      
677,5.0,                       great little record player  i bought this for my son to try records for the first time  it was so good i bought another one for my mom  super easy and portable  definitely recommended      
678,2.0,                       cute product  sound quality it awful tiny sound   similar to your phone or built in laptop speakerspackaging was badly damagesalso  this happens too often with amazon products  i received an item that had clearly been used before   it was either a return or display   all of the plastic seals had been previously opened and reclosedalso was missing the av cable which should have been included bad product and bad seller     
679,4.0,                       yes i love the vintage sound of the static needle as you start the record  but they play very good   it s fun listening to old    s and    s  my family and i had a great time playing music on the record player   its really loud enough to enjoy      
680,4.0,                       great vinyl  classic and sharp looking  plays well    issues  i  without researching so it s my own fault  assumed it could maybe connect through bluetooth to other speakers  but the bluetooth is to connect other devices to play through the record player  what s the point of having a record player if you re gonna plug your phone in and listen to downloaded music  because the sound itself isn t all that great  so i connected a speaker to the player for better quality sound      
681,5.0,                       purchased for my nephew s birthday   arrived in actual record player box  without any extra box padding   so i was concerned about its playability   no worries   record player works well   perfect for beginners   great gift      
682,5.0,                       my grand daugher just loved it    got to play       rd records on it   sound is just like the old players back in the day don t know about the bluetooth   my grand  daughter used it yet       
683,3.0,                       i bought this to play my lps  sound quality is not very good  but not bad for the price  i guess  i m hoping i can attach some external speakers to it  great looking and easy to use      
684,3.0,                       its okay for the price  since its cheap  the records skip  i fixed this by putting a   cent or    cent  depends on the record i want to play  with tape at the tip of the needle arm  for the price  i cant complain      
685,1.0,                       based on the reviews for this item  i expected a bit more  the sound quality of this record player is equivalent to the sound quality of my   year old son s disney record player  also  my record player came with tears on both corners of the top part of the record player  i don t recommend this record player to anyone with a refined ear for sound      
686,2.0,                       i ordered it during black friday and even at that price it wasn t worth it for me  it skipped old records and a brand new out of a packaging too  it seemed to work better for the  nd or  rd songs  but the  st song was horrible  it s very flimsy and i guess you get what you pay for  returning asap and getting something else      
687,5.0,                       this was for my teenaged g daughter for christmas  she liked it  she really liked it  still does  makes me want one and start buying vinyl  easy to use  great sound quality      
688,5.0,                       i love this record player  i love that its vibrant red  it s so easy to use for a beginner like me for me it s perfect  sounds great  works perfectly  and is easy to store away when it s not being used i personally leave it out but to each their own  you won t regret this purchase      
689,1.0,                       i was excited to receive this record player  the excitement died quickly as the sound quality was not that great but ok  bluetooth worked great  but the record player did not function  decided to return it and invest in something of higher quality     
690,5.0,                       got this as a birthday gift for my dad he loves it  he had a ton of records with no player  now he and  my mom dance the night away to their old favorites      
691,5.0,                       i absolutely love this record player  i went to an old book store and bought some vinyls and have been obsessed with how they sound on this record player  really recommend      
692,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          the comment i received from the special person i gifted this item to   this thing is so cool   i feel like it s an antique and i m so cool to have one   the sound quality and bluetooth is rated based on volume capacity in a large space room      
693,1.0,                       did not work when i got it      
694,2.0,                       the product per say was fine   it was the fact that i ordered my granddaughter the flag one and received a plain black one   i gave it to her as a birthday present so instead of taking it out of the box first i let her unwrap   the disappointment as she was expecting a flag one was very sad to me but she said she would just keep it as she wanted to listen to her album   she is a a very patriotic person and this was upsetting to me       
695,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          it s a great record player  clear   crisp   with the right sound system  the speakers aren t bad if you owned a studio or used it in a small area  however you want this to be in you living room  i suggest buying a sound system using an aux cord  the bluetooth connection was confusing  overall great product that sounds great with a solid sound system      
696,5.0,                       it has been so fun to finally play records from the    s that i have had in storage for so long   playing some of the children s records  comedy albums  and classical recordings that our family enjoyed so often in those years has brought back many great memories of simpler times when we would gather together around a record player  this victrola copy even looks like the vintage one we had and the sound is authentic   such a great buy       
697,5.0,                       i bought this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend  he was so happy  we ve gotten records from his grandparents and there s nothing like the sound of a record player  the speakers are amazing  bluetooth hooks up quick  i have no complaints  great buy      
698,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i got the item just now and the sound is clear and very easy to function  read and follow the instructions so you don t break or bend anything  i bought it because of the price and the color  matches my living room  i hope it lasts        
699,2.0,                       poor quality  it arrived with the screws stripped out of one of the lid hinges  hinge was detached  only used small screws in cheap press board  really don t think it would ve held up  sent it back      
700,4.0,                       ah the good old days  plenty of record players available but this was all i wanted or needed  might add speakers some time  hubs has rush albums and it needs to be loud      
701,4.0,                       product is great  has really nice sound quality and i like that it s portable   includes an extra needle  the bluetooth is easy to connect as well  i only gave it   stars because i ordered it in the color gray  and was sent red  but didn t care enough to exchange it      
702,5.0,                       great value for the money  let s you play all those old records in a compact package  bluetooth works pretty well  only drawback is the sound is a bit tinny   even when connected to larger speakers with a subwoofer    could use a different needle for    rpm records  and a place to store the power supply in the case  very satisfied  recommend to anyone looking for a good portable player     
703,5.0,                       we were a little bit nervous after reading some of the reviews  but it seemed to be the best option for the price we wanted  while we were first setting it up we had trouble with the table  it was wobbly and would only turn a few times  but we found a small round piece under  top right of the part that spins  which was inhibiting it from turning all the way  after removing that part and placing it in the indent where it belongs  it worked great   haven t tried the bluetooth aspect yet  but with the record we ve used so far it sounds great and was all we hoped for   hoping that continues      
704,1.0,                       i purchased this for the bt features  which really isn t a feature at all   read the specs carefully as i got scammed   i would be really upset but the record player plays on the phono settings   with average or adequate sound if i m wrong  please tell me how to connect my wireless speakers without the need for a rca cord   which  by the way  doesn t work for me either   i have a ue boom  that i can t use   very unfortunate      
705,2.0,                       something sounds off with the sound quality  it s sluggish and slow sounding even on the right setting   also  the speakers don t work correctly and sound only comes out one side   sent it back      
706,5.0,                       not the best out there  but definitely the best for people just getting into vinyl records  sound quality is great until you get to a medium loud quality  it depends a lot on how clean the vinyl you have is and the quality of it  it works without issues  is fairly straightforward  and has line in   bluetooth in   aux headphone out   rca out features  really great device for       if you plan to get into serious or light vinyl collecting  i recommend you start out with one like this  then gift it to someone else and get a fancier one if and when your collection has grown  anybody who buys this will be satisfied considering the player costs about as much two new vinyls      
707,4.0,                       great choice for a beginner on a budget  my    year old bought this herself and teaching herself  yes the speakers are weak  but who cares  if you want better  pay more for a higher quality one  this serves or purpose excellently  she can take to get friends house  grandparents house  tech others the basics and super easily  those bad reviews think they should get a mercedes by investing       have the correct expectations going in  this is budget friendly record player  excellent for beginners and novices  great choice      
708,5.0,                       pretty happy with this  went out thrift ing and brousing thru old lp s sound quality is pretty good but i think at some point i will add some little small external speakers      
709,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this is the first record player i ve owned and i couldn t be happier  i love the sound quality and the easy setup  this is one of the best purchases i ve ever made      
710,1.0,                       that is how long it lasted  then the turntable would turn      of an inch then nothing  so with the extended warranty i sent it back and ordered a different brand name  understand i know it was portable  it never moved from the spot i put it to play records  i just like the size of the unit      
711,3.0,                       good points  cute  easy to set up  simple  and good pricing  sound quality not so great   good for kids or non audiophiles  we did not get this w high fidelity in mind  but it s missing the additional stylus  and the stylus is not a good one so we need the extra stylus  thinking about returning it      
712,2.0,                       i knew i was not going to get true stereo sound but there was zero range  i have gotten better sound quality from inexpensive bluetooth speakers  the search continues      
713,5.0,                       if you are even considering buying a record player i d like to take a moment here to thank you for helping to keep vinyl and physical music alive  this player works perfectly  i love the color  great quality  this is the cheapest  great quality one i found  at first i ordered one from best buy around christmas time and they really disappointed me with telling me they were out of stock after i had waited forever  so then i came on amazon and found this one  i think crosley is the most popular brand people are buying now  but this is exactly the same and cheaper  plus my grandmother said  victrola  was the name on her record player back when they came out  apparently      
714,5.0,                       tested it with a couple of   s  i love it  i haven t tested it with a bluetooth speaker yet but i am happy      
715,1.0,                       skips horribly  do not buy  victorola should be ashamed to sell this product      
716,1.0,                       got this for my teenage son for christmas  could not hear  speaker did not work  the only way we could hear it was to put our ear next to the needle  my son asked if it was pre owned    upon removing it from the packaging he noticed a big dent in one of the corners  as excited as we were to have him open it and use it  we were ten times as disappointed to have him receive a gift that didn t work  quality was awful  not sure if i should return it or just cut my losses      
717,5.0,                       very easy to set up for a first time record player owner  love the suit case style  did not expect much from the build in speakers but was impressed with the sound  the bluetooth connectivity is also a great addition when i want to listen to songs on my phone      
718,2.0,                       i haven t opened this as i bought this as a gift so i m not sure what the quality is yet  the box it comes in says exactly what it is  if you live with the person you re getting it for you d better hope you get to it before them      
719,3.0,                       decent product   but my child couldn t figure out their terrible website to register it  so lost out on the free gift   email to support went unanswered      
720,1.0,                       cant rate usability   as it arrived broken  ended up getting a non portable for slightly more that has a full sized turntable  this would be great for kids rooms  but that s about it      
721,4.0,                       works great  easy set up  bluetooth connectivity is awesome but to actually listen to records on it the sound can be a little disappointing  i was also expecting this to be a  chargeable device  aka you could use it unplugged since it says portable  but i realize nowadays that simply means it s lightweight and compact  still a good product though    even came with an extra needle  if you intend on using this simply as a turntable you should be very pleased      
722,1.0,                       don t buy this product me and my father bought this and it came in a used state and not the new state we had paid for there was no power supply and no extra needle the record players exterior was scratched and dented and the inside of the record player had the entire thing sticking up and not down in place it was loose the latch was very loose didn t do barely anything to close it  was missing the needle cover the needle looked bent and didn t work i do not recommend at all      
723,5.0,                       i absolutely love this turn table  i got the tie dye version  and the vibrancy of the colors is great  the sound quality is what i assumed it would be  it is rather loud if turned all the way up  however i do feel as if the speakers would blow pretty easy  i have never used the bluetooth feature  i just use it to play vinyl  i leave it out on my desk in the living room  and have had many compliments on it  i highly recommend      
724,5.0,                       it works as a record player should i am actually impressed  we bought the shiplap one  and obviously they arent using real shiplap  i assumed it would be an ugly vinyl wrap  but the quality is better than i expected      
725,5.0,                       best purchase that i made in a long time  great gift for any music lovers   i can finally listen to the records that my mother and grandmother listened to  definitely plan on growing the collection of vinyls  sound quality is awesome and it s great there is the option to use bluetooth to pair to my phone or something else  easy to use for beginners of vinyl record players  not to forget it s cute too  i ended up getting the turquoise one to match my room and adds a retro laid back vibe to the room  definitely recommend this and would purchase again      
726,1.0,                       record player came packaged very well and looked really cool so i had high hopes  read the quick set up instructions and followed them accordingly and set the player up  but it didn t work at all  the phone light never stayed lit   after finally getting the light to stay on and the turntable to spin  it played but the speakers were very faint and you could barely hear it  so gave up and packed it up   returning it  don t waste your time or money      
727,1.0,                       this was supposed to be a christmas gift for my partner  it arrived damaged  for one   secondly  this is a very cheap model  despite the listed price  you re getting a     quality player and paying extra for a nice color       would never purchase again  we returned and recieved a full refund  so they did earn one star for a smooth transaction      
728,5.0,                       gift for my    year old son  who likes all things retro electronic   perfect mix of modern tech and old school charm   plays records wonderfully  and easy to bluetooth from phone as well      
729,5.0,                       husband loves playing old records  one of his favorite gifts   it is easily portable and so he can cart it into his basement workshop and play the rolling stones to his heart s content   needs bigger speakers    i think can attach but not sure as he has not let me even check it      
730,1.0,                       product broken in shipping  while the product seems to be made well it does not work due to shipping practices  it seems like a nice product but i would suggest buying it in a store      
731,5.0,                       great gift for my thirteen year old  sounds great  he plays it all the time in his bedroom upstairs and sound is still great down below  i also love how he can attach headphones to it      
732,5.0,                       i am not a pro but i just wanted something to play my records on  some reviews are not so kind  but this works for me     
733,1.0,                       no stylus in the arm or extra as stated   when i contacted customer service they said i don t need a pen to operate a record player     no kidding   needed it for a specific event and it didn t work      
734,1.0,                       purchased with   new albums for my daughter   it started skipping right away on all of the records   there is no adjustment on the tone arm or anything so we tried the  penny trick  which worked only slightly better   the first one we got had a slightly warped platter   sent it back and got a replacement right away   same problem with the skipping on all the records  every track   it was unusable  the speakers sound awful   returned second unit for a refund      
735,1.0,                       i purchased this for my teenaged daughter for christmas   brand new records on a brand new record player  and each one is skipping   we tested those records on my husband s record player and there in no skip in the vinyl   we changed the needle  and the records continue to skip   i ve tried reaching out to the manufacturer  and i m hoping they ll work with us to make this right   of course the box was tossed in the recycling with the rest of the holiday trash      
736,4.0,                       the player is good  speakers on the player need some help  and really it s not the same as on old record player  i purchased this because i wanted the old sound of the needle on the album and it just doesn t have it  it is a nice display peice     
737,1.0,                       i bought this not even four months ago and it s already broken after very light use  we have it in our children s playroom up on a high storage piece where they can t touch it  we ve taken good care of it and yet it now sounds like the music is underwater  we replaced the needle and it still sounds horrible         
738,5.0,                       this is my first record player that i ve owned  i needed a small portable one for my room since i don t have much space  i love it though  it came safely packaged and with easy to ready instructions  i wish the speakers sounded better  hut they aren t terrible things  i enjoy listening to my records on there and glad i bought this      
739,5.0,                       ok  you re not going to be mixing   scratching at the techno clubs with this  or kickstarting your dj career   but if you want a solid entry level turntable to enjoy your collection of      albums that have gone unplayed for    years  then yes  you ll love it  nice bluetooth speaker so you can play your current playlists too  again though  you re not going to be turnin the party out with this thing  but you will get to appreciate all those albums again      
740,1.0,                       i ve had this for about   months  at first it was decent sound and a really cool thing to have to play my grandma her records of dean martin  but i haven t used it in about a month or two and when i plug it in  i smell something burning and it wont turn on  it only gives you a month to return  so i missed it    i hope they see this and give me a replacement  all that money just to last a couple month  not worth it       
741,5.0,                       i have been hesitant to get a record player and then my friends surprised with with this one for my birthday  it has been great  the sound quality is awesome and i can hook my phone up to it if i want to use it as a bluetooth speaker  just bought another one for a friend  plays almost every size of record  very happy with this purchase      
742,1.0,                       terrible re ords that play normalky on the home record player skip through the whole album  sound quality is poor  this was suposed to be a gift for our grand daughter and it s essentially non fuctional  we tried several albums the result was the same     
743,5.0,                       very good quality to listen records with a compact and versatile player  the quality of the speakers can improve because when the music is loud the sound has some distortion  the blue tooth connection is good and easy to pair with my cellphone      
744,5.0,                       i love this turntable so much  it was an early christmas present for my son  i ve wanted one for a long time and i ve been having a blast playing vinyl i ve collected my whole life  i play it through external speakers and it s just about perfect      
745,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          just got this today  and read some reviews about the sound quality not being great  but honestly it sounds great to me  works great right out of the box  looks great  and a fantastic deal for the quality and size  would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs a smaller record player but still wants a quality product      
746,5.0,                       great fun wish there was more bass to the output but that s my only gripe battery power and a little compartment to store the spare needle that comes with it would ve been a plus however  at this price point and the amount that this thing will be used you really can t complain      
747,5.0,                       this little thing rocks  sounds pretty darn good  it connected really fast and it s easy to use  smooth needle that really allows the old school clicks and pops of vinyl to stand out     
748,5.0,                       bought this for my son that s really into a retro look  sound quality is great  and it was easy for him to pick up on how to use it properly  of course  we had to couple it with one of the most respected film score composers out there   hans zimmer  really puts life to his already amazing music      
749,5.0,                       very pleased with my purchase  i grew up listening to records that my mom had so i was really eager in purchasing one for myself  going to record stores and finding jems from my childhood brings back so many great memories  the case is lightweight  perfect for travel if that s what you wish  it did take me a minute how to connect it via bluetooth from my phone because i have never used it before  it has great sound  i don t need it blasting because i do have neighbors in close proximity  i absolutely love the color of the case too  very happy with my purchase      
750,5.0,                       speaker sounds good for what it is  plays well  love the blue     
751,5.0,                       my husband and i both love the way vinyl sounds and going to flea markets and antique shops  i bought this so we could have some time hunting for records together and it has been great  it also has a bluetooth function so you can play anything on it through a phone or tablet  speakers are great too      
752,4.0,                       a nice inexpensive way to listen to my dusty old lps  disappointed in that the bluetooth is apparently only so other devices can use the speakers  i was hoping to be able to transfer from albums to phone  speaker has almost no bass  so you ll want to use an external one for much listening  not bad for the money  and i can enjoy some old music once more      
753,2.0,                       this player will not give you the warmth a record should have  internal speakers are a joke  and even hooked up to pioneer receiver and bose speakers the treble and graininess is almost unbearable  stay away  waste of money   the only reason i m giving   stars is because i can use the bluetooth function     
754,5.0,                       this was a father s day gift  my dad was ecstatic  i ve never seen him so happy to receive a gift not have i ever seen him more protective of a gift  as soon as he listened to the albums that were given to him  he boxed it back up and placed it out of harm s way  i m buying one for myself soon      
755,5.0,                       bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and we both use it all the time  this is a really high quality player  especially for the price  we haven t used the bluetooth capabilities at all yet   just the record playing  we ve probably played    hours worth of music on it   it hasn t skipped a beat yet      
756,4.0,                       this record player is exactly what i needed to play my old    records from the      s  the sound quality is not that good but the records are not in great shape  either   so  they sound exactly like they did when i played them back in the day  i ve had no electrical problems as mentioned by other reviewers      
757,5.0,                       purchased as a christmas gift for my husband  and he loves it  it is well made  sturdy  has a unique    s style design  and the sound is excellent      
758,1.0,                       wouldn t play any of my records without skipping  this record player is very cheap for a reason  because it isn t reliable   the sound quality was very poor and i wouldn t recommend anyone waste their money on this product      
759,4.0,                       i got this as a christmas gift for my teenage son he really liked it it was a very unique gift idea  he s obsessed with all things american flag so the fact that this was offered in the american flag pattern was amazing and perfect for him    the sound quality could be a little better though it s kind of hard to hear and a little muffled     
760,5.0,                       probably the best     bucks i ve ever spent  i ve not even tested the bluetooth connectivity though  the built in speakers get plenty loud to rock out with a one year old  chopin  leo sayer  elton john  and black sabbath tested  it also plays old singles fine with the included chip      
761,5.0,                       liked the ease of use and the decent sound   i used it to play the robert mitchum  nice girls don t stay for breakfast lp i purchased which i could not get in cd format      
762,1.0,                       i tried plugging it in and turning it on for the first time today  and not only did it not turn on  the thing started smoking  i called amazon s customer support and they were of no help  i wasted my money on this        
763,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          when my mom passed she left me all of her vinyl records  i bought this record player so i could hear   album that was my favorite when i was younger  i was not disappointed at all with my purchase  i was iffy with the mix reviews but i m glad that i bought it anyways     
764,3.0,                       got it today  it has a bit of a muffled sound actually  also  i m not sure if it was supposed to come with an aux cord  if so  i didn t get it  the packaging was really big was the product was protected for sure  when i opened it  the needle point was off so i had to snap it back in place  there s also some wood chipping inside  not sure what that s about  overall for the price  it s alright  the sound is loud though      
765,4.0,                       this was a gift for my mother  and she really liked it  the pink was truly a vibrant color  arrived well pkg and in excellent condition  the sound was pretty good for a portable i really don t know if you could find a better one  but definitely not like a home stereo  but i knew that when i purchased it     
766,2.0,                       it looks nice and it s cute  but if you want quality sound   this is the wrong thing to buy  literally i think an old style gramophone has more sound quality  i tried running the rca outputs though a graphics equalizer and still was not able to achieve a  reasonable  sound  this is a nice shelf decoration  not a turntable for a home system     
767,2.0,                       worked great for a couple days  then all records  all brand new  started skipping   it s almost as if the arm isn t quite weighted enough   records play slightly better when you weigh the arm down  record player is level  but the turntable seems to be off a little   i d return  but we threw the box away        
768,5.0,                       this is my first record player  i read many reviews that don t recommend these but it does the job  i love this thing  i got an amazon warehouse deal too and got it for super cheap      
769,3.0,                       what i disliked   it makes your record wobble like crazy  up and down   and it sounds like it s underwater robotic and the instruments sound extremely flat off key i liked that you can lock in the needle while transporting it  and that it s really cute in appearance and portable  i liked that you can play other music off it both aux in and bluetooth i liked the speakers pleasantly surprised with how loud they could go with good sound  i tested them just as bluetooth       
770,2.0,                       i thought it worked at first  but then it started skipping a lot on certain records  maybe that s because it wobbles as it spins  that s not good  sound quality is ok  but the headphone feature doesn t work perfectly  with headphones plugged in  some sound still came out of the speakers      
771,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          great product  sounds great and is easy to use  we even played some scratched or warped records and it did amazingly very easy to use and has step by step instructions if you are a beginner  like me      
772,5.0,                       i m in love with this turntable    i got it as a joke for my husband but i actually use it a lot more than i thought i would and it s awesome        
773,5.0,                       bought this for my wife for an anniversary gift and she absolutely loves it  she loves listening to the beatles   black bird  is her favorite  the sound quality of the built in speaker is awesome as well  if you like vinyl s then this is definitely a good and cheap  for the price  pick for a vinyl player  you won t be disappointed      
774,4.0,                       sound quality through the speakers is fair at best     but hooked up to a stereo the sound quality improves a bunch other than that it s pretty standard         
775,3.0,                       i was hopeful based on the comments but this was disappointing  the sound is just not good  no bass at all  the item itself is beautiful but this is definitely a  my first record player  item  i was going to return but someone bought it off of me for their kid      
776,2.0,                       i got this record player in july of       its now early spring of      and she kicked the bucket  my record player almost never moved from its designated spot in my room  i took very good care of it and now she just wont work    when i plug it in i can hear a hum from the speakers but the power light doesn t go on and when the wand is moved the records don t spin  i really loved this but i haven t had it long enough to justify it not working  cheap player for a too short but well lived life  get the square trade        
777,5.0,                       when your child thinks they re on to something new   enjoys vinyl records  easy to use  enough for a bedroom decent sound quality  she s happy with gift      
778,4.0,                       a good quality introductory turntable  setup is practically nonexistent   it s very plug and play  including bluetooth setup  my only complaint is the speakers are a bit  tinny  and lack bass  this can be remedied by using the speaker output  although that adds more equipment and reduces the portability  still  overall  i m pretty happy      
779,5.0,                       this victrola vintage   speed bluetooth suitcase turntable is perfect for my needs  the sound quality is great  i live in a fairly small house and with the volume at the halfway mark i can hear it all the way to the back  i like the size of the player and that you can close it when it s not in use  it s easy to operate  i haven t yet tried the bluetooth capability  overall a great purchase and i m glad it got it      
780,1.0,                       so i purchased this with no knowledge of record players at all  when i inherited a collection  but then i didn t get around to plugging it in  i know  terrible  until yesterday  maybe i got a lemon  but i tried multiple outlets and power chords and none work  and i m not the only one after reading reviews i should have read  total disappointment and waste of money      
781,2.0,                       i was super excited for this record player and it was really easy to use  i first played a classical record and thought all was well but then realized as soon as i played a vocal record that the tempo is completely off and the voices are either extremely pitchy or too low   extremely bummed  will be returning  plus it didn t even come with a replacement needle      
782,2.0,                       we tried a few different records but they all skipped on this record player right out of the box  i read reviews about the skipping and buying new needles  but i don t think i should have to buy a new needle for a brand new product  the sound quality is ok  but not great   disappointed for sure  i will be returning this product      
783,1.0,                       there is a design flaw with this product  the lid gets in the way of the record spinning  and i ve found most records  especially newer ones  can t clear it and end up sounding slowed and distorted  i removed the screws and disconnected the top to solve the problem  after reading reviews  many people are complaining about their music sounding distorted  and i wonder if this would fix their issue  i have no idea how this product made it to the shelf  it is not designed to function properly      
784,5.0,                       i bought this gift for my daughter   she loves retro and elvis presley   she s in love with her record player  sounds pretty good   the quality is even better     
785,4.0,                       this arrived quickly and well packaged  i bought it as a gift for my roommate and she loves it  i did misunderstand the bluetooth feature  it is a bluetooth device that you can connect other devices to and not the other way around  basically  it s a speaker  but that s my fault  i love the sound and quality of this product  should ve bought one for myself  i will soon      
786,5.0,                       i have tons of old lps that i hadn t player in years  it s in my kitchen nock and use it all the time for what it is  a portable  it sounds great   the case it is built into is compact and nice looking best thing i ve bought for myself in a long time  ok     
787,1.0,                       took forever to arrive then it did not have the power cord    we found a cord to use but it still didn t work  i should have read the reviews before buying      
788,4.0,                       the only thing i wish this thing had was a way to power it without plugging it in fortunately you must have a battery source other than that i absolutely love the product please my records just fine bluetooth connects just fine so far hundred percent best christmas present ever from boyfriend     
789,1.0,                       i knew full well that the built in speakers on this would be bad  and they are  here s the problem  i hooked it up to some external speakers using both the red white line out and the headphone jack and both still sounded terrible  if you dont care about audio quality  this is the turntable for you      
790,3.0,                       bought it as a gift for my mom  it worked great the first time  would not work the second time i will be buying an american made turn table next for her luckily it did not cost much      
791,1.0,                       save your money unless your just buying this as decoration  if its just decor go for it  if you want to hear skipping go for it  if you want crisp clear sound you might be disappointed      
792,5.0,                       bought as a replacement for a different budget record player that didn t last long  the sound quality is pretty good for the built in speakers  connected to a soundbar  it sounds even better  plays records as it should  and looks great doing it     
793,5.0,                       i was hoping to connect it to other speakers but unless they re smart speakers  can have them the speaker  look and connect    good sound  wish it had a repeat option  use it a lot      
794,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i love it  this is good for beginners like me  you can also turn on the bluetooth for speakers  it is easy to operate and there are a lot of colors to pick  i think the quality is perfect for its price  the only thing that i don t like is the quality sound of the speaker  honestly  it s not the best quality but as what i ve said it s okay because it s not that expensive  i played imagine dragons and coldplay vinyl and expecting my taylor swift vinyl in september      
795,1.0,                       i bot two of these for my kids and they re total rubbish  sound is horrible  and it scratches     gram records for some reason   not adjustable   get the audio technica for    instead and add a set of pc speakers      
796,1.0,                       junk junk junk  got it for my daughter for christmas   so disappointing  the record wobbles so its making the record skip  just opened it and will be sending back  highly upset this was the only thing she asked for and can t have fun with it for christmas     
797,1.0,                       one star because i can t give it no stars  bought for my daughter last christmas  she was away at college and didnt use it  we decided to play a record now that she is home and when we plugged it in smoke and turned it on  started coming out from under the turntable  very dangerous      
798,1.0,                       it was a very nice looking machine   i was going to use it for playing   rpm records and it was like chipmunks chattering and song played confusing   returned it the following day   sorry      
799,5.0,                       victrola has always been an amazing record player company  and they knocked this out of the park  too  absolutely amazing sound output  easy to operate  and just overall a great modern record player      
800,4.0,                       granddaughter enjoyed     
801,3.0,                       we love the look and sound    it is meant to be a blast from the past so i don t mind the manual operation of the needle arm etc   but the bt feature was nice and then it just stopped working  can t seem to figure out a fix       still love the look and the sound is really good for built in speakers   i want to retro sound though  keep that in mind      
802,3.0,                       victrola manufactured designs can be improved  considering the regressive platform used on this specific product   record player uses flimsy inefficient platform apparatus  causing damage to vinyl records played using this paradoxical disjunctive design     
803,3.0,                       i have to place a coin on the arm while playing records to avid it skipping  i would probably pay a bit more next time for a heavier arm to avoid skipping  for the price it works fine     
804,2.0,                       i ve ordered this record player before for my ex  this one came broken  super disappointing  i ve taken it to multiple record shops since i purchased it almost a year ago  no one seems to know what s wrong  it s a very basic record player  very little volume  etc  so for it to also come nonfunctional was even more disappointing      
805,1.0,                       my daughter this record player because she likes tie dye  but she was only able to use it about four times  before it quit working  the turn table stop working and she even to it to a place to see if they could figure out why it wouldn t work and none of the place could figure out the problem      
806,2.0,                       it didnt work  turntable motor never came on  we are returning it and trying a new one s  nd one worked once  my sons disappoint has made me decide never to order this brand of product again   im stuck with   record players that are garbage      
807,5.0,                       i had never used a record player before  this is super easy  sound is great  can be heard several rooms away  easy to connect to bluetooth  can be packed up to move easily  very pretty      
808,5.0,                       i bought this for my boyfriend because he had been wanting a record for a while    and this was an easy set up for begginer vinyl collectors      
809,5.0,                       guys     i m so happy i bought this turn table   the second it arrived i unboxed all my originals from the    s and got to it   and let me tell you  it is awesome   the sound quality is great   just as it was back in the day on my other record players  which for those days were pretty high end players    so there is no complaint here with the sound   the usability is also awesome  just like riding a bike   i didn t need to read the instructions since i m very familiar from growing up in the    s  lol   this player is awesome      
810,3.0,                       great gift for my child who has never seen a record before   lots of novelty there  but the sound quality of the speaker is terrible  i expected better      
811,1.0,                       this little junker is heading back to the return stack   the bluetooth simply didn t work  i couldn t get it to connect to anything   i also tried to hook it up to an external speaker using a wire  and that didn t work either   f a i l   i had better little record players when i was   years old      
812,5.0,                       love it  the speakers are good quality for such a simple little thing  i m sure it ll sound even better when we hook it up to some legit one  love the look and can t wait to get more records to play on it      
813,5.0,                       beautiful record player  it came exactly as it was supposed to   new and in the box  the beautiful teal blue didn t disappoint  the speaker on the record player isn t as fantastic as a full surround sound system  but it is pretty great  i couldn t believe that it had three speeds  awesome      
814,4.0,                       nice little record player  easy to move around  not a bad sound  lost a star because it has no controlls for bass so sounds arnt what i like     
815,2.0,                       it worked great for about   days   the player won t stop spinning when you return the arm to the resting position   now it keeps spinning when you try to change the record unless you turn it off   disappointing as my husband was excited to receive it for xmas      
816,5.0,                       i bought this for my best friend for christmas and not only does it look good  it works perfectly  great product and a really nice price for this item     
817,5.0,                       i am so in love with this record player  my husband bought it for me for christmas  it is the best gift ever  it is easy to use  the sound is fantastic  i especially love the color  all the color choices are terrific  if i could give more than five stars i would      
818,3.0,                       great little record player   my only problem was that i received it with the band that moves the turn table unattached   when it wouldn t spin i researched on the internet and my husband attached the band   it was missing the adapter for    rpm records   i purchased one at a local record store     
819,2.0,                       this thing worked for   minutes  sounded terrible and is very cheap  almost like a novelty item not for real use  given   stars because the returns process seems easy  don t purchase      
820,5.0,                       i love this  let s me play all my old records      
821,5.0,                       i bought this record player for my daughter s birthday  it s rustic appearance goes great with her style and decor  she loves the sound  the features  and the look of it a lot      
822,2.0,                       the box came horribly damaged and when i opened it up the record player was missing the power cord  there were also large white splotches covering the record player which looked like someone had stuck stickers to it and then tried to scrape them off  i don t know if this is just because i ordered used or what but i can t really recommend this product      
823,5.0,                       this is the  nd one i have purchased in two years  love it  perfect for my brother who loves to play records and does so everyday  stands up to the constant wear like a pro  sounds great       
824,2.0,                       it s cute but i m returning it  the sound quality is bad and for some reason mines constantly jumps records  not a good experience      
825,5.0,                       it is almost like the one i had growing up but it has bluetooth  the sound is great and i love it      
826,3.0,                       it s  good except i want to play my lps in the park and i can t with this portable palyer  it s only portable providing u have an outlet   not good for any environment because it always has to be plugged in as opposed to the sharper image one   you can charge it goooooo  anywhere        
827,2.0,                       this wouldn t be a terrible purchase if at least it had a decent output but it doesn t even have that going for it  don t bother getting this  spend a bit more and get a better record player      
828,3.0,                       all worked well with this cute little portable player when it was initially set up  but then the internal speakers stopped working  tried plugging in to the headphone jack but still no sound  we had to return it  i gave it   stars though because i m sure it was just a faulty unit      
829,2.0,                       arrived totally doa   turntable doesnt spin  no power light  etc update   the  rd party refunded my payment immediately   good customer service      
830,1.0,                       the product looked nice  but was poor quality   we bough   brand new albums to go with this purchase  and all   albums skipped   we were confused about which one was the problem  the vinyls or the player   all had various levels of skipping   we were only given    days to figure it out   which makes sense because you wouldn t want to stand by a bad product thus the short return window   anyway  bought a new player and found out it was indeed a lemon we were stuck with      
831,1.0,                       i bought this for my daughter  after two months  the power stopped working  the seller refuses to replace their defective product and instead keeps sending me an audio cord that somehow is supposed to fix the power issue  i do not recommend buying this and definitely do not recommend this seller      
832,4.0,                       solid construction and good operational quality for the price  youre limited with connection options on the unit for sound output but the quality of sound is decent  im not a fan of how the   s hang over the edge of the unit aesthetically  but thats a minor thing  easy to use and store away      
833,5.0,                       loved this  it s been awhile since i ve been able enjoy my old lps   works well and is simple to setup   love the flag wrapped design   enjoying all my old records   thank you      
834,5.0,                       this is pretty neat for the price   don t expect bang   olufsen sound out of this  but not bad for listening to vinyl   the size and case make it easy to store away when not in use   i have really enjoyed listening to my old albums      
835,5.0,                       i bought it for my daughters birthday and she absolutely adores it   i bought her a couple of albums as well   my older daughter now wants one   since it s portable  it s a little less durable than a stand alone model  but they would rather it be portable   i am getting ready to order another one for my older daughters birthday next month      
836,3.0,                       it s a decent record player  you get what you pay for  sound is ok  the turntable is lopsided so everything sounds a little weird  the pieces like the needle arm etc are all very light and seem very breakable  but the case is durable and the bluetooth works fine  my son enjoys it      
837,5.0,                       my daughter used her birthday money on this after doing her own research  she loves it  sound quality is good enough that sometimes i have to tell her to turn it down a little  it s definitely a great choice for beginning vinyl lovers      
838,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          best purchase i did ever  i wanted to get a turntable for a while now and this was the best choice  i m not an expert and i don t have too many records  yet    but for the price it s more than i expected  the sound is excellent no need for an additional speaker  highly recommended      
839,5.0,                       got this as a gift for my brother  he absolutely loved it  its portability and size are awesome  the sound volume is appropriate not too loud or too low  bluetooth works fine  plays different speeds and sizes  absolute success      
840,1.0,                       its been determined by customer support that i need a replacement and they are now ghosting me almost at one year it no longer spins the discs without manually pushing it  sound now muffled and sounds mute  replaced needle did not fix  trying to return or replace but do not see that option      
841,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          my son has been looking to buy this for awhile now and so i decided to get it for him for a first timer  this is a great record player  the sound quality could probably be a little better  but hey  you get what you put for      
842,5.0,                       super cute and portable record player  for the money i think it s a great option  not sure why there are complaints about the speakers as the music can be heard throughout our two story home  if you re looking for something simple and compact this is it      
843,1.0,                       i purchased this item used in very good condition and when i received the record player it did not work at all  nothing worked not the bluetooth pairing  headphone jack  output jack  and when playing a record you could barely hear the song  the volume was turned up all of the way and everything was on  thus is by far the worst record player i have ever used or seen  very disappointed        
844,3.0,                       it s great as a portable device but the speakers are poor  i wasn t expecting it to be wonderful either  i know it is compact and cheaply made but the speakers are not great  the sound quality is poor  i wasn t a fan  i have since hooked it up to better speakers but if i had known it was this poor  i would have just ordered a different turntable      
845,5.0,                       bought this for my sister for christmas and she went crazy for it  she doesn t actually play anything on it  it s more for decoration and being fancy   she literally screamed in my ear when she got it so i can say it was a success  portability is great and was very easy to carry around from point a to b      
846,5.0,                       i bought this for my daughter as a bday gift   she received it before the actual delivery date  which was nice  she gave it   thumbs up  she loves the turquoise color  i may just buy myself one      
847,2.0,                       i received this turntable as a christmas gift and when i set it up the turntable was sooo wobbly  when i put my record on it and started it up  it immediately scratched my vinyl  so upset  i was out a new record and returned the turntable  replaced it with a much better quality one      
848,4.0,                       it s a super cheap turntable so you can t expect too much  the pros are its portable  lightweight  and plays through bluetooth and aux cord as well as records   the cons are its cheap plastic feel  the sound is nearly all treble  and parts like the needle seem easily breakable   for its price though i d say it s worth it      
849,5.0,                       well worth every dime spent  when i played my records i was over whelmed with emotions listening to sweet sounds of real music  to see this box s bring out so much sound i could not believe my ears  i would recommend this to everyone  this is a must buy product if you like the feel of going back in time  love  love  loooooooooove it    would love to know how i can purchase extra needles for storage  i love this player so much i never want to be without enough needles  please can you email me this information thank you much  think i just found the perfect christmas gifts for family     
850,5.0,                       a good simple vinyl player with good sound  nothing special but all you need to simply play vinyls  should make a good addition to a bigger system one day      
851,2.0,                       i m new to collecting and playing vinyl  so i guess i underestimated how much a good turntable costs      simply isn t enough for quality sound  the sound quality on this is quite terrible  fuzzy and tinny sounding  the plastic on it also feels cheaply made and the product feels cheap and flimsy all around  it gets the job done  i guess  it does play my vinyls  but it s not a good quality product all around      
852,1.0,                       received it  it was supposed to be a gift for my daughters bday tomorrow so i opened it to wrap it and it s black not red  i m furious  it s going to ruin her bday the box says red but the it s black    totally unacceptable         
853,4.0,                       i purchased this for my wife as a christmas gift and we have used it several times since she opened it on christmas day   very easy to use  she also uses  the bluetooth option to listen to music from her phone   the sound quality isn t great  but it s not bad  pretty much what you would expect for this price point      
854,2.0,                       this was purchased as a christmas present  shortly after we started using it we noticed that it would intermittently stop in the middle of a record  it seems do it more on    s than lp s  i think i would probably buy a better record player if i had to do it again      
855,3.0,                       great brand  great sound but was not pleased they sent me the wrong design twice  i did not receive the rye dye design like i preferred  they insisted on the british flag design  after the second try  i figured to go ahead and keep it and cover it with cool stickers lol     
856,3.0,                       i was really sad that i can t hear a record  hardly at all  even with external speakers  i bought it to play records and because i love the map design  it does connect nicely to bluetooth and external speakers  so it s like a really cute bluetooth speaker  but don t buy this if you re looking for a record player      
857,1.0,                       didn t play records properly   actually bought a record stabilizer and the still didn t play correctly   music on all records we tried sounded distorted      
858,5.0,                       if you understand that this is not an expensive unit and it will not preform better than one  you will be happy unbeatable overall value wife uses it to play old records for her mom happy wife  happy life no regrets buying this inexpensive unit      
859,5.0,                       this isn t a top of the line record player and i don t think that s the point  it s convenient because it s small and i can carry it to wherever i want to go  i ll listen to it at my house while doing whatever then i take it to my girlfriend s house  sound quality isn t that bad either  perfect for regular sized rooms      
860,3.0,                       excellent dieting and very well conceived  unfortunately the sound quality from the internal speakers is dreadful  however i purchased on the basis of it having bluetooth  however the bluetooth is only designed to have incoming signal and does not send the deck output thru bluetooth to say  a sound box for superior quality i am able to use the phone jack to my bose sound box as a means of improving the audio but this is so untidy      
861,1.0,                       this record player will not work play on newly pressed vinyl    it will play old vinyl  new pressed vinyl is pressed super tight  for better sound  and the cuts or grooves are not as deep  so the needle will skip  so if you plan on loading up on newly pressed records  look for a higher quality player          
862,5.0,                       the sound quality is exactly like i expected   it s on par with an actual record player from back in the day   this is good enough for my teen who is into retro stuff      
863,5.0,                       pretty decent turn table   comes with everything you need to use it  aside from a blue tooth but that doesn t matter  and it s really easy to use and work with  seems to play my records pretty well  just with a slightly higher pitch in the audio  however that could just be the records fault and not the turn tables  would make a great gift for anyone into vintage things      
864,5.0,                       granddaughter loves it  especially bluetooth feature  she s becoming a fan of vinyl borrowing records from my college days and adding new purchases of current artists     
865,1.0,                       one month and   days after receiving item  it quit working    days too late to return it   we ve only used a few times as we didn t have records before purchasing the record player don t waste your money      
866,5.0,                       after reading through amazon reviews for about an hour  i finally settled on this product for my husband s birthday gift  we have used it about   times so far and it has worked flawlessly  it isn t super loud  but good enough for every day use in our home  so far hard played both old and new vinyl records  i also like that it is easily portable      
867,5.0,                       bought this for my tween granddaughter who is just getting into vinyl records  she absolutely loves it and appreciates the bluetooth option      
868,5.0,                       i love this record player   from the sound of all the wonderful records we play to the cute design of the record player  it is exactly what i was looking for to pull my decorating together  the use of it is quite easy   many more jam sessions to come       
869,5.0,                       i pulled it out of the box and made sure it worked before i gave it to her  awesome sound quality for what you pay  worth it      
870,5.0,                       loved  gave it as a gift and has been a lifeline for my friend  she was able to find needles and accessories for it easily and it connects with her home wifi and allows her to play anything she likes through it  manages to be portable and practical while still being a good record player      
871,4.0,                       my daughter loves that she can hook up her phone   play other music through the bluetooth  it s pretty cool to see her enjoying records as well  it s important to make sure this player is absolutely level to prevent any skipping      
872,5.0,                       great product  arrived in perfect condition  was super easy to assemble  and works great  super simple and easy to use and i would definitely recommend      
873,5.0,                       great beginner record player  super fun  works great right out of the box  easy to use  sounds like a record player  not too loud  nothing special  but it gets the point across  this is not for high quality playback but is super nostalgic  speakers are not extremely loud but the do put out a good volume  my favorite part about it is the easy transport  just take your record off and close everything up in the case  really convenient      
874,5.0,                       i bought this as a gift  but he likes every aspect of it   for the price it works exactly as expected   if you want something extremely fancy or high quality this may not be for you  but the price point on this product is great   he enjoys being able to play the records that were otherwise collecting dust      
875,2.0,                       i feel a little guilty giving this product a   star review   but when it arrived in an undamaged amazon box  the boxed item inside was pretty smushed on one end   even the styrofoam around the player was broken and crumbling  i took out the player and gave it a once over  looked okay but i won t really know until my son gives it a spin on christmas day  i would have returned it  but wasn t convinced i could get a replacement before xmas      
876,1.0,                       i purchased this record player because i loved the portbility of it  i m also a huge fan of the union jack flag  since there is no weight to the arm  any record that i played created a  slow drag  sound  unfortanely  i ended up returning it      
877,4.0,                       great price but sound isn t up to par  it has decent volume but lacks substance  bass and treble      
878,1.0,                       terrible     
879,2.0,                       i ve used the player three times and it skips while playing records  i ve only used new records  so it is not an issue with the albums having scratches  it is definitely the player s poor quality  this is disappointing because i have heard read great reviews about victrola      
880,5.0,                       i believe this was my teenager daughter s favorite christmas gift  not sure if she utilizes the bluetooth feature or not   she is constantly playing records  sound quality is great for the price  would recommend      
881,4.0,                       i think this was a good place to start for me  i doubt it will be the only one i ever get   who knows  its ok  it looks great   the looks get it another star  it sounds like   stars  maybe   depending on how good the record is  i m not a hater at all being real  its a good purchase for the money      
882,2.0,                       so sorry to say that we could not get the bluetooth connected after trying   different devices  also when switching to bluetooth  it would shut off  had to return but wowza    taking it to kohl swas a breeze  reordering   hoping  also hoping for earlier delivery than   month away       
883,2.0,                       cheap  cheap  cheap  the part of the player that plays the records just pops on and off  the records don t play cleanly  it will do in a pinch  but this is definitely not high fidelity      
884,1.0,                       player skipped and required adjusting the speed of the record from the second time we used it  i bought it because it had good reviews  but i m returning it and wouldn t buy anything from victrola again  looks like you get what you pay for  which is to say  not much      
885,5.0,                       sound quality is not great but that s to be expected when you pay so little for an item that s normally priced very high  great for beginners or people who have an older album on vinyl that they d like to listen to without spending mad money on a turntable      
886,5.0,                       love the player   bluetooth feature plays other devices through player speakers   have to use aux cable to play player to a speaker  it does not connect wirelessly and play to a speaker      
887,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i love it  perfect for what i need    just wanted to start playing old christnas records again   the speaker sound reminds me of the one i had when i was a kid  very nice for the price     
888,5.0,                       the sound quality is so good and it came in quicker than it said  i actually bought it as a gift for a friend and she loved it  i am giving this a full review though because i bought myself one but    they are much cheaper at walmart at the moment  i dont know how long that deal will last though  it is all working great and some come with a spare needle and a promo code  it was also packaged very nicely      
889,4.0,                       got this as a gift for my brother  solidly built  works as advertises  speakers are a bit tinny and weak  but i wasn t expecting them to be the best  can be confusing to get this going   actually had to read the directions overall good product about what i expected  my brother loves it      
890,1.0,                       it often has what i can only describe as a hiss or static that pulses with the vocals  i really wish i d saved a little more and bought a proper turntable      
891,5.0,                       this is so incredibly cute and hip looking  i wanted to write a view and recommend it if you re thinking about purchasing this   i got the white one   looks really cool in my daughter s room   and it does work pretty well  too   if you care about sound  you ll need to hook this up to better speakers   obviously the built in one it comes with isn t going to be that great      
892,5.0,                       the turntable felt a little wobbly  so i opened it all up to make sure it was screwed in properly  everything was nice and tight  records play great  bluetooth was easy to connect to  i ve had issues connecting to other devices   and the sound is pretty decent for a     player  i love their versatility of being able to use it as is  or plug it into my bose system for better sound quality  one of my favourite purchases ever      
893,5.0,                       i purchased this a gift for my nephew   the look he had when he opened it was worth it s size in gold   he loves it   so do i   bluetooth was very easy to set up and records sound great on it   the music doesn t blare out of it   but does get loud enough to enjoy   also the hook ups to put connected extra speakers in it  if u want it louder  is a great option to have   the color looks amazing       
894,5.0,                       this was purchased as a gift for my    y o niece   with the resurgence of interest in vinyl records  it is the perfect size to set up and store away when not in use   the bluetooth feature allows her to send music to external speakers  so she is very happy with this record player      
895,5.0,                       my    year old granddaughter took all my old    s back to colorado without any way to play them  i had to send her a player so she could listen to them and she was impressed it had blue tooth  the fact that it is portable made it possible for her to take it with to collage  hope they will love my old tunes      
896,1.0,                       out of the box christmas morning and it is skipping and scratchy  brand new vinyls  more than one to make sure  so sad      
897,3.0,                       the bluetooth sound was great but it was defective and would not play the records  the record sound was scratchy and quiet  the quality did not seem as nice as other brands      
898,4.0,                       very few problems to find with this player   it works really well   however  if you have any old vinyl s and they are a bit curvy they will hit the player itself because the very back of the player is really just a hair away from the vinyl itself when it is being played   otherwise a really nice machine      
899,1.0,                       wasnt the best sound quality but i was happy with it at first  unfortunately  though i ve only used it twice  now the power won t come on  ive tried   other compatible power cords and still nothing   only had this about       months  it s been sitting on my tv stand  too late for a return so basically its    bucks thrown in the trash can        
900,5.0,                       couldn t be happier with our new record player     packaged perfectly  very easy to operate  excellent sound  excellent quality  the perfect look   exactly what we wanted   exactly      
901,2.0,                       super disappointing  skips all over my brand new record and does not rotate evenly  sound is pretty bad  don t waste your money    believe the negative reviews  i read them and was hopeful it would be okay because i didn t need anything fancy  but this will straight up destroy your records  such a bummer      
902,5.0,                       beautiful and works perfectly  worth every penny  just in love      
903,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          super awesome  definetly should be plugged in to an external speaker for a more crisp sound  great player for beginners  love it      
904,5.0,                       love the color  i love how it closes like a small suit case  works really well  sound is great  can also use    records  you must have a plastic insert for the    s     
905,2.0,                       it was a gift for my friends and they just love it  sound quality is great   design is elegant yet very  retroish   anyway  highly recommend  so i decided to buy another one for my sister and instead of gray color one  vinyl recorder came in red  very disappointed     
906,1.0,                       this was my first record player  i was naive to buy something so cheap  but my friend got something basically identical from another brand and it works fine  from the first time i used mine it bounces and skips in the same spot on every record  i tried to fix it and missed the return period but it s a piece of sh   that makes my favorite songs sound garbled and will damage my records if i keep trying to make it usable      
907,5.0,                       absolutely perfect    this nostalgic      s rca victrola is just what i was looking for   not only do you have the name   they did a great job with the player at an amazing price point      i ve added a couple custom stickers and now it s perfect       i am once again enjoying my elvis presley music as it was meat to be      thanks for a great product          
908,4.0,                       my daughter really likes her new record player   i would recommend this item   i was a little bummed that i ordered this for her for christmas and wanted the white one  but received the turquoise one   there was no time to exchange it and she said it will do   the whole family is enjoying it      
909,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i ordered a mint green one and it arrived mint green just not so pigment  so it looks white but when taking a closer look it s mint green  i was relieve tho that it didn t arrive as a robin egg blue like some people have reported it to arrive overall it s a great record player for beginners and i was confused cause i didn t find anywhere that this had bluetooth but it does which is awesome       
910,5.0,                       got this for my brother for christmas  he loved it and started playing music off of it instantly after he opened it up  i got him a couple brand new vinyls and my grandma had a ton of old ones  every one he tried sounded amazing and made everyone feel kinda nostalgic  i got him the all black one and the handle on it made it really easy to carry around  it was a great gift and fool proof  love it      
911,3.0,                       the only way this will sound good is if you plug it into a legit speaker like a sound bar  on it s own the quality is just semi screechy  other than that the look and feel are great      
912,5.0,                       well i thought it would be a great gift for someone in my family whom had plenty of old records  they haven t even opened it yet will update as soon as the old b    trd opens the box     
913,5.0,                       this record player obviously isn t going to give you professional sound  but that s not why i bought it  it s perfect for my inexpensive albums that don t require super quality sound  it s a record player that works and takes up very little room  very easy to set up  just plug it in  i m very pleased with this purchase      
914,1.0,                       the sound was actually decent if you kept the volume low  however  we played several different records and they all would skip at certain points on the album  i returned it and bought a second one thinking it was just a defective one  the  nd one skipped on all the records as well  was really disappointed because it was such a perfect size and we loved the look of it  just poor quality     
915,2.0,                       not of best quality   sound quality is poor and gimmicky  you cannot connect via bt to get better sound you need to connect to a tuner receiver for better listening experience  this limits mobility not recommended to connect your device because of poor sound quality overall good for beginners  who don t want to spend a lot so what you see  is what you buy  should make a nice conversation piece      
916,4.0,                       you get what you pay for  works  my daughter loves it so that s all that matters      
917,5.0,                       wonderful christmas present to my    year old  she loves it   i can hear her blasting to s music from my room     
918,5.0,                       i love this record player  i can play my old albums from the    s  it works perfect and sounds great  i am very happy with this purchase      
919,5.0,                       cute  practical  and fun  i bought this victrola record player for my dorm room  the bluetooth function makes it instantly versatile  note that it must be connected to power  it doesn t have a battery like i first expected  the suitcase itself seems to be made out of a light wood  so it is not too heavy  i bought this in the eggshell blue color and it goes perfectly with fairy lights and a vintage map i have on my wall  would definitely recommend to college students or anyone looking for an affordable vinyl player      
920,5.0,                       great gift for my dad  was worried about the quality but it was beautiful and he loved it  brought him a ton of nostalgia and he was finally able to bring his records out  it s been over    years  spent our christmas listening to records  got him a readers digest record with all the types of christmas music  classical  country  traditional  etc   super fun  best of all  was adorable      
921,5.0,                       my daughter loves it  the price was just right  we spend more money on the records than we did on the record player      
922,1.0,                       right out of the box a speaker was broken  sounds terrible  disappointed with the quality  still no response from seller      
923,1.0,                       it stop working   i thought it was the cord so i ordered one   come to find out it was the record player   i just bought it late march  i can t return it cause may         was the last day i could return it   i m so irritated because i really liked it      
924,1.0,                       the sound is as expected for such small speakers  you get what you pay for  i m giving this one star because the turn table stopped spinning after about   seconds and would never start again  i read the instructions thoroughly and am sure it is a defect  i will be returning and buying something a little more high quality      
925,5.0,                       sent to my dad early  christmas present  he has a  vinyl  collection  he said the  sound  was  amazing and  loves all the bluetooth and  other  features  he has  told  several people about his  gift  thank you for helping to make my dad s  holiday s special      
926,3.0,                       serviceable turntable  do not expect it s own speaker to do   if you want to hear the quality of raw sound as we had from old rock albums on a full stereo system   however  output to good speakers thru equalizer works     
927,5.0,                       came earlier than planned  easy to set up and great sound quality      
928,1.0,                       received the replacement because  st one didnt work  this one missing plug   other parts   certainly not  like new  or  new  returning this one   going elsewhere      
929,5.0,                       an inexpensive way to play your vinyls   for the price  this is a solid unit with dependable internal sound qualities   it does have the ability to easily plug in external speakers for a better sound   at this price point  i would definitely recommend this unit      
930,5.0,                       i got this for my grandkids   the sound was good  i wish it had a auto return arm   but for the price it seems to be a decent quality      
931,5.0,                       i bought it for my    year old granddaughter for christmas and she received albums from her parents so she very happy      
932,5.0,                       i ve had my eye on these forever    am so glad i finally gave in   purchased one  it s great quality   i love that it s portable       
933,2.0,                       skips  skips on new and old vinyls  just not right  read other reviews because it says it all  now i m concerned about a refund  very disappointed as was the recipient      
934,4.0,                       the sound is quite thin but what can you expect from a     record player   the bluetooth input connection seems to have some issues   i ve been unable to get a consistent stream   it stops every    seconds for approximately    seconds   otherwise it s a good deal     
935,1.0,                       wish i could give this zero stars  both of the ones i ordered were very loosely built  turn plate was jiggly  second one i ordered  same and turntable was jammed and wouldn t spin and when it would it would spin intermittently      
936,4.0,                       this is nearly just what i wanted to play some old records   i wish it had the mechanism that held records above the turntable so i could play records one after the other because i have a lot of   s  the sound is good and it s very compact which i like   overall a cool player for the money     
937,4.0,                       i love that it is compact and a carrying case  i took it to ahoq my kids what a victrola looks like and they were so impressed  i love that it includes the bluetooth and aux settings as well  makes it incredibly valuable  the sound is ok but definitely loud  i had to turn it down a bit though because at max it sounded like speaker was gonna blow  i am happy with this victrola as a starter      
938,3.0,                       i got this as a gift for my mom  the one time i listened to it  i realized just how poor the built in speakers are  if you want any quality in the audio  you have to buy additional speakers  would probably be better suited as a novelty gift for a child      
939,5.0,                       bought this for our niece back in july  over   months ago  and checked with her over christmas if the product still works and if she still uses it  she brought it upstairs from her bedroom and put on a record and says she loves it and uses it all the time  she was very excited to show it off      
940,5.0,                       got this for my boyfriend and he loves it  it adds a great touch to your room and is perfect for playing music  bluetooth works great the sound isn t the best and the most clear but it s not like it is horrible either  it s great for your room and i think anyone would appreciate this as a gift with their favorite artist bands vinyl      
941,2.0,                       i just got my record player and was overjoyed  worked great but upon second time using it the lift lever stuck in the backwards position and i couldn t get it forward again sadly sending it back and going to purchase something with less mixed reviews  sometimes you should listen to the negativity even with a high star rating      
942,5.0,                       very nice record player  simple to use and i love listening to my old records  the sound is great and i love that i can take it with me      
943,5.0,                       actually  this is a great value for the price  it s great for children  it s great for listening to your old vinyl  however  the sound is more like a small portable radio  that said  i still feel that it is a fine value for the money  if you are looking for full bodied sound  spend more        
944,2.0,                       within hours of getting this record player it began making my records sound like they were underwater  by the second day i had it  it was basically completely broken and the speed was all kinds of messed up  i honestly do not recommend this item  save up a little longer and buy a nicer one  and so your research  i somewhat bought on impulse  did return      
945,2.0,                       bought two for my kids for christmas       it is now august      and neither one of them still works  not great quality  poorly made  i am embarrassed of this purchase      
946,1.0,                       bought this product for my daughter and her vinyls   when we receive this player on the first day we tried it  the speakers were distorted and the sound just wasn t pleasing to the ear   this product looks good but it is idefinitely not a good quality   we were in the midst of covid    pandemic and we couldn t  return this product  i am going to reach out to amazon now and see if i can return it      
947,5.0,                       love this vintage bluetooth turntable exactly what it describes  it s everything i thought it should be  i bought it for part of our   yr old granddaughters christmas    she absolutely loves it  great sound  very vintage   very affordable  very impressed  it s a must have  highly recommend      
948,5.0,                       this is my first record player and i adore it  it comes with a new needle and a few more things to get you started out right  and leaves you to it  its very comforting      
949,5.0,                       bought as a gift for someone who had old vinyl collection  with limited living space   for the price  an excellent way to relive music from vintage vinyl  enjoyed the evening sharing memories  cool little player  if you want sharp and loud  skip this one  if you want a cute  minimal space invading player  this is for you   the sound was better than expected      
950,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          so far so good  no complaints      
951,5.0,                       i got this awesome thing as a birthday present from my husband  and i love it    i wish i had more records to play on it  he got me the misfits record with this and it sounded like i was at a live concert  it was amazing        
952,1.0,                       i owned this for about a year but only had a chance to play music with it maybe   x or less  all of sudden  the motor stopped working      
953,1.0,                       absolutely horrible   never worked even after buying a new cord and now stuck with it  add in never receiving a call back from the company s cs dept after   calls and   voicemails  just disgusted almost beyond words     
954,3.0,                       stopped working after a couple months  i only used it   times  sounded good when it worked      
955,5.0,                       sounds great even on my old    s and    s records that are warped and scratched  i m extremely happy with this purchase      
956,1.0,                       as many have said  this unit arrived undamaged but without a power cord or instructions   once a proper cord was purchased the unit was still doa   i don t understand if people are being sent returned units or if the quality control is so atrocious that easy things like this slip by   the only thing this has going for it is the way it looks   do not buy        
957,5.0,                       my record player that i received was in perfect condition and beautiful looking i love the color and it looks just like the picture the sound can be very loud or very quiet which i like so i can listen to records at night  sadly the handle on the needle is very very tiny so it s hard to pick it up with the handle but of course you can pick up the needle other ways  i love this record player and i use it everyday i plan to continue using it everyday too      
958,1.0,                       not sure if these are like the   s floor models with the tube  but it didn t sound right at all  i would suggest buying locally since shipping can damage these dantiy treasures        
959,1.0,                       this worked great the first handful of times i used it  suddenly the sound quality went way downhill and everything was muffled and static  don t bother buying this      
960,5.0,                       was a little skeptical on the quality of this record player  but i plugged it in popped on a record and was completely amazed on how good it sounded  i highly recommend this record player even came with replacement needle      
961,1.0,                       this was not good at all  the sound quality is horrible and the turntable wobbled uncontrollably  we returned it      
962,2.0,                       i was so excited for this record player  when it arrived i noticed that the plastic under the turntable was loose  i put a record on  and heard nothing  when i pushed down on the loose piece  sound came out of the speakers and it sounded great  when i lifted my finger the sound stopped  the audio out to my stereo worked but that killed the ability to be portable and listen to records  so frustrated  now i have to wait all over again      
963,1.0,                       extremely tinny  i wasn t expecting high fidelity  but i did expect a little better than something i made when i was       
964,1.0,                       very unbalanced and unplayable even with the tone arm weighed down a bit  brand new records right out of the package skipped as soon as the needle dropped down onto the record  don t waste your time or money on this and spend a bit more for something that will work      
965,4.0,                       i got this record player for my    year old daughter for christmas  she loves it but when we first set it up it kept squeaking there was a plastic piece stuck under the turn table so we had to take it out  after that it sounded great definitely not the best of the best but it works well and sounds good  it is a big large in size though i m not sure if it s normal for a record player  but it is great      
966,3.0,                       it s cool and it worked fine  the biggest fault i d say it has that the lid doesn t really have a stopper to stay open  so it can just slam shut on one of your records if you bump the lid  while open  so be careful  it happened to us within the first   minutes of using it      
967,1.0,                       terrible  i bought a used one at a thrift store and it didn t work when i got home  nbd  it was used and a risk i took  but then i ordered a new one on amazon  and that also did not work immediately upon arrival  same problem with both  it won t spin  which obviously is essential for a record player  do not waste your money on such a terrible product      
968,1.0,                       i bought this in october  the sound quality wasn t great  but hey  it was    bucks   i only used it a couple times a month  about a month ago  the power stopped working  i turn the knob and sometimes the red light will flicker for a few seconds  but there is no movement  i ve tried different outlets  disconnecting cords  etc  with no change in results  i even waited a month to write this review to make sure it wasn t a fluke   buy at your own risk         
969,1.0,                       the package was dropped as we watched him take it out of the truck  it does not work what do we do and how many days do we have to return it  i don t know how everything works yet  we will write a review when we are done     
970,5.0,                       purchased for a    year old s birthday because she wanted a record player with the speakers built in  she didn t want my old system because it was huge    she loves the quality and i can hear it from downstairs clearly   i m lucky i don t mind her music      
971,4.0,                       the sound is surprisingly good  i bought a crosley on another site   years ago and the sound was awful  i like this record player it came with   needles  nice and portable i really like it      
972,1.0,                       bluetooth no sense  you cannot connect speakers with bluetooth   only other devices  so for what am i going to connect my cellphone to the record player      for headphones same thing you will need wires   yep    only with cables   so if you want  a descent sound you will need a really good speakers  good for decoration san jose  costa rica r      
973,2.0,                       the player was decent for the two weeks that we ve had it  then it just completely stopped working for no reason  we ve tried multiple ac adapters with no luck  we don t have the box anymore so i m not sure if it s able to be returned and replaced  daughter is super disappointed      
974,4.0,                       nice look clean authentic record sound with that crackle and pop that makes a record stand out      
975,5.0,                       good directions and a fun add to the house  we love having it and was super fun on christmas to listen to old vinyls      
976,3.0,                       it doesn t have the best sound  and there needs to be a way to adjust the tone arms balance  the sound could be improved if there was a way to blue tooth out to better speakers  on the plus side  it seems to be well made  and it looks good      
977,4.0,                       it s very easy to set up  i was expecting a little bit more of volume but you can always connect it to a bluetooth speaker to get it louder     
978,4.0,                       husband was very happy  although with having bluetooth  i thought i could connect to our surround sound but could not     
979,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          its what i expected  its not as tough construction as i d like but it s going to work for what i bought it for  i would not give it to a small child but it would be good for anyone who wants to listen to records without having to pay for a bunch      
980,3.0,                       the color is much different in person  it looks mint online  but in person it s much darker  as other reviews have stated  quality isn t great  we ve had success with all but one of our vinyls  it s not the record itself  as we tested it on our other record player which plays it just fine it s definitely a beautiful and functional piece though      
981,1.0,                       unfortunately the arm needle is not quite right so it just skips on all the records    i tried to email the company to see if there was anything that could be done to calibrate it   but never heard back from them      
982,1.0,                       this is a low quality turntable that try s to lure customers in with the bluetooth gimmick and cheap price  but you get what you pay for in this case  these cheap turntables have poor quality arms  which can  skate  across the record  this will scratch the record and skip your audio if you are getting into vinyl and looking for a starting turntable  do not resort to this line of tables  they will ruin your records and turn you off to the hobby  invest in a solid  study  reliable turntable      
983,3.0,                       sound isn t very great  my portable speakers are much louder and clearer  and the records skip horribly even brand new ones  have had it for over a year and i never use it because it s more annoying than not      
984,4.0,                       it was hard to get working  if it s not spinning when you turn it on to play the record then you need to check under that tray and make sure the belt is aligned  there s youtube videos on it also  good record player overall though  should have came ready to play instead of me having to almost take it apart to get it to work      
985,5.0,                       bought this as a gift and the recipient loved it  she already has bluetooth speakers so she doesn t use that feature heavily  but she enjoys playing vinyls and she really liked the union jack design on it      
986,3.0,                       be aware the bluetooth is not how you might think  i incorrectly thought this would pair with a better speaker however this is the server side so you can pair a different device to this and use it as the speaker  to play thru home theater i had to use rca cables      
987,5.0,                       easy set up  plugged into my jbl portable speaker  sound is perfection  i had no idea it would work so well      
988,5.0,                       bought it for my daughter   an old soul that should have been born in the    s  she loves it and it suits her perfectly     
989,4.0,                       bought this because i have a lot of vinyl albums   when i connect it to my soundbar i get a louder sound than the record player s small  speaker  it s not quite as good sounding as an amplifier and large speakers  bottom line it plays albums i haven t heard in years and i don t have to purchase said music      
990,4.0,                       i love that my son and i can listen to my recently passed father s records   we have been enjoying the blast from the past without having to spend a fortune   love this product for that   the sound is not magnificent  which isn t surprising for the price   we use it in a small room den  so it doesn t have to be the loudest sound to be fun to listen to      
991,1.0,                       speakers stopped working less than   months in  contacted the shop through multiple avenues with no response  i do not recommend the product or this seller      
992,4.0,                       me and my wife love vinyl this wasa great size and look for our little bar table  i only added   stars because the sound from the small speakers although loud are a tad twangy  but problem solved i hooked the headphone output to a set of pc speakers and it sounds great couldn t be happier     
993,5.0,                       i finally can play my old records that i ve been hanging onto  this little guy is amazing  the sound quality is fantastic  and it s pretty stylish  i also love the fact that you can connect devices to the bluetooth  i love this one      
994,4.0,                       i would have given everything a   star but i can t connect my jawbones to the player  my phone connects  but that s it so far  other than that it s a great vinyl player      
995,3.0,                       like the record player  brings back childhood memories  including the cheap tinny sound that came out of those little portable players  this thing sounds terrible  but the build quality is pretty good      
996,4.0,                       overall i think its pretty good  but its not the best it seems cheaply made but its great for beginners  this is a good alternative for looking for something cheaper and works good  i like that it came with an extra tip for when the other one wears out      
997,3.0,                       nice design as pictured  colors are bright  it started making a weird squeak noise only after   day when we move the needle hand to play a record  its annoying but still works      
998,5.0,                       so far this thing is very adequate and perfect for what i wanted  occasional vinyl enjoying  i had a new record i wanted to play and was apprehensive after reading other reviews that it would not play well  so far  no issues   the new record plays fine  no skipping  hoping this continues with other new records in the future for the price  it s definitely decent in my opinion  the speakers are fine but i ll likely add some better speakers just to get a more complex sound from it      
999,2.0,                       sound quality awful  but novelty fun   that is  u til is just stopped working   months after we got it  note  had probably only played    hours or less of music with it total   tried different outlet  different    power source  to no avail      
1000,4.0,                       obviously  we re not dealing with high end electronics here but it s a great little     turntable to take out on the porch   play records  i hook up my monsoon speakers   subwoofer   it sounds great  i haven t had it very long yet so it remains to be seen if it stands the test of time      
1001,1.0,                       the base records sit on while playing is extremely loose and flimsy  it seems like the heavier weight of newer records is more than it can handle  so they wobble excessively while spinning  causing skips and distortion  we returned one and tried another  but the same problem existed  so much for cheaping out and only spending     bucks for a player        
1002,3.0,                       i have just opened my record player  and i have been looking for records and ordered one  it is a    rpm but when i see the record player there is no    adapter    it s a bummer but guess i can still listen to other records but i am upset about this      
1003,1.0,                       it worked well and didn t use it for a wile and broke down  after not using it just didn t turn on  i used the original adapter and even bought new ones but nothing did the trick  so bummed out      
1004,5.0,                       i am just getting back into the vinyl world and this is a great starter player  it s cute  the color is accurate   light  easy to use  and provides a good sound  i also have to give major kudos to the manufacturer as it came without the    adapter and they immediately sent one after i wrote them  i had it within a couple of days   i recommend this player      
1005,1.0,                       speakers rattle  returned and have the same problem with the second one  save your money      
1006,1.0,                       i purchased this record player a year ago and it stopped working  we didn t use it to frequently and it recently just stopped powering on  i would not recommend this product  if you do purchase spring for the extended warranty you ll need it      
1007,1.0,                       quit after less than   months    use less than a dozen times      
1008,3.0,                       the center piece accessory for    rpm records was missing  when i called they said they couldn t get another one but gave me enough refund to order one  however   the one i ordered does not fit in the compartment made for it  it does work  but this is not satisfactory      
1009,1.0,                       got this product and haven t used it in   years  it was sitting on a desk all of this time untouched  i just tried to use it and boom  it doesn t even turn on  i guess it has a short life      
1010,4.0,                       great price  came with extra cartridge stylus  sent in warranty they sent a free gift  another cartridge stylus  nice  only issue is when the volume is turned high you can hear a hum out of the speakers      
1011,3.0,                       i have just received my record player and have not yet played it  the issue at this point i have is the color  i ordered the color that not only shows on the website but on the box  i ordered the seafoam aqua color and what i got was a blue turquoise  and reading other reviews i see this is not an isolated occurrence  otherwise  it s cute and i look forward to using it      
1012,1.0,                       this product was total trash  i  missed the return window  but right out of the box the light turned on and and didn t last very long  we ve tried various outlets as well as other trouble shooting methods from online but nothing works  i am so disappointed  we were so excited to finally listen to vinyl at home and now i am feeling like i wasted     of my money      
1013,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i noticed when i first played my record on this it s just producing a very weird sound quality  it sounds as though the music fluctuates between high and low  and also it sounds faster than it s supposed to be  not too thrilled with this player at the moment      
1014,5.0,                       awesome  volume is great depending on the album  but overall it is amazing  fast shipping and works like a charm      
1015,5.0,                       bought this as a gift for my son so he could play old records he inherited from his grandmother  it is similar to the one i had as a kid in the    s  not the greatest quality sound but authentic as original for sure  still   stars      
1016,1.0,                       junk  stopped working in    days   something wrong with the on off switch       of the time it won t power on   cute but i don t recommend      
1017,5.0,                       bring back many great memories of days ago  it plays my old records  some are    or so years old  just fine  music comes through the great built in speakers  small and super easy to move from room to room  i love it  give it a try  if you are as nostalgic as i am      
1018,4.0,                       i bought this for my grandson who loves the vintage records   i would have given it a   star review because i am overall pleased with it but the on off switch is reversed      
1019,5.0,                       playes all my records perfectly and the blue tooth is a plus and you can hook up direct to with the optional in put jack s as well bought a second for my mom and she love hers she s going to buy one for my brother as well     
1020,5.0,                       great product  great sound  easy to use  my    year old daughter loves it   the only issue was this was a birthday present and they didn t deliver it in a brown box  it was literally the product box showing exactly what it was  thank god i was home or it would have been stolen      
1021,5.0,                       ordered this item to allow me to play some old    record albums that i found among some of my dad s things  it plays beautifully and i am enjoying not only my dad s old collection but i can now share the storybook    records i saved from when my kids were little with my grandkids   the sound quality is very good and  so far  i have had lots of fun with it  and you can t beat the price   i  recommend it for casual  occasional use      
1022,5.0,                       i bought this to play my old    records and the old children s   rpm  records for my grandchildren  it worked well  packed safely and arrived onetime   it has been played at least    records in the last two days and sounds good   for a low cost player i have no complaints   i have not used the bluetooth and have no plans to use it      
1023,5.0,                       my daughter loves it  i feel the sound quality needs a bit of improvement but she says it s just me   i am    grew up with the original ones so i know the sound quality is a bit off   but hey it s not for me she loves so therefore i love it        
1024,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          for the price  hard to beat   built in amp  built in speakers  built in headphone jack  the   primary speeds you need  bluetooth   portable     
1025,4.0,                       it is as i expected  the sound quality is not bad  i plan on trying to hook it up to external speakers to improve the sound  otherwise  this is an excellent portable record player      
1026,5.0,                       i was worried about getting this due to some bad reviews but its honestly amazing  amazing sound  multiple speed settings  and looks great  amazing product       
1027,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i got this as a gift from my son for christmas and i absolutely love it  it sounds amazing and i can t wait to build up my vinyl collection      
1028,5.0,                       i bought two of these for my sons  nw they can play  and enjoy  my collection of lps from the      s      s   these are well made and sound great      
1029,4.0,                       i got this for my daughter for christmas  she likes it although it skipped very badly outnof the box even on new records  taping a dime to the top of the needle arm added enough weight to keep it from skipping      
1030,2.0,                       loud hum if connected to external speaker  internal speaker awful  i have       bluetooth speakers that sound better  they can do pretty nice things in this price range  although was not expecting great things for the price  this is just unusable  maybe defective  never tried it until outside warranty  cool looking and concept great      
1031,5.0,                       bought as a gift for my    yr old who loves old music and has never owned a record  set up was easy and the sound is surprisingly good      
1032,1.0,                       one cannot use bluetooth headphones or speakers to play records   one can only use the speakers on the victrola to play music from another device      
1033,1.0,                       we only played this for a few days and then the speed changed and we had to play a    rpm album at    rpm and then it went downhill from there  started skipping too   beautiful cover and we are heartbroken the quality is so bad   great idea      
1034,5.0,                       this is my first ever record player so i was a little nervous but it s very easy to use   such good quality     
1035,5.0,                       this is am amazing record player and deal  the sound quality is crystal clear  the blue color is beautiful  this arrived early and far exceeded my expectations      
1036,4.0,                       its would have been   starts if the whole plastics part where the vinyl goes would be more stuck on there  it moves to much to were i feel its very delicate but maybe some krazy glue will help  other then that good quality item  looks amazing has multiple features  not to heavy  pretty light i do wanna switch out the speakers but we ll see      
1037,5.0,                       this is a fantastic  inexpensive   starter  record player  the sound is lovely and it s quite easy to use      
1038,1.0,                       i never write reviews  but this is the most tinny sound ever  completely not worth it  please save yourself the waste of money and buy something else  also  within a week of purchase  the player started skipping because the arm is unbalanced  do not buy      
1039,5.0,                       i absolutely love this  it s not too big or too small  it s perfect  so glad i bought it      
1040,5.0,                       got this as a gift for my dad for father s day  he loves it  my parents are retired and love to sit outside bird watching and piddling around and this is perfect for them  the sound quality isn t perfect  but i wouldn t expect it to be  also very portable and easy to use  might have to get one for myself      
1041,4.0,                       very cute  easy to use  the sound quality isnt amazing but its good enough   also couldnt get it to connect to my speaker  but overall i really like it      
1042,5.0,                       bought this for my mom for christmas   and she loved it  i thought the sound was awful but she didn t seem to mind  build is decent        
1043,4.0,                       speakers used are substandard  looks great  works well bluetooth functionality only plays other source sound on its speakers  i would rather have bluetooth sound connectivity to other speakers which is missing      
1044,5.0,                       i love this product so much  i ve wanted a record player for a while and i finally got it and the quality is great and the tie dye looks amazing      
1045,1.0,                       this thing is a piece of garbage  rattles at max volume  not the little buckle  the dinky speakers  this thing skips on every record i have  and they are all unscratched and well cleaned  don t waste your money  get something that ll be stable and produce better sound than a     walmart bluetooth speaker      
1046,5.0,                       have not had a record player since i was a teenager    this one is awesome   the sound is clear and has plenty of volume   have not tried the bluetooth feature   not sure i need it  but my kids my give it a try   great product so far      
1047,1.0,                       the cord that came with the player absolutely did not work  now hunting for a replacement      
1048,5.0,                       this was a gift for my daughter s friend  she loves it  it was exactly what she wanted  she loves the bluetooth component and likes the retro record player  made a really cool gift  my daughter wants one too now      
1049,3.0,                       disappointed when this gift from santa wouldn t spin  step dad took it apart and saw the belt was loose  he found a youtube video   learned how to fix it  if the belt is prone to come off during shipment  then a simple troubleshooting insert would have helped  otherwise it s a great little player      
1050,2.0,                       the sound is good and i love the color that s why i got it  however  the body and knobs area is lifting from the box  i didn t notice this since i bought it a month ago and just started using it today  it works but if this is common then it s not a great quality      
1051,5.0,                       got this for my    year old for christmas  figured it would be a good starter player  and i was right  she loves it  could be a bit louder but the sound quality is perfect and she can take it wherever she wishes  good find for a great price     
1052,5.0,                       very good for the price  the only thing bad is the belt slips sometimes  and it s a pain to reinstall  but overall   this makes a great starter vinyl player  the default speaker sound is okay  but external speakers make it sound much more clearer      
1053,1.0,                       died after using it once in the first    days  company will not honor warranty despite their claims here and in the manual  support won t respond to emails or phone calls      
1054,5.0,                       the color is beautiful  vibrant  the product came quickly  and arrived unharmed  it plays my vinyls perfectly  the blue tooth is such a welcome perk  the speakers are plenty loud enough  and the quality is a      
1055,1.0,                       i wouldn t spend my money on this if i were you  please take my word of warning  initially i had to put a quarter on the needle just to get the player to even work and a month later it s not even functional anymore  if you want a record player just use the money to get a good one this is an instance where quality really does matter or else you ll end up with     down the drain and scratched records      
1056,5.0,                       i love my suitcase record player  compact  but it plays well   perfect size to bring along anywhere  sound is great too  hours of classic enjoyment  i highly recommend      
1057,5.0,                       i am thoroughly pleased with my purchase  i was so happy to be able to put the records my dad had collected from the   s   s to use and bring them to life  honestly  i really do think music sounds better on a record player  i had no issues with the bluetooth connectivity either  i was nervous about my purchase after i saw mixed reviews  but i ve gotta say it s getting   stars from me      
1058,5.0,                       i absolutely love this record player  it is exactly what i was looking for  sound quality is great  all the mechanisms worked smoothly  i would definitely recommend this for anyone      
1059,5.0,                       my husband and i brought this to my family s christmas and my grandmother absolutely loved it  we played dirty santa and she wanted it so bad  my cousin wound up winning it for her      
1060,2.0,                       havent tried bluetooth yet was a gift  first   the instruction manual was in spanish  and the albums play on the    setting   not the     idk why       
1061,5.0,                       love this turquoise victrola record player    it is so beautiful and has such a classic vintage retro look  everyone who sees this just loves it    sounds great too when playing my vinyl record collections    i m so happy with this excellent service from seller  thank you      
1062,4.0,                       i was looking for a decent record player for my wife for christmas and selected this model because our daughter is happy with hers  it was a pleasant surprise for wife and she has thoroughly enjoyed a trip down memory lane playing her vinyl    s and    s from the    s      
1063,5.0,                       we got an    yr old son that should have been born sometime before the   s  we love it and is constantly ordering older records  he hasn t complained about the operation and sound is pretty good from what we hear  like that it is a bluetooth speaker as well     
1064,5.0,                       never owned a record player  don t know much about them  i read the instructions and was able to figure it out no problem  for the price it feels like a good way to introduce myself into the returning world of vinyl      
1065,5.0,                       it is cute  it does not look inexpensive  the best part is the speakers  they sound great  and i am picky about sound systems  if i don t feel like using the bt function  i can listen through them  very happy customer       
1066,5.0,                       bought this as a gift for my sister and she loves it      
1067,2.0,                       record kept skipping and it wouldn t automatically play the next song  i was disappointed because i gave it to my aunt for christmas but she couldn t really enjoy it  the skipping was annoying     
1068,5.0,                       the built in speakers are  of course  a joke    but if you just want to listen  comedy album   they work   use the line out to connect to a decent stereo and it s a different story   sounds great through my onkyo polk     system      
1069,5.0,                       daughter asked for this for christmas and it was sold out in the store  arrived quickly and she loves it  color is beautiful      
1070,1.0,                       this thing really sounds like crap  use some sort of external speaker system for anything that sounds close to acceptable  very cheaply made  more of a toy than a serious form of music reproduction      
1071,5.0,                       i ve had this record player for about a year now  still works great  haven t had to replace the needle  and i was provided with an extra so it s nice to know the quality is there  definitely sounds nicer hooked up to some speakers  but if you don t have any  this will will get you by     
1072,5.0,                       bought this as a gift and it was a winner  my friend loved it so much and uses it every single day and works perfect  love     
1073,5.0,                       being new to buying turntables  i was a bit sceptical when i ordered this  i wasn t sure if i d get what i wanted and if i d like it   but i was so wrong   the minute i got this  i played a few lps and boy they sounded so good on this one  the fact that this comes in a nice suitcase design with bluetooth and an in inbuilt speaker made it a really good buy at this price      
1074,5.0,                       this item was marked used   acceptable   it s perfect  i m so glad that i took the chance      
1075,1.0,                       thankfully is very portable made it very easy to return the piece of junk     
1076,5.0,                       i was definitely weary because of the price  and that it was coming from online  sound quality is great  however it starts to get a little drowned out at the absolute loudest volume  mine had a little knob in the back loose that i m still not sure the purpose  but it was easy to tighten  definitely worth it      
1077,1.0,                       i got a replacement because it kept skipping  it wasn t my records because i tried multiple  followed instructions  the replacement skips too  disappointed  didn t receive my refund      
1078,4.0,                       you are most definitely going to have to purchase additional speakers if you want to have good sound quality  overall i am happy with the purchase      
1079,1.0,                       this is the second player i purchased the first one did not power on at all  this one skips all the record the turntable is cheaply made and does not support the record properly     
1080,2.0,                       no problem with bluetooth connectivity but the needle jumps all over the record and there s no way to adjust weight or any tracking so it ends up skipping like crazy  it does this on every record  they play fine on other players      
1081,5.0,                       this was a gift for my teenage daughter  her favorite band  the struts  are british so this was perfect  love the vintage look  the price was fantastic      less than most sites  the sound is great  i personally love to hear the little crackling sound of a record  i was super surprised at how fast the shipping was  i couldn t be more pleased with my purchase  she loves it  i highly recommend  thank you         
1082,3.0,                       looks very nice and is compact  the sound quality is pretty clear however it skips very often or gets stuck on records  tried multiple and same thing  the turntable is too small and you can see the records become unbalanced allowing the needle to bounce     
1083,1.0,                       very bad quality and cheaply made  sound quality is very bad  record player was skipping while playing the record  spend more money and buy better turn table      
1084,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          it works  got this for my fil  sound is ok but it works     
1085,5.0,                       bought one for my son for christmas  he loves it  i m envious  i may have to get one for myself      
1086,5.0,                       great product the  color is great the sound is good and i m bluetooth you can use the sound and whatever device you are using through the record player     
1087,5.0,                       this was a gift for my boyfriend and he was so excited  we immediately set it up and played a few vinyls  the sound was excellent and i love the suitcase look  as donna summers said  turn up the old victrola       
1088,4.0,                                my daughter uses this  she has but one record  it is a brand new record  and i m not sure if she has it set up correctly  but i ll change this review if i find out otherwise     the record skips quite a bit  i ll keep you informed soon               
1089,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          it s a great machine  the needle produce a great sound   portable  good relationship price   features   thing to improve   the speakers are ok for enjoy alone   but you ll need some extra to be louder  it comes with instructionsmanual and needle replacement      
1090,5.0,                       child wanted a record player and we found this one cheaper than in most stores with a larger variety of colors to choose from  so far it works well we ll have to see how it lasts over time      
1091,4.0,                       the speakers are weak  but with bluetooth  it doesn t really matter  i love the case  keeps it dust free and easily portable  i bought it for my camper  it s perfect in there  works well and it serves the purpose that i wanted it to      
1092,1.0,                       i was so excited on purchasing my first record player  i knew it wasn t going to be the best because of the price tag but i was hoping it was gonna put me through   months until i move and have a bigger place for a better one  this record player repeats and skips on every record i ve put on it  have had it for a week  very disappointing  returning it now  just know     players should come with an asterisk      
1093,5.0,                       got this as a gift for my daughter  it arrived quickly and was packaged well  it s pretty inexpensive but seems to work well  she really likes it  she likes that it is small and portable     
1094,5.0,                       just ordered this victrola yesterday  sunday  and it said i would receive it on friday but by some strange turn of events it was delivered next day  super fun surprise  i ve never owned a victrola before and i m seriously in love with it  it has amazing quality and it continues to surprise me  it has a bluetooth feature that i was not expecting at all  the bluetooth option is super clear as well  another fun aspect is how my parents have reacted to it   this victrola has pulled my parents under it s nostalgic spell  i m nervous they ll try to steal it from me the next time they re over lol such a great purchase and a wonderful surprise     
1095,4.0,                       this works great  i don t usually use it for bluetooth but when i do it connects easily  i use it for my records and the sound quality is great  it comes with a    adapter      
1096,3.0,                       the functionality of it works with my yamaha receiver which has a stereo selection  sounds pretty good  but when playing the    records  the song isn t done and it just stops and shuts off  also  when it turns on or shuts off it sends feedback through the speakers  like a banging noise  overall rating is a    it s nice to play my collection of original records      
1097,1.0,                       so disappointed  this was a christmas present for my daughter   it skips on every single record   and we are past our return window so we are stuck with a pos for a present  do not buy this product      
1098,3.0,                       its ok for the money but if i could id get a refund  horrible sound quality      
1099,3.0,                       this is a great compact record player that is so easy to pack around or travel with  my only complaint is that the speaker isn t very loud at all  that is easily fixed by buying a speaker to either bluetooth or plug in  great gift      
1100,5.0,                       this is a nice novelty record player that brought a smile to my hubby s face when he saw it      
1101,5.0,                       everything is fine and worth the price  but the sound quality is a little off  it kind of has a small static sound if i play music too loud  full blast  but only happens sometimes  overall  great device and would purchase again      
1102,5.0,                       got this for my husband for christmas  i m so excited to give it to him  he has been buying vinyls so i m exciting to see how it plays  he loves america flags so this was an awesome find      
1103,4.0,                       good sound and easy instructions  however  if you are using colored vinyl where it may be a thinner record  i would advise putting a penny on top of the needle  the stylus is very light and only goes down so far  put a little weight on it and no skips whatsoever  other than that  i m happy with my purchase      
1104,5.0,                       i live with roommates  they wouldn t appreciate a sound system  so this is perfect for me to play and enjoy my favorites  if you re looking for surround sound  opt for a player that requires speakers separately      
1105,4.0,                       was a christmas present and was shipped in the box the record player is in  rather than a brown cardboard box  left on the front porch for all to see  easily could have ruined the surprise for my daughter  that would have been a bummer  otherwise  the product works as advertised  she loved it and i think it will be a fun thing to mess around with for her      
1106,1.0,                       this player is terrible   the first one we purchased was skipping   amazon was great at replacing it   the second one now does not work at all   the power won t even turn on   it is only   months old   buyer beware   do not buy this product      
1107,3.0,                       this product is alright for beginners on a budget  however it doesn t have a proper needle weight and will scratch your records if you don t put a coin on it or something  personally i used a ring that didn t fit with a twist tie thing  great sound  really easy to use and store      
1108,1.0,                       i received a broken piece of junk two times in a row with two different record players   to say my children were disappointed is an understatement   to say i m disgusted with the quality control of amazon is an even bigger disappointment      
1109,5.0,                       daughter loves it  really has decent speakers      
1110,5.0,                       i brought this for my    year old daughter for valentines day     she loves it       
1111,1.0,                       straight out the box plugged it in  set my record in place and turned it on and it wouldn t spin  made a wirring sound inside and after following all troubleshooting tips to no avail i called for a replacement  which never showed up  you get what you pay for i guess   i ll be going to my local record shop soon to get one that works  take my dad s advice   get the oldest one you can find      
1112,5.0,                       you re getting what you re paying for  and let me tell you  it is an amazing price for the quality and how easy is to use  great turntable      
1113,5.0,                       i gave it as a gift to my in laws and they loved it  it is really compact and works just perfect  it s really cool that you can play music from the usb in case you want to use it just like a small music player      
1114,3.0,                       sound is tinny but nice to be able to play any where like out doors  nice to play my oldies again      
1115,5.0,                       the item was exactly as described   didn t include the aux cable but no worries   my daughter loves it  sound is good   only issue is with shipping it was delivered in the origional box had i not been home i m sure it would have been stolen from my steps       
1116,4.0,                       i haven t done much with it because i keep getting scratched records from amazon     
1117,1.0,                       worked for about a week then got real staticky changed needle not the problem   tried getting in touch with someone no help   not worth the money      
1118,5.0,                       love this turn table  i got the blue color and it really adds a nice flair to our living room  the functionality is great too  the music is clear on any setting bluetooth  audio cord  and record  i would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to play records but also wants the flexibility of playing from other media as well        
1119,5.0,                       this is a great record player if you don t want to take up much space  fits perfectly on a small night stand  plays well and sounds good  very cute color and case it durable  cleans easily      
1120,5.0,                       this is such an awesome vinyl player  the sound can be made pretty loud  and the quality is good  as long as the vinyl isn t scratched  i got the brown and it looks good  love it      
1121,4.0,                       should have better quality speaker  disappointed first time felt that way with amazon purchase  didn t send back   my bad  good for little kid  if they know what it is     
1122,2.0,                       i bought this item for my son s birthday in july  he didn t want to use it until he got his own apartment  it took him until two weeks ago to do this  when he tried to play it the  plug don t work for the unit  i couldn t find a place on amazon to let them know because it was bought in july  so  this is the only way to let them know  he loves the look  but can t listen to it       
1123,1.0,                       the platter doesn t spin  and there is a clicking sound coming from it  completely and utterly a waist of money  i do not recommend anyone buying this record player  i guess it s a hit or miss for some  i will be sending this back for a refund      
1124,5.0,                       got this as a gift and i am in love with it  audio obviously sounds like its old and it gives a cool vintage vibe to my room  very light weight and is perfect if you want to travel with it  definitely recommend      
1125,5.0,                       the item arrived on time and it s great shape    put my first record on and the classic sound brings back memories      
1126,1.0,                       i bought these a while ago  played a few records and now it doesn t work      
1127,4.0,                       i love this record player  however the built in speakers are not good at all  i purchased a set of speakers for better louder sound      
1128,5.0,                       hi my name is diana   i had got this vinyl record player for christmas and i was really excited to open it and it didn t come with a cord  and i really want to listen to my record with my music and i didn t get a cord to my record player   i was just getting ready to listen to my record and then i didn t see a cord   so i hope that you can send me a cord soon and then i can listen to my records  thank youemail carlisle     comcast neti think i found the cord but i m not sure but i tried using the plug i found and it s not turning on       
1129,5.0,                       i ve been wanting a record player for a while now  but i didn t want to spend too much on one  i also needed a new speaker  so this seemed like the best option to solve both problems  this is super easy to set up and use  the sound quality is great  and i was able to connect my phone to the speakers pretty easily  on top of that  it s great decor for my apartment      
1130,5.0,                       if you like to play records and are on the road most of the time either as a career or just in general  this is for you      
1131,4.0,                       my teenage daughter requested for christmas  price  was excellent and loved the color choices  i was greatly disappointed that it was delivered as is so when she opened the door it was handed to her clearly showing her what she got  i was shocked  no surprise now      
1132,1.0,                       worked fine for the year of the warranty  then one day the power switch just slipped and never worked again   we probably used it less than    times   unfortunately  the one year warranty had just expired  and there is no way to get replacement parts   another piece of trash in the land fill   i m sorry i bought this      
1133,4.0,                       absolutely love this turntable  it works as it should  the only drawback is that the sound is too low for what i like  and i have not found speakers that give me the sound that i want  but that is not victrolas fault      
1134,5.0,                       i bought it for a friend and i didn t expect such great results  it is easy to carry around  beautiful  souns quality is perfect for the price  honestly  it s better than i expected     
1135,4.0,                       this portable suitcase turntable is a great little product  i just wanted something to play my vintage collection without investing in a major sound system  the victrola is perfect for its simplicity  the bluetooth capability is a nice added  feature      
1136,5.0,                       the product color is darker than expected  but i have no other complains about it  the directions are simple and the machine is easy to use  it works very well and is high quality      
1137,2.0,                       the sound quality on this is pretty awful  i wasn t expecting much but it didn t even meet my modest expectations  i have a     bluetooth speaker that sounds twice as good as the speakers on this record player  low volume  flat sound      
1138,5.0,                       great little record player  perfect if you are new to vinyl records or if you ve got a vast collection  set up nicely  and came with an extra needle  sound quality is great  no issues at all      
1139,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          on the video that was bluetooth but when you put a record on it s like any other old school record player  it s great   awesome nostalgia      
1140,5.0,                       i grew up listening to christmas records on my grandmother s player and wanted to have that experience in my home   this is perfect for that   it has great sound quality and good volume   i have purchased about    records for it so far and look forward to growing my collection   it is also portable so i can take it with me when we travel      
1141,1.0,                       this record player will not play records with out skipping  sad for us we have owned it for several months but just took it out to use today and it skipped on ever record  we tried    spend a little more money and get a better quality player      
1142,5.0,                       after reading all the mixed reviews  i was adamant to buy it    but i m glad i did because the sound quality is as it suppose to sound and happy with my purchase    so for the price  it s a good buy        
1143,5.0,                       sound quality was ok  we weren t able to hook it up to blue tooth speaker although there s a setting for it      
1144,2.0,                       i m not sure if i just got a defective product  or if this was the result of purchasing a returned item  but the sound quality of this record player was awful  i was prepared for a low sound quality  but it was so twangy   shrill that we almost didn t even want to keep listening  i returned it and bought another cheap record player  and the sound was much better      
1145,5.0,                       i use it to test and play old   rpm records and i like it s small footprint      
1146,1.0,                       i purchased two of these for my twins daughters for christmas  when they tried them for the first time one worked and the other sounded distorted  this was very disappointing since it was one of the things she wanted the most  i tied to connect to the website to get tech support and it was not able to connect      
1147,5.0,                       exactly what i was looking for  havent heard my vinyl in over    years  wow    it was great to hear them again   so glad my hubby bought me this for christmas  i love it       
1148,5.0,                       love love love this record player  sound is clear and bluetooth is an extra bonus that i use all the time  it gets pretty loud as well  i sometimes have it on in a different room and can hear it clearly  also love how it can close so you can take it on trips     
1149,1.0,                       right out the box it wasn t working so i took it apart at realized the rubber belt had come off so i put it back on  very annoying  and it worked for about   minutes and came off again  this happened several more times  it is clear i already need a new belt  totally lame purchase      
1150,5.0,                       record player works great with records but don t be surprised if the bluetooth and aux sound quality isn t the same  its a record player so the sound is better with records      
1151,2.0,                       it s really cute and portable  but beware   the bluetooth is not for speakers  the speaker is very poor quality and i will never use this for that reason      
1152,3.0,                       it s very cheap  but the sound quality isn t very good  better to invest in a more expensive one  i think it will damage records over time  so be wary      
1153,5.0,                       i purchased this portable turntable for my dad to enjoy his old lps  glen miller  harry belafonte and jackie gleason      it s easy enough for him to work as is  and has the extra bluetooth and speaker inputs to enhance the experience      
1154,1.0,                       the turntable almost turned for   seconds  i m sure i got a lemon but i cannot recommend this product      
1155,5.0,                       well  i just received my portable bluetooth turntable today  i got the purple color because i love prince  it s so beautiful   the sound is tin canny but i hooked up my bluetooth speakers and it sounds great  listening to purple rain lp now  fast and good service  i love it       
1156,2.0,                       the picture and the actual product are a little different looking  if you care about eye appeal    do not purchase  looks even more cheaply made than the price would reflect      
1157,4.0,                    el bluetooth solo sirve para conectar dispositivos al sonido del toca discos  mas no para conectarse el a otros dispositivos de sonido  el parlante integrado no tiene una buena calidad de sonido         
1158,5.0,                       i ve purchased   of these  both for gifts  this is a great product  sound quality is nice  easy to set up  and portable  it s bluetooth and battery cord operated  unsure about battery life since we keep it plugged in while in use  but i m sure it s great  maybe a picnic      
1159,1.0,                       powers on and works just fine  problem is i have tried several brand new never opened records and it always skips on a few songs or even a whole side of the record      
1160,5.0,                       simple to set up and pair  not stereo sound but works really well  very easy to use      
1161,3.0,                       its a novelty player  don t expect great quality or great sound    but it does work  so it gets   stars     
1162,5.0,                       great pick for a gift  i got this to my friend and she s in love with it  but we  had really high hope for it  the sound isn t that great  nither that it feels robust  other than that the turntable is great and have been working greatly for over   months now     
1163,5.0,                       bought this for my    year old for her birthday  she absolutely loves it  the sound quality is crisp and clear  i love that it s portable and she could take it anywhere she wants  perfect for beginners who have never even seen a record player before     
1164,1.0,                       for      this is a basic starter turntable  sound is kinda tin like  good for kids  but it didn t play older records very well      
1165,5.0,                       i was really pleased with this product  i gave this to my mom as a gift for christmas and she loved it  she was finally able to play old records left by my grandparents      
1166,5.0,                       easy to use   easy to store   works great   sounds great   i ve already recommended to others      
1167,5.0,                       this is a beautiful record player  plays all my old and new records with no issues  also connects to my cell phone so i can play all my tunes through this  the speakers are very clear and sound amazing  would definitely recommend anyone to buy this  great price for what you get     
1168,5.0,                       this was a christmas gift for my husband  it s easy to work  and is a great basic record player  the colors are very vivid  the sound is great quality  you can turn it up pretty loud without distortion  no complaints so far      
1169,5.0,                       small yet great sound and fits on a shelf  several friends have given us older vinyl records   they sound great      
1170,5.0,                       great portable turntable   we already have one at home and it s  portable  too but still too bulky just to lug around   the victrola is compact and yet outputs delightful tunes   the price is really great too      
1171,3.0,                       you get what you pay for  i have a couple vintage records from the   s   s that work fine  but newer vinyls skip like crazy  i ve tested the newer vinyls on a different turntable and they work fine   this thing is just cheap  a fix i ve found is taping a penny to the arm when playing the newer vinyls   the extra weight helps  definitely a cute looking little record player  but if you re looking to collect vinyl records just save up and get yourself a better player      
1172,1.0,                       i purchased this for my daughter last july  we loved it   but after    months it stopped working  first we thought it was the cord but the cord works fine  it won t turn on at all   we weren t even able to get much use out of it as we liked to   what a disappointment because we love to play records      
1173,1.0,                       this was a disappointment  played fine then began skipping  i rarely return items but this is going back      
1174,5.0,                       i bought this for my daughter and she loves it  great quality and color  i also bought the record storage to match in color as well      
1175,2.0,                       this model does not play records   connect via blutooth to an external speaker fyi   i learned it the hard way  good player  works fine  but misleading with the blutooth connection      
1176,1.0,                       we had to return this item as all of the albums we purchased skipped   in doing additional research  we learned that this turntable is more for looks and less for listening to albums      
1177,5.0,                       finally i can play all my old records that i kept  my grandkids were amazed that was how the older generation rocked to their music  my albums sound awesome the speaker on the victrola sounds great      
1178,5.0,                       this was a christmas gift for my granddaughter  she went bonkers when she opened it  of course i had to give her extra cash to go buy records  she loves it  that is what is important     
1179,4.0,                       sound quality is garbage out of box  i bought an rca adapter to connect to my existing sound system and it works relatively well  good for the price point for a kid or a non audiophile that just has some records to revisit  no slip mat      
1180,5.0,                       i ve had no problem and ive had it for almost   months  super good for the money and love the bluetooth feature      
1181,5.0,                       bought for my parents for christmas to play all their old vinyl records on  they re hard to buy for and this was a great surprise  mom was like a little kid playing all her oldies and beach music  good times      
1182,4.0,                       it s exactly what it says it is  everything is perfect but i deducted a star because the sound quality isn t really the best  it s not bad but it could be better  overall  for the price it s actually really good and looks amazing in my room      
1183,1.0,                       cheaply made  not high quality feeling  sound is equivalent to your phone speakers  buy something else       
1184,5.0,                       i absolutely love my record player    i got thos for my birthday last year   it works perfect        
1185,2.0,                       i thought i was lucky after reading some of the bad reviews when i first bought this record player  the first day i used it  everything worked fine and i loved the product  when i tried using it the next day however  the speakers weren t working and made all of my music sound fuzzy  it would come and go but hurt my ears every time the speakers went out  it s a cute decorative piece but does not properly work for music lovers      
1186,5.0,                       we like the style and variety of colors  compact and transportable  but decent sound  nice that it came with needles  my tween loves vinyls and is very happy with it      
1187,3.0,                       my only issue with this player  it doesn t sound like the older players  the sound is definitely better  i was hoping for that old sound     
1188,5.0,                       bought this as a gift    retro with modern features   it works just wonderfully   i connected it to my soundbar   fantastic     
1189,1.0,                       i bought this for my    year old son just last christmas  it was working good for months but just a month ago it stopped working   my son takes really good care of all his possessions so i know this item was well maintained  if an electronic stops working for no reason then for sure this item is defective   very disappointed with this purchase  if you buy it make sure to get the guarantee      
1190,5.0,                       perfect for an   year old   sturdy  doesn t require a lot of space and is very easy to use   doesn t have a bunch of other gadgets to complicate it   takes a little bit for a child to realize how not to scratch the record when lifting or placing the needle   my grand daughter loves it      
1191,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          no complaints here  wonderful price  easy to use and good quality      
1192,5.0,                       was a gift for my mother with dementia   she loves it   the sound is good  the extra stylus a nice plus   it plays her old records well      
1193,5.0,                       so  in      you got rid of your old phono because everyone was dumping their record collections for cds and here we are in      and guess what  records are back in vougue  get yourself one of these new     crosley victrola whatever players and hear your records again  no  they will not ruin your records  this record player is cheap but it s plenty good enough to satisfy your nostalgia  oh  and next time  don t get rid of your old phono      
1194,5.0,                       works great  the bluetooth is instant on iphones it connects amazingly  the sound definitely sounds like its coming from a record player   not terrible but definitely isnt bose or anything      
1195,5.0,                       best purchase in a while  it s cute and a great  functional accent to our room  it works very well and would make a great gift to someone who is new to the world of vinyl      
1196,2.0,                       cheaply made  worked for several records and then lever that lifts and lowers the arm got jammed with the arm in the up position and will not move  returning item      
1197,1.0,                       it is really cute and the blue tooth is working   however  the turntable part is not   would like to talk to someone about getting it replaced      
1198,2.0,                       i knew the speakers weren t going to be great but i figured why not  you can t even tell you re listening to a record  no scratches or pops  because the audio quality is so poor  even using bluetooth sucked     
1199,5.0,                       a great christmas present  great for someone starting their vinyl collection     
1200,5.0,                       i bought it for my daughter and it reminds me of when i was in school and got my first  record player  i don t mind the sound quality because that is really what makes records fun to me      
1201,4.0,                       i can t get the bluetooth to work with my bluetooth headphones  direction are very confusing      
1202,5.0,                       bought this for my granddaughter for christmas  she already has it   she loves it      
1203,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          so i bought this thinking i had to buy speaker with it and i was pleasantly surprised when i foun out it was actually pretty loud and clear my room closed it super loud but an empty apartment you can hear it clear as day   the bluetooth is nice aswell  the player pretty great for the price i would buy again but you should buy protection nothing is forever      
1204,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this is my first vinyl player and the first time i ve ever used one  i was confused on why my vinyls kept skipping just to find out that it was not the player  it were the vinyls  i was definitely skeptical until i just bought panic  at the disco s latest album  pray for the wicked  and since it s brand new  it sounds amazing   i bought the other vinyls before i got the vinyl player so i must have not taken care of them well  very good vinyl player      
1205,1.0,                       i was excited to get this product  but unfortunately it was not working and it came without a charging cable  unluckily  i received this package after almost   months and hence that warranty did not cover it      
1206,5.0,                       i have many vinyl records from the    s that i can now play on this portable unit easy to use  fair sound quality for a small unit  but acceptable   fair price for this unit      
1207,1.0,                       i purchased this item for my daughters birthday  and the record player skipped on every vinyl we played on it  we changed the needle  and it still skipped  she liked the map print so i exchanged it for the exact same player  and it had the same problem as the first one   skipping  we have now returned the second victorola and will purchase a different brand      
1208,1.0,                       cute design  very portable  however  the needle kept skipping and the speakers were meh  i had bought this for a christmas present and had to send it back within a week of christmas  definitely not recommending      
1209,4.0,                       good speaker for the price  adds a very cool vintage look to the bedroom  very easy to transport  i like that it locks up and you can carry it like a suitcase      
1210,1.0,                       this product is cheaply made  purchased this record player to get into vinyl  i was very disappointed with the quality and sound of this player  the unit is very light and made from thin plastic  out of the box i got about two hours of playtime before issues began to arise  the sound began to distort and eventually became unbearable to listen to  i ve used the brand new records  returned and purchased a higher quality record player      
1211,2.0,                       it worked for a week and now it just skips  tried troubleshooting a few different things but it s not helping  someone had mentioned adding a little weight to the tone arm so i m not sure if this is the fix or not but it s really disappointing  my daughter was excited to get this only for it to be garbage  do not buy this  save your money for a nicer model     
1212,1.0,                       we purchased   of these and only   out of the   worked    very disappointed   obviously there is an issue with this product they need to fix   pretty sad when you give it as a christmas gift and it wont work       
1213,5.0,                       just like the old days  it is so easy to use hooks up to blue tooth very easily  sounds great  perfect size makes it easy to move around and find space for   victrola has been making record players forever how can you go wrong  worth every penny  fun to play  the old records again      
1214,1.0,                       the corners of the record player arrived visibly damaged and chipped      
1215,1.0,                       cheaply made latch that fell off on first use when opened for christmas   tried to put back on but holes are too large to hold tabs  clearly a manufacturing flaw   bought this because of reviews  name  and specifically because it closes  disappointing      
1216,5.0,                       nice compact size made it easy to set up and play old records for my father in law  i wish there was a stackable version  as he would have loved it even more  but this was a nice start      
1217,1.0,                       i gave it as a gift and the bluetooth does not work at all whatever it was supposed to do it doesn t do so having bluetooth on it is a waste if you re just looking for a record for player with poor sound then this is for you     
1218,3.0,                       only lasted   months and then burnt out  couldn t figure out why     
1219,2.0,                       it s cute as a novelty  or as a first turntable  but you get what you pay for  mine wobbles pretty badly  so much so that it causes skipping that doesn t occur when the same record is played on other turntables  the sound is what i would consider headphone quality  just ok if you re sitting right next to it  horrible the higher you turn it up  bass is lost  high notes sound tinny   all in all i d say save your money and put it towards a higher end piece      
1220,5.0,                       got this for my daughter for her   th birthday and she loves it  she hasn t grown bored with it yet and has broken out all of my mothers old albums to listen to  works great  sounds great      
1221,1.0,                       we could barely hear a sound with the volume turned up to it s highest setting  thankfully my son in law  who is good with tech things  was able to open it up and attach the speaker wires that were never hooked up  it works now but should have been taken care of before it was sent out  not everyone could not resolved this issue and would have had to return it      
1222,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          love this thing     
1223,5.0,                       my school children love it when i bring this out and listen to records   i ve not tried the bluetooth system   the sound quality relies heavily on the vinyl  it s been fun to teach the children about that aspect of records also      
1224,5.0,                    tiene el tama o ideal  liviano para transportar  gran sonido  nos sorprendi  gratamente  viene con una aguja de repuesto  excelente opci n para escuchar tus viejos acetatos        
1225,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                       excelente dise o  buen sonido  conexi n bluetooth bien  mi esposa se enamor   probamos algunos discos que ten amos  excelente precio         
1226,1.0,                       we got this less than a year ago and it s already busted  light comes on  but the turntable won t spin at all  so records can t be played  like i said  for the money   we got a little bit of use out of it  i wouldn t recommend anyone go with this brand  though  per our experience and per what others have said about customer service      
1227,5.0,                       i have really enjoyed it  i received one as gift and bought this one to gift someone else  love that its compact and portable  i really have no complaints in the quality  especially when comparing to the price      
1228,4.0,                       the sounds coming out of it are a little light on bass  even with an external speaker   subwoofer   that being said  i m not sure if it s the stereo system or the medium   but i didn t get it for awesome sound  i got it for a retro experience and fun  and in that sense it is perfect      
1229,5.0,                       this is a beautiful sounding record player  it s not perfect but for the price  you absolutely cannot complain because there are absolutely no big flaws with it  i m listening to it right now as i type this and it s just really nice to listen to vinyl  it s a kind of vibe  also  this is a great beginners player  i d recommend getting this if you re just starting out      
1230,5.0,                       i love how versatile this is  it really makes the office more elegant  looks especially great next to the whiskey decanter      
1231,2.0,                    el reproductor es muy bonito  le doy   estrellas debido a que cuando lo conectamos funcion  unos   minutos y dej  de girar el plato  tuve que desarmarlo y lamentablemente verificar que estaba mal ensamblado  afortunadamente lo pude solucionar y est  funcionando bien         
1232,5.0,                       this was a christmas gift for my oldest grandson   he is    and he is enjoying this and will be adding to his record collection i am sure this will be lasting for a very long time         
1233,5.0,                       i have been looking for the perfect medium to play my old vinyl records on and i am very pleased with my selection     
1234,4.0,                       this is a walk down memory isne   covered in period cloth and works well doe        and    rpm   speaker sound is a bit  tinny  but over all a nice gift to give     
1235,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this was an early father s day present from my wife  it s perfect for me  sounds great and not too big  just the right size  missed the one star because of the bluetooth  i just wish they could come up with a new model that you can use the bluetooth to connect to a speaker  like alexa  so you can hear your records through them      
1236,5.0,                       great sound easy to use  i am in love      
1237,5.0,                       it looked better than it did in the advertisement  the sound is clean and crisp and it s portable  i bought it for my wife for christmas and she loves it      
1238,5.0,                       its what u expect for mids and highs on speakers  packs nicely  if u want good vinyl for sound get a different one with a grounded photo output  if u want a quick player for parties and shower tunes this is your boy      
1239,5.0,                       product turned on the night i got it  got a record for it the next day and it stopped working  replacement comingedit  replacement came in less than a whole day and works perfectly      
1240,1.0,                       this turntable isn t for audiophiles    it s fine if you re spinning old records at your bbq parties  but if you are looking for something to last for a bit under regular use  this is not it    inital quality is good but it quickly declines    within   months of light use  only a couple records per week   the speed noticeably slowed and the power speaker volume switch is very touchy    also will not play    g vinyl due to no balance weights on tone arm   i can t recommend this because if you spend     more  you can likely get something a lot better        
1241,2.0,                       right out of the box mine had arrived sadly arrived broken  the turn table wouldn t spin and it wasn t picking up anything from the stylus  i tried out the aux and blue tooth connection and they worked alright  the speakers are tinny sounding and have no bass to them  and i m pretty sure its playing in mono after taking it apart and fixing the problem  which was an issue with a really cheap connector  i got the record player working  the sounds was the same as with the aux or blue tooth inputs but it does wobble a little  the record player parts are also very plasticy and cheap feeling not a bad machine for basically     but i do expect brand new items to arrive working        
1242,3.0,                       over all i like the player  it was a deal price wise so of course the needle and arm aren t the best quality and causes some skips but nothing a nickel on the head won t fix  over all a good value for the price and i am happy i purchased it      
1243,1.0,                       after purchasing i noticed most of my records skipped  i thought it was the records but it was the player  after switching to a higher end record player  all of the records that  skipped  played beautifully  my recommendation for any person looking to get into vinyl is to buy a higher end record player      
1244,2.0,                       yes i know i m playing decade old records but the sound quality does no justice to these recordings  you can play any type of record and even use as bluetooth speak but     
1245,2.0,                       i have purchased several albums that refuse to play on this device  brand new records  i have troubleshot everything i could and still continues to be unbalanced  any advice is appreciated     
1246,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i was so excited to open this and even more excited when i started using it  highly recommend       
1247,1.0,                       bought for daughter for christmas   i know is not high end  but here we are in may and it stopped working   cool   avoid this product        
1248,5.0,                       got this for my daughter for her   th birthday and it s amazing  the price was great  the sound quality is great  and it can connect to bluetooth speakers  it s also really nice to look at and she loves the color  super happy with our purchase and she absolutely loves it      
1249,5.0,                       this is nice for the money   i bout it for my brother   the volume is not loud enough if played in a room with a bunch of people  but it does have the bluetooth option  which i suggest      
1250,4.0,                       i bought this as a last minute gift for my husband and he loves it  we held on to all of our albums and our parents albums for years without listening to them  now we can      
1251,1.0,                       i bought this for my bf and after one week of him using it  this pos record player broke  waste of money        so disappointed      
1252,2.0,                       not my favourite player by a landslide  the lid does not have any sort of retention  and can fall closed from a minor bump  this is catastrophic because the internal surface is smaller than a record  meaning it will slam down on your precious vinyl if you accidentally bump it  also  the bluetooth function was defective on my unit  although i hadn t intended to use that feature much anyways      
1253,5.0,                       hooked it up via rca s to my home stereo and it works as it should  great value for the money     
1254,3.0,                       i hate that it has to be plugged ingood choose fir the price however      
1255,5.0,                       i gave this as a gift to someone who loves listening to music  and they love it      
1256,4.0,                       this is my first record player ever  so i m don t know much about it  what i can say is that the price is what made me bought it  i mean i wasn t expecting much but for starters it s a great deal  i give it   stars because it didn t bring an extra needle as i read somewhere here     
1257,5.0,                       great giftbto show the kids a lil bit about the past        
1258,5.0,                       great record player and great price  built on speakers sound great   haven t tried playing other music from it through bluetooth so i cannot comment on that aspect      
1259,1.0,                       the worse choice to make in buying a record player  this was the second one sent  itcwas to replace the first one which was also defective  still looking for a descent player      
1260,4.0,                       i ordered black but got one with the british flag  i mean no big deal but yea  doesn t hurt the performance just hard to blend it into my game room  records play great  played the ink spots and it had wonderful quality  plan to play many more      
1261,2.0,                       i got nothing but the player itself  need to provide your own re charger and connectors   i recommend getting an instruction sheet  from a previous owner     
1262,4.0,                       it s really easy to connect this player to speakers or bluetooth on  your phone  the built in speakers aren t amazing  so i hooked it up to a tower speaker i have and now it sounds awesome  easy fix and lots of fun to listen to      
1263,4.0,                       bought for a cheap method of playing some records we found  it seems to work  but isn t the highest of quality  price is fair for quality      
1264,3.0,                       i got this for my daughter for christmas cause it looks very retro cool and the color matches her room  she was very excited to play a new record she also got for christmas but it skipped like crazy  we tried a few old records and it worked fine  ordered a replacement and it wasn t much better so we taped a penny to the top of the needle head and now it plays the new records just fine  sound isn t great but it works and looks cool  not bad for          
1265,4.0,                       i bought this record player for myself on my birthday three months ago and i absolutely love it  it is light  portable  has a great sound player and is a beautiful shade of red  very easy to connect with your phone ipad and does a great job as a speaker too   not only do i finally get to play all my old  vintage records  but it makes for a wonderful addition to my dining tea room  contemplating buying this as a wedding gift for my bestie  highly recommend      
1266,5.0,                       thank you so much  my son loves it      
1267,5.0,                       i loved this  for a starter record player  this is your best bet  sound quality is decent nothing out of this world  you can connect your phone via bluetooth but the sound quality remains the same  i noticed on the back you can connect other speakers  overall i love this record player      
1268,1.0,                       it plays bluetooth okay  but sounds a bit staticy  completely useless as a record player  we ve tried four or five records  brand new and previously played  and they all sound terrible  unfortunately  the window has closed for returns  or amazon would have this one back  keep shopping for a good one      
1269,5.0,                    espectacular  magn fico  me gust  la robustez  la calidad se ve bien es muy pr ctico  de f cil uso  muy intuitivo  llenaron todas mis espectativas y a muy buen precio         
1270,5.0,                       i bought this for my wife for christmas  she loves it  especially the color  the only bad thing is this unit is blue tooth receiver and does not send to our speaker tower  you would think the opposite would be true  it would sell better      
1271,1.0,                       this box was shipped in its original box  it came ripped and with a hole in it  this was supposed to be a gift  but is most likely damaged  very disappointing      
1272,1.0,                       lasted   minutes and goodbye  not functional      
1273,4.0,                       bought this for my    year old grandaughter and a def leopard album  gotta teach them right        
1274,4.0,                    era lo que quer a mi hija  el sonido no es tan bueno  pero no est  mal        
1275,1.0,                       my daughter received this from me for christmas  she used it only a few times  it started smoking and almost started a fire  very disappointed that this only lasted a couple of months with very little use      
1276,3.0,                       very disappointed that when our daughter opened this gift that it was not the tie dyed style we had ordered but just a plain orange one  also  when we tried it out it would quit before it got the end of the song      
1277,2.0,                       i ve had this victrola since october of last year and i ve only used it three times  when i tried to use it a fourth time it didn t even want to turn on when i plugged it in  i haven t dropped it nor have i broken anything it just went kaput on me  at first  i thought it was the cord so i called the company to get a replacement for the cord but that turned out not to be the problem  but for the first few times it did play it was great      
1278,5.0,                       my husband was thrilled with this gift  he pulled out all his    s and we danced  easy to use and store      
1279,4.0,                       this is a great  starter system the sound is surprisingly good and it s so fun listening to vintage records it looks small  but totally works with standard size vinyl      
1280,1.0,                       this turntable worked once and then the speed slowed down and the sound was slurred   do not buy this item   it stopped working properly on the second album   terrible     
1281,4.0,                       fantastic product  though i have gotten the wrong color both times i ordered  the second still looks great with my apartment so i ll be keeping it  but be prepared to work with amazon support if they send you the wrong one      
1282,5.0,                       i had an issue with the original one   the turntable would not turn   i contacted the manufacture and within    hours they sent me a brand new one and told me to keep the other one for spare parts   this new one works as advertised      
1283,2.0,                       so i got this for my birthday not too long ago  it worked amazingly at first  but now when i try to play any of my records they found morphed  at first  i thought i had a bunch of damaged vinyls until i realized that the turn tabled was tilted and making the audio mess up badly     now i have to get another player because i can t listen to any of my records      
1284,3.0,                       bought this for she shed  sound quality is not great but ok     
1285,2.0,                       honestly very disappointed   i was super excited when it went on sale and had seen pretty great reviews  got it yesterday  looked great then i played a record     it did nothing but skip either full songs or throughout entire songs   i know it s not my vinyls as i played them on another record player and they were perfect  may try again today but am most likely returning     
1286,5.0,                       i just got this today and it s very cool  it s attractive and vintage  super easy to connect to bluetooth or play vinyl  didn t even read the instructions       
1287,5.0,                       this is such a great record player  super easy to set up and operate  it arrived in perfect condition  and i really love the bluetooth feature so that i can use my phone to play music if i want to listen to something i don t have a record for      
1288,5.0,                       brought me back to my childhood   easy to use   great sound     now i ll have to start buying lp s again      
1289,5.0,                       he loves it  and it sounds really good  great gift for the price      
1290,4.0,                       my father really loved this record player and the sound quality is pretty good for something of this size  the only issue i had was the box that is came in was damaged and looked pretty beat up      
1291,5.0,                       i bought this for my boyfriend   we haven t had vinyl in years and are just starting a new collection   he loves the record player   the sound is great and it is nice that you can connect another device and play through the speakers   the compact suitcase looks really cool as well      
1292,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this is the second victrola i own  i ve had the product for a couple weeks now  i discovered a major flaw  some the records seem to skip on this  i thought it was the record itself but it plays perfectly on the other player  so this player has some bugs to it  multiple records skip on it for some reason  bluetooth works fine      
1293,5.0,                       now i can listen to my old lps great color  good quality happy to have this      
1294,5.0,                       my father is really enjoying his new record player  i purchased this for him for christmas  it s the perfect size for him to move around the house and to pack it up when not needed  love it      
1295,5.0,                       i ve had for years and it still works amazing  hands down  best amazon purchase  great for price      
1296,4.0,                       this is obviously a cheap player  but with a few adjustments additions  it s pretty much what i was looking for in an intro player  i had to glue a penny to weight down the needle so the records would stop skipping  but it works well for my aesthetic  and i chose a penny from my birth year  so it s all cute   the biggest improvement that has saved my records is replacing the terrible needles that come with this  buy some diamond tips and everything will be great      
1297,5.0,                       bought this for my little sister for christmas and she loves it   would recommend anyone that likes the    s   s stuff buy one for there pad        
1298,4.0,                       i got this as a gift for my mother  and she absolutely loves it  it has a lot of great features  and works well  the only problem is that the built in speakers don t sound very great  but not bad enough to bother you that much      
1299,4.0,                       thought i d introduce our seven year old to one of my favorite childhood memories  listening to the record collection with dad   while the built in sound is a tinny for my tastes  the warmth and richness of vinyl is there   up and running right out of the box   he had an amazing time  and i m still grinning from ear to ear      
1300,5.0,                       i ve been researching portable turntables and found this one   great quality sound  without any need for an amplifier   but  there are few other things that just make this purchase sweeter   it auto stops when the record is done to protect the needle and motor   the lift lever lessens the risk for scratches when lifting or lowering the needle      
1301,1.0,                       i wish i could give zero stars  turntable will not spin  absolute piece of trash      
1302,4.0,                       the only dislike i had for the product is the speaker quality  i have to be careful which type of music i listen to and how high the volume is set  i believe the speakers are easy to blow  cute but must be      careful  the record player plays my vinyl and miss the old days       
1303,1.0,                       bluetooth is great  but turntable is messed up  skips on a brand new record     
1304,5.0,                       my daughter has been asking for a record player for years   this was perfect for a teenager to atrt with   i do wish it could hook up to a speaker because the sound is not the best but it serves its purpose       
1305,5.0,                       some very nice features for a record player of this size and design   sound is as good as could be expected with these tiny speakers but it does allow for connecting to an external amp and speakers     
1306,1.0,                       bought this as a gift for my daughter s birthday   cannot get any records to play   every record i own skips within seconds of playing   i requested a return and was told it would be picked up  but that never happened   wouldn t be writing a bad review if this was working      
1307,5.0,                       i ordered because of the wild and vibrant colors sound is great don t know anything about bluetooth     
1308,1.0,                       the face lifts and makes it difficult to trigger the arm  invest more       bucks more will save you the hassel and protect your vinyl      
1309,4.0,                       its aight for what its worth if you re gonna spend money on this its probably for a kids dorm room home room personally just spend like     on a cheap setup thats easily upgradable but for what its worth  sound quality and speeds arent to bad easily a beginner level sound system not bad at all      
1310,1.0,                       turntable did not work   big christmas gift for granddaughter   something she really wanted  grandpa   grandma felt soooo bad when her gift did not work  grandma has to start shopping early as many to buy for  just put record player in closet when arrived for christmas  now ready to return   print return slip only to see return date was          please   this item is defective and i would appreciate your response to return      please        
1311,5.0,                       i purchased this for my    year old daughter  she specifically requested a red suitcase one  it works great and was very easy to set up  she loves it         
1312,2.0,                       i think the volume is broken  you can barely hear anything  i connected to a speaker and that works but it s kinda disappointing      
1313,5.0,                       it works very well  we love it  the first one we got was damaged   i called amazon and they were so nice and sent me another the next day  this one works well      
1314,4.0,                       got this for my daughter for christmas it s really pretty but the sound quality is bad i thought she was playing music from her phone when i walked in     
1315,3.0,                       this item did not come with a slip mat this in turn makes the album sound warped  we had purchased a brand new vinyl and it sounded warped  come to find out there was no slip mat with this item  so we had to purchase one to have good sound quality  i think it should come with one and that we should be refunded for the slip mat purchased      
1316,1.0,                       stopped working after   months  garbage  had to put several coins on top of needle to keep it from skipping on all brand new records      
1317,5.0,                       i love the retro vibe  so i got this record player  i didn t even know it had bluetooth  even though it says it in the title  and that just makes it even better  i probably wont use it as a bluetooth speaker cause i already have a really good one  but as a record player  it works wonderfully  so far i have two albums and i love how it sounds  not as clear as many people describe it as  but i like it because of how it sounds  overall a very great product      
1318,5.0,                       i love this record player  it is very easy to use and has great sound quality      
1319,5.0,                       got this record player for my husband for his birthday and he absolutely loves it  easy to use and has great sound quality      
1320,2.0,                       my records sound like junk on this record player  you have to keep the volume down or the mix doesn t sound right  highly disappointed      
1321,5.0,                       this is a nice record player  but the needle is very light weight  if you place a penny on the head it will work perfectly though   boomeradvice     
1322,5.0,                       bought this for my granddaughter for christmas   she loves it      
1323,5.0,                       works as described  great sound quality  plays my    and    speed vinyl record great  very nice      
1324,1.0,                       i bought because it was highly rated  but on a brand new record it just constantly skips  sound is ok when it actually works  feels pretty cheap but  well  it is cheap  so you get what you pay for i guess      
1325,5.0,                       the bluetooth function is high quality  the line in auxiliary function is great as long as you have a quality auxiliary cable  has a single rca output and that also functions well  as for vinyl records the sound quality is amazing  plays loud and clear  i definitely recommend this player      
1326,5.0,                       great gift to give  i bought this along with a vinyl  the sound quality is great  i would definitely recommend this brand for someone that is interested in a record player      
1327,5.0,                       it s been   months since i bought my record player it still sounds really good and it s easy to use  i recommend this record player to beginners and the bluetooth works really good as well but i rather use my records      
1328,2.0,                        sounds horrible since it continually skips  i cant hear a complete song  i bought it to my friend and now i m so embarrassed  had high expectation on it but it totally let me down i should choose a product in a reasonable price instead of a cheaper price       
1329,4.0,                       i ordered the tie dye one and i love it  it came today  and it was well packaged  and it s just darling  speaker quality is about what you would expect for the price  but i love the versatility of this little thing  i didn t realize until it got here that it was bluetooth compatible  so i can stream my music from my phone as well as play records  it looks so nice and looks exactly like the picture  i m in love      
1330,5.0,                       i love this player this is my second one  i love how essye and smooth it is to use  great sound and bluetooth connection      
1331,4.0,                       received faster than scheduled   is smaller than i expected  but an excellent product   only down side is sound quality of built in speakers   i ll be ordering external speakers though to make up for it   all in all     i love it      
1332,1.0,                       i have not tried this because it s a valentines gift  but i m stuck because the return window already closed unless they make an exception      
1333,4.0,                       very cool i bought the purple victrola for my wife and she loves it   at our age we should have chose a automatic player because it will keep you busy changing records   has blue tooth and sounds ok but hook up speakers for doby sound   can be used with earplugs or headphones     stars for the price   enjoy     
1334,4.0,                       i thought i ordered the england flag one that was in the picture but a red one arrived  i ordered a damaged box one so i figured it was my mistake  cool little record player that sounds ok  i hooked up external speakers and i use the bluetooth with my phone also  works good      
1335,5.0,                       it s so cute  i m giving it to my granddaughters for christmas with some old   s i had as a kid  they don t know about record players and they love to learn  and they love music and to dance  i d forgotten how much fun it is to sit and play your old records  i have a bunch of   s from my teenage years too  great memories  i think they are going to love it  they are       and   years old      
1336,4.0,                       i just found some old records of my mom s from the         s and bought this record player to listen to them  i love this player  only thing i would improve is the sound quality  not as good as i think it could be  i can hook my mini bose speaker up to it and it s better      
1337,1.0,                       i purchased this neat christmas  i thought it would be perfect to play my    s   it was super cute   and it would be easy to move around   but it would stop the    s before it was done   i thought it might have just been that one  but no it did it to them all   and i have other ways to play them so i know it is not the disk  so i returned it      
1338,5.0,                       my grand daughter had been interested in vynal records and i got her this for her   th birthday  she loves it      
1339,2.0,                       i got the record player yesterday  played maybe   or   records before it started skipping  i knew it wasn t the record as i had literally opened it for the first time before playing  i tried changing the needle to see if that was the issue  but it again started skipping  this time on a different brand new record  worked great when it wasn t skipping but again only lasted about   records before it started skipping ridiculously     
1340,3.0,                       i expected better sound qualityalso i thought i could connect my bluetooth speaker to improve sound quality but i ve been unable to figure that out  i think they mean you can use this player as a bluetooth but who would want to   poor sound     
1341,5.0,                       very old school  love it  sound quality is just ok but you have the option to plug into better speakers  bluetooth connectivity is a nice option but really not meant for this  pulled out some old led zep and was taken back in time  comes with a    adapter and additional needle      
1342,5.0,                       i know that other people haven t had the best luck with these machines  but i love mine  the sound quality isn t the best of the best  but let s face it  are you looking for high fidelity  flawless sound out of your record  i wasn t  i was looking for a fun  antique sound and this is awesome  can t beat it      
1343,1.0,                       this product does not work with all vinyl records  very disappointed in addition  when i returned the product and received a refund  the refund was less than what i paid for the product      
1344,1.0,                       listen  i bought used  i should have known better  but i went against my better judgment  i m was black not turquoise  and the thing didn t work whatsoever  the arm has petroleum jelly  glue  squirted in it making it completely garbage  worst record player purchase i ve ever made  the turntable didn t turn at all  and the arm wouldn t ever read the record when turned by hand  should have really been checked for quality before it was sold      
1345,1.0,                       item just not working at all  i was pretty excited when i receive the item  but as soon as i plug in the power cored  i notice the power light is still off  and nothing is running     
1346,5.0,                       feeling old  treat yourself to this portable and easy to store turntable and listen to your old favorites on vinyl and dance like you did as a teen      
1347,1.0,                       the record player stopped working within just a few months as a needle skips and bounces  customer service doesn t help and doesn t respond to emails or inquiries     
1348,1.0,                       it worked when received  i used it a few times to play vinyl and bluetooth without a problem  when i went to use it again the speakers did not work and as it was just past the    day purchase date  the vendor will not replace refund nor will amazon replace even after the csr stated they would provide a replacement if the vendor did not replace refund         
1349,1.0,                       do not buy    if i could give this zero stars i would  this is the second player we have purchased from this company and they both stopped working within   day  we thought the first one was just messed up because we bought it from a store instead of amazon but the new one did the exact same thing      
1350,5.0,                       i normal always read reviews but i really liked the look of this turntable so i was a little nervous purchasing  i am very pleased with it  it s a beautiful style  sounds great  easy to use and even the bluetooth is an easy option to use and sounds great  it was a good investment  i purchased the stand on amazon as well and it s beautiful in color and looks great for a complete set      
1351,1.0,                       i was so excited about a turntable  it did not spin at all i was not expecting the best sound  i was not expecting anything exceptional  i just wanted to play a record the thing did not spin      
1352,2.0,                       the sound quality is great  when it doesn t have the most annoying squeak in the world on every turn  other than that i m really pleased with the quality  just please make it stop so i can hear my records     
1353,2.0,                       you get what you pay for  invest in a better record player   like i should have done   first  it worked but the sound quality was crud and then two months later it won t even power on anymore   of course after the return policy was up      
1354,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this is fairly easy to use and sounds great  it s also fairly cheap in comparison to others of this nature  worth the money     
1355,1.0,                       i am not one to write reviews but for this item i felt obligated  my wife bought this for me for my birthday to replace a similar one i had for years  i have now received   from amazon and not one has worked  the first powered on but emitted only white noise  the next   will not even power on  save yourself some time and energy and buy a different product      
1356,1.0,                       no sound coming out of it  had to return it      
1357,3.0,                       the sound quality is mediocre  sounds like you re listening through a can      
1358,4.0,                       ordered black but received blue  maybe a sign from the universe  easy to use for a beginner  does interesting crack noise sometimes but overall so happy with it      
1359,5.0,                       perfect choice with this victrola record player because it has blue tooth so you can also play music stored on your phone  it has a great sound and is easy to use  perfect for teen and young adult      
1360,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          pros the same sound as my old    s record player   very portable   excellent for beginners cons until today in test         
1361,5.0,                       i had a bulky record player growing up  i missed the sound of records  i bought this little guy because it s my favorite color  i was not disappointed  it s the same great sound but in a lightweight case      
1362,5.0,                       this turntable is amazing for the price  sounds really good  and it s pretty darn good quality for what i paid  i d definitely recommend it      
1363,5.0,                       i really enjoy listening to records on this  brings back childhood memories      
1364,3.0,                       this is a kind of kids toy  it will play vinil but is not able to reproduce with a minimum quality the new albuns with more dynamic range  it will skip the part of musics with more deep bass  speakers are really bad  so i ll just recomend for those who wants to play old albuns and doesn t care about music quality      
1365,3.0,                       not a terrible product  let s just say you get what you pay for  stopped working after a few weeks  i would say invest in another product if you truly value the sound quality of vinyl but not bad for a novelty item      
1366,4.0,                       the product looks  sounds  and works great  but unfortunately it was delivered in the product box  which was torn and dented when i received it fortunately  this did not cause damage to the product  it just caused a bit of anxiety finding it that way      
1367,1.0,                       this record player is horrible  it doesn t play any record correctly and the sound quality is horrible  will be returning     
1368,5.0,                       i don t know why thickness is an option for rating this but my son says it s dummy thicc and works fantastically lolthe demon finish is great        
1369,5.0,                    me gusta esta marca me trae recuerdos        
1370,5.0,                       this was a gift and i love having the ability to play my old vinyls and    s from my childhood      
1371,1.0,                       horrible horrible horrible   nothing on this thing works  what a waste of money      
1372,2.0,                       the sound quality is just bad  i guess you get what you pay for   i also have the issue of my needle skating across brand new records and making my songs skip   cute player  but could use better tech inside      
1373,5.0,                       i was a bit confused at first how it worked but i just found a video and figured it out pretty quickly  it gets pretty loud especially on bluetooth  great price for a vinyl player they re usually way more expensive and it s a cute brief case when you fold it up     
1374,4.0,                       it s so sturdy  i love it    the bluetooth is pretty loud for    to    bucks  it s something you could use and it spices up your room too      
1375,1.0,                       ordered this  returned  ordered again  and returned again  this player skips on brand new records  the turntable makes records wobble and will not play them properly      
1376,5.0,                       i thought the sound was nice and crisp especially when paired with dre beats headphones  not a bad little portable player for the price and i also love my red checkered design      
1377,2.0,                       i guess i got what i paid for      
1378,3.0,                       it s a cute little record player but you need a better pair of amplified speakers for a good sound  also turntable is for    s more so than albums      
1379,1.0,                       returned  one speaker channel died in a week  you can hear the motor if you hook it up to bigger speakers  very plastic  spend the          on a decent turntable      
1380,2.0,                       this was my first player to play my records on  i purchased this in      and it stopped working before the next year  it just would not turn on anymore  also  after years of well fed wisdom on vinyl  these players don t do anything but tear up your records  if you have records you don t really care about but you want to hear em play for a cheap price and cheap sound  go ahead and get this      
1381,2.0,                       i bought this product to listen to old and new records but it has a sound glitch up  it will randomly skip parts to a song or the song will mess up  even on brand new just opened records it did this  wouldnt fully recommend     
1382,5.0,                       for beginners  easy use  love the foldable case      
1383,3.0,                       the sound out of the unit isn t very good  there are no separate sound controls other than volume  very disappointed  the case is pretty with the map graphics clear and bold  comes with an extra needle which is nice      
1384,1.0,                       this looks nice but it unfortunately stopped working a month after i purchased it  also  the bluetooth never worked      
1385,3.0,                       product looks great but can t use it because it didn t come with a power adapter  everything i can see shows it should come with one but ours didn t  amazon support was great to work with but the original seller was unreachable at the time      
1386,5.0,                       we are lucky enough to have a cool record shop in gloucester massachusetts so i started listening to old records  this player is cool   and works      
1387,1.0,                       epic fail  big disappointment  opened on christmas morning with anticipation and it would not work  turntable will not spin  do yourself a favor and choose another bluetooth turntable      
1388,1.0,                       the box arrived busted  another amazon customer s original order label and return label was on the box  immediately started skipping    seconds in  and continued to get worse  i tried   different albums  changed out the needle  etc  i m disappointed to buy a new item  only to have someone else s returned  and probably already broken  leftovers      
1389,5.0,                       first time vinyl user here  the victrola is very easy to use and provides acceptable sound quality  it comes with an aux out  so i actually have it running to an external speaker system  but the built in speakers are solid      
1390,1.0,                       if i could give it a negative star i would  the bluetooth feature worked fine but the main purpose for buying a record player would be to play records which it didn t do successfully amazon should hold these companies accountable for selling products to their customers that don t work  it s unprofessional not to and takes advantage of those that also pay for a prime membership every year      
1391,1.0,                       absolute utter trash  tiny sound even hooked up to pro monitors with riaa eq  headphone is full of static  they should pay you to take this  i have never had such a negative experience buying something  i d chalk it up to price but at even less than     this is a waste     
1392,1.0,                       from the moment i took it out of the box and put on the first record  a brand new record  it was skipping and the speakers sounded crackly  i should have spent the extra money to buy a better player      
1393,5.0,                       very good record player  kind of skeptical at first because i read some pretty bad reviews  however  it works well  sounds fantastic  and my husband absolutely loves it      
1394,3.0,                       the record player itself is good  but when used with headphones the sound still comes out of the normal speakers for some reason  leaving it to be useless      
1395,1.0,                       gave it to my daughter for her birthday sept        unboxed and speakers would not play sound         
1396,5.0,                       sound is exactly what i wanted  product is gorgeous   very surprised at the price and several friends have asked for the link     very pleased  thanks for a cool statement piece      
1397,3.0,                       pressure placed on record by needle is way to much  not horrible for a first timer  or if you only plan on playing your records very sparingly      
1398,4.0,                       it s a little cheap on quality but it works great      
1399,1.0,                       sound was too tinny     
1400,5.0,                       i like the sound  i like how easy it is to use  i am very pleased with my purchase  a a a a a a a      
1401,5.0,                       so far   so good  we gave this to our five year old  granddaughter for christmas and she loves it   she s has been listening to her mom s old record  story books  we had fun choosing some albums for her    limbo and the twist  at a used record store  i love to give novel things that the other grandparents won t don t give  it was a much appreciated gift      
1402,5.0,                       i got my used in good condition and it came in like it was brand new  love the white and gold looks great as decor as well      
1403,5.0,                       this is a very well made product  sound quality is good compared to other brands i ve seen  speakers get pretty loud  overall it s a great item and i totally recommend      
1404,1.0,                       bought this in october for  a christmas present so she didn t open it till        she was able to you for less then a month and now it won t power on or anything  she was so excited but didn t last even a month        
1405,5.0,                       i bought this for my dad for christmas  he mostly uses it as a bluetooth speaker since he can t find his box of old records after my parents recent move  the speakers work great      
1406,4.0,                       neat record player with great portability  as far as i m concerned the sound quality is spot on      
1407,5.0,                       this is an excellent starter record player  or a great record player for those in a smaller home or apartment  i ve had no problems with any of the functions  including the speakers and blutooth  would buy again      
1408,5.0,                       pretty good player considering the price  i m in a small space so it s just loud enough for me but don t expect much  you pay for what you get  like i said  it s good for the price  gets the job done and i m overall happy with it      
1409,1.0,                       bought this as a gift for my daughter  it started smoking first time it was plugged in   pay attention to all the bad reviews  they are real      
1410,3.0,                       i bought this record player for my daughter  who is      it is cute  and she has been enjoying it  but almost immediately we decided we needed a better quality player   the sound is so  so  and there s a lot of wobble in the mechanism that spins the record      
1411,5.0,                       small compact record player  beautiful color  the sound is nice and it s great to have so many ways to play your music  the part the record sits on seems a little flimsy  but other than that everything on it is perfect      
1412,1.0,                       the record player inexplicably stops playing before the end of every record  piece of junk      
1413,1.0,                       hugely disappointed with what should be at least an ok record player    by the makers of the first record players no less  item arrived in seemingly good condition  however when i attempted to play a record it was obvious the lift lever was broken and therefore the arm will not stay down to play records  hopefully my record isnt too badly scratched from the needle skipping across the surface       
1414,3.0,                       cheaply made  not sturdy  and sound quality is not great  this is only day one of use  will come back with more      
1415,5.0,                       great starter player for my little guy      he loves it  easy to use  and a great way for my little audiophile to be able to play his own records      
1416,1.0,                       not worth the money  arrived broken and then was sent another broken one as well     
1417,5.0,                       couple hours in from unboxing i am very happy  there was a cover on the needle that i missed during unboxing but took less than   minutes to realize my error  then it worked great  best spontaneous purchase for low price thus far on amazon prime      
1418,5.0,                       this is the best thing ever for my classroom   the kids  first graders  marvel at how a vinyl record works and the blue tooth speakers work great for music from my phone in the class   after i retire  it will work beautifully at home   love it      
1419,5.0,                       surprisingly  this works extremely well  and if you register it on their website  they ll send you a  free gift   an extra replacement needle   the bluetooth isn t the best but it works and it s clear  the actual record player though is amazing and has the airy sound that most people look for in using records as their sound provider      
1420,1.0,                       it broke within    hours   this is our second try with this record player      
1421,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          very happy for a beginner   it s so nice it inspires me to seek higher and greater sound but i m good with this for a while quality materials in a very small package     
1422,1.0,                       at three months stop working and i have been trying to contact them and do not receive call back      
1423,1.0,                       the needle ruins your records     
1424,1.0,                       this player skips on every album we played on it  it is a cheap piece of junk i would like to return      
1425,4.0,                       like the look   sounds ok  we don t play our records much  but it s small and takes us back when we reminisce      
1426,5.0,                       it was for my mom  i added speakers  it s a great product  i have never used bluetooth      
1427,3.0,                       got this for someone so they could play the vinyls i got them  its pretty decent but i personally wouldn t get it for myself  the design is pretty stale and the music quality is okay  for for serious music heads  its just a quick and easy way to play your vinyls if you want      
1428,5.0,                       i bought this for my boyfriend as a birthday gift and we both absolutely love it  it sounds amazing  we use it at night to listen to podcasts  and we never have any issues with it  it s very budget friendly and i don t regret it whatsoever      
1429,1.0,                       the box arrived completely damaged and clearly opened previously and appeared to have been a returned item re sold      
1430,5.0,                       found an old album that i used to listen to as a little girl   looked for the album fir years   found it online and now i have the record player to play it on   love it      
1431,5.0,                       i bought this as a gift for my niece who had started collecting records  but had no record player to play them with  this was definitely a perfect choice for her  it s simple enough for her to understand what to do and work it on her own  it also works with bluetooth so it doubles as a speaker which she also loves  she can take it from room to room easily and it works great  the sound quality isn t top tier  but she says she likes it because it makes everything she plays  feel more vintage       
1432,3.0,                       it s a fun toy to start someone along the path to appreciating vinyl  mediocre sound at best  tone arm is not weighted properly and caused skips on all but the most perfect records  i glued a coin to the arm and now it works ok      
1433,5.0,                       bought this for a little nostalgia and i couldn t be happier   the sound quality is great and the player was fully functional right out of the box   i highly recommend      
1434,5.0,                       i love this record player  its is so easy to use  you can hook up bigger speakers to the back if you d like  the bluetooth is for streaming music from another device  works great      
1435,5.0,                       the turntable on my record player was very warped so i bought this one and hoped for the best  it is great  the sound is impressive for the size of the player and it was very easy to set up  would recommend      
1436,1.0,                       it s beautiful  too bad i cant play it  no cords  nothing      
1437,5.0,                       just what daughter wanted  looks nice and is easy to take along with you      
1438,5.0,                       i bought this for my husband for his birthday  we ve both really enjoyed it  it s cute and stylish and the sound quality is great  my only issue is the bluetooth  i read the manual and still can t figure it out      
1439,1.0,                       please do not order this for a christmas present without knowing you will be the one to pick up the box when it s delivered  this was my daughters gift from santa and it has the picture on the outside of the box  totally ruined it  i would never have know to ask that it be covered     
1440,1.0,                       the sound is all scratchy like an old old record     sad   because it is so cute and portable  thank you     
1441,5.0,                       i got this as a present for my mother  she couldnt be happier  the sound quality is very good and it is extremely portable      
1442,1.0,                       i loved my player that i got for christmas  then one day i went to turn it on  and there was no power   at first  i thought it was the outlet  but other things worked in the same outlet  i even tried a different adapter but still no luck so i returned the player and upgraded to a better turntable      
1443,5.0,                       freaking amazing  got it for my friend and it plays records and music from your phone  it can go pretty loud  i used it at a small party  it s also easy to move because it turns into a little briefcase  one of my best buys      
1444,3.0,                       it works but not too well  the music drags out  i was scared it would ruin my records so i purchased a better quality turntable      
1445,5.0,                       super cool  my daughter loves this  i especially love the color we got  looks aged and retro      
1446,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          my first time to use a turntable  i m so excited to have this   this is very easy to use  i love the vintage crisp sound this brings to my home  i can t wait to get more vinyls   also  the bluetooth was easy to connect to  i would recommend this to music lovers  very happy i bought this and you can t beat the price       
1447,5.0,                       i ve never had a record player lol but wanted to have something before my times  and it s very easy to use  lightweight and sounds amazing       
1448,5.0,                       super easy to use and such a fun thing to have      
1449,1.0,                       well  love the design and thought it would be great for our    year old daughter  it looks great and was excited but after putting on the first record i notice that needle and arm skipped through the song  this happened on any album i placed on the turn table  switched out the needle and this did fix the issue  returning it  better luck next time      
1450,4.0,                       this is good for the money  volume is ok  it s not terrible but not the best  definitely worth the cost though and sound quality is good  i ve had it a few years now and no issues whatsoever     
1451,5.0,                       this is a fine little lp player  an excellent value for the money      
1452,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          we used this to play our vinyls we have been collecting for a while and absolutely love it  best sound quality and bluetooth works like a charm  we hooked it up to a      sound bar to make us bougie but we love it      
1453,3.0,                       i bought this for my    year old granddaughter for christmas  she loves it  the color is great and its works as they say but i found it a bit flimsy and plastic  i guess i expected the quality of the original ones      
1454,1.0,                       meedle head is not heavy enough  it bouces like a basket ball on the forsy couple of songs  causing it to scratch the albums      
1455,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i love that       
1456,2.0,                       the quality was a lot less than expected  vibration from speakers made record skip  i wanted it to be good but in the end returned it and bought a better quality more expensive one      
1457,5.0,                       birthday gift for granddaughter  she loved it      
1458,5.0,                       item is as described by seller   this is a gift      
1459,1.0,                       played one time  switched records and power light went out    that was it       
1460,1.0,                       i haven t even owned this record player for a year  i ve hardly used it the last   months but recently bought a new album and couldn t wait to listen  sadly  my record player will not turn on   it makes a sound like it has some sort of power  but even the power on off light won t come on   i m so upset  this is such a big disappointment      
1461,5.0,                       this is the first record player i ve ever owned  i was very  skeptical about what i was buying because i didn t want to buy the wrong thing  it sounds really nice and none of my records skip scratch  the only complaint i might have is that with my larger records they hang off the edge so you can t close it while playing the music  but it s pretty  it plays well  and it s relatively simple to set up      
1462,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i bought this to play my grandmother s records   it is simple to use and the sound quality is terrific   the compact size makes it easy to store as well      
1463,5.0,                       not the color my daughter wanted but wow  way better than expected  beautiful too  sounds so cool and blue tooth works fabulous  she really liked it       
1464,3.0,                       excellent for a kid or a bedside thing   not for the serious minded   if you have a few old records  this would be perfect  it is really convenient      
1465,5.0,                       bought this several months ago  and let me tell you  a lot of odd dance ensembles have occurred since  it s loud  it s portable  and lots of fun to have around the house      
1466,5.0,                       absolutely amazing the sound quality is outstandingi have it attached to my sound system and it it made it even better i recommend this to anyone in the market     
1467,5.0,                       it just brought back my teenage years   i have so many    s and    s  when i moved   years ago   i was not able to move my stereo system  i just started missing playing them  it takes up very litter space      
1468,5.0,                       bought it for my wife because she was feeling nostalgic  it s not a bad sound and is actually pretty loud  i would imagine back in the day this was what we would be used to  bluetooth works great and it s nice that it has all   speeds      
1469,5.0,                       quality of construction and excellent performance     
1470,4.0,                       love this  only downside was the tear on the leather outside   nothing a sticker can t fix   sound quality could be a little better with bluetooth  but sounds just fine with a regular vinyl       
1471,5.0,                       this is an excellent buy  the size is perfect to fit just about anywhere  i m extremely happy it came with an extra needle  my husband workd at a record store for   years and he loves it  the color is also wonderful  i would certainly purchase again for another room or a gift      
1472,1.0,                       we were not able to give it to our niece last christmas  but could this year  it lasted four days  the motor had failed  a total waste of money  what a burn  i bought junk  don t do the same  get one at target      
1473,2.0,                       got this for my daughter s   th birthday  seemed to work great until just shy of two months after her birthday the speakers just completely quit working  it s now outside of the amazon return window so we re stuck with it unless my husband is able to repair it himself      
1474,5.0,                       i have had this portable record player for more than   months and it still works perfectly  i love the fact that i can listen to music by either physically connecting my phone  through bluetooth  and use it as an ordinary record player  it also is tie dye  which is as dope as it gets      
1475,4.0,                       gloriously glittery but the turntable and top part is made a very cheap plastic  the bluetooth also cuts out intermittently unless your device is right up next to the record player  i m not sure if it s a positive or negative that the record immediately begins to turn when you move the arm towards it       
1476,4.0,                       fast delivery  easy to use  a little fragile on th mechanics but for the price i can t complain  got this for my mom who has a ton of old vinyls  this is a perfect player to rekindle the good old days  speakers are ok  i plugged my wireless speaker into the headphone jack and it sounds a bit better  i ve only tried one record  hall and oats  and it seems to lack on base  not sure if vinyls lack base in general      
1477,5.0,                       my daughter absolutely loves this record player  bought it for her birthday in the union jack design  the sound is really good  much better than i expected  very happy with purchase  will be buying more vinyl so we can use it more      
1478,1.0,                       this is for a little kid  it doesn t put out any bass when you hook it up to a receiver      
1479,5.0,                       i liked everything about it     
1480,2.0,                       had to return it because when you connect to bluetooth there is no noise cancellation  you can still hear the phono play back and it s quite annoying  it would have been perfect otherwise      
1481,1.0,                       giving one star because it did not power up out of the box   this was a christmas gift for my nephew   he was so excited he immediately took it out of the box before even opening the rest of his gifts and it did not work   huge disappointment   the power cord wouldn t even stay in  it kept popping out   i m returning it update  ordered another one at it does not work properly   the  st one wouldn t even power up   this one  the speed was inconsistent  i give up   returning the  nd one as well and purchasing something else      
1482,5.0,                       i love this vintage turntable  i ve been looking for a record player for a while and found this  it is a great price and it is something i use everyday  it works perfectly  i love that it also has bluetooth speakers with it because i can not only listen to my music on my record  but also play other music  i definitely recommend this for anyone who would like to buy it      
1483,5.0,                       very nice product for the money  decent sound and bluetooth connected no problem  haven t tried the line in option but i expect it to work just as well      
1484,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          it works fine  set up is easy  sound form speakers is just okay  it s not the  victrola  brand as advertised  but it s doing the job  everything about it seems pretty flimsy  but it was     and it plays      
1485,5.0,                       bought for my daughter as she had   record she had never played  she loved it  it s loud and the sound quality is really good     
1486,5.0,                       i love this record player  i don t have a need for a kenwood stereo system with the massive speakers like we used to have back in the old days just something simple that can play my music  this little unit is more than sufficient for the single room experience  for the size of the speakers it sure produces quality sound  i mean it s toward the treble end of the e q  range but as advised you re not buying kenwood so know what to expect  overall a really good little unit for the price      
1487,2.0,                       it looks good   doesn t sound too bad  great for the price  but  the    setting runs about one extra revolution    so the sound is sped up ever so slightly  just enough to bug me because i know how my records sound  not sure if this is just the case with the one i bought  but not taking any chances  probably won t get another one     
1488,4.0,                       good portable vinyl player   sound quality is good   have not tried bluetooth yet but would be great if it can connect to my amplifier via bt  player works perfectly   no issue or of the box and was able to play a record with ease hard case wraps the whole package snugly      
1489,5.0,                       purchased this as a gift and my friend was very pleased with it and all of its features      
1490,1.0,                       don t wait to try it out  i was an idiot and just tried it today  past the return date  the motor doesn t work      
1491,5.0,                       this is exactly what i was looking for it is amazing little piece very vintage looking and small and works perfect  i am very happy with my purchase     
1492,5.0,                       great entry level record player  sound quality could be better but still great deal     
1493,5.0,                       we got this as a gift for my father in law  and not just him  but everyone else loved it  the briefcase packaging is amazing  easy to open and set up anywhere you want it  the sound quality is great  very elegant design  i ll be purchasing it for myself      
1494,4.0,                       love the color of this product and it was a great price point  my daughter really enjoys it      
1495,1.0,                       beautiful but i just used it brand new out of the box and every record skips even brand new just opened vinyls or ones i cleaned  i even tried to replace the needle but still every record i play new or old skips on this piece of junk  shame cause it is a beauty      
1496,5.0,                       wish the speakers sounded better      
1497,1.0,                       purchased as a christimas present for my daughter along with the matching vinyl carrying case   initially the only negative is that there is no where to store the power cord and it does not fit inside the record player   we loved it and the sound was great but even with limited use it lasted       months before it stopped working   disappointing to say the least     
1498,5.0,                       surprised my wife with this record player  she absolutely loves it  it s beautiful and the sound quality is amazing  she uses it all the time      
1499,1.0,                       the record player won t play unless i push the needle down as the record goes around i ve tried this on different speeds and different records but it just won t work properly i am not going to put a quarter on the arm to push down the needle to hold it down like we did in the    s mailed it back for full refund     
1500,2.0,                       a lot of skipping     
1501,5.0,                       perfect and cute  sound is good and it s just what i needed      
1502,2.0,                       terrible for vinyls  great for bluetooth skips every single vinyl we ve gotten  we ve set up the correct speed and everything and it skips every single new vinyl we ve received  i can t believe how disappointed  i am  do not get this for vinyls        
1503,5.0,                       works great  more compact then other units  my daughter never heard a record player  she loves it      
1504,5.0,                       bought this as a gift to for my boyfriend and it s such an awesome record play and it looks fantastic  very easy to use and the bluetooth is a great addition     
1505,5.0,                       this is a wonderful product  sounds great and easy to use      
1506,3.0,                       don t know what i was expecting based on the price  but the speakers are awful  maybe a good way to get started in the hobby if you for some reason don t care about how anything sounds  but as soon as anything starts playing i want to turn it off  otherwise seemed fine  but will definitely be returning      
1507,3.0,                       product actually stopped working all together  how can i get another      
1508,4.0,                       it wasn t the product i dislike i ain like how ups put my package outside my door  unwrapped for the whole neighborhood to see what i had smh     
1509,5.0,                       my boyfriend got this for me for a present and i have yet to listen to all of my records  i love its bluetooth capabilities and its easy to use  cute  and worth the price      
1510,1.0,                       doesn t come with a  cord to plug in and play      have to buy it separate  horrible quality  horrible  customer service    don t buy this product  we spend a lot of money on amazon   can t believe we were treated this way  think we will take our business elsewhere      
1511,5.0,                       bought this a gift for my    year old and she loves it  great record player with great sound  it s not the loudest  but that s ok      
1512,5.0,                    el producto es lo que esperaba  el color nada que ver  esperaba un verde menta y el que me lleg  es blanco         
1513,1.0,                       returned  no power cord      
1514,1.0,                       i ordered this and had already bought records  very excited to try them out  when i received it i was in the middle of two different moves and did not get the chance to try it out but once i did a few weeks later it did not work  due to the moves i was out of the return window so i know have a broken record player and lost the money  do not buy     
1515,5.0,                       what is funny is that many  modern  artists are recording in vinyl  it s coming back  but i am happy hearing again my record collection      
1516,5.0,                       purchased this addy the great of my daughter  she loves it  it s easy to use and the sound isn t bad at all      
1517,5.0,                       she loves it  couldn t be happier  makes me wonder what i did with my original victrola  which was virtually identical      
1518,5.0,                       was truly impressed with how good this unit sounds  we got it for our teenage daughter and it has a great depth of sound      
1519,1.0,                       my player arrived today and looks great  the only problem is that the turntable won t spin  the bluetooth function works fine but the record player won t play records at all      
1520,2.0,                       got it for my daughter  it s beautiful   people compliments it a lot   the sound wasn t that good from the beginning but realistically i didn t expect more for the price   but after   month the sound got awful   like staticky  now is only a nice decoration in her room        
1521,1.0,                       speakers do not work  no sound et all  wtf  any number to call for support           
1522,1.0,                       it s all in the headline      
1523,1.0,                       bought this for my daughter and the power cord was not in the box  i ordered a power cord and when it arrived  the record player would not work  it came on and hummed but the turn table would not come on      
1524,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          great   th gift      
1525,4.0,                       my wife has been using this a for a couple weeks now and she loves it  it seems a little cheap in places and the speaker quality leaves a little more to be desired  but it works great  very light and portable      
1526,2.0,                       this was worth the price   we needed to put a penny of the arm because it kept skipping      
1527,4.0,                       decent little record player and fits my current needs   the sound is so so   but it s possible to connect larger speakers   it doesn t scream quality made   but at the price point  it s acceptable      
1528,5.0,                       a perfect bit of nostalgia  it really garners a lot of attention and compliments      
1529,1.0,                       i liked the look of the unit  but beyond that its crap  after two weeks the unit started dragging my records  i just stopped using it and packed it away  brought a better record player  problem solved  save your money      
1530,1.0,                       i ve had to return the item  x  not very happy about it  i would never buy this brand again  waiting on my refund      
1531,2.0,                       we purchased this for our daughter for her birthday  we did not see anywhere on the posting that we were purchasing a used item  when she opened it up this morning   the product was clearly used  it was also supposed to include an extra stylist  it was not included  we will not purchase from this seller again      
1532,5.0,                       so nostalgic  brings back all sorts of memories  it was funny explaining how records work to out millennial daughter       
1533,5.0,                       works perfectly   got this for my mother  she had moved into assisted living and has limited space   it plays her    records without a problem      
1534,1.0,                       it s horribletried to get my money back and couldn t        
1535,1.0,                       the product stopped working after a month  it was never moved or tampered with  it just stopped working      
1536,5.0,                       i bought this item as a gift for my husband because we moved and didn t have space for the really big record player we like this one because it fits nicely on his nightstand the sound is good clear loud we liked it so much even my mother decided to buy one after listening to it     
1537,5.0,                       great purchase for the price  good gift  but you should buy the recipient at least   records because you can instantly plug it in and rock out        
1538,5.0,                       i love it  wanted to upgrade from the kind of cheap player i d had for   years and had worn out in multiple moves  storage  etc  it still works  but it s nice to have a better player that i ve wanted for a while      
1539,5.0,                       bought this as a christmas present for my sister  i hear her playing some elvis with this every day  sounds great  and looks great pros worth the pricelooks greatsounds greatcons doesn t come with any vinyls     
1540,1.0,                       i had to return the first one because the turntable wouldn t turn i just got the replacement and the speakers don t work i just tried to call tech support and their mailbox is full      
1541,5.0,                       i m so happy with this player     
1542,2.0,                       cannot get it to work with my speakers or my bluetooth  only works with the speakers on the unit which aren t very great      
1543,2.0,                       bluetooth didn t work  speakers didn t work  maybe i just had a defective one  returned immediately      
1544,5.0,                       works great for a beginner     
1545,1.0,                       i bought this product and the moment i took it out of the box the record player did not work  i tried to play the record and the turn table was not working right  the music quality was terrible and it wasn t the record it self because prior to buying this i had tried the records on other players  please give me a refund      
1546,5.0,                       fast shipping   works great       
1547,4.0,                       is the sound great  no  but you can connect to bluetooth for the price   because other wise you re looking at a hundreds of     setup      
1548,5.0,                       sound quality is great and price is very affordable     
1549,5.0,                       honestly for the price you get a bluetooth speaker  and aux speaker  and a vinyl player  the speakers themselves are not the best  but they get the job done  you can even hook up your own if you don t like them      
1550,3.0,                       arrived today in a unsealed untaped etc  box  i was totally shocked  anyone could have opened the box   took out whatever they wanted  wow        
1551,2.0,                       i had ordered camo color but received solid gray instead  tiny speakers have no bass and distort when turned up      
1552,4.0,                       this is a good record player  the sound is good and it is easy to use      
1553,3.0,                       great table  worth money  easy transport  connected to large old school speakers  sounds great   recommend      
1554,5.0,                       we love this little turntable  plus it connects easily to my iphone as a bluetooth speaker  the sound quality is great  easy to use too      
1555,2.0,                       i was very excited about this when i got it  as it was my first record player  but was soon disappointed  the record continuously skipped  so much that i was worried about it damaging my records  i did more research and found that this was a common problem for suitcase model record players  i returned the item and got a nicer audio technica turntable instead      
1556,5.0,                       i bought this for my dad   he hasn t used the blue tooth yet but is very pleased   i wish it had an automatic arm as it is difficult for him to lift the little lever without scratching the album   i have a feeling i ll be buying many needles      
1557,5.0,                       speakers aren t great but hooked up to bluetooth speakers and it s great  reminds me of my childhood turntable      
1558,5.0,                       absolutely love this      
1559,5.0,                       so easy to use and works amazing     
1560,5.0,                       product cheaply made  fairly decent sound but the unit quit working after   months  amazon return window    days   unit does not power on  victrola support is not reliable   unresponsive to voicemails  required to leave a voicemail  no live person at customer service is ever available       
1561,5.0,                       fast ship  good product      
1562,5.0,                       daughter loves this  bluetooth works great  sound quality is ok      
1563,4.0,                       i ve been using this for a couple months  after buying it as a christmas gift for my wife  it works well  is easy to use  and looks nice  it lacks bass  and will never be confused with a hifi system  but you definitely get your money s worth  in a positive sense       
1564,5.0,                       it was a christmas gift for my little sister and she loves it  says that works really good      
1565,4.0,                       i was disappointed with the sound output jack on the back   poor quality sound but the sound from the speakers is fine   everything else works great as well      
1566,1.0,                       i presented this item as a birthday gift only to find  during setup  that the needle was broken  good thing it comes with a replacement  right  the replacement is also broken and looks as if it was chewed on by a dog  i bought a  new  item but this is clearly used and broken  very disappointing considering this was a birthday present      
1567,1.0,                       my second record player in a month  first one had irregular speed and this one had broken speakers      
1568,5.0,                       came just as expected and works like a charm  really a lot of functionality for such a great price  my wife s grandmother loved the color as well  this is our second purchase of the same item and we d happily buy another for a gift down the road      
1569,5.0,                       i love the ability to strap the needle down for transit  i like the autolift and drop switch so you don t damage the needle dropping it we haven t used it for the bluetooth  so i can t comment on that  but i was actually impressed with the sound quity for the value and it s very easy to move around as needed      
1570,1.0,                       didn t come with a power cord and when i found one to plug it in to to an out let the turntable didn t spin correctly and when i tried to fix it it still wouldn t work  was not producing and sound and was not indicating it was on  do not waste your money on this     
1571,2.0,                       of course amazon loves to tell me something will arrive that day if i order it in the next  insert time here   this thing showed up a day late and the motor would not turn  i am returning it and will update my review when i receive a working one      
1572,5.0,                       this is alli hoped it would be  in response to the people having trouble with it  not working   please be sure to remove the white stylus cover  i thought it didn t work either until i decided to read all the instructions      
1573,1.0,                       the sound is like an old pocket am radio  even when connected to my home stereo system it is still weak and tinny sounding  zero stars  oh  they won t let you do that  therefore  i am forced to rate it one star      
1574,4.0,                       for the price  this is a great starter record player  the switches seem to be wired backward  but it doesn t affect how it plays  hooks up to my sound bar and plays great  very portable  easy to use      
1575,5.0,                       this is quite awesome  of course i will not carrying this when i going to outside  but is comfortable for carrying  and it is looks like suitcase if it is closed  so if you can store this somewhere like inside of store  maybe you can surprise another people  hey  look at my suitcase  in really  this is turntable  not suitcase         
1576,1.0,                       item was received and product came out of the box damaged  turn table was popped out and wouldn t work  benefit of doubt  ordered replacement  got replacement  unit won t even play    seconds without skipping and replaying  weird  requesting refund and now i have to ship off   items to get my refund  poor product and even poorer quality control      
1577,2.0,                       purchased      and by the end of august  the speakers are shot  so bummed  it s cute  love the color and ease of use  but gotta have those speakers  too late for return so i can use it on the lower volumes still or let my kids have it while i search for a better quality record player      
1578,5.0,                       my husband loves his record player  i got it for him last year for christmas and it works great  great sound quality      
1579,1.0,                       this thing is junk  belt keeps popping off  tear down every    seconds of play to put it back together  save your money  buy something quality      
1580,5.0,                       i love this but the speakers are   i guess the best way to put it is  soft  they have a plug in the back for speakers though i will probably end up getting some speakers for it  still love it though  very portable      
1581,5.0,                       great    my daughter loves it     
1582,1.0,                       i bought this product as a christmas present for my friend  i was very excited to give them it  and was very disappointed to find that it was defective  for whatever reason  on every record i purchased it starts out fine  then starts skipping at random points as the turntable seems to have a warped rotation  very disappointed and hoping i can get a refund easily     
1583,1.0,                       i used this once and it was great but when i went to use it the  nd time  it didn t start  i paid     for a new cord in case that was the issue but it still didn t work  i tried to get help through amazon but since it was past the    day window then  they said i would have to contact the manufacturer myself  very disappointed      
1584,5.0,                       great       
1585,5.0,                       only had it for a couple weeks  it s so pretty and convenient  i love the way it operates  can t say much for the sound quality because i listen to really old records and enjoy the crackly sound      
1586,1.0,                       i ordered this product with lots of hope because of the good comments  but received it and set it up  and it won t even turn on  the power supply is all plugged in  i even tried multiple outlets to make sure enough electricity was getting to it but the power light won t turn on  highly don t suggest because now i m going to have to go through the return process which takes even more time out of my day     
1587,2.0,                       the sound quality is terrible and the turn table wobbles  i would not buy again      
1588,1.0,                       i was so excited for this product  i got it set up with now problems  after   songs it s started to scrape as the platter turned and skipping repeating parts of the songs  very disappointed      
1589,1.0,                       plugged it in and it got fried  didn t work at all  had to return it      
1590,3.0,                       the record player is great looks really cool my husband was really impressed  the internal speakers are harsh at higher volumes it could just be the acoustics of the wooden table its on but we re looking into getting some better quality external speakers     
1591,2.0,                       this player wouldn t play with multiple newer vinyl             and would constantly skip  maybe better for older vinyl or less dynamic music but would not recommend  i got a much better quality  beginner  turntable for about     more than this one      
1592,5.0,                       nothing better than listening to vinyl     
1593,5.0,                       bought as a gift for my husband he loves it  easy set up works very well      
1594,1.0,                       used it maybe     times first few months that we bought it and it died   other reviews mention the same thing   not worth buying again      
1595,5.0,                       great record player for my daughter who s just getting into records      
1596,3.0,                       it s okay for the price  the speakers are low quality   very tinny sounding  i hope to find a cord that will connect it to my bose speaker      
1597,5.0,                       this is a perfect record player   it was a wonderful gift   packaged great and arrived early      
1598,4.0,                       sound could be better  but for a teenager just wanted something different in their room this is a good product   does play records okay  but sound could definitely be better      
1599,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          amazing product  i definitely suggest it      
1600,2.0,                       brand new out of the box and the turntable would not turn to play the record   turns out the belt was not attached properly   luckily we were able to take it apart and fix it  but would have rather spent christmas evening listening to records rather than fixing a brand new record player      
1601,3.0,                       sound quality is pretty bad but it is cute     
1602,4.0,                       there is very low bass on the sound and no adjustments      
1603,5.0,                       such a great sound  you can use bluetooth connection and play music from your phone if you don t want play any vinyl player is also very stylish and looks amazing and makes perfect match in our living room  i would expect higher price for great product like this  no regrets  highly recommend        
1604,5.0,                       i love the compatibility  of the case for storage and the look  this was a small anniversary gift to my husband who has lots of vinyl records  it sounds great and bluetooth is a plus  takes me back to chil  i recommend for those who like to play their music and relax      
1605,3.0,                       bought this for my daughter for her birthday  she had it for a month before the speaker blew  i emailed victrola   no response  not sure what the proper procedure is to return or have it fixed  but i feel like i wasted my money now        
1606,1.0,                       this turntable is highly questionable   the only thing i d like to add aside from my headline is that the platter stopped spinning after i d only used it several times      
1607,1.0,                       this turntable is highly questionable   the only thing i d like to add aside from my headline is that the platter stopped spinning after i d only used it several times      
1608,5.0,                       this turntable has everything   easy to use   portable and best of all get to listen to vinyl pasted down from the    s    s   music feeds the soul       
1609,5.0,                       love this player  good price for what you get  hope to one day upgrade but love this purchase for my first turntable  very easy to use      
1610,5.0,                       my daughter absolutely loves this  she loves playing vintage lp s  small compact unit with great sound  she luvs the uk union jack too      
1611,5.0,                       bought this for fianc e for christmas  and she can t stop playing records  she love it  and so do i  playing your phone over it is extremely easy for set up      
1612,5.0,                       that sound though  this has been such fun for us  love     
1613,5.0,                       we purchased this for my younger sister who s currently in college  she loves music and was wanting a record player  it looks super cute in her apartment room  she s not picky about the technical aspects  it gets the job done  the packaging came damaged  as the description warns  but as far as the device itself  there s nothing concerning to note  she s had this for five months now and when i asked for her opinion of it today she responded                      
1614,5.0,                       great price and great sound  i love the color and get lots of compliments  can t be beaten for the price so i m super satisfied      
1615,5.0,                       the sound from the player is very clear  even with the volume at max level  it is also easy to set up and use      
1616,5.0,                       well worth what paid for and timely delivery     
1617,5.0,                       quality product     
1618,1.0,                       would not turn on after plugged in  i probably just got a defective one but did not repurchase from seller      
1619,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          it is a good product for the price and we love this  the record is not an original it is brand new never played and i m happy with it     
1620,4.0,                       love this record player  the speakers are ok  a little onthe quiet side but i like the charm of it  it seems to be a little delicate  especially the arm  i recommend reading the directions on how to operate it properly so you don t break it      
1621,1.0,                       if i could have rated this zero stars  i would have  after waiting two weeks for this record player  i finally received it and tried playing one of my brand new records on it  long story short  the record player started smoking after about    seconds of being turned on  and it  almost caught on fire  definitely will be returning      
1622,5.0,                       was as gift     
1623,5.0,                       i bought a new record player because i needed new speakers for my old one  and a new player was cheaper than new speakers  i played one side of a vinyl before i had to leave and it sounded just fine  i have yet to try the bluetooth setting  but it is a nice feature  i like the vintage look to it as well      
1624,4.0,                       i love the map design  plays records well  for the most part  pretty load on its own    i haven t yet hooked up additional speakers  i ve noticed a lot of the records  wobble   which i ve read is sometimes a record player defect  still giving it four stars  since i m not sure if the record player is the problem or not  i love the fact that it s also bluetooth compatible  which gives me the ability to play anything from my phone at a higher volume         
1625,5.0,                       i bought this for my    year old granddaughter and she loves it      
1626,5.0,                       very impressed with the sounds as well as easy to move around   the quality was very good for the money      
1627,5.0,                       this thing is made out of cheap plastic but you can t really tell from a distance   plays fine  sound is good until reaching high volume   great for people new to records and not looking to sink too much into it  at     it s a great value      
1628,5.0,                       now my daughter can enjoy my curated record collection  and connect her devices with bluetooth  super easy to use and set up      
1629,5.0,                       it sounds awesome and my son loved his christmas present       
1630,3.0,                       switch is labeled wrong however it is a nice record player  i love the portability how it works in with my decor     
1631,5.0,                       works amazing  sounds clear   very happy with this     
1632,5.0,                       this was a great christmas gift      
1633,5.0,                       it was a gift for   yr old  she said it works great and loves it      
1634,4.0,                       bought this for my   yr and she loves it  super easy for her to use  very nice product      
1635,5.0,                       if you re looking for a great way to play all those records in the attic   this is it  this little turn table has great sound and is even bluetooth enabled  it comes in so many great colors patterns   we chose turquoise and love it  it s not that big or heavy so completely portable  we can t wait to take it to the cabin with us  great deal for the money      
1636,4.0,                       i returned this player and ordered the same company better version      
1637,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          you get what you pay for     all my records skipped for the first third where the record hung off the platform  the skipping decreases as you get further along  since i have all     lps this record player is worthless to me  it s cute but that s about it      
1638,4.0,                       for a compact  beginner record player  this is hard to beat  when it comes to the sound quality  you of course get what you pay for  however  you can easily hook it up to a better sound system and the playback is great  after a few months  my only issue is that it seems to struggle and skip occasionally on heavier    g vinyl      
1639,1.0,                       needed a replacement turntable till i could afford a nicer one so i gave this a shot  mistake  the tray wobbles like crazy when it spins whether there is a record on it or not  when you do try to play a vinyl the needle jumps all over the place because of said wobble  unusable  not a single vinyl played without problems  save your money and buy a more reputable brand      
1640,1.0,                       about a minute into any album  began skipping endlessly  tried both needles  same thing  returned it  bought a real turntable      
1641,5.0,                       super cute   my daughter loves it   i love the blue color      
1642,4.0,                       i bought this so i could play old records i found at the thrift store  i ve had this record player for about a month and it plays pretty well  i like that it comes with more features  like bluetooth  my only complaint is that when i connect my phone to bluetooth and play at full volume  it sounds a little airy and muffled  but i don t normally play at that volume so it s fine  i would probably buy this again      
1643,5.0,                       got on sale   love this   worth the buy and i figured it out with a little help but i probably could have done it all by myself  it s not very loud but i m very happy with this purchase  i finally get to listen to my dad s records  thank you        
1644,5.0,                       works great

1660,5.0,                       great device and easy to use  i love listening to my old records  this device speakers are good  too      
1661,2.0,                       the sound from the built in speakers is very low quality  but works great with audio output and decent speakers      
1662,5.0,                       small but great sound   came with two needles and got a third when i registered the phonograph   bluetooth is not perfect but everything works fine for the price      
1663,5.0,                       i purchased this for my    year old daughter for xmas  we both love it  it works great and she is excited that it is portable      
1664,2.0,                       received this record player today  although shipping was fast  that s really the only positive  my first concern was that immediately upon opening the outer amazon box  which didn t have any outside damage   i saw that the manufacturer s outer box and the record player box inside that was damaged  i don t understand why this was shipped to begin with    this hole screams damaged item to me     i ve included images of this  now  let s talk sound     i get that it s only     and the sound isn t going to be superb but the sound is very hollow and tin ny  not deep and rich  no base  all treble  the other issue is that the actual color is completely different than what is seen on amazon and on the outside of the actual player box  and it s not because of online imagery having variances in shading lighting  etc  what is seen on amazon and the actual  live product packaging matches    it s a light  vintage era  sea foam like turquoise  what is actually in the box is a turquoise blue  you can see the difference in the image attached  not at all what i ordered or wanted  i will be returning and considering other players      
1665,4.0,                         who  as far as i can tell  is pleased w the item     
1666,2.0,                       after   months of having this vinyl player it skips a lot and the sound isn t great      
1667,3.0,                       makes records skip  it s a good record player for beginners      
1668,5.0,                       bought this for christmas for my friend and they really enjoy it       
1669,5.0,                       boyfriend loves it         
1670,4.0,                       i found the quality of the sound is best in the medium range  but sometimes that sounds a little too loud  when the dial is too low it sounds like the vinyl is squeaking  other than this the record player is great      
1671,5.0,                       great record player  the built in speakers were a little tinny  but that is normal with most of the record players i ve owned  the bluetooth is easy to connect and a great option      
1672,4.0,                       not happy with the sound  no bass     
1673,5.0,                       my daughter has been using this for a year now with no problems   she has used the turntable and bluetooth and both have given no problems      
1674,5.0,                       sounds great  easy to set up for a first timer  and seems to be good quality     
1675,4.0,                       great player  wish it was a little bigger so you could close it with the record in it but it s fine  i wish the speakers were better quality but for a smaller room  it s great  great gift for an office or dorm     
1676,1.0,                       i bought for my girlfriend for a christmas gift and then when she saw her gift she was so happy to show all family but the item didn t work  ruined my christmas      
1677,1.0,                       would not recommend  i purchased this and immediately put a brand new record on  that had been played twice before  and this record player skipped terribly  the same record played beautifully on a friends record player  the sound quality is also very poor      
1678,5.0,                       i appreciate the nostalgic feeling  for the price it s a fun addition to my living room and a great conversation piece  guests enjoy choosing a vinyl to play      
1679,5.0,                       it s so easy to setup and use  thank god because i had no prior knowledge if turntables before getting this one  i love it  it comes with a replacement needle as well and bluetooth sounds great too        recommend      
1680,1.0,                       this was a christmas present for my daughter  when she opened it she was very excited and unfortunately it does not work  it doesn t spin fast enough to play regular sized records or    s  very sad      
1681,5.0,                       love the look of this  very fun  not super loud but it has good sound      
1682,5.0,                       a  my son is going to love this     
1683,5.0,                       bought this for a christmas present  wish i had bought one for myself  the person i bought it for just loves it  was my favorite present to gift this year      
1684,5.0,                       bought it for my grandparents for them to be able listen to their records in any room vs having to listen to them in the one room they have their heavy non portable player  they love it  it is very easy to use      
1685,1.0,                       i had perfectly new records and they would always skip in the beginning because of this record player     
1686,5.0,                       i love to be able to listen to my old albums and how it looks any where i take it      
1687,5.0,                       bought this for my grandson s birthday   it was a hit  quality sound  and portable  a good value      
1688,1.0,                       this product was repackaged and sold as new  it did not work  not happy  it was a christmas present      
1689,5.0,                       it s great        
1690,5.0,                       my daughter loves it     
1691,5.0,                       i purchased this as a gift for a    yr old and she loves it  works really well and she is getting into vinyls      
1692,5.0,                       good record player for beginners  works perfectly fine with my records  if youre records needle starts skipping just tape a dime on top of the needle head and youre good     
1693,5.0,                       birthday present for my granddaughter  the sound is outstanding enough that her parents lisyened      
1694,4.0,                       you ll need to purchase diamond tip stylus separately as the original ones that come with the player contribute to quite a bit of skipping  even on brand new records  once we replaced the original stylus with diamond tip stylus   it made all the difference in the world       
1695,4.0,                       i received what i expected and that s a great thing  the sound quality is good for me but it s not a booming type of loud but i really thinks it a good beginners turntable  i will eventually get something with a few more features but for now i m pleased      
1696,2.0,                       this product looks retro cool  but sounds like utter garbage  thin  trebly  weak  and a disservice to the engineer who mixed your record  not for anyone who wants even minimal tonal depth      
1697,2.0,                       this product looks retro cool  but sounds like utter garbage  thin  trebly  weak  and a disservice to the engineer who mixed your record  not for anyone who wants even minimal tonal depth      
1698,5.0,                       amazing  loved the sound quality and it looks sooo   cool      
1699,2.0,                       record tends to skip where it does not on other record player  the units speaker is not true stereo and sound isn t high quality      
1700,3.0,                       this is a     record player that s portable  and it sounds just like one  the sound quality is not great for record standards but is fine for a portable     record player  good for beginners but would not recommend for someone who s looking to get a good deal on a great player     
1701,1.0,                       don t even try to play any modern records on this thing  player can not play    g records  doesn t say this anywhere within the description or the user manual   buy a different brand     
1702,5.0,                       love the nostalgic feeling   look sound is pretty good for this player     
1703,1.0,                       the box came to my door  it looked like it was dragged down my street behind the truck  like i m suprised it s not damaged      
1704,4.0,                       i didn t expect much for what i was paying  because of that it s performing better than i would have expected  the sound is of enough quality that i wouldn t complain but won t give it   stars  i don t regret the buy and would recommend to anyone who wants an affordable record player      
1705,2.0,                       the plus side of this product is the fact that it is easily transportable and connects to blue tooth  i tried multiple records on this and they all sounded like absolute crap  you could play better sound from plastic solo cups      
1706,3.0,                       nice but seems to skip on a brand new record  unhappy with that but the sound quality is great      
1707,5.0,                       what a beautiful product and what a way to relive memories   easy to unpack and ready to relive memories in less than   minutes  got delivered in a day or less with prime    very cool looking setup   in a mini suitcase   easy to unpack and setup and very lightvery affordable and a great way to listen to classics     definitely recommend     
1708,5.0,                       such a cute design  playing this brings back memories of my teenage years  i had forgotten the sound of an old     i like the bluetooth option too      
1709,1.0,                       i actually bought two of these record players  the first one lasted a month stopped working then i returned  the second one lasted   months  adorable but doesn t work  don t buy      
1710,5.0,                       looks and sounds great     
1711,1.0,                       arrived with screws missing which caused the record to sit uneven while playing  had to return  which was disappointing as it was a christmas gift      
1712,5.0,                       was given as a gift haven t heard any complaints     
1713,5.0,                       great sound quality i use with my surround system via aux it s very dope     
1714,4.0,                       it s so fun to have this player  the sound is good but not at good as i was hoping it would be     
1715,4.0,                       not bad for the price easy to set up it  as loud as i wanted it but when connected to the surround sound blue ray it sounds awsome has that classic static crackling sound which i love      
1716,5.0,                       great sound     
1717,5.0,                       this record player was a gift for our    year old   she is enjoying it so much   the sound quality is pretty good for the price of this product      
1718,5.0,                       great product  looks nice  works great  no issues at all      
1719,3.0,                       my grandaughter was so excited to get this and loves it  i feel like the sound quality is poor and needs additional speakers  easily portable and fun colors      
1720,1.0,                       i have tired playing all my records but every single time the sound comes out distorted  i ve tried changing the settings but nothing  i changed the needle to see if that was the problem but no luck      
1721,1.0,                       used for one day then stopped working        
1722,5.0,                       bought for a    year old s birthday   easy to use for beginner   person loved it      
1723,5.0,                       although this unit is portable  it has amazing quality  it features a lift up lever so that your vinyls don t get scratched or your needle sanded  it also comes with a spare needle  amazing right  my daughter has used everyday since christmas and it still looks and sounds like brand new      
1724,2.0,                       we ve had this for a year and rarely use it  the speakers no longer work      
1725,5.0,                       a great  fun item to play records   sound quality is great and the price was right   absolutely loved playing christmas music on this   the kids had a blast listening to old story albums and we loved the old music we grew up with   fantastic find      
1726,1.0,                       the record player only played in    speed which is not much use if you have big records   i sent it back      
1727,1.0,                       not really useful  speaker is in the box  so if you were to turn it up at all  it makes the record skip  worthless  it s a child s toy  i would have returned it if i hadn t already thrown the box away      
1728,5.0,                       love it  i ordered a    pack of random vinyl records  the seller i bought from was lykastore on etsy  this record player was a super great price and works really well  i absolutely love it      
1729,5.0,                       this was the one gift my daughter wanted above all else for christmas this year  she was not disappointed  loved it      
1730,5.0,                       our granddaughter enjoys listening to records and this is a perfect size for her to take away to school   she is very happy with the quality of the sound      
1731,5.0,                       easy to play  very loud and sound quality is pretty good as well      
1732,3.0,                       i love the device itself but was disappointed that the needle on my machine was damaged before i even used it for the first time  upon playing my first record i also found that there is a loose wire that causes an odd skipping sound by making the turntable jump  i keep having to push it further underneath to make it stop but it eventually wiggles its way loose again  i thought about returning it  but the hassle of it all stops me      
1733,4.0,                    la victrola  es un instrumento muy bueno para los que tenemos muchos lp  de hace algunos a os y no habiamos podido volver a escucharlos  realmente el sonido es muy diferente a la musica de hoy aunque hay discos que no se escuchan bien  fue muy agradable  escucharlos nuevamente         
1734,5.0,                       a great buy and would definitely buy again      
1735,5.0,                       great     
1736,5.0,                       this is adorable and it plays pretty good  audio quality is not the best though  it does get loud but it has this certain echoey to the tone      
1737,5.0,                       really like this record player  bought this for my birthday to listen to my daft punk albums   very first records  sounds great and is easy to move and use      
1738,3.0,                       it looks great  i loved it until i started trying to play records  they all sounded like they were dragging even after changing the speed  had to return it unfortunately        
1739,5.0,                       great little portable record player  super for a picnic or part at the lake  made to go wherever you want  son loves it      
1740,5.0,                       this was a gift for my granddaughter as soon as she got it she opened it up and put on bohemian rhapsody and it was lovely we enjoyed it perfect for a really cool    year old     
1741,5.0,                       had some    s and    s from the    s   wanted to listen to them again  this unit did the task just right      
1742,1.0,                       i have several records so i kept trying different ones and they all skip with this record player      
1743,5.0,                       brought for grad present for nephew  he said it s the best present he received      
1744,1.0,                       beautiful little record player  but when we plugged it in  the plastic middle piece was lose and the arm was flimsy and would not power on we should have read the reviews before purchasing  don t waste your money      
1745,5.0,                       great for the price     
1746,1.0,                       box was destroyed when arrived and item didn t turn on  i tried calling the manufacturers customer support and the message just kept looping and amazon tried it with the same results      
1747,5.0,                       love it    plays my    s and    s records   nothing like mixing some old technology with some old     maybe they will add an   track       
1748,5.0,                       absolutely love it  plays great  sound quality is great  love the outside  can play really loud too  i highly recommend it  especially if it is your first time exploring vinyl     
1749,5.0,                       was looking for a way to play vintage records  this fit my budget and wants exactly   does what it s supposed to      
1750,5.0,                       this is a great compact  no frills player for a bedroom  the speakers are not too loud  but fine for a single room  it is easy to connect external speakers as well  the fact that is portable is the real bonus  it can be closed up and carried like a briefcase or stored safely without worry of getting dammaged      
1751,5.0,                       coolest gift i ve ever bought for myself  i love it  now i can play my records and will definitely will be building my record collection      
1752,5.0,                       my godson loved this gift   he s very into   s music and this is a great way to play old    albums      
1753,5.0,                       just what i needed  great gift for mom to play all her old vinyl records  it s retro design was perfect and takes you back to that era     
1754,5.0,                       this is really good sound quality for the price  i was pleasantly surprised  hooked up via bt the first try  so it s super easy  bought the matching case for the vinyls      
1755,1.0,                       sound is horrid  skips a lot  not sturdy and simply junk     
1756,5.0,                       great        
1757,1.0,                       bought in may of last year as a present  used twice and now it won t even power on  bought a new power cord thinking it was the issue and still doesn t work     
1758,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          records new and old play great  be sure to wipe the record before use and ensure the needle of the tone arm is secured      
1759,4.0,                       yooo i thought this was crap because the needle kept skipping on records but once i used the replacement needle it was fine  so if your records keep skipping fiddle with the needle because i almost returned it thinking it was defective      
1760,5.0,                       for the price it s a great little player   i bought it and gave to my mom as a gift and she says that it works great   the bluetooth feature is also a plus if you want to listen to streaming music      
1761,5.0,                       this is one of my ex s favorite gifts from when we were together  works great  sounds great  overall not complaints  i should ask for it back as payment for pain and suffering      
1762,1.0,                       no extra packing when this product arrived  box was slightly damaged  this birthday present had to be returned because the turntable was not balanced      
1763,4.0,                       i bought this as a gift for my    year old daughter  she loves the record player and it works fine  but it is not a mint color as shown in the picture  it is a bright turquoise blue  very different  she would have preferred the mint color      
1764,5.0,                       mother was super thrilled to get this for mother s day     
1765,5.0,                       this record player is great   it plays all   record sizes  has an auto feature that stops spinning when the record is finished   the   built in speakers work great  but you can also bluetooth to wireless speakers   the suitcase is very well built and the hinges have a reinforced safety catch to prevent the lid from opening too far or putting too much stress on the hinge   the only downside is the real life color of the blue was a little different from the website  but that is splitting hairs      
1766,5.0,                       b day gift for a special uncleit s hard to change the option of an    year man who insist nothing sounds as good as his old hi fi system  however upon hearing that little record player play  he had to admit   it ain t half bad     priceless      
1767,2.0,                       i was happy with this product at first  it has nice sound and is packaged nicely in a suitcase style player  however after about      months it is starting to sound slow and after asking at my local record store have found out it needs a new belt which is just as expensive as the player  i would recommend paying a little bit more and getting a better quality player     
1768,2.0,                       look is cool and the bluetooth is cool  vinyl sound kind of weak   i guess its okay for the price      
1769,1.0,                          doa  this was the main gift at a special birthday party yesterday  it was exactly what the birthday girl wanted  and she was so excited  we plugged it in  nothing  thought the cheap power supply might be the culprit  so we went to goodwill to find one that fit the specifications  with the new  used  power supply  the turntable began to spin  but still no audio came through the speakers  after unplugging and replugging  we found that the record player had returned to its former  completely unusable state  very disappointing    when the turntable was spinning  the two records we tried wobbled  as if the mechanism were unbalanced  neither record was warped  and we tried two just to be sure    after opening the box  we saw that good old warning    you know  the product contains something  known to the state of california  to cause birth defects  reproductive harm  etc  i looked back at the product page  and this warning was not posted anywhere i could see  i would not have bought it in the first place if i d been informed of the potentially hazardous content      
1770,1.0,                       i got this for christmas and just got it set up and went to use it and it doesnt work   the turntable doesnt spin  in researching the problem  i guess this is very common with this item   it is so frustrating because it has never been used and out of the box  it is broken      
1771,5.0,                       very good sound quality and really cute for a good price      
1772,5.0,                       i adore this record player  it s small and easy to use  it has a good sound that fills my house      
1773,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          the speakers are loud but if like better quality sound i recommend plugging it in to something better  great for beginners     
1774,5.0,                       i m not a music purist or hardcore record collector  but the sound was pretty good  it s also very compact  and it didn t take up much room  the bluetooth feature was also very convenient to have   and you can use it as a speaker for your digital collection  for the price  it s a great deal if you re just starting your vinyl collection      
1775,4.0,                       well  i didn t like the way it was packaged and sent to me because this was a christmas gift  but  it works well and my granddaughter loved the color      
1776,5.0,                       good value for money especially when you re not looking for high end product    solid sound and quality   durable the sound quality mostly depends on the record and not your machine in my opinion      
1777,1.0,                       garbage   puts out almost no bass  needle is notorious for ruining records  bluetooth function is deceiving  all you can do with it is use it to play stuff from other devices on the table s poor quality internal speakersif you re getting into vinyl  spend a little more on something decent     
1778,5.0,                       everything was in great condition and my sister loves this awesome birthday present      
1779,1.0,                       bought for my existing and new records at the beginning of the pandemic  sadly disappointed  it skips the whole time  every song  which is horrible for the record tried changing the needle  no luck  sending it back      
1780,5.0,                       i got my son this for christmas and he loves it and plays his vinyl several times a week      
1781,4.0,                       this is a great little record player  it s cute  the volume is decent and the sound quality through the bluetooth is good  it came really quickly and in perfect condition  i definitely recommend this as someone s first record player      
1782,2.0,                       very  very poor sound quality  and the headphone jack doesn t work properly      
1783,1.0,                       i bought this for a friend for christmas  the first time they tried to turn it on it started smoking from the panel  we have been trying to contact the company for days now and the company won t answer our emails or calls  i am really disappointed in this because for the price i would expect it to work  i want my money back or a replacement      
1784,5.0,                       i was impressed with what you get for the money  this record player is great and has internal speakers but also connects through bluetooth to external ones      
1785,5.0,                       my teenager had been asking me for a record player for months  i am so glad i purchased this one   it looks fantastic in his room   not only does it play records  but it also has a blue tooth so he can play songs from his phone      
1786,2.0,                       i liked the product but it didn t even come with a cord so we had to search our house to find one that only worked for a second  i am pleased with the product but disappointed with the fact that i can t even play my records till a cord comes  would have been nice to know if it was included or not     
1787,3.0,                       i knew i wouldnt get a top of the line phono player at this price but i would atleast wxpwct it to play without skiping  i would say its still a good biy at this price though      
1788,5.0,                       love it     
1789,5.0,                       sound s great     
1790,5.0,                       my teenage daughter is into everything retro and vintage   she adores this  even has a place to hook up to a phone in case she doesn t need have enough vinyl      
1791,5.0,                       easy to take this anywhere an listen to some albums  you know it sounds better on vinyl  nowspinning  neilyoung     
1792,5.0,                       this little record player is amazing  it is compact and takes up very little room compared to my other record set up  the sound quality is much better than i expected  very pleased with this purchase      
1793,5.0,                       the sound is great and the design is even better  we ve already listened to old vinyls from relatives and bought vinyls from a local record shop  streaming is neat  but there s something about actually putting a record on and  listening to music   something boomers and millennials can both agree on and enjoy        would recommend  much wow      
1794,5.0,                       we were looking for a compact  affordable  quality record player and that s exactly what we received      
1795,4.0,                       i bought this for my    year old who has an interest in older physical media  ad a starter player for a teen who may or may not turn this into a serious hobby it s perfect      
1796,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          amazing plays great loud and quietly has the         and    size records  just put a penny on the needle for        records  even has a headphone jack       
1797,4.0,                       i got this as a christmas gift for my dad last year and we loved listening to all the classic christmas records   he played with that thing the whole day   he whips it out every holiday and plays his favorite records      
1798,5.0,                       i love the vintage style of this record player   the sound is great   it s easy to use   i m so glad to have something to play my old records again after many years without      
1799,4.0,                       the product was pretty good  it s really large but it is really cool  iv e never owned one of these so if your curious i would def recommend it  although  initially i thought that the sound quality was going to be super clear with all the speakers but it wasn t  so you should keep that in mind  but  all in all it s nice and i don t regret buying it         
1800,3.0,                       i like it but i hate that the bluetooth will not connect  i had to buy an auxiliary cable to be able to use my phone     
1801,1.0,                          more dollars will get you a real record player  for beginners     
1802,5.0,                       my daughter loves it     
1803,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i like this so much  so excited an early family christmas present  great deal      
1804,4.0,                       love the look and the ability to play old records  sound quality is okay  but you can hook up external speakers      
1805,5.0,                       my    year old really wanted a record player for her birthday   this victrola was affordable  adorable  and a great value   it s an excellent little record player and my daughter is thrilled with it      
1806,3.0,                       not real clear     
1807,1.0,                       this is a piece of garbage  i want something that actually plays records      
1808,1.0,                       while the product is beautiful to look at  the unit within the record player connected to the platform where the record is placed is flimsy plastic that seems to sit too high   it invites warping and i had to buy a record clamp  which ended up not working anyway   the records we played subsequently skipped constantly despite these efforts      
1809,4.0,                       love my player  built well  only problem is i can t get it to connect to any bluetooth device      
1810,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          the sound quality is really nice  the player it self is well designed and its portable which is also nice  the price is affordable as well      
1811,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          it s really good for the price i love it      
1812,5.0,                       great product     
1813,2.0,                       bought this thing to play some records that i have   it does the job to play the records but the sound quality is not too  great      
1814,5.0,                       easy to use if you ve never had a record player before  very cute brown color  nice quality     
1815,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this is amazing the quality is unbelievable  for the price    its a steal        
1816,4.0,                       excellent     
1817,5.0,                       this is super cute and works well  the sound quality isn t that great but it gets loud  i love that i can plug in external speakers  it tucks away nicely to save space which is good because i have more room for records      
1818,5.0,                       i never thought that i would have a record player but once i saw this one it grabbed my attention right away  i really like vintage stuff so this really fit my likings  the sound quality is amazing  when i got my first record and i was so excited to play it  the bluetooth also connected really fast with my iphone so i was able to listen to music i don t have records of  would highly recommend      
1819,5.0,                       this was a christmas gift for my teenage daughter and she absolutely loves it  great sound quality          
1820,5.0,                       bought this for my husband and he loves it   he has old records and like to play it on this record player     
1821,1.0,                       didn t work  power issues from the record player  returned it  bought a similar one at walmart for the same money and bought a warranty there      
1822,1.0,                       we were really excited to order this victrola      the player is really convenient cause you can carry it with you  but it skips all the time     every record we played  so sadly   we had to return both players we bought      
1823,5.0,                       i just opened it and tried a record   so perfect  it sounds nice and is very cute   i have no idea what i m doing with vinyls so idk about some of the other reviews   but as an amateur  this seems perfect     
1824,4.0,                       perfect for playing records   teens get to also use the box as a bluetooth speaker for their music when needed   the only reason it isn t full stars is the sound is medium at best   however  it has a latch that keeps the needle in place when you move the box   there is a    rpm disc inset to the box that you can use when needed   sweet product      
1825,5.0,                       super simple to use and gorgeous design  some people aren t but very fond of the sound quality but i think it is fantastic      
1826,5.0,                       bought one for my boyfriend for his birthday and it works really well  maybe not top notch for sound quality but honestly pretty loud  so happy with it that i bought one for my dad for christmas   presents for life for both of them  ya know       
1827,4.0,                       it is not as nice or solid as i hoped  i don t know how long it will last though inexpensive i suppose i got what i paid for      
1828,5.0,                       works great  very happy with it anyway  only complaint and it s barely worth mentioning  the sound is good  not great  but still a very good buy for the money      
1829,5.0,                       great first record player to have  sound quality is nice and it is really easy to understand how to use  awesome product      
1830,3.0,                       it would be nice to have packaged it in a second box to ship so that when i received it it wouldn t have been torn and dented  it is also a gift for someone in my house but now they know they get a dented up record player for christmas      
1831,5.0,                       it was a gift for someone really likes it to     
1832,5.0,                       great gift     
1833,1.0,                       i m really sad  i got this for my birthday and it didn t come with anything in the box so i can t turn it on  also the color is not at all the same as in the picture  i had such high hopes      
1834,3.0,                       this product is adequate if you want to listen to old albums but the vinyl used to make new albums is heavier and they skip on this version  my daughter bought a new album after getting this for her birthday and it skips constantly  it s because there is no tone arm balance per victrola      
1835,4.0,                       this product is cute  a little smaller than i expected   however my daughter loves it so   i have not heard it play so i do not know the quality of that feature      
1836,5.0,                       my husband loved this bday suprise   my son liked it to so he went and bought him one      
1837,1.0,                       dead on arrival      
1838,2.0,                       this is not the color i keep receiving  mine is definitely more of the turquoise than aqua turquoise  buyer beware  the player you ll get won t be this color      
1839,5.0,                       fun item to have to play old records and seems to function as it should nice handle for carrying to other places if needed     
1840,5.0,                       this player works amazing  bought it used and it still is percect  plays everything great  love the slow arm release and the volume knob is nice and smooth     
1841,3.0,                       the sound quality on this item was terrible   although the albums played  i did not enjoy how it sounded   team up with bose and make this a better item      
1842,5.0,                       i had to swap out my first one for my second one because the first one didn t work  after receiving the second one i was satisfied with the sound and quality      
1843,5.0,                       got this as a gift  works great it s compact and it work great     
1844,2.0,                       the only thing that works great is the blue tooth  any record i try to play  the players just cuts of a good chunk of the ending of a song  i ve tried to play multiple records  different speeds and no matter what  the end gets cut off          
1845,5.0,                       this is a good portable vinyl player  cute easy to use  good for kids and adults      
1846,5.0,                       looks and works great        
1847,5.0,                       i love this record player easy to set up and great quality and sound for the price      
1848,4.0,                       product is well made and simple to use     
1849,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          it is a good player it really doesn t have good bass but it s dope      
1850,5.0,                       had since easter and been great for us      
1851,5.0,                       i wasn t sure if my daughter  who is     would even like this but after using the bluetooth and having fun at an estate sale purchasing records  she was in love with it   best gift purchased this year      
1852,5.0,                       daughter loves the sound of records   like the versibility and the current tech features      
1853,1.0,                       was great for the two months it lasted  looks very cool  sound good  just stopped working after two months of light usage  gave it to our daughter for christmas  stopped working end of february  window for return closed a month before that  price was nice but i guess you get what you pay for      
1854,3.0,                       i just bought this to play old records  works great but sound quality leaves much to be desired   cool red color  portable and fun  they just need to improve the sound      
1855,5.0,                       loved giving this as a gift  nice print and ordered a record storage holder with same print      
1856,3.0,                       the product was nice and tight and for the money not a bad deal  however  if you re looking to  feel  the vinyl  not for you  i tried running the line output to my pa system and the signal was terrible and just wasn t what i anticipated  not a bad product for what it is      
1857,5.0,                       found old albums     
1858,3.0,                       i ordered this product because i needed a cheap record player  that s precisely what i got  it came entirely functional and easy to use  but i was unaware that cheap players like this actually damage your vinyl  after a few weeks of use  i sold it online to find a better one      
1859,1.0,                       i have only had it a few months  played it less than a dozen times and either the needle already needs replacing or it s broken   pretty disappointing      
1860,1.0,                       item was sold new in box but record player case was scuffed up and no power cord  very disappointed      
1861,1.0,                       the player looks and sounds great  however  i just found out that the player only lasted a few months  i bought this to my nephew and he was so excited  he just told me that after a few uses the record player made a weird sound and stopped working completely      
1862,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i received some records when my grandfather passed away   i purchased this so i could listen to them   every single records  both sides sound and do the same thing       see video         
1863,5.0,                       bought this for my daughter and she loves it      
1864,5.0,                       very unique color combination and looks even better in person  i tried out some new and vintage records and it played great  i love that i can bring it wherever i go  it definitely makes a statement in the room both aesthetically and through sound      
1865,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          for the most part it was alright sounds nice      
1866,2.0,                       this was our second one  the first was great  this last one has distorted sound     
1867,1.0,                       the sound is poor     
1868,5.0,                       good quality sound easy to use     
1869,2.0,                       terrible sound quality  the built in speakers are junk      
1870,5.0,                       i use this record player on my    s and my    s records  beside it s bring back memory of my    s and    s      
1871,2.0,                       worked for about a month then the mechanism inside stopped spinning the record  tried to contact customer service through their website but they never got back to me  guess it s going in the trash      
1872,5.0,                       works beautifully      
1873,5.0,                       as described  happy with the purchase      
1874,2.0,                       i thought my product was faulty but it seems that the needle skipping on records is a common issue  mine produces  a warbly sound every time the record makes a full revolution on the bed  i ve never gotten a good listen with this player in the year or so that i ve had it        
1875,4.0,                       works ok  but when using rca jacks  output is very weak   i can crank the volume on my main stereo unit to make up for it    but i shouldn t have to      
1876,5.0,                       perfect lp player for my teenage daughter  it s loud enough for her room without being overbearing  it s a great starter record player and it s price point is perfect for that  not the best but great for a start into the hobby  finally the aesthetics are perfect      
1877,5.0,                       got for my husband for christmas and he loved it and the flag case was the cherry on top      
1878,5.0,                       it looks better than i expected  got it as a gift for my boyfriend  he s going to love it      
1879,5.0,                       love it just like back in the day lol     
1880,5.0,                       my husband loves loves this  it works great the speakers are very clear and the case is beautifully done      
1881,4.0,                       this was purchased for my adult daughter for her   nd birthday   she had been wanting a record player for a while and this was affordable   she loved the geometric pattern and colors  there were many to choose from   the bluetooth was an extra bonus      
1882,4.0,                       works great  sounds great  i m a beginner in the ways of vinyl but i found it very easy to figure out      
1883,1.0,                       both times music skipped on first track on multiple recordsreturned  will look for another brand     
1884,5.0,                       very nice   built well doesnt feel crappy play records jus fine my    yr old daughter likes it     
1885,5.0,                       perfect for listening to old   s and   s  i got this after finding some disney read along books in an antique store and it fit the bill perfectly  sound is great for one room      
1886,5.0,                       love     
1887,5.0,                       this was a gift for my husband for his birthday  he loved it  awesome sound and easy to connect to bluetooth devices      
1888,4.0,                       really cute and works  speakers sound quality is marginal but i expected that        
1889,5.0,                       i bought one as a birthday present for my daughter   another for my son for christmas   they love them  the sound is clear  they like the bluetooth feature as well     
1890,3.0,                       i purchased this for my niece as a gift for christmas but when she went to use it  the turntable didn t work  after some time  i found that one of the pieces was loose   had to fix it      
1891,5.0,                       it s the perfect player  it has great sound   love that it s portable     
1892,1.0,                       it s a different color  i haven t even tried it out for sound because i m highly dissatisfied that they mislabeled the color      
1893,3.0,                       it works okay  it isn t super loud but i don t need it to be very loud due to neighbors  the blue tooth works in close proximity and there is no password necessary  i was disappointed in the color i received  the aqua turquoise is not light colored like it is in the picture  it looks like a royal sea green and it s pretty bright      
1894,5.0,                       we spent several hours listening to my parents  old records and had a great time      
1895,1.0,                       due to an uncalibrated wobbly turntable  records skipped and most were unable to play at all  not good sound quality out of speakers  actual color of unit s exterior is  very different from online photos and even the photo on the packaging  although it does look aesthetically pleasing i don t recommend purchasing this product  it was easy to return      
1896,4.0,                       decent starter record player  some vinyls i noticed played slightly faster than they should  had to replace the needle one time but that was on my end  other then that i had no problems      
1897,2.0,                       while i expected the built in speakers to not be great  i did expect better sound when connected to a receiver   this was not the case      
1898,3.0,                       the volume stopped working on it shortly after using it  unfortunately i m too busy to really look into it  but the bottom line is    i got it for those nights i had time to listen to a record  now it s digital as always since this thing couldn t go a week without getting broken  very disappointed     
1899,5.0,                       bought for my husbands birthday  he loves it   now he can play the records he collected in college   everyone who stops by loves it too   buying one for my fil now      
1900,1.0,                       the entire turntable wobbles  end of story  will be returning  very disappointing     
1901,5.0,                       happy to see record players are coming back  love the new technology of adding bluetooth to the player as well      
1902,5.0,                       looks good but there is no bluetooth out to another external speaker  the bluetooth is inbound from and external device  sound lacks bass      
1903,5.0,                       very affordable  bought for my daughter as a gift  she loved it  sounds great      
1904,5.0,                       perfect for those who love the nostalgia of vintage record players      
1905,5.0,                       got this for my sister for a present  she loved it and it works great  prefect for those recollecting records      
1906,4.0,                       i got it for my girlfriend and she loves it  it was super cheap and i didn t expect much  i was surprised  she uses the bluetooth and the table while she s in her dorm  her friends are jealous and i m a little prideful to show them the records and sound  it gets pretty loud as well and all of them are jealous and want one  the only problem i have with it is the turntable itself or record holder seems flimsy and i m scared to touch it      
1907,5.0,                       i listen to my huge collection of records on the daily and love the look of this suitcase record player  the fact i can plug it in to my speakers or use the bluetooth is so awesome  money well spent      
1908,5.0,                       perfect     
1909,5.0,                       this isn t top quality but it s well worth the price i paid  i m very pleased with the package i received  it came a day early too      
1910,5.0,                       this was a christmas gift for my granddaughter    she loves it  now we have to buy the albums to go with it      
1911,5.0,                       great sound qualitymy    year old daughter loves it       
1912,2.0,                       the record player is too small for normal sized records so the record wobbles and then it skips parts of the songs when the needle is on the outside of the player      
1913,5.0,                       very cute look  my daughter picked this to decorate her room  not the highest quality sound but the blue tooth is a great feature     
1914,2.0,                       my wife was so excited that i ordered this for her and after opening it up and putting a record on it played wonderfully with absolutely no sound      
1915,5.0,                          yr old loves this player and the idea of hearing music  records  being played this way  lol   come with   needle installed and a spare  also includes a pop up adapter for   s      
1916,5.0,                       runs smoothly  great buy  new and old records sound great  would definitely recommend      
1917,3.0,                       i loved the simplicity of the player  very nice aesthetics  easy to set up and use  there was a few new records that it would skip on some parts  yet on a more expensive player  the record played fine on those parts  all my old records it played without any incidents  this leads me to believe that maybe it has trouble some of the newer records as some of the newer records are thicker  i don t know  i just know that some of the brand new records it would skip on certain parts when my expensive player had no issues with those same records  either way  it is a nice player to be able to just pack up and take with you      
1918,2.0,                       i wasn t hoping for much but it surprised me in good and bad ways  some pros were that there were different speeds and how nice it looks in the outside  cons were the portability is low because of the cable you need and the inside of the player wasn t glued right or something because i could se the inside     
1919,5.0,                       a           
1920,5.0,                       this is so neat  i love how it sounds and  the easy storage  the size of this is great also  i would defiantly recommend  it looks just like the images shown      
1921,5.0,                       bought this for my    year old grandson  he loves it   the look of the case is so cool   i gave him all my old albums from the    s and    s   it was fun to hear them again   good purchase      
1922,1.0,                       this product is nothing but a cheap piece of plastic  first of all  the record player came in a box that had previously been opened  second  when i had tried to play one of my records  the player would not even rotate the record  take my advice  stop buying on amazon  go to your local store and see first hand what you are buying      
1923,5.0,                       the wooden finish was beautiful in person  my boyfriend loves it      
1924,5.0,                       it was a anniversary gift for my husband and he loved it  i was amazed at how inexpensive the product is and how well it works and looks  definitely recommend buying it      
1925,1.0,                       came damaged and wont play records     
1926,5.0,                       it s a great player you get old sound     
1927,5.0,                       i love the easy set up  plug in and play  the sound quality is great  it is portable to take outside for parties  and it folds up compactly to fit in my entertainment center      
1928,5.0,                       great product  cute  stylish  and easy to figure out  came packaged well and overall a great addition to any vinyl collection      
1929,5.0,                       christmas gift son loved it it s awesome absolutely no complaints     
1930,1.0,                       this is a piece of junk  don t bother  bought it as a gift and broke after only a few uses   the needle will stopped working  we replaced the needle and still no luck   sometimes it works ok and then other times it does not work at all  this was a gift  really disappointed      
1931,1.0,                       bought as a christmas gift for my son  after trying several albums  new and vintage   cannot get it to play at the right speed  at first we just thought my old lps were the problem but after several months and purchasing many different lps none will play properly  they all play too slow even no matter what speed setting we use      
1932,2.0,                       junk sounds like garbage     
1933,1.0,                       thanks for ruining christmas  it was working christmas eve        it stop on christmas day     
1934,5.0,                       super cute and very functional  great for someone who just wants to play that vinyl they have laying around      
1935,5.0,                       it was nice     
1936,5.0,                       bought for my daughter who is early   s and is beginning to collect vinyl  good sound quality at a reasonable price  perfect for beginners new to records      
1937,4.0,                       this is obviously not the greatest quality record player  and you might have to mess with it to make it work properly  but it is portable  and gets the job done      
1938,1.0,                       started smoking as soon as you turn it on  then it stopped working  got a random refund from them  so i could not trouble shoot      
1939,5.0,                       replaced my console for this  suitcase  and i am very happy with my purchase  easy to use     
1940,3.0,                       gave this to our    year ops for christmas  after just a few records played you could tell the speakers weren t the best quality  we returned it and upgraded to a different player and external speakers  would be an ok player for a child      
1941,1.0,                       the sound is very  tinny   very low quality   won t play records properly  lots of skipping   even brand new records it s cute but not functional  do not recommend      
1942,5.0,                       i bought this record player as a gift for my boyfriend  who is a music junkie  he loves it  all of his family member have begun to buy him records for his collection  good volume  very simple to set up and begin using  straight forward manual for those who have never used a record player before  it also looks very nice in his bedroom      
1943,5.0,                       works great looks good and convenient     
1944,5.0,                       my daughter love s it     now i just to get her some more vinyl s        
1945,5.0,                       sounds great  but doesn t get too loud before distorted sound  you need to have the lid all the way open to make room for the record  really cute and portable      
1946,1.0,                       turntable wobbles right out of the box  all records skip badly  skip this product      
1947,1.0,                       ordered what i thought was new one  but box was damaged and it was someone s return  decided not to reorder      
1948,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          love  love this  haven t tried the blue tooth yet  the sound is amazing the only drawback was the packaging  this came only in the box that the record player was in  there was no other packaging at all   the player could have easily been broken      
1949,4.0,                       just received it today  i was not happy how it was shipped though      
1950,1.0,                       it came in and immediately didn t work  it skipped over all of my records and you could barely tell what song it was because of how much it skipped and sounded like static      
1951,5.0,                       our handicapped daughter love it  she listens to it all over the house with her wireless ear phones   it has given her much enjoyment      
1952,5.0,                       my lil sis loves it     
1953,5.0,                       my daughter is thoroughly enjoying this record player   sound quality is really good      
1954,5.0,                       very easy to use  grandkids loved playing it      
1955,5.0,                       easy to use   would buy again love listening to music on vinyl      
1956,4.0,                       very cute  great for kids  which is who it was bought for  easy and portable  the sound isn t the greatest but i am also conspiring it to one that i spend over      for  basically you get what you pay for      
1957,2.0,                       sound is terrible and quality of materials is so so  i would not buy it again  if you need it for decoration purposes only  the vintage look is gorgeous      
1958,3.0,                       this is a nice cheap turntable  it sounds good  its simple  but dont be fooled it is a bluetooth receiver only  it cant transmit bluetooth ish     
1959,1.0,                       the unit came broken   i don t know when or where it happened but it didn t work upon getting it   reading reviews on the internet it seems the construction is a bit flimsy and breaks easily during transportation      
1960,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          great product for the price  i bought an old record of edith piaf while in paris and wanted a record player to satisfy my curiosity  not knowing if i was going to buy more records after that  i did the job great  less than   minutes to get started and sound perfectly fine for the intended usage  i got mine in the union jack style since the husband is english        
1961,5.0,                       excelent looking  sounding and playback options      
1962,1.0,                       literally stopped working used it only once  turn knob to on and it just makes a strange noise      
1963,5.0,                       the graphic design on this is really dope  i haven t had the chance to play a record yet but from other reviews on youtube  it s good quality  i have connected to bluetooth though and this little sucker gets loud  i m very happy with my purchase and it will be of much use to me on my chill days        
1964,5.0,                       reminds me of when i was a kid  great sound   very lightweight      
1965,3.0,                       okay  so this is on the cheaper end of the list for record players on this site  it has an attractive aesthetic and simple design  the speakers are pretty weak so i will be connecting better speakers  it plays old records fairly well but almost invariably skips on newer records  these are a bit thicker   i am considering sending this back but i am a pretty casual record collector  of course  this would be inadequate for passionate listeners        
1966,1.0,                       turned on the first time smoked  smells like electrical burn waste of money didn t even get to play not one record     
1967,5.0,                       works great     
1968,5.0,                       this was a christmas gift  for my grandson he totally loved it      
1969,5.0,                       its perfect for my teenager granddaughter she loves it and it s not hard to handle  very happy with this     
1970,5.0,                       my daughter loves this   plays great and sounds good   no complaints      
1971,5.0,                       my daughter loves this record player  she uses it very often     
1972,5.0,                       i know very little about vinyls  that being said it spins very well  much music      
1973,4.0,                       sound isn t great but you can still decipher the music  it looks good and it works fine so if you really want a record player it does the job  haven t tried the bluetooth feature yet because i have other speakers for that      
1974,5.0,                       i had gotten this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend and he loves it  we get new records every time we can  he loves it   the sound is great        recommend this      
1975,5.0,                       my sister loves it  she was so happy best birthday ever     
1976,5.0,                                                                                                        i     
1977,1.0,                       i purchased this record player as a gift and less than a month later  it doesn t work  i went on youtube to see what we could do to fix the issue and found video after video warning people not to buy because it breaks easily  i wish i had did more research      
1978,1.0,                       basically it doesn t work  as the needle doesn t hold on the record will look for something of higher caliber because i actually want to play my records more     
1979,5.0,                       i bought this for my son  he loves it and it puts out good sound      
1980,5.0,                       excellent product  as described     
1981,5.0,                       love this  this is my first time buying a record player and i was skeptical of the quality since it s only    dollars but definitely worth the price  sound quality isnt     but still decent i ll rate     out of    based on record players i ve heard from before  highly recommend for first timers getting into playing records      
1982,5.0,                       this makes a good gift  especially for teens  it also has a bluetooth setting      
1983,5.0,                       love it  excellent product to spin your records or connect bluetooth  easy to use  love the lift lever  very very satisfied  highly recommend      
1984,5.0,                       bluetooth works great  loud enough for evening plays design very lovely  a little blurry though   i love it a lot  coochie man high fives this              p s  must take with precaution for those who have never used these  it s very delicate      
1985,5.0,                       this was a birthday gift for my    year old granddaughter  she loved it  it sounds good looks good and has a lot of cool features     
1986,5.0,                       i got this for my mother in law  she loves it  i like color and style plus sounds good      
1987,5.0,                       i was really surprised at how well this turntable was built  built in speakers sound good and you if you want you can even hook up your own speakers to add to the groove      
1988,4.0,                       taking away   star only because the directions to set it up weren t very detailed  took a minute to get it working if you don t know how to use one  but surprisingly the built in speakers are fairly loud and item is good quality      
1989,5.0,                       gave this as a gift to my best friend of ten years and she absolutely loves it     
1990,1.0,                       i loved it at first  but after a few short weeks the speaker started sounding really awful  of course it worked long enough to throw the box away and not be able to return it        
1991,5.0,                       i absolutely love every part of this record player records sound is so beautiful and bluetooth added what more can you ask for      
1992,5.0,                       bought this for the wife to go through old records  sound reproduction is good  the speakers are small so it doesn t have a very big sound  it does seem to have some good connectivity options that make it very functional  good value for the price      
1993,1.0,                       really hoped this would work but it didn t  platform wobbles causing record to skip about twice per song  returned it and ordered another  same problem  boo     
1994,5.0,                       great little record player for beginner and it actually folds up very nicely     
1995,4.0,                       box came damaged and didn t look new     
1996,1.0,                       it sounded horrible  like the record was warped but it was a new record and we tried more than one   i  loved the way it looked but unfortunately it did not work so well   maybe it was just the item that we received but i am not reordering      
1997,5.0,                       i bought this for myself     i have vinals that i haven t been able to listen to for so long  this is perfect      
1998,5.0,                       this thing is so adorable   got it as a gift for my daughter s   th birthday   she loves that she can also play music from her spotify account using bluetooth   the records sound great too      
1999,1.0,                       worked okay for a couple of months and then stopped turning on  huge waste of money  do not buy this      
2000,1.0,                       i had just set up the record player and put the record on and it doesn t play it s all scratchy and sometimes the needle moves around the record  when it does play for a few seconds the sound is awful turn the volume up all the way and it s still very quiet  do not buy this product it s a waste of money     
2001,1.0,                       the speakers and sound was terrible  i sent it back     
2002,3.0,                       pretty color  easy to use but it skips        
2003,3.0,                       blue tooth only receives doesn t out put to other type speakers   sound bar  cordless speakers  sound is good quality  but if you like it loud not happening      
2004,5.0,                       love it simple to use hooked to existing stero fine     
2005,5.0,                       i love my record player       works beautifully sound quality is good      
2006,2.0,                       the color is soooooooo off  the aqua turquoise is shown as a minty greenish color on here but in reality it s bright blue whomp whomp      
2007,3.0,                       speakers sound extremely tinny  but what should i expect for          
2008,2.0,                       don t buy  waste of       took it out the box and set it up  immediately started skipping  to solve it i taped a penny and dime to the handle and it worked  except now it doesn t play at the right speed so all the songs sound off tempo  just don t get anything victrola     
2009,1.0,                       didnt work from the minute it was received  something loose under the player itself  inside the box ended up paying more money for a better quality product      
2010,1.0,                       this was a christmas present and it did not work right out of box  my daughter was so disappointed and so were we  we exchanged it for a new one but are disappointed again because it isn t going to be here until the end of jan  hopefully the new one will work      
2011,5.0,                       this was a gift for my brother in law for his birthday and he loved it  great size  sound quality and price     
2012,2.0,                       i purchased this to play my    s  it did not come with the advertised    adapter  big let down when my wife opened it on christmas  had to make one out of cardboard      
2013,1.0,                       it stopped working at about the two month mark after only using it once a week or so  there doesn t seem to be any way to return it as defective after the initial    day return exchange window      
2014,5.0,                       this has been the best christmas present  the sound quality is splendid and it s really easy to use   the bluetooth connectivity is also fantastic and its like having a vintage speaker  honestly the best decision i could ve made when buying a vintage turntable      
2015,5.0,                       i am very happy that this record player plays my records  it is portable and easy to use      
2016,5.0,                       really great sound quality for the price  if you just want a starter turntable or basic turntable  nothing fancy  go with this one  you won t get anything better than this for paying         more      
2017,1.0,                       shipped in manufacturer box  no amazon box    box badly damaged   no power cord included   no extra needles   big disappointment   don t know how well product works yet  since can t use until i go buy a separate power cable   should have rejected the order      
2018,4.0,                       it has all of the problems that everyone else mentioned  it also seems to be a decent little record player that looks good and is light enough for my kids to lug around      
2019,1.0,                       cheaply made  looks great  but sounds like tin can speakers      
2020,4.0,                       does what i need it to  no pairing instructions for bluetooth so not sure if i can pair a bluetooth speaker to it or just use it as a speaker w my phone      
2021,5.0,                       its beautiful  i like it  it s cute has a little stain on it when i opened the box  that s disappointing other than that  it s fine      
2022,3.0,                       the sounds is really bad and after owning it for six months  the case began to crack     
2023,5.0,                       haven t used it    you know  it s a christmas present for someone else  so i ll wait and see  but it looks great  it has everything you need  and nothing you don t     
2024,2.0,                       my product came with a unbalanced turn table and makes my records skip  i m unable to listen to them with ease it needs constant attention      
2025,5.0,                       i was satisfied with the player as is due to the ease and convenience of use  the only down fall is at higher volumes the sound quality is not the best  i look forward to obtaining a compatible blue tooth speaker and this will end the problem      
2026,5.0,                       loce so much      loce listing to vinyls                  
2027,4.0,                          year old daughter uses it constantly  no problems as of yet  i d say it has pretty good sound quality and can get pretty loud for a small medium room      
2028,4.0,                       the sound is pretty bad  but i expected that  it s adorable and plays my vinyls   i can hook up other speakers      
2029,5.0,                       gave as a gift to get my daughter iniated to vinal    she loves this record player since its portable and she is just starting her vinal collection        
2030,5.0,                       love this record player  it looks good and a good size  love the turquoise color      
2031,5.0,                       my daughter needed a record player for christmas and i could not get out to get one  this one is perfect       
2032,5.0,                       good quality  looks and sounds great  was a gift for my daughter and she loves it      
2033,5.0,                       great sound for such a small player      
2034,1.0,                       horrible  gave it as a gift for my daughter and it never even powered on  when i would turn the knob to power on i heard a buzz sound for a second but no power  had to send this back was my first return ever to amazon     
2035,5.0,                       enjoying listening to a record from the    s and another from this century   don t have any other records but love to go down memory lane with the ones i have      
2036,2.0,                       cheaply made skipping on any record i play but the old coin on top of the needle does the trick but you shouldn t have to do that on a new player  do yourself a favor a pay for a better model      
2037,5.0,                       this is the  nd one we bought love it     
2038,5.0,                       the product is great  it looks so good  it s compact  and it sounds surprisingly good considering the price  the only downside was late shipping  but the product itself was even better than i anticipated      
2039,5.0,                       perfect for my    year old daughter  she tried a crosley from target and it was terrible  so we took it back and purchased this one  it sounds great and for the price it was absolutely the right choice      
2040,1.0,                       get a bigger one with better speakers update  speakers went out after only   weeks  never had it up higher than a quarter turn and they still busted or lost connection      
2041,5.0,                       i think this record player is amazing   the sound worked very well and there were no issues with it  it s kind ve like a little suitcase that you can take everywhere and it works super smoothly   i definitely recommend this if this is your first time getting a record player  it was my first time  and i love it      
2042,5.0,                       bought this for my    year old dad to play his old records from the    s and    s  it sounds very good and easy to use  nice quality item      
2043,5.0,                       i got this as a present for my sister and she loves it to death  the american flag design it very nice and it s a durable product      
2044,2.0,                       product died less than   months post purchase   sound quality was below average at best   all things being equal with the poor electronics in the defective unit  perhaps a decent price for a young child      
2045,5.0,                       my teenage granddaughter loved it  it s pretty cool      
2046,5.0,                       it was a great gift for a teen  to show her our world she loves it     
2047,5.0,                       bought this for my bf and he liked it  we don t know anything about vinyl players so i can t say if it s better than anything else  but it came in one piece and played the music well  i would recommend for a first time purchase      
2048,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          simply love it    really a good deal for a used one  and the turntable itself is great enough for beginner users       
2049,5.0,                       gave this to someone as a christmas gift and they loved it      
2050,1.0,                       item came broken  it didn t play and we couldn t use any of the functions  it was left a decorative item  this should be removed from amazon      
2051,4.0,                       got this for my wife  she uses it regularly  and loves it  not sure if they did this intentionally  but even things you play via bluetooth sound like records  which i believe adds a nice quality to it      
2052,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          just received it so far so good      
2053,5.0,                       was easy to setup and use   the sound quality is as good as it is going to get for what it is   i was impressed over all with the sound for what it is   it is not a full stereo setup but that is not what i bought      
2054,5.0,                       bought this for my daughter who loves music  found some of my dads old records and they play flawlessly   excellent buy     
2055,5.0,                       looks great for the price   good quality and sound   well packaged   my granddaughter is going to love it   it looks like a vintage suitcase  too      
2056,5.0,                       delivery was fast and product was exactly as described and works beautifully      
2057,5.0,                       bought for graduate      
2058,5.0,                       this was a gift for my daughter   she loves it   the sound is great  it s easy to use   it looks nice too      
2059,5.0,                       this light weight easy to move record player is affordable and amazing     not only does it play records including   s but it has a line in  bluetooth   built in speakers and able to connect to additional speakers       
2060,5.0,                       my son decided he wanted to listen to lp s so i thought that i would get him an inexpensive record player   well worth it     
2061,4.0,                       love it     
2062,4.0,                       i absolutely love it i haven t gotten my record for it yet but i m looking forward to it  the sound is kinda flat with the bluetooth but i think that s cause it s bluetooth      
2063,1.0,                       we were very expecting about this christmas gift but it never works  we connected it but it no turn on      
2064,4.0,                       i do love the look and the quality of my record player  the only thing i will say is do not expect the sound quality to be amazing  i ve noticed it kind of depends on the record as far as how loud it will go  but these are not built for good sound quality  other than that  i love it     
2065,5.0,                       love the portability   light yet sturdy and high quality workmanship        
2066,5.0,                       it was a gift for my granddaughter  she loved it      
2067,2.0,                       product was given as a gift  after playing a record the songs started to slow down and play almost in slow motion and will sometimes skip the song  record player did not work      
2068,5.0,                       love it  great for a gift      
2069,5.0,                       i gave it as a present  and the person who was in there    to play their records      
2070,1.0,                       this product broke a month after having it  it is skipping on brand new records  apparently suitcase record players have an issue with the tone arm not having a counter balance so it skips and can damage the records      
2071,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          brand new vinyls were junk     
2072,4.0,                       works      sound quality     on higher volumes  but normal volume  depending of quality of vinyl     portability     it needs to plug into an outlet to turn on  therefore  it isn t like a portable bluetooth speaker over all loveliness             
2073,4.0,                       overall i give it a    its actually really great  the sound quality could be better if it came with a better stylus so id suggest investing in that  if it came with a better one i would have given it a five  the speakers arent super high quality but that gives it an almost vintage sound  overall very worth it as its not expensive      
2074,3.0,                       the sound and speakers suck but the price at that time was good for me over all i did not like it and have only used it   times wish i had away to get my money back or at least some of it jims      gmail com     
2075,5.0,                       this record player works great  the sound is very nice on it and as far a record players go it s easy to use  my grandfather and his brothers used to sing gospel and recorded a few records and now i m finally able to listen to them again  very happy with this      
2076,5.0,                       i love the unique luck that it gives to my room     
2077,1.0,                       the box was damaged when it arrived and when plugged in  it failed to work  absolutely no power      
2078,1.0,                       after like   month of use i just stopped using it then when i tried using it again there was some plastic burning and i had to open it up to see what was wrong and as expected  i found plastic burning     
2079,5.0,                       perfect gift for my daughter she love it easy to install sounds great     
2080,3.0,                       some devices may have issues connecting to this via bluetooth   sounds better when you don t use the built in speakers      
2081,5.0,                       its is great but i dont know if its the vinyl or record player but sometimes the needle slides on its own     
2082,4.0,                       nice product  speakers are not highest quality but ok  we enjoy playing a few albums and thinking back on how things were    years ago  fun to have      
2083,5.0,                       it works wonderfully for both playing records and anything from your bluetooth  it s sleek and beautiful  easy set up and portability  very light weight  sound is good  my daughter loves it        
2084,5.0,                       ordered this player because it was on sale  and it s much better quality than i expected  decent sound  will need speakers  but it s a good record player  bonus that it connects bluetooth      
2085,5.0,                       beautiful record player  as always  from victrola  and excellent sound and performance quality      
2086,5.0,                       very nice  especially the one with the map design on the outside  its nice that it h came with an adapter  and you can play not only records  but you can plug in your phone via  aux cord  or bluetooth  boss product     
2087,1.0,                       daughter opened in christmas and she could not play it because no power cord was sent

2094,2.0,                       yeah  the speakers are tinny and sound a bit cheap  the device itself also feels a bit wobbly inside the casing  but other than that it s a fantastic product  if i get external hookups for a different speaker  i may update the review      
2095,1.0,                       perfectly new unopened records skip on this system  the sound is okay  good for the new vinyl collector but look elsewhere for better quality      
2096,5.0,                       great little system to start with or enjoy old records   sound isn t top notch but it does sound good

2109,4.0,                       this was a gift for my    year old grand daughter  her pick  she loved it   sound quality not that great but if you place high on a dresser  etc   it sounds much better      
2110,1.0,                       it looked very nice and was compact  but it skipped horribly on all the records i played no matter what i did  luckily  the return service was quick and easy

2113,4.0,                       great starter record player with a nice asthetic  that being said it s nothing high end and the cartridge it comes with isnt high quality  nonetheless a great gift for someone who is new to vinyl

2116,1.0,                       this player has never played albums without skipping repeatedly  i gave it as a gift  and the receipinet was too polite to tell me until after the seller s    day window closed  she uses it as a bluetooth speaker only      
2117,1.0,                       item came in an open box  had obviously been returned  belt on record player was broken and missing pieces  super disappointed as it was a birthday gift      
2118,1.0,                       does not work  it refuses to turn on  even when powered  when it does turn on  its speakers are basically nonfunctioning  the sound is extremely quiet and cannot be adjusted  very disappointed      
2119,5.0,                       my    year old retro daughter loves it  works well so far     
2120,1.0,                       this is obviously a bad product  due to illness  i have been very delinquent in responding to reviews  i have not been able to get the turntable to power on     
2121,4.0,                       great product exsept for the sound could use some upgrades     
2122,2.0,                       this looks great  came packaged well  but is missing the cord that is needed to plug it in   not sure if that was supposed to be included  but we can t seem to find anything at home that will work  so it may be going back   has anyone run into this problem   what was your solution      
2123,5.0,                       for the price it works very well and it plays my    and    records      
2124,4.0,                       loved the color  was a birthday present for a friend and she loved it  a good starter record player  the sound could be a bit better but for less that     this was a steal

2127,1.0,                       this record player is horrible  i want to return it but i don t have the box  mine broke after a few days of having it and i haven t gotten it to work since      
2128,2.0,                       kept making my songs all skip  i know it s not my vinyls because they were new  super cute  but super defective      
2129,5.0,                       perfect gift     
2130,5.0,                       i haven t had the best experience on amazon with record players  and i was worried about this one when i got it  however  after about a month of owning it  i have no complaints at all  she looks great  doesn t wobble  and is surprisingly loud  especially for the price  i m very impressed with it      
2131,1.0,                       the box it came in was beat up  but the player itself was fine   once i tried setting it up  i realized that the power cord was missing as well as the manual   i guessing that this was a returned item and they didn t bother to check and make sure all of the items accounted for before reselling      
2132,5.0,                       great record player  came with easy to follow instructions on how to set it up  works great

2134,5.0,                       really great  i didn t realize that it is also a bluetooth speaker  really great volume and easy to set up      
2135,5.0,                       works great for my grandmother s old vinyl records   plays well and sounds good     
2136,5.0,                       i bought this pre owned and expected the scratch to be much worse but it s barely visible  i ve never used one before but i picked up pretty quickly      
2137,5.0,                       amazing   it was a birthday gift for my daughter who just turned     she loves playing her new vinyls on it         
2138,2.0,                       used the record player     times then all of a sudden the turn table stops working  you can hear a noise of it trying to turn but won t  i have all these vinyl and a broken record player      
2139,5.0,                       i m giving it   stars because it works  no dings  no sound issues on my end  the things works and my wife enjoys it  simple      
2140,5.0,                       i got this for a present for my sister  she loves it  she blasts bowie out of it  worth the cost         wish they had other color options though      
2141,4.0,                       i specifically ordered this record player in turquoise and it was delivered in brown  my teenage granddaughter picked the color out to match her newly decorated bedroom  very disappointed      
2142,1.0,                       cheaply made  stopped working within a day  i returned it  after returning it i talked to a few record enthusiasts that said this needle they use will actually hurt your records  pass this record player up and get better one      
2143,5.0,                       i purchased this for my husbands birthday  i was so impressed with how easy it was to use and the fantastic quality     
2144,3.0,                       not sure no plug and clip lock to close suitcase is broken     
2145,5.0,                       impressed  sounds great  works well  and it looks good enough to be a display piece     
2146,5.0,                       it works great and sounds great  the bluetooth works perfect  i use it almost everyday and it s great  only thing would make it better if it would play without having to be plugged up

2148,5.0,                       i received one as a gift and loved it so much that i purchased as a white elephant gift and everyone fought over it  great quality and i love the vintage look      
2149,5.0,                       good turntable for beginners     
2150,5.0,                       came on time and sounds great  its the exact color as the picture  i m very happy with it      
2151,5.0,                       great for old school listening real   rpm s     
2152,5.0,                       my daughter got this for christmas and she loves it  the sound quality is good for her bedroom  it s really a cute record player      
2153,2.0,                       shipping was not on time and the sound was not good      
2154,5.0,                       i am a record collector and did not have hundreds of dollars to spend on a more high tech turntable  this has been great for me  i collect more than i actually play so i haven t used it a ton  will update if any issues in the future     
2155,5.0,                       i use it as a present for my    year old dad and he loved it  it was so easy to use     
2156,1.0,                       i bought this on sep    and save it until december to give it to my son as a christmas present  he use it once and when he tried to use it again on new years it did not work  very disappointed     
2157,5.0,                       as discribed  fast shipping good seller  perfect gift  for a person who loves vinyl records      
2158,1.0,                       it was a gift for my dad and every single record that we tried to play ended up finishing in less than a minute because the player skips through the whole record  it was actually annoying turning it on and hearing the songs skip      
2159,5.0,                       very nice     
2160,1.0,                       bad sound     
2161,3.0,                       worse sound quality than expected  even for price   doesn t open wide enough to fit a record without slight rubbing  as a decoration  the player looks great     
2162,4.0,                       this is my first record player in years  the sound quality is not that great but for the price i can deal with it     
2163,4.0,                       love it but it kind of felt a little cheap on the inside  i was afraid i might break something when i was testing it out before giving it to my daughter  but she loves it      
2164,4.0,                       the only problem was the turntable was not level and so when it turned it looked like there was a very warped record on the table  i don t know if this is common or if it was something that happened in shipping  played great other than looking like the record was traveling across a story sea      
2165,1.0,                       this product is the worse thing i ever ordered in my life  the turntable didn t even turn  built very cheaply   i do not recommend this product at all      
2166,4.0,                       the victrola vintage record player is awesome for beginners and affordable if you just want to listen to your vinyls and better yet the fact that it has bluetooth allows you to connect your phone as well  the quality is good and for what i paid more than good honestly it has a vibrant bright color and portable suitcase which makes it easy to take on the go      
2167,5.0,                       i bought this as a gift for my niece and she loves it   it has a lovely sound      
2168,4.0,                       i really like the sound quality it works well  i am highly disappointed in the print though it is very pixelated so if you want a crisp map that looks high class this really isn t it      
2169,5.0,                       ordered this for my daughter s birthday  she absolutely loves it  plays well  design is cute  and overall a great product      
2170,5.0,                       exactly what i wanted  loud  sound quality it perfect  i would recommend this to any vinyl lover     
2171,1.0,                       worked well upon opening for the price but broke within a year under minimal use      times total  so cannot recommend this product      
2172,4.0,                       nice item but poor sound     
2173,5.0,                       this is a great fun product my daughter loves it    great quality       
2174,5.0,                       my grandparents have a record player and i went online to buy one and     found they are much easier to use than when they were invented  love the easy use and multiple ways to play music and a record      
2175,2.0,                       product failed  after limited use   disappointing   worked well   but but failure after limited use by     year old just outside of return window   do not recommend as a gift      
2176,1.0,                       looks great but skips on every record played be it new or old     
2177,5.0,                       great for the price  came in really early  i bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it      
2178,5.0,                       ordered this as a gift for my elderly brother  he absolutely loves it    he loves music   bring back a lot of good old memories      
2179,5.0,                       has amazing sound and very clear      
2180,4.0,                       bought this because it was a cheap price and had decent reviews  it isn t the best sound quality but it is a nice player and i would buy it again  comes with a    adapter and extra needle  it also works as a bluetooth speaker  it tends to skip on some of my vinyls  brand new ones  unless you use the lever to slowly put down the needle      
2181,5.0,                       the product looks durable  love the design and so nice to play those lp  so vintage feelings   bring backs good memories      
2182,1.0,                       product was bought for a christmas gift  after we opened it  we realized it s been opened before  manual was torn open and the deck was broken  it wouldn t even turn on  we had to send it back and will not be ordering another  found another for the same price with much better reviews so fingers crossed      
2183,5.0,                       i can t believe how inexpensive this is  it s really compact and the suitcase style is cool  good quality and sound      
2184,5.0,                       we love this unit  the bluetooth doesn t reach all that far  but the look and sound of this player is perfect  it s been a huge hit in my household  love it      
2185,5.0,                       great sound   easy to use  and well made      
2186,5.0,                       great value     
2187,5.0,                       was a gift for daughter who is a freshman in college  great quality  sound is as expected  some parts are fragile but that s obvious  she loves it      
2188,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          it s amazing    works so good      
2189,5.0,                       this is my first record player and it has worked perfectly  it rarely ever skips and it s speakers are very good and loud for the price  i would      recommend this to anyone looking for a good record player at a good price  i promise i am a real person with a real opinion  i genuinely love this product      
2190,1.0,                       cheap junk   st one was defective  second one has a different defect      
2191,5.0,                       love     
2192,5.0,                       this is a great product   stars     
2193,5.0,                       perfect for a beginner  not too pricey  lightweight and portable  hooks up to speakers headphones as well as bluetooth     
2194,4.0,                       when i received my package it was already pretty damaged  i opened the box to find the record player in good condition but one of the sides showed the  leather  lifted up like it was not sealed properly  other than that the turn table is in good condition  sound is low quality but good for the price      
2195,5.0,                       i purchased this for xmas for a friend  whose mother missed playing her old vinyl records  let me tell you it was quite a big hit as we played many of my friend s mothers vinyl selections over the course of the afternoon while pounding many drinks and beers        
2196,2.0,                       vinyls skip  pretty much half of the vinyls i had skipped  when i played them on my roommates one that was a bit more expensive i found none of them skipped so it was definitely the player  just received it about a week ago     
2197,4.0,                       first record player for my teen daughter  sound quality could be better but its a portable player  i didn t want to spend alot      
2198,5.0,                       this has been a great starter player and is very attractive  sound quality is not the greatest but most definitely a steal at this price      
2199,1.0,                       turntable belt keeps falling off  my son fixed it   the gift was for my grandson who loved it  glad it could be fixed but i don t recommend   it s very cheaply made      
2200,4.0,                       fantastic for all of you first timers with record players  but there were some records that had a certain base or octave that the record player had a hard time producing and it sounded like someone was screaming in a box  for a lack of a better example       
2201,5.0,                       nice i love it     
2202,4.0,                       arrived super quickly   the color is not what i expected based on the picture shown but i m still really excited to try it out  i ll update my review if i run into any problems but for now i m pretty happy

2205,5.0,                       my daughter and husband had this up and running in less than   minutes   good sound  and so far it s a hit   i ll update if this thing flops  but for now it s awesome      
2206,1.0,                       this little players sound is one big distortion  i just couldn t believe the good reviews i saw  the needle and arm are so heavy it will ruin your record  the needle is such poor quality it will also ruin the record  it s also tiny  just one piece of junk      
2207,5.0,                       love this product perfect size  doesn t take up much space lots of colors to pick from much cheaper than price at different stores      
2208,2.0,                       every album we tried to play skipped  it was a huge bummer  loved the aesthetic of the record player  but that doesn t mean much if it doesn t work  just sent it back in for a refund  i recommend looking elsewhere

2226,5.0,                    perfect sima  bella

2236,5.0,                       hubby loved it     
2237,4.0,                       listening to vinyl transports me back in time  only wish the arm would return by itself when the record is done      
2238,3.0,                       nice little gadget and works well  but it s very quiet    definitely get speakers  also  i like the bluetooth feature  but i really bought it for the record playing      
2239,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this is perfect  smaller than i thought i would be and that makes me happy  it s built well and sounds pretty good  it s definitely worth what i paid for it      
2240,1.0,                       this thing is a pos   it is made cheaply   the speakers stopped working a week after i got it   save your money     
2241,5.0,                       works great  just started using it  it s compact and when not in use can be stored in a cabinet or closet  love the color and am looking forward to getting the matching record storage case      
2242,1.0,                       it scratched two of my records  this brand has a heavy needle      
2243,5.0,                       got this as a graduation present for my brother along with a bunch of vintage elton john vinyls  he loves it and uses it almost every day  i have one from over   years ago and it still works perfectly   it s very easy to use and the sound quality is great      
2244,1.0,                       the item was shipped in it s original package  no extra box  when received it also did not spin the record player  essentially giving my just a bulky bluetooth speaker  i m not knocking the brand  as i ve heard they re really good  just this overall experience was the absolute worst it could have been  will try and contact amazon for some reimbursement      
2245,5.0,                       work very well and nice sound   recommend getting it      
2246,1.0,                       what a scam  this product is faulty as could be  i bought it once  arrived and didn t work  so i returned it and got a new one  after   times playing  it made a puff and smoke came out i followed all the directions  don t waste your time or money on this      
2247,1.0,                       was so bad  scratched my vinyl  skipped to the point of being unplayable and the speaker where awful  i spent some money and got a middle tier record player and it has been night and day different     
2248,1.0,                       when we opened it the screws that hold it together were stripped and some of them had fallen out  when we got the record playing the sound was intermittent in and out  it was horrible and my girlfriend was upset  i would not recommend this record player at all      
2249,5.0,                       very easy to set up and to use  great sound quality  it s the perfect size for us and fits right in the desk

2267,1.0,                       i was looking forward to this product but was let down by the built in speakers poor sound quality  it also has a tendency to skip with records that play beautifully on higher quality turntables

2276,1.0,                       cheaply made record player  it broke when i tried to put the arm in place  also had a hard time playing the records properly      
2277,5.0,                       sounds quality is fine  for the life of my i will never understand why people like vinyl better than a good cd  but hey  my daughter loves this      
2278,4.0,                       an inexpensive product that worked   months  fine for playing old records  it s loud enough for cooking in the kitchen while playing it in the next room  i m very disappointed      
2279,3.0,                       i didn t understand the damage because i didn t read the details   my bad     
2280,5.0,                       it sounds good for the size      
2281,3.0,                       did not come with power adapter so i could not turn on   pretty disappointed      
2282,5.0,                       my boo had tons of records but no working record player to play them on  he loved it  loved the pattern and it worked great  then he left me for his married ex wife who cheated on him because she didn t want him  what a waste of money  three days later she didn t want him again so karma was quick with him and now he s alone  anyway  please buy this for yourself  you would enjoy it      
2283,5.0,                       my   yr old niece loved it     
2284,5.0,                       absolutely fantastic to have a record player again   sound is amazing       
2285,2.0,                    mal sonido        
2286,3.0,                       this did nothing come with a power cord or an extra needle likeit stated in the product review  sorely disappointed in this product as it was my daughters main christmas present      
2287,1.0,                       not even for the beginner     
2288,2.0,                       speakers are terrible  very low volume   keep looking      
2289,5.0,                       although this was purchased through the amazon warehouse it was brand new in the box  great deal      
2290,5.0,                       my niece loved it  very stylish and durable      
2291,1.0,                       this skips records consistently and feels very cheap  getting a good record player for under      is impossible  if you re looking for a record player that actually works go a different rout  but if your okay buying this toy that comes pre broken then by all means go for it      
2292,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          the quality isn t as good as you think  most of the parts are made of plastic  but it s worth this price      
2293,1.0,                       all the records we have played on this scip horridly  no way to adjust the arm     
2294,2.0,                       arrived broken and the circle it s not working     
2295,5.0,                       bought this as a birthday gift for my daughter  in  law and she loved it   made a great addition to her personal home office  well made and speaker sound is great   lovevinyl     
2296,3.0,                       major skipping problems with newer albums due to the overly light weight of the needle arm      
2297,5.0,                       edit  i received the remaining parts  works like a charm and looks adorablethis product did not come with the power cord  extra needle or instruction manual     
2298,5.0,                       i love it but it was missing the replacement needle the box said it came with  otherwise i m happy with it     
2299,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          totally worth it    worth the money  worth everything  this is amazing      
2300,2.0,                       i have only been able to listen to several albums and it already sounds a little flat  i tried changing the stylus but that did not make it sound any better  given the low price of this product i did not expect the highest quality  however  i am still disappointed with the short lifespan of the record player and speakers      
2301,5.0,                       bought for my grand daughter   she was ecstatic   she loved this vintage looking turntable that is blue tooth       
2302,3.0,                       my wife picked this out to play some recorded she recently discovered from her youth    it plays the            s and    s just fine   it s not a bad looking box you can pair it to a bluetooth speaker or a cable that has the rca  mini  plugs  and then you can use an amplified external speaker  if you are wanting decent sound  you might want to consider doing that   it has speakers  and the music comes out  but they are not of any quality  they get the job done  the best way to describe the sounds that comes out of this is   tolerateable     at     you cannot expect high quality sounds       
2303,5.0,                       i bought this as a very early christmas gift for my husband  i m sure he ll love it      
2304,5.0,                       portability is good  no battery power so always need a power outlet  sound is good  about what you should expect from the little stock speakers  it does have audio out so better speakers could be hooked up  it has met all expectations      
2305,4.0,                       for the price i paid this unit is a good mix of versatile and portable   good for visiting with friends or other small social occasions      
2306,5.0,                       compact and sturdy   has aux  connector as well as bluetooth capabilities   the sound is great   my son loves it

2316,4.0,                       this product is very reasonable in price   this retro suitcase style turntable is very nostalgic and functional   ideal for compact systems   this victrola system combines portability for all your amps and speaker hookups

2321,4.0,                       i think this was my wife s favorite gift for christmas  we don t care about the bluetooth capability  but the built in speakers are a little weak  great option at this price point  lots of fun      
2322,5.0,                       great gift for my husband  the overall quality of the record player is great and we have enjoyed the sound it produces as well      
2323,5.0,                       works great     
2324,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i m so obsessed with this product  i was a little skeptic because of the reviews but holy crap it s amazing  the sound is good  it was so easy to set up  and just so amazing   good price too  i highly recommend      
2325,1.0,                       bought for my daughter for christmas  worked for about a week  now turntable doesn t turn and it just makes a popping noise when turned on  customer service wasn t any help  very disappointed     
2326,5.0,                       it s very portable and has a good sound     
2327,5.0,                       plays as described  i haven t had any issue with the sound at all  would definitely recommend for vinyl lovers      
2328,1.0,                       very poor quality    i ve had it less then a month i used it four times and the needle broke already  the sound quality is terrible  i hope i can get a refund      
2329,5.0,                       i purchased this for a gift   she is in love with it     
2330,5.0,                       my    yr old son really wanted a record player and he picked this one  he loves it  sounds good and its simple to use  i d buy it again if i needed another one      
2331,1.0,                       beautiful machine  but stopped working after   months of use  most disappointing is that it is listed as durable  would love to try to exchange it  but do not see a way to do that        
2332,5.0,                       it s a terrific little patriotic record player and it s perfect for me      
2333,5.0,                       quality product and great for anyone wanting a nice record player without spending a fortune      
2334,2.0,                       it s definitely not a long term record player  maybe a starter  good bluetooth and portability  but sound quality was terrible on all my records     
2335,1.0,                       could never get it to work properly  chanted the needle but it constantly skipped words on the vinyl  this was not a good product      
2336,3.0,                       it s beautiful but the chord one day started making it smoke and the whole thing freaked me out      
2337,5.0,                       love this and have long wanted one      
2338,5.0,                       excellent turntable with excellent sound quality      
2339,5.0,                       got it for my wife   she loves it      
2340,4.0,                       it worked pretty well  but it did have   problem  it s could have also been the records  but it kept replaying the same verse of a song over and over and i can t fix it        
2341,5.0,                       i have no complaints  perfect soundpackage came with a link to get a free replacement needle      
2342,5.0,                       perfect gift for my mother  she plays all my grandmothers records in it      
2343,5.0,                       simple and easy to use  sound quality is clear but with limited bass   the suitcase design takes up very little space which is a plus    i wasn t looking to spend too much and this worked great for my budget      
2344,5.0,                       if you don t have a lot of space this is a perfect item  it s compact and easy to store when not using  the sound is good  i enjoy it      
2345,5.0,                       really impressed with quality considering the price  speakers do a good enough job playing your vinyl  recommend for those just getting into or re discovering vinyl or you don t have a whole lot of room to work with      
2346,3.0,                       sound quality is terrible  build is really fragile  only good thing about it is its portability  wouldn t recommend for actual use as a record player  might be fine as decoration      
2347,1.0,                       loved the item until it quit working after   uses  it s a surprise christmas gift so i guess at least i found out before christmas      
2348,1.0,                       broke shortly after arrival  does not play records  skips regularly  possibly damages your records  i can t get a hold of company despite reaching out   times      
2349,1.0,                       broke after   month  used it twice  will not ever be purchasing through this brand again lol very disappointed in the product  cheaply made  poor sound quality      stars  listen to a toddler scream for an hour  it ll give you less of a headache      
2350,4.0,                       we love it  although the needle had to be weighed down with a quarter  don t remember doing that back in the day              
2351,4.0,                       this is a nice little turn table   the sound is spectacular but it s not terrible either   pretty good overall for what the price was      
2352,2.0,                       product was not up to par  right out of the box it  skipped  while playing  the return was good as usual with amazon but product was defective     
2353,5.0,                       this record player is great   works like a charm with excellent sound quality  not to mention an affordable price      
2354,1.0,                       doesnt work  record just skips  want to return this  i wouldn t recommend this at all  please advise how to begin return     
2355,5.0,                       very cool and old school feel with technology  great sound quality      
2356,5.0,                       this is such a darling record player  and the blue tooth feature is awesome  it made a wonderful gift to my    year old   she s started her records collection and uses it a lot  you can carry it like a little briefcase  the price is awesome too      
2357,5.0,                       perfect perfect perfect     
2358,2.0,                       came in pieces when i got it     
2359,5.0,                       decent device  speakers are on the poor side if your using this device to listen  it does have a way for you to connect your own though      
2360,5.0,                       it s a great product  plain and simple  it s fun and makes any room look and feel cooler      
2361,1.0,                       stopped working after two months     
2362,4.0,                       still haven t figured it out  we like the record player and the sound from the player itself is okay  we are glad we got it to play our old vinyl      
2363,5.0,                       love the bt capability  sounds good  easy to use for beginners     
2364,5.0,                       great product     
2365,4.0,                       everything works  the one i got didn t include a   rpm adapter  though      
2366,3.0,                       bought to play old vinyl  warped some of them  sound quality was okay      
2367,5.0,                       bought it to play my   s   my old record player only played   s and   s  and this one does all     easy to use and set up      
2368,5.0,                       my dad absolutely loved this     
2369,5.0,                       works sound is good     
2370,3.0,                       wish the sound was better but overall satisfied  the bluetooth is for input not output  so you can bluetooth your device  ie phone or computer  to the record player  not the other way around  to output sound you use the rca output      
2371,5.0,                       husband loves it      
2372,4.0,                       awesome  does the job and makes a great gift     
2373,5.0,                       bought for our teenage grand daughter and she just loves it      
2374,2.0,                       item showed up with no extra boxing or protection other than the manufacturer s box  and the box was opened  being that this is electronic i will probably be sending back      
2375,4.0,                       it s okay  sounds not great but we get to hear some older records now     
2376,5.0,                       i m in love with that thing  beautiful sound  pretty look  and overall awesome thing      
2377,5.0,                       great product  unbelievably fast shipping shipped   hours after ordering and arrived a whole day earlier than expected      
2378,5.0,                       i absolutely love my new record player it s great to be able to listen to my albums which haven t been used for almost    years         
2379,1.0,                       after being used   times it quit working  when i called the phone number to request assistance i got transferred to a voice mail box and got no answer  no help is available on the website either  very disappointed        
2380,1.0,                       the speakers are low volume even when turned up  thank god i have a warranty  this is not worth what i paid  even if it s already on the cheaper  i have to blast the volume all the way up and still  barley any sound     
2381,4.0,                       it does the job sound quality could be better and louder will see if i add my sound bar  but for the money worth it      
2382,1.0,                       was excited to get this  was upset it showed up and didn t play and sound through the speakers      
2383,5.0,                       my   yrs old son is loving it  great sound  good quality  love that is doesn t take up a lot of space      
2384,1.0,                       horrible  sound quality is atrocious  this should be    bucks for the quality you get      
2385,1.0,                       item i received was not as pictured on this description  the item i received was very different  it was a much darker shade of blue  i m very disappointed because as pictured the item would have matched perfectly with my living room decor      
2386,5.0,                       very cute  nostalgic and great sound      
2387,5.0,                       really cute while still perfectly functional  smaller than expected  record overflows the edges      
2388,1.0,                       without all attachments     
2389,5.0,                       i love this record player it s great for beginners and i can bring it around places   i definitely recommend this product       
2390,5.0,                       the sound quality is good and it s great to be able to play my old records again      
2391,5.0,                       are use it all the time while cooking or for in the shower it s the best not to mention a perfect conversation starter when people see it     
2392,4.0,                       i love this so much   it s super cute and plays the music very well and ships quickly        recommend     
2393,1.0,                       this product does not last   i have had it for just over   months and used it maybe     times to play some old records   as of today  the speakers in the unit no longer work unless i press down hard on the case   it was a cheap device but i expected it to last longer than a couple of uses   please save yourself the hassle and don t purchase this      
2394,2.0,                       this record player worked very well until recently    months after purchase  it is now smoking when turned on   has anyone else had a problem   we are afraid to use it anymore      
2395,5.0,                       woah  what sound and quality build  i really like this turntable  it has two really quality speakers and lots of in and outputs  i hooked it to my stereo aux port and it was totally compatible  it was easy to transport and pack away  i m glad i got it      
2396,5.0,                       this was gift they loved it easy to use very practical quality of case very chic perfect for guys and girls lightweight   leather looking material isn t cheap at all

2398,4.0,                       this was a christmas gift for my daughter   she loves it and plays records every day on it   in fact we bought one for my    year old mother   they both love it      
2399,5.0,                       not the nicest record player but very enjoyable regardless  suitcase concept is pretty cool as well      
2400,5.0,                       just what i was looking for in ac gift     
2401,5.0,                       got it as a gift for my sister she loves itworks great     
2402,4.0,                    la verdad el sonido es bien bajo   es mas para una habitaci n   que para compartir en una reuni n        
2403,1.0,                       it broke within a few months  it was super pretty but i only got to use it a few times      
2404,1.0,                       plate wobbled right out of the box  couldn t play anything  needed to find a record player locally in order to have it for christmas   quality control needs to be better      
2405,5.0,                       fantastic sound  quality     
2406,3.0,                       would love if this was actually true bluetooth that i could play a record through my home bluetooth audio system  disappointed in that aspect but overall good record player      
2407,5.0,                       great for my granddaughter  she really loves it and the look of it too      
2408,1.0,                       this thing is absolutely garbage  sound quality through built in speakers is terrible and it s even worse when it is hooked up to a stereo  i have bose surround sound in my basement and it was so static filled i couldn t make out the lyrics  do not buy this      
2409,5.0,                       works great     
2410,1.0,                       my turntable will not work on blue tooth  it will connect to different speakers i ve tried  it will show connected to turntable and device  but soon as it connects  the turntable stops turning          been playing it with built in speakers     
2411,4.0,                       got this for my daughter for christmas  she loves it  i got a great deal on this one  about      that is nearly the best price i ve seen  works well  sound quality isn t phenomenal  but she can always hook it to external speakers      
2412,1.0,                       it was broken at the hinges when we received it      
2413,5.0,                       it was a gift      
2414,4.0,                       bought it for my kids   they like it  i think the sound is good for the price i paid      
2415,1.0,                       it didn t come with the plug in so i had to buy one but even then it wouldn t turn on  couldn t test it but honestly it s poorly made  get yourself a better one      
2416,5.0,                       so glad i purchased this  overly happy with this product      
2417,5.0,                       it was a gift for my daughters  she loves it     
2418,1.0,                       given to my lovely wife for her birthday as a reminder of her youth   and no power cord is included  just read the reviews for others and this is a problem that happened elsewhere      
2419,5.0,                       i loved to share listening to vinyl with my kids  the player s blue tooth capability is an added bonus with teenagers in the house      
2420,5.0,                       we love it  it has that old great sound when music came out a long time ago      
2421,1.0,                       sound is so poor  so bad i assume i received a dud  amazon was fantastic to deal with though     
2422,4.0,                       a good product for beginners  it s easy to use and works nicely  the sound quality is fairly well if you plan to listen on your own or at regular occasions  along with that  the wait wasn t too long   it arrived earlier than the estimated delivery date      
2423,4.0,                       i have not tried to connect to bluetooth  yet  sound quality  meh  too quiet even with volume on highest setting      
2424,5.0,                       i bought this to enjoy our record collection  the sound is great and it is enjoyed by all      
2425,5.0,                       it s an amazing gift   perfect     
2426,1.0,                       worked for a year and   weeks just in time for the warranty to end      
2427,2.0,                       worked great for awhile but only a little under   months later it doesn t work at all        
2428,5.0,                       cute  sounds great     
2429,5.0,                       love this  it does exactly what i want it to      
2430,5.0,                       i think it s amazing for the low price  everyone hating on it has expectations of an       record player  for the price  sound  needle  quality  its fantastic  i like this one way more than the crosley  so happy with my purchase        
2431,5.0,                        st order was damaged  belt was stretched out too much  received  nd one in perfect condition     
2432,5.0,                       got this for my god daughter   and she says she ll never go back to her ipod again      
2433,4.0,                       it got here timely  and is great  one star gone because the sound quality isn t fantastic  but you can bluetooth it and play the actual songs through a different speaker that way     
2434,5.0,                       great player for old vinyl records     
2435,2.0,                       i bought this and sent to a friend as a gift  the vinyl did work but the bluetooth audio did not work  it was embarrassing gifting a defective player      
2436,5.0,                       i ve had this for a year now and it still works great  just as pictured and works good      
2437,5.0,                       my daughter loves it      
2438,4.0,                       i love my record player and have waited forever  sound could be better though it doesn t go up very load but its portable so that makes up for it      
2439,5.0,                       daughter loves this piece of nostalgia  she found my stash of all my classic rock albums  and hearing her play my old records sure takes me back in time      
2440,5.0,                       absolutely amazing     
2441,1.0,                       not even a year later it no longer works  it s definitely not worth buying  i highly advise you don t waste you money on this price of crap      
2442,5.0,                       works great with no issues   easy to use   my wife loves playing old records we get from thrift stores      
2443,5.0,                       this was a gift for my    year old daughter  she absolutely loves it and plays her music and uses the bluetooth feature everyday      
2444,1.0,                       bought this as a birthday gift  he plugged it in immediately after unwrapping  and this just snaps right off  it s absolutely beautiful and the sound quality is great  just wish the craftsmanship held up      
2445,5.0,                       got it for my fianc  for his birthday      
2446,5.0,                       my daughter loves it      
2447,2.0,                       the player worked one time and would not play a record the second time  it would not turn on at all  i liked the style of it  but was disappointed in its performance      
2448,2.0,                       like it  while it worked had good sound  but it broke almost exactly one year from purchase date  turntable stopped turning  you have to start it by hand and no sound      
2449,5.0,                       for the price not bad at all  not as loud but still able to enjoy the record        
2450,3.0,                       broke after a month of use  took it apart  thinking it was a connection problem with the speaker  and didnt find anything      
2451,4.0,                       had to tape a penny to the needle cuz out want heavy enough and the speakers aren t high quality but it plays old records and new fantastically   worth the price      
2452,5.0,                       not sure what the bad reviews are about  this thing is amazing     gives it that old school sound and is so aesthetically pleasing to look at  excited to have this      
2453,5.0,                       for the size it has good sound  it s very cool looking  i gave it as a gift and they loved it      
2454,5.0,                       nice     
2455,4.0,                       its a very nice player  it did crackle on a few parts however one thing i really was upset about was the color  i ordered the turquoise teal colored one but instead i got the red one  dont get me wrong  its still nice  but i would have favored the original color because it would have matched my room     
2456,5.0,                       works great   and the sound is okay being loud enough    and plays big records too    for the price and the looks i believe it s a good buy      
2457,4.0,                       it s good if you re a beginner with vinyl  the speakers are pretty decent but not the strongest  the bluetooth is ok as well but don t expect too much from the range  for what you pay for  it s a good investment      
2458,5.0,                       great portability  super cute and amazing sound quality  and the directions make it super easy to set up and maintain

2463,4.0,                       she loved it except when she played music from her phone via bluetooth  it didnt sound clear  but its loud and plays her records      
2464,3.0,                       got this for my brother for christmas last year  he loved it but we had to put a quarter on the tone arm to keep it from skipping on records  looks pretty crappy now  sound quality is whatever  pretty typical sound for a portable record player      
2465,4.0,                       won t wow you  but does the job    very inexpensive  glad we got this

2477,5.0,                       came wrapped well and when expected     
2478,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          the color on the turquoise aqua is way off  the picture makes it look like it s a mint similar to the ice blue kitchenaid color  it s more of a robins egg blue  which unfortunately doesn t match anything i have  it s a lot darker and brighter than the color shown  will update review after i use it update  works great  the speakers aren t the most spectacular things but you can always hook up separate speakers  i m happy with it for my first record player      
2479,5.0,                       i bought this record player for my sister so i can t personally comment   however  my sister seems to love it

2486,1.0,                       the player speakers are cheap they didn t lady more than   months did not play it loud at all   cheap speakers don t waste your money       
2487,1.0,                       i m giving this a one star because the needle on the record player broke after only having it for   week  everything else on it worked fine  it was just poor quality material

2529,1.0,                       my product was used  the box was secured with scotch tape the ac adapter was thrown in the box and the speakers were giving off minimal sound  so i am assume they were blown  one star for being cosmetically appealing

2538,5.0,                       super easy to use when using records and connect to bluetooth if you choose to use that function instead      
2539,4.0,                       updated review  nice features at price point  newly received  black  model arrived in good shape and has a feature that the blue one didn t    the volume power knob also turns on the bluetooth discovery function whereas the blue unit had a separate switch for the bluetooth  i like the black model s design  one less switch to break and more straightforward to sync   sound is good but not great  as expected from two small built in speakers   stereo sound is evident   i like that this model stops the turntable automatically when arm at end of record  no auto return of arm   another portable unit i have does not do this  solid four stars now for product  one start missing due to poor assembly on first model and inconvenience of needing replaced  unit very  plasticy   could have used more metal and less plastic on some parts to inspire confidence that it will last a long time   old review follows  ordered light blue model  arrived by prime as expected   box in decent shape  but the item arrived defective  poorly manufactured    one screw missing from top deck  one other screw had completely come out of top deck and was jammed under turntable  no evidence of shipping damage    my guess is screws were stripped when installed and simply fell out during shipping    though who knows where the second screw went     something heavy has come loose inside of the turntable cabinet and slides back and forth upon tipping  presumably once held in place by one or more of the same missing screws   the turntable functions well enough despite missing loose components  one speaker not working  that i m willing to give it another shot with a replacement    though the blue one is now backordered until after christmas  amazon customer support was great re  replacement options  trying again with a black one      
2540,5.0,                       got this for my daughter for christmas  she uses it almost daily   it s perfect for her bedroom  the sound quality is great

2544,1.0,                       the record hangs off the side and ruins the balance  so all my records skip and wobble  can t find a way to fix it  waiting too long to unpack it to realize it sucks and can t return it

2547,4.0,                       totally recommend  it s beautiful and super compatible  the sound is great  if i gave it   stars  it s because i wish the needle on the inside get a little more sturdy  apart from that it s great

2589,1.0,                       this is not a functioning turntable   with the volume on max it has weaker sound the a cell phone and the needles skips every track do not waste your time and money

2602,1.0,                       there was no power cord included  so i had to go and find one here at home  i plugged it in and it didn t spin  it just started to smell like burning      
2603,2.0,                       turn table works great but the mint green color i ordered is absolutely not what i received  the color is robin egg blue which is very disappointing      
2604,4.0,                       this record player is great  the sound qualilty is good and is working great  one thing that didn t make me put   stars is that it didn t come with the power cord  and i had to buy one      
2605,1.0,                       very low quality for the price  cheap in every way       for a kid s toy maybe  but otherwise  no  the sound is tinny and speaker rattles  the bluetooth didn t work at all      
2606,4.0,                       for         this record player exceeded my expectations  such a great conversation piece with pretty good sound quality  bluetooth works great  only negative was that it gets skippy every once in a while but fixes itself quickly
