0,1.0,                       when i first opened it it looked fine but then i went to turn it on and it took like an hour to even get it on  after that i went to charge the phone and it says it s on   percent all the time and when i have it on the charger it doesn t do anything and i ve tried with   chargers  i m debating on whether i should pay to fix it or just return the phone because it s so impractical and doesn t work even close to right      
1,5.0,                       to begin   my seller was chubbiestech  the phone arrived two days early in the amazonrenewed box  included was a charger  cord  screen protector  and sim tool  the phone itself was pristine  absolutely spotless  zero scratches  dents  or marks  and it has     of it s battery capacity  the phone functions perfectly  it arrived in such a condition that i would have thought it was a brand new phone straight from the apple store   i had been reading some of the concerning negative reviews and decided to purchase this phone  i do not regret it one bit  i am very pleased      
2,5.0,                       very pleased with the quality and condition of the phone   a few scratches around the top of the phone  by my case covers them  my phone even arrived a day earlier than expected   even with a hurricane looming  my new phone was easy to set up and it have all of the info from my old phone transferred  would definitely recommend this seller  the even included a screen protector      
3,5.0,                       i like the reliability of the apple cell phone   the fingerprint reader is a time saver and is safer than passwords  battery life so for good     
4,5.0,                       so far  all is good  set up wand transfer went smoothly and phone is operating well   it was in great shape      
5,2.0,                       loved the red  hated low battery life  apple recommends replacement       approx      fee  no ear phones        walmart  i m having problems with the finger print recongination feature  fat fingers  poor reader abilites  i ll have to return the phone if my teck  can t fix this  phone returned     
6,5.0,                       as the title says  works as well as the iphone    replaced it because i thought a problem was hardware related  turned out it wasn t   do like the expanded    gb memory over the    gb memory of the   because i can have my entire music library onboard  use music  podcasts  calendar  all of it  signing in to my account  the phone filled with all my apps and data  honestly don t notice it s much faster with updated chip and i seldom use the camera  so newer features don t make a significant difference to me but bottom line is is works as well as i m used to  will use it until i upgrade to iphone    when that comes out  so i can be ready for  g when it really it deployed and working  most places have little to no  g  regardless of what the ads say       
7,5.0,                       i had a great experience with this purchase thus far  after reading some reviews about possible issues i was concerned and contacted seller  they responded quickly       min  with multiple questions i had and related information about the t mobile only iphone i had purchased and made me feel very comforable with the purchase  a  customer service was my experience and the phone is in great shape for  renewed   will update if needed  with phone and network carriers it pays to do a little homework sometimes      
8,5.0,                       yes the shutter sound can t be turned off but by just using live mode to take photos that is resolved  the phone was for my wife and she likes the shutter sound  who knows why   so zero problem either way  phone arrived indistinguishable from new  shiny and scratch free  setup was easy  sim card from old phone worked perfectly  charged extremely fast and battery seems to last a long time  we added the extended warranty  a    gb phone for less than      can t be beat      
9,1.0,                       i got this with international shipping to south africa  the packaging seemed really secured  and still  i received a half cracked home button on this phone  i m highly doubtful it was due to shipment damage  this was meant to be a gift so i m very very disappointed  the post clearly stated that the phone was  professionally inspected  tested  and cleaned to work and look like new    i provided some images but my old phone doesn t have the best camera quality  if you re looking for a seller who keeps their promises  this is not the place to purchase from  i don t recommend at all      
10,5.0,                       i was so nervous about ordering a refurbished iphone off amazon but this was worth the money  i ve had the phone for about a week now and i have no complaints  cosmetically  there were a few scratches by the power button and on the lower left portion of the screen but i put on a case and glass screen protector so you can t even see the scratches anymore  my phone came with     battery health remaining  my t mobile sim card booted up just fine and i had no issues with creating getting the phone set up  would recommend      
11,5.0,                       i ordered the fully unlocked version  when it came in the mail it was in new condition  no scratches or dings  and it came with the charger and tool to get my sim card out  we have a plan with verizon  i was able to take out my sim from my old iphone and put it in this one and it turned on and loaded all my stuff with zero issues  my phone is working fine and the battery life is just as good if not better than my last phone  so far no bugs or glitches  i m very happy with my purchase  there were a lot of mixed reviews so i was skeptical on buying it but i m glad i did  plus it came with an amazon backed warranty so if one came defective i didn t feel like i would loose my money  my advice would be to pay close attention to your selection when adding the phone to your cart for service options and when in doubt go for the fully unlocked version      
12,1.0,                       so embarrassing  i bought this phone for my daughter s birthday and it turn on for few minutes and then shut off and never came back on end up buying a new one for just      dollars more  with all the warranties  and i had to pay for the return      
13,1.0,                       i received an iphone   that was purchased as an upgrade for my sons   th birthday this phone is listed as fully unlocked on amazon when we tried to activate it through our phone service they were unable to do so because the phone is said to be listed with a carrier already  now we have a phone that while it appears to look great does not work for our service provider so does us no good    how disappointing to have purchased this as a gift only to have to turn around and tell someone it s not able to be activated  i don t know how well it works because i cannot even activate it      
14,5.0,                    bien good       
15,5.0,                       we haven t had any problems with this phone  it looks and works great  had an old phone and needed more memory  shipment was quick and well packaged      
16,5.0,                       this was shipped very quickly   the phone performs well   it was the replacement for the fatally damaged iphone   which my son had become very fond of   glad i made this replacement purchase   price was right      
17,1.0,                       if i could give this product a zero i would  ordered this phone once and the front camera didn t work  decided to return it and replace it with another phone from this same vendor  big mistake   the second phone s front camera doesn t work either  clearly they do not quality check their products before they send them out  don t waste your time and money      
18,5.0,                       i bought the iphone        it looked like new when i received it  it did not come in the original iphone box  it came in a cardboard box with the plug in to charge it and the little metal piece for sim card  it worked great in every aspect except that i noticed the sound quality was not as good as my iphone  s  the sound was more  tinny  sound  probably not noticeable to others  but it was for me  i don t know if it was a defect or how the iphone   was made  it just startled me when i would use it for an alarm clock playing music  i did not have any problem at all returning the iphone  the package came with a card that had their phone number and email address  backed by amazon  there is a    day warranty and i turned it back in shortly before the    days was up  when i spoke with the customer service  they were really nice and just wanted to know what was wrong with the iphone  i was sent an email with the return label and i sent it back with no problem and got a full refund  even though the phone did not work out for me  i would still recommend this company because of their great service and following through with what they say they will do      
19,1.0,                       the phone could text and call but could not connect to cellular data  defective and not as described and now i don t have a phone for     days until i can get this replaced      
20,3.0,                       it had scratches on the phone   but it was my daughters birthday present   did not feel like returning it   the charging port and cable were not apple  but i think it mentioned that   the phone was just inside the box   no wrapping whatsoever  phone is good i guess overall     
21,5.0,                       excellent condition  like new  arrived promptly everything works apart from fingerprint function but i had the same problem with my last one  maybe i just don t have good enough fingerprints      
22,1.0,                       i should have known better  as soon as i tried to turn the phone on to set it up  there were problems  the phone was not responding to charging or me pressing the home power buttons i finally got it to turn on and assumed it was just a freak occurence  i was mistaken  and began to set up the phone  the phone kept resetting itself or shutting down completely throughout the night  again  i blamed it the amount of data i was transferring from my old phone   mistaken again i used the phone for a few days  and it reset or shut down probably an average of   times a day  sometimes the phone would freeze completely and become unresponsive to any buttons  touching  or even my attempts to force it to shut down  i would just have to leave it alone for an hour or until it reset itself again i ended up returning the phone  and asked to exchange it for one that worked  the company faied to do so and sent me a refund instead  now i am without a phone right before the holidays and must scramble to find a new one  i will not be buying this phone ever again and i recommend that you don t either      
23,4.0,                       phone arrived in good condition and given as a gift to grandson grandson was disappointed as charger and cord received was too generic and charging was not too quick  maybe you could send a better charger and cord in order to improve your image to your customers  hope you can do something about it battery is being monitored at this time  hopefully  there will be no issues next month and so on will be posting whatever issues we might have in the coming months thanks for your attention teresa b july           sunday there are other issues found on this iphone    camera flickers and makes noise    someone else s email is showing on the phone    very slow in applications    clicking when trying to use video in view of these issues  the iphone was not properly refurbished and it is very very disappointing the iphone has to be replaced  please let me know how to send it back  if not  just refund the money thanks teresa b      
24,5.0,                       i don t always write reviews but i m so happy with the condition of the iphone i got  no visible scratches or dents  i get all my calls and text messages i just put my old at t sim card in and it works perfectly  only downside is battery maximum capacity is      but i feel that is fair enough because the product description says      which it is  don t buy one of these if you need a better battery life      
25,1.0,                       i was really excited to try amazon renewed for my teenage daughters cell phone  i ended up ordering two and neither one worked with our service provider  the first one i bought said it would work with all carriers  took it to the store and it wouldn t work with their network  the second one i got for sprint and it was originally sold as a prepaid phone and i don t have a prepaid contract with sprint so they couldn t use it on my account  very disappointed in finding out it was originally sold as prepaid in the store and not in the amazon description  i feel like that s something very easy to check on before listing it for sale  ended up returning both phones and didn t repurchase from amazon renewed      
26,2.0,                       phone arrived on time  and looked completely new   was easy to set up and worked exactly as expected   after two weeks  if i was out and was carrying the phone in a bag it would begin to randomly execute functions   initially i thought i had been hacked  but i read on line that this probably means the screen installation is faulty   unfortunately this happened  while i was on vacation  so i ended up being without a cell phone during my trip whenever i was out of the house   it also deleted all my music  which i was able to re load when i returned home    it then took another week to call and obtain the postage paid label and buy a replacement phone once i returned home  so i was without a mobile phone for several weeks   i have bought refurbished phones in the past without any problem   i intend to try again to buy a refurbished phone as it is the phone i want  it did look perfect  the battery life seems good  and the price is very good      
27,5.0,                       the apple iphone   came in pristine condition  not a scratch on the device  the battery life is great  phone has been used for   weeks now and not one single problem  seller sent the phone quickly  very happy customer      
28,1.0,                       my phone came in great condition and worked perfect for about   weeks and then it started shutting off automatically and keeping a black screen while i could still touch and feel the fingerprint vibrate  it has a grey line that shows across the screen while it does what i explain above  i have service on my phone and i pay my phone bill but it always says  no service  and my phone doesn t work i paid almost      for a phone that is defective and doesn t work still       
29,5.0,                       i purchased this phone beginning of feb        i have been using it for    months   it acts like a brand new phone   i haven t had a single issue   battery life seems normal   i doubt i will ever buy new again      
30,1.0,                       this product came as a complete disappointment  broken  turned on and off whenever it felt like  it didn t keep charge  the turn on off button wasn t even working properly and the was a glimpse  of light showing in the lower left side of the screen  trademore s customer service was horrible  even though they accepted the refund request immediately  they never gave me the money back   it took me a month of begging them   and amazon finally stepped in and gave me my refund  i bought another phone from them at the same time  the other phone seems to be working just fine      
31,5.0,                       i love my new iphone  it s refurbished but it s new to me   i set it up myself  really easy  it said no sim  asked my do i need to put it in new phone  he told me to google it   i was smart enough to fight out  when i called number and old phone rang  i figured it out      
32,5.0,                       so happy with the seller and purchase  shipping was slower than i would ve liked but first world probs right  the phone was in amazing shape  no damage that i could find at all  i got the iphone   silver and it s fast  perfect and was such a great deal      
33,5.0,                       i love my new phone  it is exactly as described in the listing  i will never purchase a brand new model when the renewed models are just as good and much less expensive  if you didn t know it was an older model you would think it was the latest being offered   no scratches no noticeable defects and battery level is very good      
34,5.0,                       i love my iphone       it s beautiful super clean and pristine          battery life and no scratches     sometimes the volume seems a little low in phone calls but it works perfectly     i was hesitant after reading some reviews on here but it was a great buy i m so happy with this phone     i hope everyone gets as lucky as me     i hope this helps anyone that s worried about buying and it was unlocked completely and i have metro pcs and i got my android switched over right away       this is a real review no bs                              
35,4.0,                       for those of you trying to suss out which seller is best through the aggregated reviews  i ordered my from electro wireless  the phone took about a week to ship out  but to be fair i ordered just before the fourth of july and i can see how that would gum up the works  it arrived within a day of being shipped though  so that made up for it the phone looks immaculate  no scratches or dents   so far i ve had no issues  though it s only been    hours   i booted it up  put in my sim  placed calls  sent texts  changed display settings  tested the speakers with my music  etc    anything i could really think to test i did  the phone came with the tool to open the sim tray  a usb plug  and charge cable  the plug and cable are not apple products  which i expected  but since some reviews act surprised  i ll confirm for those of you who think that really matters  there are two minor downsides  the battery capacity is only at     right now  while that s still entirely useable  at     the battery is essentially dead needs replaced  so i ve only got    to use  though i m not sure how long that will take me to run down so maybe that doesn t matter  the second downside is they also send a tempered glass screen protector  but  it s unfortunately the wrong size  not sure if it s for the  s or a newer iphone  but it sure isn t for the regular old    i ordered a case anyway  so it s not really an issue for me      
36,2.0,                       the phone came in excellent condition  worked until i updated it and now i cannot use it with my cellular data  apple quoted me      to fix it  i m very disappointed in the short length of time the phone actually worked but it is not the sellers fault      
37,2.0,                       if you re coming from android don t do it  i only tried iphone because of crickets wi fi calling rules   i got the amazon renewed iphone     it sucks at recognizing screen touches  it doesn t understand my voice in voice command or speech to text texts emails  i m a mid atlantic wasp so i have no accent  it still didn t correctly dictate most of what i said  i even tried different listening apps  device microphone  google keyboard  siri   yet for some reason siri what type what i was saying on the screen as i spoke to her proving the device could understand my words  but the stupid witch never helped me or followed commands  even  call home  was misdirected   after talking to siri  now i know how men feel when they talk to women     the battery only lasted a few hours with mild to moderate use  no videos  the actual phone itself is really small if you re starting to have eye or dexterity issues it s pain in the butt  and apparently apple doesn t have a back button  the middle button is the only button on the front  the programmed user manual is a joke  the steps count and sleeping tracker are not accurate  this phone was nothing but a lesson in frustration plusses   if you are coming from android it let s u use many google apps   will remember your google login once entered to allow you to more seamlessly transition between google and apple  it was fast and easy transferring my content from my android to the iphone   if you are the type that likes actually pushing a button the main button is actually push click  not just a spot on a screen  however pushing and clicking it sometimes it ignores you anyways  the signal reception was fairly good and the wi fi calling worked very well  that being said the audio itself was not very clear  it sounded like a cheap phone      
38,5.0,iphone      gb space gray unlocked gsm  what came in the box    iphone      gb space gray unlocked gsm    lightning cable    usb plug    original box  what was not in the box    earphones    sim card removal tool    user manual  the cable and plug are white and wrapped in plastic just like what you would get if it was new from apple  i cannot tell if these are originals   earphones have always used  rd party so not getting a set was not a deal breaker   phone condition body is in very good condition  there are paint flecks on the corners  maybe dropped on a hardwood floor  it is smooth to the touch  not deep so it does not appear to have been dropped on concrete  pavement or other rough surface and it is not a light scratch from carrying it in a pocket   screen condition it came with a screen protector already applied  if there are any scratches i cannot tell  with the protector on  it looks pristine   a bummer since it was not mentioned in the ad and i had purchased a case and screen protector for it  i always protect the phone before it goes outside   it s an expensive device so why people don t protect it from day one i ll never know  i guess some don t care  i have a spare screen protector now   battery condition  battery health says     maximum capacity relative to when it was new      charge on startup   even though capacity says      i am not having issues where i am out of juice early  over a day with moderate use  heavier use i would need to recharge around      pm       pm  this of course is a ymmv   setting it up phone was already reset  you set it up just like if it came straight out of the factory   camera no scratches on the lens and photos come out crisp and sharp   speakers no issues  sound is very good  no hissing  cracks or pops   microphone  lighting port no issues  works   phone came with ios        installed  so far i have not come across any issues that would give me pause on the purchase  phone is working as expected and the ad says phone is like new and i would have to agree   amazon tends to lump all the reviews together  regardless of seller so you can t tell which negative review belongs to who  it s as if it was all sold by one seller  reviewers need to say who their seller was   my seller was mobiledealz and at the time they were a little bit cheaper than most    this phone debut at          tax on september           nearly   years later it is has seen a      price drop  i don t need the latest and greatest  a gently used phone is just as good 
39,1.0,                       i was sold a phone that had a remaining balance with tmobile    i wasnt even able to activate the phone because they needed to be paid for the phone   absolutely furious about it  it was a gift that they cant even use  this seller should be shut down for being so shady      
40,5.0,                       this is the second refurbished phone i bought in amazon  both have been perfect  no scratches and no problem with functionality  i know there is always a risk  but for the moment  they have worked very well for me      
41,5.0,                       needed a new charger bcuz it didnt belong to phone but seller sent me one asap   did have a while on the phone with tmobile to clean phone to factory reset  then it work great looks brand new  no scratches  slick looking red phone  yes pick the red   lol  definitely a great deal  thank you seller     
42,3.0,                       got this iphone   as a replacement and it has no problems came with screen protector on it  and there was no problems setting it up  no cracks an actuall functioning phone  love it     
43,3.0,                       the phone is fine but i paid extra for it to be shipped on a tuesday and it got here thursday afternoon  the battery after being fully charged lasted about   hours  my previous galaxy phone s battery lasted me all day  so   idk i haven t owned an i phone in so long i can t compare it to other iphones  i am still getting used to it      
44,1.0,                       i purchased this refurbished phone          for           prior to purchasing the phone  i  asked about the battery life   now  the battery is dead as of           less than   months after purchase   usage cost me        month average based on purchase price   i could have had a current brand new  iphone for that monthly usage cost   do not use this vendor   they should have replaced the battery as a good will gesture even if past warranty date   as a business owner  that is how i would have taken care of a customer to earn future business from them   shame on electronic deals reply from  vendor hi brigitte  we are very sorry to hear this  unfortunately  the order is past    days old and the warranty period has expired  we suggest taking the device in to apple or a local authorized apple technician for repair we sincerely apologize for the inconveniences caused kind regards electronic deals family   staff     
45,5.0,                       after   months the phone is now not operable it says the phone was stolen     
46,1.0,                       i purchased this phone and after only using it for over   weeks it stopped charging   it just would nt charge   after scrambling around the next day trying to find a phone i found a new phone i purchased and tried to return this one after forgetting to take the lock off they contacted me and said no refund unless i gave code   no problem i emailed back and gave them the information  then it was something else  no refund until you do this  then the next email no refund until you do this   i finally contacted amazon and they took the purchase off my amazon store card   you cant hold peoples refunds hostage because of a defaulted product   thank you amazon for the refund      
47,5.0,                       who needs a brand new phone  not me  this phone was like new and the price was right  works and looks perfect      
48,5.0,                       im always afraid that i m going to buy a unlocked phone and it won t work with my t mobile network i carry  however when i bought this phone it worked just fine and she got home but the sims in and we were good to go don t think twice get it     
49,1.0,                       i received the phone  seemed in very good condition  however  it would not boot up  it stayed on the apple screen for over an hour  i m done requested a refund and returned the phone      
50,1.0,                       the phones were dirty and grimy  visible scratches on screen  the worst was batter lasted for about an hour on both units  couldnt connect to the data plan of my carrier  only reason didnt return is because i was able to trade them in for new phones with my carrier since they had a promotion  otherwise they would have gone back     
51,5.0,                       this is just as described like brand new  you can not find another phone at this price in as good of condition  i was able to place my sim and set up was as easy as        very fast shipping  would highly recommend  amazing product and price       
52,4.0,                       i knew that a renewed product would mean that the battery had some use to it  and i m finding that to be true  no matter if i disable bluetooth  wifi  etc   it just doesn t last long  just be aware  physically the product was flawless and came nicely packed      
53,1.0,                       could not get this phone to connect to the verizon network   worked with verizon customer service and technical support for over four hours with no success  took the phone to a verizon store in case the old sim card was a problem but even with a new card the phone still wouldn t work elected to send the phone back to buyspry for a refund      
54,1.0,                       the phone came in looking perfect  but the sim card reader was not working   we went to two different stores and one was a t mobile factory store   they stated the screen was replaced and extremely glitchy as well as the sim card reader is not working      
55,1.0,                       purchased as a birthday gift  so didnt find out until after it was opened that the giftee couldnt even use it because it wasnt compatible  i specifically searched for an unlocked phone for that very reason  this was falsely advertised    now going through the trouble of returning it and waiting on a refund      
56,1.0,                       the phone was broken and missing the tray the sim nbc and goes in  i can t even get the phone turned on  the battery life is also very short this is a horrible phone and i am so disappointed  i have sent many emails to refund or send me a new phone  i sent back the  the other phone a few weeks ago and getting really upset  the phone is the only way to contact people and i spent     dollars on it  if i have to take legal actions i will  thank you i love amazon so hope this is resolved or i won t be buying from a manson ever again      
57,1.0,                       received a defective phone    the boot screen would display a line either above or below the apple logo occasionally  it would either show as a green line or a static line   there was occasional lag when swiping through home screens and opening apps  i compared it to a friends iphone   and the problem was specific to the phone i received   the touch screen would not respond occasionally   the battery would not display correct percentages  i once had the phone charging for    minutes and the percentage did not increase at all  after restarting the phone it showed the correct percentage   this also happened while using the phone   the percentage would not decrease until restarting the phone   the speaker sound quality sounded poor compared to my friends iphone       
58,5.0,                       packaging was great  no dings or damage to the phone  satisfied with shipping  it just came with the phone and charger   great phone for the price   recommend to anyone for a budget phone      
59,3.0,                       the camera shutter click will not turn off  i ve tried everything     from what i found this phone must be from japan or korea b c it s law that the camera sound is always on  so that s annoying         
60,4.0,                       it s fully functional and works just fine  i use straight talk and i haven t really had any problems except at some point when i took calls i couldn t hear them unless i put it on speaker but it went away and work just fine  came with a tiny scratch on the bottom corner but i have a case on so i don t see it  same size as an iphone   but the iphone   has a louder earphone  i can hear through it but it s not loud so that sucks but my phone works and it s really nice  came with a charger too  no earbuds unfortunately     
61,5.0,                       the product came a day before  o  easy data transfer from other iphone   descriptions were pretty accurate  condition of the phone looks brand new  battery health     though not know how long the charge lasted since l needed a     screen error on my part   returning the product      
62,1.0,                       the phone had spam texts as soon as i turned it onit stayed hot my flashlight on the phone never workedi had to keep my case off just to get it to stay on     
63,5.0,                       i was initially super worried about buying a renewed phone  especially with apple s battery issues  i bought this for my dad  and everything was pretty much new without the apple packaging  the battery life indicator as well as a few apps to check indicated that the battery was at        capacity  which is basically next to new  i am very pleased with it      
64,1.0,                        st time i ordered one it had blown out speakers so i returned it and asked for a working one as it states that exchanges are an option  they just refunded me instead  i ordered another one  upon opening the package i noticed that the phone was all scratched up on the bottom  but not to worry they covered the scratches with a sharpie  they are junk  they are not refurbished  they are scribbled on and sent out with blown speakers      
65,5.0,                       maybe i m lucky but this phone arrived in perfect condition  exactly as described   i bought it for my wife whos iphone   was failing   we inserted her sim card and she was up and running   i charged it the night before so we ll see how the battery lasts but so far so good      
66,5.0,                       so glad i trusted the positive comments for the seller buyspry  my iphone   looked like brand new and has been working great  even came with a durable screen protector  the generic lightning cable and power brick look and perform just like authentic products  what a great way for me to get an iphone for work without having to spend the    for the newest model  for       i now have an iphone for work so that i can check email and calendar  i still use my android  but my work only allows iphones for exchange access due to apple s stringent security updates  battery life is great  all in all  exceeds my expectations so far      
67,5.0,                       the phone was in good condition  the sim card door broke but they sent me a new one  phone seems to be operating fine  would purchase from this seller again when i need to      
68,4.0,                       the phone i have now works so well  it s in seemingly perfect condition  for what i paid for a used phone  i feel the seller deserves praise for the product at the end of the day  i wish i could give four stars  there were several communication issues  product issues that i felt took this order in a wonky direction      the order was sent to my address with signature required  when i asked to remove the required signature  i m not home all the time   the package was sent the next day to a location one state away  rather than spend another four to five days without a phone  i chose to drive a half hour through a different state to pick up the package at the fedex facility  okay     the first phone stopped working after a few weeks  believe me  being without a phone for a few days can be a risky issue  i don t even have a phone at home  what if i had to call      my employer  etc   they gave me a very quick and flexible response  saying they would replace or return the phone  amazing response  they told me to remove my icloud info and delete the email app  which was impossible because it wouldn t even turn on  but no problem  they removed the icloud account and email when i turned it in somehow  however  they did not mention that i would have to hold onto the sim card so they sent me a new iphone  nice model  everything fine  except  no sim card      no sim card  by this time the world was in the middle of an epidemic crisis  my carrier was closed except for in one location  fine  but the carrier veritably chased me away yelling at me to call because they had no functioning service  not fine   no phone   after all the drama i figured out how to call them without activation on my own  a few days later i got the sim  anyway  the new phone works outstandingly  the exchange was smooth  they were very fast at messaging and did a terrific job of offering me an exchange immediately with no extra fees  however the lack of notice about a signature requirement upon delivery  the first phone battery stopping completely  and the lack of communication about holding my old sim card backed up my phone use  i m all set now though  four stars      
69,5.0,                       this is the second refurbished iphone that i purchased from hybrid it on amazon  i purchased from hybrid it because of their excellent customer satisfaction rating  i bought the iphone   as a birthday gift for my granddaughter and she loved it  the phone arrived on time  was well packaged and in perfect condition  it looked like new  not a scratch on it  it worked perfectly and when the sim card was added  was set up on a cell phone plan with no issues  the battery health was     which is great for a refurbished phone      
70,5.0,                       very happy with the phone  like new condition though the battery  not surprising and warned in advance  is not       i am quite happy with the purchase      
71,5.0,                       i ve had bad experiences purchasing phones off amazon over the years  however  recently they ve been doing a bang up job sending me fully working products  i don t know if i m lucky or they upped their standards  whatever the case maybe  i got the package a whopping two days early and the setup was business as usual  would recommend other key features   it comes with an iphone charger and push pin for the sim card slot p  s  i am a t mobile user      
72,5.0,                       i ordered a red i  to replace a i   i was not expecting to be surprised by reading the reviews  it showed up in   days when i opened the box it looked like a new i  i ordered the red one it was in perfect condition no scratches no dings  dents or scuffs it looks brand new  set it up in no time every thing is working  flawlessly i ve had it a few weeks and no issues yet  will repost if anything goes wrong     
73,1.0,                       received the phone and it seemed ok at first  the ios was about   major versions old so i tried to update it  but for some reason it couldn t   long story short  after several hours of trying to fix it and a few more with apple support  it was determined that the hardware was bad  seems like this could have been determined when doing their qa  but i m guessing they don t do much if any  on top of all this after finding out that they sent me a bad phone  i had to pay for the return myself   happy ending is that i found the same exact phone for about     cheaper on another site and this one worked      
74,2.0,                       update    months after purchase and i ve lost full touch functionality of the phone  complete waste of money quite disappointed this started to happen right around the    day mark  it was too late to return and now the touch functions are barely working  wasted money  i gave   stars because the battery life is pretty good and doesn t lag      
75,5.0,                       as expected      
76,5.0,                       i m returning back to iphones once again and this is the perfect one to start with  yes the battery after i charge it in the morning it stays charged all daymy calls are clear my music is too i love the pics too  great ph     
77,5.0,                       like new  i have had this phone for   months now with no problems at all  really happy with my renewed phone it treated me like a new phone would  saved alot of money buying used and i get to use fingerprint reader which i wish apple would bring back on newer phones      
78,5.0,                       after reading some of the reviews on the reseller buyspry i was actually terrified of buying this phone  probably one of the riskiest clicks i ve had to do however  the phone arrived neatly packaged  exactly as advertised  with cable   wall charger and it looked brand new  there were a few light scratches on the screen and on the glass behind but the type of scratches that are only visible under certain angles and with lots of light   personally not a problem at all  at first glance  it looks absolutely spotless   like a new phone  battery capacity health  the you can check at settings  was at     which seems pretty good  overall  so far zero complaints  phone looks amazing   works just as good      
79,4.0,                       phone works as expected  no problem adding it to my verizon contract line  and it was in like new condition      
80,5.0,                       this is amazing  literally like i just bought it brand new  it is amazing  no glitches and works like an absolute dream   will definitely go through this seller again if necessary     
81,3.0,                       the good    the phone was delivered in a timely fashion just before christmas    it looked perfect  no physical defects the bad   the ugly    i discovered the phone came from japan where the camera sound cannot be turned off  by law  took it to the apple store  and said they couldn t do anything about it  i take a lot of photos  and the loud click is a pain  but  that was a minor detail for the price    most importantly  the phone locked up suddenly  the apple store couldn t unlock it  the only way was to wipe it clean to factory settings  lost everything that wasn t stored in the cloud  including my photos  the phone has a     gb memory  didn t want to bother with paying extra storage space in the cloud  let s hope this doesn t happen again    or else  monthly payments on a new phone may no longer look as optional           
82,5.0,                       i ve been an iphone user for the past    years  and while i love the interface and design  i do not like paying the high price for a new phone  last month  after dropping my iphone    i know i m very behind on the models  but it still worked well    i made the decision to upgrade  i love that i can use amazon renewed to find a iphone at a fraction of the price of a new one many of the reviews made me nervous about making this investment because the phones they received had some problems  since the seller hybrid it had great reviews  i felt better about taking the risk   to be noted  i initially bought a iphone  s from hybrid it  but then returned it after deciding to upgrade to an iphone    the return was easy and the seller was helpful  the phone i received was in great condition  and i had no trouble setting it up with my at t sim card  i ve been using it for the last three weeks  and i haven t run into any issues there are a few things to add  the phone came with a generic charging cord with a wall plug in  it did not come with headphones  so if you are buying an iphone    you ll have to buy bluetooth headphones or earpods with the lightning connector  which are about     on the apple site  finally  the battery health is at     according to my phone  which is expected with a refurbished phone  it does last me through the day  but something to note if you are in the market  i hope this helps      
83,1.0,                       bought this from the verizon store   i bought the phone during thanksgiving time as renewed  used it pretty much lightly as i don t make too many calls or install apps  etc  around march the phone battery stopped working and i had to keep the phone plugged in at all times to work  then  the battery completely died and phone wouldn t work even when connected  and screen got lifted  so watch out for the device   can t trust renewed devices anymore       
84,5.0,                       the phone has      battery life and zero scratches marks  the phone is perfect for my   yr old      
85,5.0,                       this phone was for a family member   their  s was on its last leg  but they didn t require the latest technology  or the price tag that goes with it   i m glad i took a chance on the refurb   the phone works great  it looked new when i took it out of the box  and i had no issues with swapping out the sim card from the old phone and getting it up and running  a great buy      
86,1.0,                       i used the phone with at t for about nine months  it worked well  when i asked at t to unlock the phone so i could use it with another carrier  at t had no record of the phone i received from this seller  thus  unless i use this phone is used only with at t  the phone is useless going forward phones advertised as at t carrier phones should fall under the general rules and conditions of what it means to have phones locked to that carrier  at t can unlock phones that are originally locked to them  apparently  mine works with at t  described as  partially unlocked  by at t reps  but cannot be unlocked unless the original carrier is identified  this seller said it s at t  at t says it s not at t should it really fall to me  the consumer  who believes  apple iphone      gb  gold   for at t  means the phone is registered to at t    to resolve this issue  a consumer can t unlock a phone  only a carrier can      
87,5.0,                       the first phone they sent me had     battery health and said it needed to be serviced  repaired  so i contacted the seller and they worked with me and exchanged it for another iphone   with      battery health and no apparent problems      
88,1.0,                       this item did not hold a charge rendering it useless  it was returned      
89,1.0,                       this phone was terrible  returned it and waiting for refund  the phone was glitching  calling people keyboard would just type randomly letters by the hundreds  couldn t open apps yet apps would open on their own  very upset      
90,2.0,                       i was not able to connect it to my plan  it should be fully unlocked  and may be it is   but we were not able to activate it had to return it      
91,3.0,                       this product came in good shape but with a completely bad battery  the phone would work until you got to around     and the  would randomly shut off  i had to buy a battery   day after i received it and it cost me another           i bought the   year warrant and paid an extra        for that  i use my phone for business and don t have time to send it in for warranty so i just paid outta pocket to prevent the inconvenience  i am always worried about buying used things online for this exact reason  with that said the phone works perfect after the new battery was installed  i will be very reluctant to buy used electronics online in the future   which was my gut feeling in the first place        
92,1.0,                       half of my calls are muffled and people cannot hear me talking      
93,5.0,                       alright so i wanted to give it some time before i wrote a review on our phone  in case we came across any problems with it   fortunately  we ve had our iphone   since december now it s january and have had zero problems with it  the phone actually came in pristine condition  no scratches or blown out distorted speaker or any other problems  i do see that there s others here that  sadly  have problems with their phone from the minute they receive it and i think it has a lot to do with the seller  before i purchased our phone i checked the different sellers and ratings reviews and ultimately we went with hybrid it  take a look for yourselves  i strongly recommend this seller for anyone looking to get one of these phones      
94,2.0,                       this phone arrived and appeared as described  like new   easily accepted our carrier sim and worked great    for   weeks   yesterday the phone suddenly died   i reached out to amazon and they connected us with apple   they tried in vain for an hour to get it working again but couldn t   ultimately amazon accepted it to return  it had the    renewed guarantee  and off it went by ups today we ve had good luck with renewed items and this may have just been a fluke   but we decided to buy a brand new apple xr phone instead      
95,5.0,                    el equipo parece salido  de f brica  lastimosamente no vino con el adaptador  para aud fonos the equipment seems to be out of the factory  unfortunately it didn t come with the headphone adapter       
96,3.0,                       its honestly a great phone  and it works well  everything about it is fine  it still has     battery capacity  the cameras are great  its very fast  the only problem is that when i got it the phone was still locked onto another carrier  my carrier is metro pcs and they told me that i would have to talk to the seller and get them to actually unlock the phone because it s still locked onto another account  this is very frustrating  hopefully i can return the phone and actually get it unlocked soon      
97,1.0,                       this should be against the law  to sell a fake iphone for      and not make it well known that it is a fake iphone is disgusting  the phones volume would cut out at random and when i try to restart it it would take hours  after a few weeks it would not read my sim card so i took it to my carrier phone store and they told me that it was not a real  shameful        
98,1.0,                       i purchased the phone and it arrived quickly  spent a great deal of time price comparing on the front end  so had been quite excited  within the first few days  the phone would randomly shut off all on it s own  not pick up wi fi  internet connection or even recognize service  this happened several times a day  it was quite irritating  would not purchase again      
99,5.0,                       despite the basic packaging  i was quite impressed with the condition of the phone  it looked brand new without a single scratch  which was one of my main concerns  when purchasing a refurbished phone  it also came with nicely packaged  headphones  aux adapter cable  and a charger  what i like the most about this purchase  was the fact that it was sim unlocked read some reviews saying it wasn t   i was able to insert my at t sim card and have it work immediately without any complications  i was able to call text people within minutes of activating the phone  i ve only had this phone for a week now and so far nothing seems to raise any red flags yet  i ll update my review if anything changes      
100,1.0,                       after i used this phone  it have some problems it will automatically restart when i use it especially charging i was scared because i have no extra money to change another phone i was bothered by this problem      
101,5.0,                       i bought this phone to replace a cheap galaxy j v which ran out of storage space after a few videos     gig vs     gig    i saw the iphone had a different size sim than the galaxy so i ordered a new sim from verizon at no cost and got it one day after i got the phone   i charged the iphone for several hours and started the activation   wouldn t activate and i talked to   or   verizon people over two days  and long waits for a tech    the last guy said he could see the phone and the sim on his system but there must be something wrong with the phone  so i sent it back and said i would try another  the people at kiss were nice and got me a different phone    both phones were in excellent shape and the second one had a nice screen protector already installed   guess what   still wouldn t activate   after over an hour wait on dec     the verizon tech said i needed to get a strong signal from a tower instead of a wifi signal   this immediately made sense to me  why didn t the other verizon techs figure this out    after a seven mile trip to a parking lot near a tower  the phone activated in about    seconds   amazing  right   not exactly   i got back home and couldn t do anything over wifi   the next morning i got to speak to a tech  right away but no solution   the next level tech told me he also lived outside of cell area and used wifi and knew the problem   guess what  i had to go back to the tower to get a strong lte signal to activate wifi   the phone works fine now and i m very happy with it   kiss gets good marks and verizon needs to know some people don t have cell service at their home      
102,1.0,                       it s definitely  buyer beware  when buying a  renewed  iphone from verizon    because verizon s iphones are not truly renewed   the last two that i have purchased from verizon have had their battery health levels fall below    within three     weeks  and two     months  respectively   one of the two displayed a  battery significantly degraded  message   what a waste of my time and amazon s refund  shipping  and return expenses   suggestion for verizon   why don t you focus your efforts on selling iphones that have acceptable levels of battery health    neveragainfromverizon     
103,4.0,                       phone almost looked new when it came  phenomenal quality      battery life  overall amazing quality be warned  these phones are sometimes manufactured in japan  and therefore the camera shutter sound never turns off when taking a picture  ever  makes it annoying in public  and is a bit of a downside      
104,1.0,                       phone was advertised as unlocked  it was not  we had to visit our carriers store  then call customer service  only to find out there was no way they could help us  charger that came with phone did not work at all  phone did have quite a few scratches  and customer support wasn t able to unlock phone or provide much help  if you buy a phone here it will just waste half a day of your life  and you will end up returning it      
105,5.0,                       i received my two phones in two days a stated with amazon prime  phone looked really good to be refurbished  normal scratches not too noticeable nothing too bad cosmetics wise  came with a charger and block piece  comes inside small amazon boxes wrapped in bubble wrap for extra protection  i had no problem logging into my icloud  i switched carriers from sprint to metro which was the reason for purchase  cdma and gsm are completely different  the phones worked just fine   the imei was clear and was not on the blacklist  sim cards were activated and put in and within    i had new service with these phones  i did take them to the store and let the rep put in the sim cards  though only been active for    hours on these phones  no complaint so far only that the battery does not hold a charge like a newer phone might   so keep a charger near  especially if you use your phone a lot during the day  overall i ll say       i m very satisfied for the price i paid      
106,5.0,                       the reviews made this seem more like a roulette thing since the iphone that i bought here works as expected  light scratches to the screen  not that many scratches in the back which is good  fingerprint reader works great  very fast  both cameras work great too  the charger that came with the phone along with other cheap ones though don t work at all  i have to use a really good quality one and it solved my problem  overall i highly recommend to buy this product if you press your luck      
107,1.0,                       i was very disappointed when getting this phone  first of all  it says it is up to date but it had a very outdated software according to the apple store and i couldn t hear out of the speaker so i had to talk to everyone on speaker  i ultimately traded in my phone at the apple store for      trade in value and got a new   plus instead  it sucks because i paid      for the phone and had it for less than a min so i was out       buyer beware i would not recommend buying from this supplier      
108,1.0,                       lovely iphone   not a scratch or dent   but  battery was completely dead and would not charge   i tried   oem chargers and the after market charger   iphone would not start without charger cable attached   must return      
109,1.0,                       the phone worked perfectly   but it had few scratches on it which they didn t mention on the description   false advertisement      
110,5.0,                       great upgrade from    no problem migrating from old phone   looks great and works better than the        
111,1.0,                       phone did not work  an account was still opened with at t  so it would not work with t mobile  phone returned  waiting on my refund      
112,5.0,                       i ordered   phones and both were in excellent condition  one looked brand new  and the other one had some tiny scuffs on the bezel  they both work really well      
113,1.0,                       this phone was horrible it wouldn t work it won t update its shuts off it won t keep service it was just a total disaster but amazon gave our refund back      no issue i love amazon i shop slot on there  i recommend amazon no matter what they got ya back     
114,1.0,                       this phone did not work with my carrier even though i was assured it would   i never hooked it up because it was not compatible with t mobile sprint   i sent it back exactly how it was sent to me  all the accessories  in absolutely perfect condition and they charged me a     restocking fee     i have been communicating back and forth where they finally said a supervisor would call me but never did  i would definitely not recommend this seller it was a terrible experience     
115,1.0,                       we purchased two of these phones  one arrived with an lcd bleed  which at least allowed us to see the problem early enough to send it back in time for a refund  please note that the problem was clearly visible as soon as the phone was turned on  it should have never been resold this way  the second phone would occasionally not connect to cellular data  a problem that got worse over time until it eventually stopped making and receiving calls altogether i cannot stress enough the frustration you will likely feel at buying a  refurbished  phone that has seemingly not undergone any refurbishing  i m sure others have had better luck of the draw  but there doesn t seem to be any quality control on what s being sent out  it is a waste of money and time  and you are better off not purchasing here      
116,5.0,                       i like  that unlike my previous iphone   that i can go all day on one charge  and also like the    g of storage  i love to have movies ready for doctors visits       
117,5.0,                       phone in good condition  had no problems getting the phone to work with att card   looking forward to using all the new features of this phone   good delivery and was better product than expected      
118,1.0,                       cell phones are like ladies  when they are young and fresh  you can t wait to play with it  you show it to your friends  take it everywhere  have some amazing times and great memories time marches onward and technologies advance  suddenly your cell phone is old and tired  once the envy of your friends  it s now a joke  you finally turn it in then there are those who buy a refurbished phone  like a milf  the phone can still provide some good times but you are only kidding yourself  the best days are gone and you will only be frustrated when it breaks down and becomes nothing more than a pain in your ass both phones i received were worn out  the first phone s camera did not work and the replacement was doa  it s best to buy a new cell phone and not waste your time buying refurbished junk      
119,4.0,                       i phone   is in good condition and works as it should  only came with the phone itself and charge cord  no plug for cord was included  shipping took longer than expected  was to be delivered       and arrived december          minimal directions on activating the phone      
120,4.0,                       it came with issues  does phone has difficulty connecting to wifi  i have to restart the phone often and that is very annoying  the phone came dirty  they didn t even bother to clean the outside of the cell that i guess that was the same poor job they did to  clean  the inside of the phone     
121,1.0,                    el tel fono pedido era de     gb y lleg  de tan solo    gb  the phone ordered was     gb and arrived only    gb        
122,5.0,                       i was skeptical about ordering a phone from this company went my daughter phone broke   but i took a chance   once i received it i called verizon and it was easy to set up  no problems and      cheaper than buying from verizon directly   where i live we can only use cdma phones so i was nervous   again worked great     
123,5.0,                       product was in perfect condition   works great  the chip was inserted and it fired right up  no complaints      
124,5.0,                       i rarely write reviews but i had to for this one  i got it as a birthday gift and it is amazing  no problem at all no scratches basically new besides packaging  came quick and is so much more affordable compare to the price on apple  would buy again  go for it if your not sure     
125,5.0,                       i have not had any issues with my new phone so far  i have been using it for about   days   getting the phone set up and all of my data moved onto it was no problem  it says that the battery has     capacity  which is within the range that the description suggested  i would order this product refurbished again  but hopefully i don t have to          
126,4.0,                       ok     
127,1.0,                       you know you are in trouble when you receive a card in the box saying to please not contact amazon if you have any problems  just contact them  the phone did not tun on for two days  when it did it randomly shuts off and restarts  the screen blacks out and when trying to get it to turn on it called     and set off emergency alarm while still blackouted screen  i do not have another phone to use and no money to wait    days after get the phone for a refund  it looks like they are just repackaging this phone and reselling t to the next sucker who orders this phone  no customer service at all      they knew was defective phone when sent      
128,1.0,                       the scratches are worse than item description  the scratches at the edges of the screen are very clearly visible at arm s length  i have requested a replacement with the extra shipping costs covered  i ll update my review if they take care of it      
129,2.0,                       aesthetically the cell phone was in good condition  i left it charging until it reached      i turned it on to set it up  in that process the cell phone felt very hot  within two hours of lasting the battery low from     to      i went to sleep and the next day the cell phone dawned with    without using it  i bought this from seller buyspry  he s been trying to call them  but i haven t been able to communicate  so i requested a refund through amazon      
130,1.0,                       this was a stolen phone          
131,1.0,                       camera was flickering battery on        total failure with ordering from this seller  now they want me to pay to resend this all the way from trinidad  ps to this seller  you represent amazon  sell people good products and stop your nonsense     
132,2.0,                       i expected so much more from apple  this is my  nd iphone and i thought it would be so much better  part of the screen reacts to touch sometimes and most of the time not  it takes quite a while to load apps and internet and the battery isn t the best either  everyone speaks so highly of these phones  but i am not convinced  i am going back to samsung as soon as possible        
133,1.0,                       description says  fully unlocked and compatible with any carrier of choice     but doesn t work with sprint so i had to return the phone      
134,5.0,                       my first iphone so far  i ve been wanting to buy these for a long time to see what all the rage is about iphones and i like it alot so far  really clean practically brand new no scratches or dents at all and i love the color and vibrant white     
135,4.0,                       amazing    i ve had my phone for a little under a month now and i love it  for such a small price it is definitely worth it  for those of you scared of buying used things  if you re not satisfied you can return it  my phone came   days early and it activated perfectlyat first my texts kept sending to my old phone but i believe that s my carriers fault regardless  i do not regret this at all         
136,2.0,                       shipping was very slow and late even though i asked seller for days to ship it  phone is decent and works so far  wireless charging doesn t work as it should      
137,5.0,                       i bought a refurbished iphone    it said that they would guarantee a     or above on the battery life  and very few scratches  i expected something between    and     battery health  with maybe a few scratches  i received an iphone    with no scratches  no cracks  and      battery life  very pleased with the product i received        recommend  thank you so much      
138,5.0,                       tammy was our go to person and resolved issue with expertise and expediency thanks much  we highly recommend this seller      
139,5.0,                       the seller was one of the most helpful and professional sellers i ve ever done business with  i had an initial problem with the serial number but as soon as i registered a complaint  the seller reached out to me within   min and kept in touch until the issue was resolved  i received another phone and everything worked out great  i d definitely use the seller  hybrid it  again      
140,4.0,                       the phone came quicker than expected  the delivery was on point  i was actually nervous about buying the phone but it is better than i expected  the only defect on the phone was a small prick where the sim card is place  it looked as though someone used something else to try and open it  as for the battery  it last for a full day because i work with my phone and always in the wifi zone  otherwise  i think it s safe to say good buy      i ve had it for almost one month now      
141,4.0,                       i bought this phone in      and i still have it  it still works perfectly  i really like it the screen only came with small scratches but that s all  the camera works so good  at first i thought it was going to be bad but it came perfectly fine so i say you buy it but if you don t want to risk then don t but i say yes it s worth it  the phone will last maybe half a day or half depends how much you use it      
142,2.0,                       everything seems ok little scratch  not bad  but for some reason i can t get texts from a couple numbers  i can send and call but nothing else   rd thing i order this week with problems  i had to review take the time wait for the stuff and now they re just asking you to send it back what s going to make me want to order anything else       
143,3.0,                       i want to like this product but the calibration or something is messed up because the camera constantly shakes  i cannot take pictures because all of them shake and come out slightly blurry  also the screen is so sensitive even when the screen is locked  i end up taking pictures while it is in my pocket  the only thing i am blaming the renewal team is the camera  the sensitive screen maybe just on me idk     
144,5.0,                       i am so so thankful i went with my gut and bought this phone  i m in love   i received it in perfect condition  not one scratch and battery life was at      there was the standard charger with it as well  i immediately went to metro where i paid     and spent about    minutes transferring the phone onto my account  everything went seamlessly  the phone works amazing   there s not been one issue with it  i would buy this again and again      
145,3.0,                       when i first received this phone it was surprisingly in good shape  the problem started after i put in my sim card and transferred everything from my previous phone    although i put the sim card in this new phone it would constantly say  no sim card  which meant i also didn t have any service and it did this a couple of times and it annoyed me     a way that i would resolve it each time is that i would turn the phone off completely and then turn it back on and it worked temporarily until recently when i did it for the last time and it hasn t showed that for a couple of days now  another problem that i recently started having with this phone is that i just now noticed that it stopped charging past         no matter how long it is plugged in for it doesn t charge higher than     anymore and i am so annoyed with this phone    with these troubles that i am having already i might as well just go to apple and get one of theirs   but everything else seems to be working fine but i have a feeling that when it approaches the amazon return deadline that i m sure i will encounter more problems      
146,5.0,                       i wanted a cheaper iphone with a lot of storage  it stinks to not have the newest version and best camera  but i love it      
147,3.0,                    la bater a se descarga f cilmente a lo largo del d a incluso dejando el celular en modo de avi n  con un uso moderado es necesario cargar la bater a antes de las    horas  le llegu  a cambiar la bater a y sigue haciendo lo mismo  the battery is easily discharged throughout the day even leaving the cell phone in airplane mode  with moderate use it is necessary to charge the battery before    hours  i got to change her battery and she s still doing the same thing        
148,4.0,                       this is the first iphone i bought for a family member they liked the phone but once again the charger broke in half the first day the tried to use it i want these sellers to know that whenever you buy a phone the charger is jus as important as the phone i was blessed because i already had a iphone charger      
149,5.0,                       super fast delivery ordered on wednesday received phone on thursday  iphone   with minor wear to the device  fully operational battery  fully functional phone  extremely satisfied with the phone provided          
150,5.0,                       i just got it   days ago so i don t really know  but so far so good  battery is       physically it looks absolutely new  if you look reeeeeally close there might be   minimal scratches on the back  but you really have to look closely  it also came with original charger  not sure about the cable but the charger yes seams like a great deal      
151,1.0,                       i bought this phone because it was specifically unlocked to at t   when i received it  it wasn t unlocked  and tech support wanted me to go through a youtube video which prompted me to download an app that i didn t want or need   unbelievable   i don t have time for this      
152,5.0,                       i don t know battery life yet because i just received it but i am very impressed  it looks brand new and is great      
153,4.0,                       if you do not have tech skills or trouble following instructions    be prepared to send another     to have it set up  if your an android person   be prepared for some headaches getting to know the ios      
154,5.0,                       this has been the first time i tried buying a refurbished phone  and i was a bit nervous about  but i have been really happy about it i received the phone  and it looks as good as new  no scrathes etc  it did not come with the original charger from apple  but that was not really a problem i have not noticed anything not functioning  or being slightly off  battery life seems great  i have had no technical problems with it  i also did not have any problems with connecting to my sim card and phone company  i have t mobile i think it is a great way to save some money on what is already a pretty expensive phone brand  and i can recommend doing this      
155,1.0,                       when i got the phone  i was disappointed  but not surprised by the     capacity battery inside  i expected i d be taking it in to apple for a battery replacement  anyway  but  when i took it to apple  they couldn t replace the battery  they showed me pictures  where there was standing water and corrosion inside  needless to say  i was shocked  not only did i have the phone in a waterproof case  i only had it for a few days  and never had it near water  i immediately contacted amazon  who contacted the seller  the seller asked if i d submerged the phone  i couldn t believe it  after a few days of emailing  they agreed to a refund  i asked for a different phone with a full capacity battery as compensation  i use the phone for work  i missed out on money  they said they couldn t oblige that  but  they did refund me promptly after reviewing the water damaged phone      
156,1.0,                       i did not notice when i bought it because i have kept using att network  however  i went to another country  and tried to use a local usim  then i found that this phone is locked  i contacted att to unlock the phone  but i kept failing  i don t know what happened this phone  but i had to buy another phone to the local usim i contacted att to unlock the phone  but they said  the imei provided is not a valid at t imei       
157,3.0,                       sold under amazon renewed by olympus the screen was defective   amazon would do nothing to help and olympus only offered to refund the product at my shipping expense   so there is no amazon renewed guarantee other than you can get a refund   spend hours with customer service with no resolution update   the seller now has offered to pay return shipping after brining it to their attention therefore i have improved the rating      
158,2.0,                       it says in brand new sealed box but wasn t  it was like a generic no brand cell phone prepaid cheap cellphone box  not brand new at all  it was setup and had scratches on the screen  looked good sure but not brand new in a sealed box like they claim      
159,1.0,                       my   iphone purchase did not come with headphones  on the description it mentions headphones  the charges are not the same either      
160,4.0,                       not satisfied with the battery capacity  arrived with     life remaining  also took    days before it was able to receive texts from android device  carrier claims they did nothing to rectify  not sure i believe them  condition of the phone is excellent  other than the battery      
161,2.0,                       i love the iphone   itself  i got one on release  this one was meant to replace a larger screen phone that i couldn t get used to   but unfortunately this  renewed  phone wasn t up to par  the description says minimal to no visible wear  however  the inch long gouge smack in the middle of the screen says otherwise  there are tons of micro scratches all over the screen visible when held at an angle to light  but the gouge is way too distracting and obvious all the time  screen on or off  even looking straight on  so unfortunately i had to return it  i should have known the price was too good to be true      
162,2.0,                       i m very disgruntled and disappointed my boyfriend bought this phone for me as a gift and of course i loved it  i got the phone set up and started using it and realised it had some issues  whenever i m on a call i can barely hear the person on the other end but they can hear me clearly and there is an echo sometimes when i m talking  it has a few scratch  everything else works perfect      
163,5.0,                       i returned it because i m used to the size of an iphone   plus  but the phone was flawless  it even came with the sticker on the screen  like it was brand new  the packaging left nothing to be desired  it was    gb as advertised and gave no problems  i just forgot to notice that it was an   and not an   plus  but that s on me  the product still deserves five stars      
164,5.0,                       great deal  the phone arrived very fast and in excellent condition  the listing said  good  condition and that it may have some minor scratches  etc  but it looks brand new  and works very well  it s about    times faster and has much better battery life than the iphone   that it replaced      
165,1.0,                       i had to get a new battery for this phone becaue it would not stay on  the phone was out of warrany and i do not expect the seller to repair this becaue i did not purchase the extended warranty  when i took the phone to get a new battery they siad its missing parts and the battery is just flopping around  it had one screw holding the internal parts in  the company said they will not work on it because it was so badly refrubished that i will have continual issues with it  i contacted the seller to try and reslove the issue but they have not contaced me back  i am stuck with a dead phone that is useless  avoid this seller        
166,4.0,                       phone came in perfect physical condition  no scratches  looks brand new  did take a bit to get it set up as the phone didn t come with the newest software and it wouldn t restore from the backup on my old phone without a software update  battery life says it s at     capacity but so far it has been great  well worth the price      
167,1.0,                       is not only scratches  the paint is getting out very disappointed      
168,5.0,                       great phone   i generally don t write reviews  i needed a new phone but couldn t  afford a new phone price   i looked  online for  weeks for a refurbished phone at a good price with good reviews i love this phone   it functions great and  it looks brand new   i am very satisfied      
169,5.0,                       really nice    it seems a brand new iphone    out of the box   at first  i wasn t sure whether i should buy or not because of there are a lot of negative reviews for this particular phone along with its seller  vendor    thus far  i have no issue with the iphone     of course  all consumers would be so cautious when he she is looking for a refurbished used phone   if i were to pick one minor thing that this phone should have is that  no place for an ear pieces    other than this particular one is missing  i would highly recommend to others to consider if you re looking for a refurbished iphone      
170,5.0,                       at first i wasn t sure what i was going to get i had a  s for a long time and didn t want to get into a contract to get a new phone getting a used from from amazon has worked great it s just like getting a new one but not having to pay the price tag  not a scratch on it works great and came with a wall charger and cord     
171,5.0,                       received my iphone within a few days of ordering it   there is not a scratch or mark on it anywhere   it presents as new   had to take it to the sprint store to get a sim card since the one in my old iphone  s wouldn t work   they had it up and running in a matter of minutes   called sprint to see if i could get the phone unlocked   again  in a matter of minutes they had that done   so  now i have a perfect iphone    unlocked and performing flawlessly on the sprint system   with it now being unlocked  i can transfer to any other cdma carrier that i choose   battery capacity is     which is excellent   fingerprint reader works perfectly   just purchased another one of these for my wife      
172,1.0,                       i dislike that it is advertised as unlocked  when in fact it was not  they did accept my return and apologized      
173,4.0,                       i love that amazon  or whoever they sub this out to  gave a warranty  that was one of the main reasons i purchased   plus cost was cheaper than best buy   not sure if this has to do w the phone  but my email is slow to load   i also dont like the fact that i cant plug normal headset in without adapter  but that is apples issue   overall the phone was a good decision to purchase and i have no problems     i was forced to buy newer cause iphone   doesnt upgrade anymore to latest ios      
174,5.0,                       works great for my daughter  we haven t tried hooking her up to cell service yet  she has it for texting and facetime  so far works great     
175,5.0,                       i ve been using a  s with   gb for   years and it finally died for good  so  i upgraded to the   and let me tell you this is huge upgrade for me  it s the exact same feel and look but better  the display is nicer  fingerprint scanner is faster  and the over speed is better  when phone came it s actually looked brand new  no scraps or scratches or worn down buttons  you forget that it was a refurbished phone  so far       for me      
176,1.0,                       touch screen way too small did not activate phone     
177,5.0,                       fantastic used iphone    works on verizon without any problems  i was skeptical  highly recommended  be careful because some of the reviews seem to end up on multiple variations of listings  i recommend you double check to make sure the description of the specific phone you order specifies clearly that it will work with your carrier      
178,3.0,                       everything about the phone is fine  the one thing i needed most was being able to make better phone calls and that s what s wrong with it  the microphone is all static and makes it super hard to hear my voice  i need that part for my job and i m out of money to spend on another one  going to have to go get that part fixed  but everything else is pretty good  nothing seems to be wrong with it besides that      
179,3.0,                       phone has average battery life and price was about average   phone was in good working order when received  however needed to replace screen recently  no visible damage was present but display stopped working  not sure if there was warranty on this purchase but couldn t needed to have repaired quickly so i didn t have time to find out      
180,1.0,                       the phone was not able to activate after trying two sim cards  had to return it      
181,1.0,                       literally ordered this on          received by        beautiful phone  no scratches and just   small light spots on the screen  my daughter was able to plug it up and we took it to the be official registred with our phone carrier  phone didn t hold a charge long  but we thought this was due to the phone needing to be charged  just arrived that day    by the next day we realized that the phone would not stay on without being on the charger  tried another iphone charger  not the one that came with the phone   phone stayed on while off the charger  until you pressed the screen   instantly cut off   took it to the apple store for what i thought might be a battery replacement  but after diagnostics the problem is the device won t power on the logic board  brain   so the device simply won t power on correctly  recommends new phone   wtf now i have to send this back for a refund   there is no way that this company couldn t have known this if apple picked up on it in    minutes      
182,1.0,                       i should be able to give zero stars  this is a scam  the phone i got is faulty and the charger never worked  i have to spend money to get it fixed and i have to buy a charger  i am reluctant to spend money to get it fixed because it might still not work  i am stuck with a useless piece of crap      
183,1.0,                       had a russian  rd party software or permissions something one it  my itunes was high jacked  had to reset the phone and remove the permissions ans reset again     
184,5.0,                       i was skeptical after seeing both wonderful and poor reviews of refurbished phones  we are thrilled with our purchase  it looks brand new  appears to have a good battery life  and connected to our carrier with no issues siri was difficult to set up  but everything else has been a great deal      
185,1.0,                       this phone at very graphic pornography in favorites  the seller did not clean the phone  the phone was a gift for my   year old daughter who came across the disgusting porn  her father and i are sooo disappointed in this product and the seller   the seller should be barred from selling on amazon     
186,5.0,                       had no trouble at all in the setup and phone came with      battery health and no scratches or cosmetic damages  some reviews say their phone was gsm only and did not work with their carrier  be sure you check which phone you are getting because some did not say fully unlocked  i ordered the silver and all i did was switch my sim card over and everything was there  didn t even have to contact my carrier     
187,5.0,                       it came in perfect condition no scratches nothing i checked the battery percentage came at a    percent which i was shocked to see when i got it it was an easy setup it was unlocked works perfectly i m very happy with this purchased     
188,5.0,                       this phone was a christmas gift   it works flawlessly so far and it looks brand new      
189,5.0,                       looks and works like a new phone  if you don t needs all the latest i phone doo dads  and i don t it s a great value     
190,5.0,                       pretty much like new  i was quite skeptical given its amazon and one step removed from the wild west but the device is just about like new  a strong battery  no scratches  everything functions well and it even came with a tempered glass screen protector  i m very impressed with the renewed program      
191,5.0,                       so far a awesome phone     
192,5.0,                       excellent phone with battery life more than      so far all functions are working great  this seller did great job of refurbished iphone   i would buy again from this seller      
193,3.0,                       battery health was    great for a phone that was released in       only fault is that it has more scratches than i would consider acceptable      
194,5.0,                       buy this one  everything should work this well      
195,5.0,                       always afraid of refurbished products  but not bad at all wife hasn t complained yet lol its been over a year      
196,1.0,                       package arrived on time  but the phone was not unlocked as advertised     
197,1.0,                       the phone i purchased proved to be unusable as it was stolen and blacklisted from network use  when i contacted support  they simply did not acknowledge that the phone was stolen  and after three days simply asked if i d received shipping labels to send it back  which i took as a tacit admission that they are well aware many of their renewed phones are from unscrupulous sources  i never actually received the shipping labels to send it back anyways   i strongly advise anyone reading this review to head over to another seller because this one has not proven very dependable  at least for me  hopefully in the future kiss electronics can find a way to take better care of their future customers than i was taken care of  because this transaction could hardly have gone more wrong for me and i m incredibly disappointed      
198,5.0,                       this was my first iphone purchase  i was a little worried about purchasing a used one  however  the phone is a gem  in excellent condition  good battery  takes great pictures  i like it so much i m purchasing another used iphone for my granddaughter   i should have done this a long time ago      
199,3.0,                       i have a love hate relationship with apple  i will not buy a new product from them ever  why  they brick phones with updates  that s shady  they smile while they do it too  so  well it matters because that makes me a repeat customer of these second hand phones  prices seem to be set competitively so that doesn t affect my choice of where my cash goes  what does have some weight in my decision making is customer service  i pay the asking price i get a device as advertised  simple enough right  you would be surprised or maybe you wouldn t  the local places offering these devices have people behind the counters that don t seem to get what good customer service is  so     okay  get to the point right  i got a phone that works as advertised at a good price and i didn t have to deal with anyone so that s a plus  however  the appearance of the item was ummm      acceptable had they not been sloppy in a weak attempt to cover up a blemish on the surface of the screen with a very cheap slapped on at the last second screen protector  the peeled backing of the protector was discarded into the corner of the box looking confused and i m sure feeling slightly used have i mentioned it prior to this post  nope  it really wouldn t matter had it not been so obvious of a weak attempt to cover something that wasn t as expected  customer service guys  don t just don t  will i buy another when the time comes  yup  whatta ya do  smile and count your blessings these days i guess  it could always be worse      
200,1.0,                       screen with small broken and the battery life not work  i m not happy because the ad didn t say anything about the battery life and the little broken one on the screen     
201,1.0,                       i returned the phone already  there was a small crack in the back which it did say might be minor cosmetic wear so that s okay i guess  but the reason i only gave one star is because i thought the phone was at t locked  but after talking to apple for an hour and talking to at t for an hour i came to find out the phone was cricket locked and that was the reason why my sim card wasn t being accepted super frustrating situation to find out that was the case     
202,3.0,                       battery dont last  and also problem with sound  my wife has to use speakers or headphones to talk all the time  otherwise she wound hear nothing        
203,5.0,                       everything ok     
204,3.0,                       so far i m happy with my new iphone    with one exception  it came with a non compatible charger  how am i supposed to charge up a brand new phone with the wrong charger  good thing i had my existing iphone   charger  my point is  if they say they re going to send you a compatible charger  then send one  then i found out the hard way that my sim card in my iphone   is not compatible with my iphone    and this phone did not come with a sim card  i suggest you read the product description thoroughly before you decide to purchase      
205,5.0,                       there were a few small blemishes on the back of the phone that were only noticeable if you look really close   otherwise no scratches  dent  or anything else customers mentioned on either of the two phones that i ordered   it came with a real apple charger not a knockoff and the phone itself worked perfectly   i saved      over buying a new phone and am super happy      
206,2.0,                        i bought this for my son to be placed on my current verizon network plan     so  ok  let me start by saying that i received the phone via   day prime shipping  phone came in a generic box  but sufficient for transport  it included the charger and  ft charging cable  nothing else  unboxed  the phone was in excellent cosmetic condition  not a single scratch anywhere  i powered it on  the display was beautiful and worked as it should  at that point i ran thru the setup and got the phone all setup for my son  its his b day present      then i took the phone to verizon store and had them put a verizon sim in it for activation and to be added to my current verizon plan     well guess what    this phone is a model a      and it is only gsm carrier compatible  not cdma  which is what verizon is     but yet  this phone was advertised as   for verizon    which is the only reason i went ahead and bought it  the verizon models are a       a      so i have given the review   stars because of the great cosmetic  great camera and fully functional condition   but because they lied  and did not send me what i purchased  a phone for verizon networks   i do feel that this is unacceptable that tey are allowed to advertise one thing  then send you another  where i come from we call that a big fat lie    and i do not put up with liars  therefore i  reporting themfor false advertisement and hopefully they will be kicked off of amazon     
207,5.0,                       as expected  the battery was not at      capacity but it was higher than expected at     there s practically no scratches on the back or front of the phone and everything seems to be in excellent working order i did not expect a charger or screen protector to come with the purchase but it did  the screen protector was already in place so i didn t have to use the one i bought and i will be saving the charger the phone arrived with in case i need it later this was listed as a fully unlocked iphone and i believe it has arrived as such  it will definitely work for the carrier i initially intended  which is cricket i believe my little sister has a step up from this phone  the   plus  and she s still paying for her phone through the provider  i ve never bought a refurbished phone before this so i m glad it worked out  if anything happens within the next    days before the amazon warranty expires i ll be sure to update  definitely would buy the protection plan in addition to the phone  as accidents do happen      
208,5.0,                       my sister and i pitched in to get this for my brother to replace his  iphone     jkjk    iphone  s  but still      
209,5.0,                       iphone didn t come in original packaging and with original accesses  which was expected  had couple very minor scratches  which is expected as well  it was fully unlocked  i have tested it   imei was not reported lost stolen ether  overall it s quite nice and for a good price      
210,1.0,                       bought it for my wife and she is pissed  this phone is not unlocked as it says in the description  took it to the apple store and they were unable to do anything with it  they said it is probably a stolen phone that still has a balance with tmobile  will be returning for a refund      
211,1.0,                       siri does not work and causes serious crashes   i can use the home button for anything but siri   when i use it for voice text or reminders  the phone will do one function and then go into vapor lock  requiring several reboots and a timeout  power down  for at least    minutes to work again   in the past i depended on siri a lot  so it has been a big problem  and then i missed my    day guarantee window to get the problem resolved   know why   because i didn t have siri to remind me to get it done in time   this has been a sad waste of           
212,5.0,                       the iphone   is incredible   all the reviews do not do it justice   i would highly recommend it to anyone      
213,2.0,                       worked   months before the bottom half of screen wouldn t respond  no response by seller on email  stay away from refurbs        
214,5.0,                       phone came perfectly working as expected  very nice to come with a charger and i dont mind that it doesnt have a headphone jack adapter  nothing wrong with the phone software wise  but there do seem to he quite a grea amount of scratches on the screen itself that are pretty shallow but still a lot for a renewed phone  you dont really notice them but i hope no one else gets a somewhat marked up phone like i did  besides that i love the phone and recommend this product if you need a cheap alternative to a pretty relevant iphone in       highly recommend     
215,1.0,                       i have never left a bad review   we own two businesses and i get the impact that reviews could have on a company   it came with a charger and that charger is the only charger the phone worked on   my    year old daughter saved all year for this      iphone     it lasted     months   we went on vacation and she forgot her charger   by the way  it was still in warranty when we left for vacation   her phone would not work with any other iphone charger that we had   i do not know much about the mechanical part of phones other than how to operate them  we went to a technician on vacation thinking it was the battery  battery was fine  charge port was fine   he said the chip was bad on the mother board and to fix it would be significant   the technician said the seller knew this phone had a problem and sold it anyway   amazon contacted seller  seller emailed me it s   weeks out of warranty go to a repair shop   do not buy from this seller   absolutely horrible      
216,4.0,                       the speaker and blue tooth did not work  had to return  the return process experience with buyspry was easy and efficient  i decided to get a refurbished iphone x      
217,5.0,                       i finally had to replace my iphone se after i botched a shattered screen replacement  i m not the type to buy into the latest model phone and i also knew that i liked touchid  seeing that the series   was the last to use the feature  i bit the bullet and upgraded  not having the    mm jack anymore didn t bother me as much as i thought it would  it shipped promptly and now i m enjoying a iphone   that works like new  but cost me way less  thanks      
218,5.0,                       i bought this for christmas for my daughter  phone came in excellent condition  no scratches  all i had to do was take out her sims card from her old phone and put it in the new phone and set it up  so far no issues with the phone  can hear great on phone calls      
219,1.0,                       received phone  phone does not work  called customer service and was given the run around  buyer beware      
220,1.0,                       this phone did not work  it did turn on the first day and it overheated within   hours  the phone had a crack and after the first day the phone wouldn t  turn off and the calibration was off  it couldn t  read the password  to get into the phone  i will never buy a phone from this company again      
221,5.0,                       couldn t tell it was refurbished      
222,5.0,                       i was hesitant to order bc of how long it said it would take to arrive  however it arrived in less than a week  a whole week earlier than expected   i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the phone  not one single scratch on the screen  rear glass surface  or camera lens  there were some small surface scratches on the paint close to the camera lens  but that is to be expected with a refurbished phone  other than that  it was in perfect condition  it is fully operational  and took the at t sim card that i had when i first tried it  where i m located  verizon is the way to go bc at t service sucks around here  when my verizon sim arrived from straight talk  i popped it in and called the customer service line  she worked her magic and paired the phone s ime number with the verizon sim  and after about    minutes it was working perfectly on the verizon sim  so when they say all carriers  it actually works on both at t and verizon carriers also  i wasn t even expecting a new cord and charger  but there it was in the box  i was also expecting to have to go find a paperclip to install my sim  but low and behold they included the sim removal tool too  for a    gb phone that is unlocked on all carriers  i m extremely impressed  the battery had about     capacity  which is great too i m excited to have a shiny new phone  and i didn t have to pay an arm and a leg to one of the big cell companies or sign and contract to get it  i m all about not signing cell contracts these days  so thank you for having great quality phones for purchase  i will purchase from them again in the near future when it s time for me to upgrade once again     
223,1.0,                       be careful  even if you buy this phone you will never be able to trade it in  even with at t  don t be fooled and end up with        paper weight      
224,5.0,                       although the iphone did not come in traditional apple packaging  rest assured that it is the real deal  i have had no problems with mine and am glad i saves a few hundred dollars buying a refurbished phone      
225,1.0,                       ad clearly states fully unlocked and after corresponding with breed  it is not  said the ad was wrong and they would contact amazon to fix it or take it down  very disappointed as we already paid for it  and ordered a case and screen protector  now have to go through the hassle of returning  bait and switch in my opinion      
226,1.0,                       the iphone   had little cosmetic wear  it looked very good  the problem was that the earpiece of the phone was barely audible  if you went to speaker phone it worked fine  i called the seller and they claimed all phones were fully tested  i do not agree  they said return it to amazon      
227,1.0,                       purchase a refurb from them it was completely crap  first thing i notice camera horrible scratched  phone than wouldn t turn on for an hour why on the charger  when i finally got on the home button worked intermittently and than finally straw was the phone wouldn t keep charging  would charge some than i have fake play for a while for charge again  only got to charge to         
228,5.0,                       this phone was exactly what i needed  clean imei  unlocked  and untied to the previous owner s apple id  there were some wear and tear on the screen and the edges  and the battery was at     capacity left  however  for the price i can t complain      
229,1.0,                       i got the phone and it looked great nothing is wrong with the phones software or anything but when i went to get it activated couldn t even activate  the guy showed me his screen and it said  phone is not elegable on this network   and when you checked the phone to see what the carrier would be it said it was sprint  customer doesn t fuckkng exist so i m just returning and getting my money back dont buy this      
230,3.0,                       i ordered   iphone   s from this vendor at a good price the phones i received work well  but after using them a while we discovered that we were unable to disable the rather loud camera shutter sound   this is apparently a  feature  of japanese market iphones due to local laws   sure enough  when we find the model code in the settings  these are japanese models  even though we are in the u s there was no indication that we would receive foreign model phones in the listing  nor how they may differ from us distributed phones   the listing indicates that the phones are  for at t   which i believe is a u s  only network provider this is somewhat annoying      
231,1.0,                       i took this phone to sprint and the phone was unable to locate any service  the customer service agent informed me that the phone had internal issues that could only be resolved the manufacture itself   not even the apple mac store was unable to help      
232,5.0,                       this is a great product that arrived very timely and looks great       
233,5.0,                       this was my husbands first time getting a iphone and he said he wasn t getting calls  i contacted the seller and they agreed to exchange it for us  when my husband got home he s a truck driver  i asked to see the phone  long story short is was on do not disturb  great phone and excellent customer service         
234,5.0,                       very nice phone  came almost brand new  it has a very small scratch on the screen but i can t even tell it s there  no scratches on back or anywhere else  it was fully unlocked and works well with my service   cricket wireless  i upgraded from a  s and my only complaint is the battery life not being much better than the  s  however i know batteries tend to die down with age  the phone does charge pretty fast  came with its own charger  and it works perfectly  would buy it again     
235,1.0,                       phone constantly drops calls  i wind up calling people back   or   times to complete a conversation  my wife calls i answer and it hangs up again   or   times   phone sucks         
236,2.0,                       i had this phone for about   month  it was working really well besides for the fact that it had issues charging   i was using the supplied cord  now the phone wont charge at all  even trying to charge wirelessly with other cords and trying to hard reset  it is totally dead and now i have to try to figure out how to fix it because i now have no phone during quarantine      
237,1.0,                       i ordered the phone as a christmas present and it arrived looking brand new  however  the sound did not work  she couldn t hear the person on the other end of the phone unless it was on speaker  i requested an exchange instead of refund  within   days  i had the  nd phone in hand and it was in pristine condition but it would not read her sim card  i took the phone to at t thinking it was a sim card issue  however  it was a device issue  so while in at t  i just chose a brand new phone to save myself the hassle of trying to get a working  renewed  one through amazon  i am still waiting for my refund      
238,5.0,                       so far great phone  little issue with volume control but resolved now  seller is great and will buy from seller again      
239,1.0,                       the screen is detached and out of square from the body of the phone  i returned it  poor quality products      
240,1.0,                       this was supposed to be an upgrade over my samsung j   the phone runs smooth  the camera and the speakers are a slight upgrade  however  the user interface annoys me   this isn t my first iphone  the whole bluetooth headphones is a lesser experience and finally the battery  this phone dies in     hours  it s incredibly inconvenient and a little stressful  i think it s just the quality the provider sold me  it says in the battery menu that the phone can only hold     of the maximum charge  i am for sure not giving apple another     to change the battery to make it slightly better  once again  who would pay almost      for a phone that dies in     hours  very poor quality  i will gladly keep my old phone and take my money back  update  within the first    hours it randomly turned off and when i turned it back on i had to reboot it to get service back      
241,5.0,                       sorry for my first review i mistook you for the other charlatans  great doing serious business with you  prompt  great quality and trustworthy  completely satisfied nothing like the seller before this      
242,5.0,                       the phone came with a glass screen protector on it  didn t come with headphones but came with charger  the battery lasts a long time  the phone is fast  and it looks new  haven t had any problems so far       
243,1.0,                       so i returned it w in the    days and the screen cracked a tiny bit in shipping it back for repairs so they just sent it back without fixing the mic   so i said fine  i ll use the warranty to get the mic and screen fixed and they said there is no warranty   wtf      
244,1.0,                       the description claimed that it would work on any network and specifically listed sprint   when i took it to the sprint store to get a sim card and get the phone activated they ran the imei and said it would not work on their network as it was gsm and not cdma i was disappointed that there was no selection for cdma in the product options would not recommend as you may not get a phone that will work on your network      
245,1.0,                       iphone came locked  we took it to t mobile who couldn t do anything for us  we then took it to apple  who offered to bypass the code  as they were working to bypass  the phone wouldn t connect to the usb port  the apple genius takes out a cleaner and starts unpacking gunk from the charging port  so  that was the moment i decided that we were sending this back  it was locked  it was packed with lint  it would not charge  and it has a visible scratch  so much for careful refurbishing      
246,1.0,                       i want to return this phone asap and i want a refund or another phone with a credit  i have waited for days for this phone  just for it not to work    the phone does not works  it is not unlocked like the description says        the screen is gone out completely  this is unacceptable  you call this satisfactory customer service but this phone is not satisfying         i am very unhappy        
247,1.0,                       bought this renewal product as a gift  it came in   days  nov    to nov     but item is not as the description  it was advertised as battery exceed      this product will have a battery which exceeds     capacity relative to new  but it was exactly at     which means i have to replace a new battery eventually which costs another           the screen freezes off a lot of time and one one point  only the home button works  i have to do hard reset to make it coming back to usual  trying to call customer services but no one available  emailing them is no help  i regret to buy this  now i have to take time to return plus i need to find a different one in   days  horrible experience     
248,5.0,                       exactly what i was hoping for  great condition barely any scratches  screen protector and case were included    what else could you ask for  i d buy from this seller again      
249,1.0,                       the advertisement that appeared in the website is false  this item is locked  it is not according to the description  i have been searching several ways to unlock this item  and anyone of them  has resolved the problem  this is a real fraud  i am really upset and disappointed of this purchase  i need a refund  the dammit deal or problem is  i do not live in united state  i was taking vacation in florida   weeks ago  and i decided to make the purchase  trusting in the dammit description of the iphone      
250,2.0,                       everything else was seemingly fine except the battery  the battery drains very quickly  confirmed that battery was degraded worse than the     advertised  had to replace battery to continue using the phone apple said the phone is not eligible for apple care      
251,4.0,                       this phone works great refurbished  the only complaint is the battery life  only     max left after its original use   but all things considered  this phone was a fantastic value  works great  and i can deal with needing to charge it once a day  probably still cheaper to replace the battery than try to buy the same phone brand new      
252,5.0,                       this was a xmas gift for my daughter and man  if i didn t know better i d think it was brand new  mint condition  i highly recommend this seller and product     
253,5.0,                       coming from a person that owned an iphone   for almost   years  this phone is an absolute unit  i love it s interface  the remarkable speed  and the impeccable battery life  i expected this phone to come with a scratch or two or at least an     battery life but it came with zero scratches and a      battery life  definitely worth the purchase  it also came with a pin to manually switch over my sim card from my old phone to this one  fully unlocked already as well      
254,1.0,                    por favor su ayuda  el celular que les compre  enciende pero no se ve nada en la pantalla es una pena que hago   lo lleve a la tienda de aqui y me quieren cobrar    solo para revisarlo    por favor diganme que hago  como hago  please help  the phone you buy from them turns on but nothing can be seen on the screen  it s a shame i do    i took him to the store here and you want to charge me    just to check it out    please tell me what to do  how do i do        
255,5.0,                       purchased two rose gold iphone   s from the company trademore  the phones arrived in two days and in great condition  everything seems to work as it should including the cameras  speaker  microphone  and touchscreen  the battery health is above     on both phones  which is great for a used refurbished phone  there is no cosmetic damage to be noted  and all functions worked upon installing my sim card trademore sends the phones in their own packaging and includes a verizon wall pack with an   ft usb to lightning cable  inside the packaging included a flyer that ensures a    day warranty  i m pleased with the phones and would buy from this company again      
256,4.0,                       arrived in a verizon box which threw me since i didn t order it from verizon   i m on at t  so i wasn t even sure if it was going to be fully unlocked for at t  not happy with the confusion but the product is fine and it works      
257,1.0,                       the sim card tray was extremely hard to get out   then i realized my phone came in with     battery life   i didn t realize that a battery should be replaced at    percent   had i realized  i would have passed on this seller   refurbished is one thing   bad battery life is another   they were pretty arrogant in their email   so beware   your phone could come almost needed a replaced battery my sister bought a refurbished phone from amazon from another seller for around the same price and her battery life is       so i d recommend shopping around      
258,5.0,                       first time buying a refurb phone  daughter needed a replacement for her old one that looked as if someone had taken a sledge hammer to it  how does a phone get like that  works great  delivered with a good battery  it was at or very near      life  no dings or scratches  with    gb of storage i will never hear again about running out of storage  came with used protective glass installed which had a few chips in the corner but no big deal  have not got to it yet  but easily replaced  also bought a silicome cover and replacement glass    months  so far  so good  could have saved an extra     if i had waited until after the christmas season      
259,2.0,                       when i received the phone  the packaging looked like someone ran over it with a tank  i ve had this phone for about   months and this phone has randomly shut off and kicks me off my wifi more times than i can count  the phone also keeps telling me to get a data upgrade which i ve never had happen to me before when i ve bought an iphone on amazon  i was trying to save money by buying a phone here  but i was just severely disappointed with this brand new phone acting like i ve had it for   years      
260,5.0,                       my husband is very happy with birthday present      
261,5.0,                       based on reviews i ve read  it seems that refurbished phones are hit and miss  and that makes sense  not all used phones were treated equally our experience with this renewed iphone   has been great   the phone really is in excellent condition  works like new  looks almost new  but costs half the price  battery came with     battery life  which is still an  a  in my book i d recommend giving it a try  we are very satisfied with the phone      
262,5.0,                       no complaints  this refurbished iphone   was like new  not a scratch on it   downloaded thru bluetooth iphone to iphone in minutes  this is my first refurbished iphone  i d do it again      
263,4.0,                       overall is great just like new except for one issue  mail app somehow still shows as the previous user s name or initial when i lightly tapped on  mail  app icon  it prevents me wanting to use  mail  app  can someone give me instructions on how to fix this  thanks      
264,5.0,                       i bought from buyspry and i could not be happier  phone looks and responds like it s brand new  i have a safe link sim card and i used to have a samsung phone  i popped in the sim card and it worked immediately  in the box i got a charger cord and a charger box along with something to take out the sim card tray  they may not be what you get in a regular iphone box but it all works great  also it did come in a generic smartphone box  i definitely do not regret this purchase  phone absolutely looks brand new      
265,4.0,                       i purchased this phone to use overseas on small trip  while i was on the airport decided to try and use it  put a t mobile sim and it didn t work  worst of all it was sunday and the seller kanga supply wasn t available i arrived at my destination country on sunday   put a local sim card and voil   it s working later i asked a friend and he told me this happens a lot with us carrier locked phones which at some point get unlocked  they don t work with us sim cards phone is working fine after   days and is in great aesthetic conditions  haven t tried headphones because it didn t come with any accesories besides a generic charger and sim tool i think the seller or amazon should put this warning on the product page      
266,2.0,                       i had people complain that they couldn t hear me when i called them  so i started using my bluetooth headset and all was good   then i found i could use speaker phone mode but it didn t work well  finally i took it to the genius bar and it turned out the microphones on the bottom of the phone are dead   repair cost is       which is the cost of the phone needless to say i am not going to buy from this vendor again      
267,1.0,                       the phone arrived with a scratch in a corner  when contacted the response was  our devices are sold as renewed which is supposed to have minor scratches   so be aware that your device may arrive in a similar condition      
268,2.0,                       sadly they had sent a phone that was defective and would shut down randomly  with research i found this was a hardware problem in some iphones  i wish they would have done more extensive testing on their products before shipping to customers  they provided a full refund in a timely manner which was nice      
269,5.0,                       i bought this phone for my daughter and she is very happy with it  everything works as it should and it looks brand new      
270,1.0,                       iphone   did not work  i took to t mobile and they said my sim card was fine  took to apple store and they said was probably a bad antenna       to fix  i sent it back asking for a full refund we will see what happens      
271,5.0,                       i have bought several products from amazon that have been renewed  it s a great way to save money and still get a good product  this iphone was no different      
272,3.0,                       i was most disappointed   they left an iphone on my front porch   my husband was home   no phone or ring   it was little enough to go in our locked mail box   or require a signature  or ring the bell   something    it was inboxed   no apple charging cord or plug   the screen ha many little scratches and is cloudy   won t but from this complaint again   the reviews were good so i felt confident with my purchase      
273,5.0,                       i could not be happier with this purchase  my phone looks and functions like brand new  i m so glad i decided to go this route instead of paying over double for a new phone      
274,5.0,                       phone is nice  working really good for now  only thing that it came with a really long charger  haven t tried it yet since i have an original iphone charger  and the cube it came with was from nokia  but other than that was able to transfer everything from my old device and connect with no problem      
275,5.0,                       this has been an awesome refurbished phone  there was absolutely nothing wrong with it whatsoever   sprint hooked it up with no issues and i had officially made the switch from galaxy to iphone and i am never looking back      
276,5.0,                       i have to say this was fast shipping as my   plus motherboard died i needed a cheaper version  the shipping was fast  the wire and block that came with it were dirty knockoffs thy didn t work  the phone was just thrown in some random phone box aside from that the phone was in great condition  no scratches no cracks  and the battery life which i was absolutely shocked at was     good cheap buy for a good phone  i would recommend      
277,5.0,                       a nice iphone with really good features and affordable  the only problem it s some scratches on the phone and the battery health because it s not a brand new phone  in my case i don t have a lot of scratches but i have     of battery health  the seller that provide me with gifts  a case and a ceramic screen protector i love this iphone  it s similar at the one i had before and have more storage than before for a lot less money  if you want a great iphone or you are new to this  you can buy an iphone se      but if you know what s best for you  i highly recommend this one     
278,5.0,                       when we ordered this phone we were concerned as some of the reviews were not great  our daughter wanted this specific phone for her birthday  so we held our breath and ordered  it s been a great phone for her   i have recommended several friends to order as well      
279,5.0,                       wow  i was pretty skeptical and nervous about buying this from the reviews  the box seemed a bit damaged like someone had tried to open it but nonetheless  i opened the box  set up the phone  and it works perfectly  i love this phone  do not hesitate to buy  it is unlocked  no scratches or damage at all  i did not expect this phone to be in such great condition  knowing that it was used  you won t regret it      
280,5.0,                       i bought four of these phones and they are all in pristine condition  they look feel and operate like new  all functions work well  no scratches or cosmetic issues whatsoever  this is such a great bargain for a perfect iphone    if you re on the fence about it  buy these      
281,1.0,                       i wish i could give zero stars  i paid      for a faulty phone  i received it friday and upon having it plugged in and setting up the phone  it flashed on and off for about an hour then came on for about an hr and hasn t been back on since  i cannot get the phone to come back on to get apple id off and was not able to turn on the find my iphone bc the phone kept going off during setup  they state i cannot return the phone until i get apple id turned off  this is a scam    do not buy a phone from them  how they are still selling here amazes me      
282,5.0,                       looked like brand new   manual not in box but since it is a refurbished  i didn t expect it and it s easy enough to download on the net   works like brand new   the only thing i didn t realize was apple changed the shade of gold   not too happy with apple but very happy with the product over all   a nice black case solved the new apple gold problem   the best thing   the price      
283,5.0,                       the phone was refurbished  it came looking brand new   even had a screen protector  i ve been a samsung user from the get go of cellphones and still getting used to iphone  the one feature i really don t like abut iphone is the keyboard   having to keep switching back and forth  oh well can t have everything i guess  i would recommend the seller highly      
284,2.0,                       out of the box i only noticed some small scratches on the screen that weren t noticeable when the phone was off  as i continued to use the phone i realized the left speakers were not functional at all and it would stop charging when it was plugged in  the battery life on mine was also pretty dismal the return process is deliberately slow and difficult  i cannot recommend buying from this seller      
285,5.0,                       great phone for your money hands down  but kinda regret it bc it was a gift for a girl i was talking to and now she is with someone else  at a least i know the block button still works on the phone     
286,5.0,                       this is the second referb iphone i ve bought from amazon   they work perfectly  and look perfect when you get them   in general electronics either work  or they don t   so if you re going to have a problem you re going to know it right out of the box   my next iphone will be another amazon referb      
287,5.0,                       this phone is fantastic  my   yr old really wanted an iphone and we weren t going to pay apple prices for one  it arrived in great condition and looked brand new she has had it for around a month now  so i feel more confident leaving a review  we have had no issues with it whatsoever  battery life could be better the phone came with a charging cable that didn t work and seller was very quick to send a replacement out to us   great purchase so far      
288,5.0,                       bought as a gift  my sister loved it  not an apple fan myself  but people seem to like them      
289,5.0,                       purchased for my mother and received a glass screen protector already on it  phone works exceptionally well  and was relieved that it was so perfect  just wish it came with headphones  but the buy was worth it vs buying from a retail phone store      
290,1.0,                       the bluetooth feature is entirley broken      
291,5.0,                       iphone   for just       all i needed  the item looks like new  it works perfect      
292,5.0,                       i ve bem using it for   weeks and it looks perfect  the battery will have     of the capacity but i strongly recomend in buying this  i iniciatially bought this to sell the phone in a trade in but i liked it and now i am going to stay with it  i am from brazil and it is working with no problem at all     
293,1.0,                       the phone initially worked just fine and i was able to make a few phone calls after getting a sim card from my carrier  a few hours later  however  i realized i wasn t getting authentication text messages while trying to set up social media apps  while trying to make a test phone call  i was redirected to my carrier s customer service line  the representative informed me that the phone s imei  international mobile equipment identity  number had been blacklisted as lost stolen and that i would be unable to use the device until it had been removed from the blacklist by either apple or verizon  the former carrier   this is unacceptable considering i paid for a fully unlocked phone  on top of that  the headset speaker sounds tinny as if it was damaged from playing music too loudly  phone calls are nearly unintelligible and music quality sounds worse than my iphone  s  i am very disappointed overall with this  renewed  product that amazon stands behind      
294,5.0,                       not sure if i got lucky or if it s the norm for premium renewed  but the phone came in literally perfect condition  battery life       the biggest surprise     screen came clean without scratches  and no dings anywhere on the body  basically feels like i bought a brand new phone  reading the other reviews scared me off from getting regular renewed  so i m satisfied enough to say premium was worth it       
295,1.0,                       getting a refurbished item is a hit or miss  ordered  iphone   last nov     and it was pristine  ordered iphone   last week and glass has too many scratches that i ended up returning  for      i expected something presentable at least even if it is an old model      
296,5.0,                       i m very satisfied with the product  there is no scratches or any cosmetic issues  it s like a new phone with screen protection film  and headphone works great with charging adapter      
297,5.0,                       needed a replacement and was shocked to find that we could buy this at such a great price   the battery life was around     and the phone appeared to be brand new otherwise   this is definitely the way to go when buying for those who may not take care of an expensive phone under a  y contract      
298,4.0,                       i specifically sought this us based model number a      it is listed as such   awesome   i instead received a japanese version model a      apple p n mq   j a    did you know that the japanese model doesn t allow the user to silence the shutter sound effect when taking pictures  or the beeps when starting or stopping video recording   after some embarrassment in front of clients at job site surveys  i researched the model number and learned why it was happening   i ended up downloading a non apple camera app  in order to avoid the sound effects   if i was sent the a     model as listed  this issue would not have cropped up   that is why i am taking off one star from this review to the seller s credit  the phone arrived a day early  was packaged well  and was in excellent physical shape   all i had to do was put my sim card in it  and load in everything from my itunes account   i ve had it for several weeks  with no hiccups applecare coverage was obviously expired and the battery reported its maximum health as      but this is obviously a used phone   still a good value for me      
299,4.0,                       this product was purchased by my daughter and according to her it was in really good shape to be used refurbished  i looked at the phone it came with minimal scratches    no cracks  it doesn t come with original apple packaging    but the phone is as promised and good value for price  it does come in a white box with what appears to be a new charger and the little pin to unlock sim card is underneath the inner packaging  would purchase from this store again      
300,1.0,                       this phone quit working properly right after the    days return window  when attempting to talk to someone on phone  you can hear the other person but they cannot hear you  this is not a problem with other person s phone because it happens on every incoming and outgoing call made from this phone  in all fairness  there are no problems with texting  games  etc  but the main purpose of a phone for me is to make or receive calls  this is not an occasional problem  it is every phone call made or received  also  i did not drop phone  get it in water  or do anything to damage phone  the phone has been in an otterbox defender since the day i got it      
301,5.0,                       this is my upgrade from a samsung j   omg  the camera is awesome  battery lasts longer   it s super fast  i had to buy an iphone to conform to my provider  virgin mobile   i  didn t want to change providers and lose my number  like my wife did   just can t beat     mo from vm      
302,5.0,                       this is a very good reconditioned phone my phone didn t even have a scratch on it the battery life was like new the amount of storage is good the only drawback is the iphone   only has a     screen if you want a larger screen you need to order a iphone   plus i highly recommend this phone     
303,5.0,                       it s a great phone  my other iphone was small and broken  this is slightly bigger so that s nice  it works great  you have to sign for the package  so be home when it s delivered or they won t leave it  i m using it now to write this  so i can tell you it works great  when i got it i just popped out the sim card from my old phone  so i personally didn t have to go to the phone store  maybe you will have to go in  maybe not  i m not sure  but my experience was great  thanks      
304,1.0,                       this product did not meet my expectations for that reason i return it back to the sender     
305,1.0,                       i m so upset     this phone showed up in a completely crushed box  no protection around the phone inside  phone is chipped and dinged up  it was even dirty  also  the home button only works sometimes   i just got this today wtf  seriously disappointed   i know these are renewed iphones but wtf   can t even ship right  unreal     
306,5.0,                       great phone   i ve had it for several weeks now and it s worked very well  like new   the battery life is good  as well as the picture quality   it was super easy to set up and transfer all the data from my old phone   very pleased      
307,5.0,                       i upgraded from an iphone    to an iphone   after the announcement of the iphone    price drop  because with ios   they finally stopped supporting the    all i do on my phone is check email  chat on telegram  take photos and watch youtube  i m not a power user  so the main difference i noticed was everything became more responsive  faster  and the battery lasts much longer  the transfer process was pretty easy through itunes  no complaints  i stuck with apple out of sheer convenience  and i ll probably continue to stay with apple as long as they don t remove the fingerprint reader in future models      
308,4.0,                       i upgraded from an iphone  s to an iphone    i had been looking around and saw this refurbished one on amazon for      and decided to take a chance on it  i also had     of credits to use  i figured it s backed by amazon with their    day warranty too  i don t play games or watch movies or any of those things so i didn t need to get the newest iphone that s out there  my old one had   gb this one has     so i m getting   times what i had  i like the smaller size too which is another reason why i got the    they do ship it in a generic box with a generic charger   the charger lasted   days and broke  good thing my old charger works on it  i ve only had it for a week but so far  so good  i will update my review after i ve had the phone longer      
309,1.0,                       my son save his christmas money and ordered this phone  now after a   hour ordeal  first with amazon support via the number provided in this posting who could not fix the issue amazon linked in apple support who couldn t fix and brought on a senior apple support tech who could not fix the issue either  they indicated it was probably a hardware issue  called amazon back and they said sorry this is not their problem even though it says amazon guarantee  they finally agreed that they would email the vendor   that was the extent of their help and backing  caution on ordering items listed as amazon backed  doesn t mean much  not sure why they say  product works and looks like new  backed by the    day amazon renewed guarantee   if they don t really mean it  frustrated     
310,5.0,                       phone is in great condition  i ve owned it for   months now and still works great  battery life was at     when i first got it  which is about the same my iphone   was at when it cracked  it s now down to     but still works fine i liked that it came with a cute case so that saved me money      
311,5.0,                       i ordered this phone fully unlocked in a desperate attempt to get a quick replacement for the one i dropped in a toilet   after purchasing  i read the comments thoroughly and thought the phone would not be compatible with my boostmobile network   i even contacted the seller to alert them to my potential return   when it arrived  i immediately took it to boostmoble to see if it would work   it was a success   however i had to pay      bucks   my iphone   memory card is not compatible with the iphone    i had to buy a compatible boostmobile sim card   i love my new phone   great quality      
312,5.0,                       for       i cannot imagine the quality getting any better  charging port is functioning  touch screen is flawless  and fingerprint reader hasn t messed up once  battery life is a tad bit worse than i expected  but that s the only complaint  set up and put in my verizon sim card and it was ready to go      
313,1.0,                       the iphone i purchased actually was a stolen   and therefore blacklisted   one  i guess it s a common practice for this vendor to sell stolen iphones amazon renewed should probably be more careful of the provenance of the iphones and should not take part in large scale phone traffics      
314,1.0,                       it did not charge correctly  took hours to charge and only when totally off  if i had it on  or using any app even when plugged in it would lose it s charge  so obviously the  rd party seller  tech exchange  did not totally check this product before selling it it was a hassle to get reimbursed even after i sent it back      
315,1.0,                       i purchased a fully unlocked  renewed  device and the phone was indeed not fully unlocked  shipping was fast and the cosmetic condition was also as described  i have no complaints there  however  the device is void null if it s not unlocked and thus  not compatible with my carrier  it was extremely disappointing as the description states that the device passed all diagnostic tests and was certified as being fully unlocked  this is major false advertising in my opinion  still waiting to see how the returns process will go with the seller   i will update this review if it goes smoothly      
316,5.0,                       what i liked was that it was pretty cheap everything was great and the battery life lasted me      hours i went to screen time and it seid    hours and then   becouse when i first got it i was in it a lot then i slowed down i love everything about it but i m about   months to a year i m prolly gong to get a new battery but i switched from the  s and the   is so much better     
317,3.0,                       as mentioned below i found the phone to bend easily  also it doesn t lay flat on a surface  upper left corner raises up  also the turn on button is flush with the surface of phone so difficult to  turn on   i took my new protective case off to help but that didn t improve  i know it s a  refurbished phone  but i wonder what condition it was in  prior       
318,1.0,                       phone unable to read sim card  returning for refund   it is saturday   i am unable to connect with the seller until monday in processing the return i learned in the instructions     all returns are subject to     restocking fee     that  shipping charges are not refundable  only the purchase price is refundable minus restocking fee   customer remains responsible for the shipping and handling expenses of all returns  this is totally unacceptable  i expect a total refund for a defective product including the warranty that i purchased i was unable to review any other features  as the phone never worked      
319,5.0,                       absolutely love this phone  it s in perfect condition with a screen protector already on it and it came in   days early     
320,4.0,                       first time purchasing a used phone  after charging to      highest it will charge   the phone was turned off for the day  when turned back on  the power went to      the battery simply won t hold a charge  no apps were added  no photos taken  in fact  i deleted apps that were not necessary      
321,4.0,                       it was never mentioned in the amazon ad that it is refurbished item  they used a different terminology i have a    days warranty so i m still observing  its performance  actually i didn t mind it s used for that price it s alright      
322,2.0,                       phone is in excellent cosmetic condition with three exceptions     the home button is recessed below the surface of the face plate and it isn t centered  it works but has a much different feel from my other iphone     there is a large dark spot on the top right of the screen    the battery life is     which is my reason for getting a different iphone   the description stated renewed  new   i suspect the screen has been replaced as well  i will be returning the phone tomorrow       
323,1.0,                       i ll let you know when i find out what happened to it  fedex said it was delivered  surprise   not     
324,5.0,                       apple asks you to verify account login with the phone number you originally started your icloud account with and unfortunately for me that was about   numbers ago so i couldn t gain access to my old purchases or pictures  but the device does its job  you ll definitely have to take a trip to your mobile carrier to get the sim activated  coming from android phone  good purchase      
325,5.0,                       i almost never write reviews  i think it s worth doing so here   many of them here scared me   but  given that it was half the price of what my mobile carrier sold  i took the plunge and bought the product   i waited with morbid curiosity for it to arrive after seeing all of the negative reviews here   it arrived several days early and had one very small crack on the bottom left hand corner that i really had to spend some time looking for to see why on earth it needed refurbished in the first place   within    hours  i made a larger blemish to the poor r d  when i dropped it screen side down on my hard floors in my apartment  luckily  the relatively small cracked section that my spectacular feat of juggling awesomeness caused didn t affect the visible part of the screen and added my own personal touch to the party   i guess  so the disaster mostly was avoided   this experience made me come to terms with the fact that it s only a matter of time before this device accidentally ends up in my commode   pro tip  i highly recommend ordering a case as soon as you order this so you don t end up like me the iphone has no issues whatsoever absent its operator  who is a darned klutz that never should be allowed to handle electronics absent close adult supervision   in all seriousness  i am thrilled with this purchase  apple designed them to be slippery   see that you buy a screen protector      
326,5.0,                       not going to lie i was very hesitant at first about making a purchase based on the reviews but    i decided to give it a try  i purchased this and arrived on date that was specified  came completely protected in the packaging  phone is refurbished  but everything looked fine with the phone  i turned it on and it was unlocked ready to use  it came with it s charger  except earphones  i m sure my mom will love this phone for her birthday gift      
327,2.0,                       update feb           one year later    the charging function of the charger cord stopped working now   made a grave error buying this phone from whoever used amazon to sell their messed up item  no good  no good the  generic  charger   data carrier cable they added to it was not good for transferring files or photos from phone to laptop  it did not work at all  it did do the charging part of its job though    but only when attached to the electrical outlet in the wall but definitely not when i needed to charge the phone via laptop     
328,5.0,                       second try for an amazon refurbished iphone    different vendor  one month report all good  battery health  at t carrier service  overall function without any problem  cosmetically  perfect purchased from hybrid it via amazon   first try  different vendor  for an amazon refurb iphone resulted in a no hassle  immediate refund      
329,5.0,                       purchased as a replacement for my son s older iphone   it looks and performs just like a brand new one and he is completely satisfied      
330,1.0,                       i was sold a phone reported as stolen   it will not work with any network   complete rip off     
331,4.0,                       i bought this phone for my mom who was maxing out her storage on her iphone    the phone works fine  a lot better then an     the charger provided in the box didn t work and the screen wasn t completely flush with the case but that isn t a problem  the phone also had a couple of dirt marks on it but after a wipe they can right off  additionally  the phone said that the battery health was at       overall i would recommend this phone and there was no major problems      
332,4.0,                       i like this  but i think i should have gone with the   plus  this thing is tiny in my hand   one thing i m not a fan of is that apple seems to have taken away the ability to make my own custom ringtones for the thing   it s one of two things that makes me keep thinking of going to android  but i have bought so much music  tv shows  and movies on itunes  that the idea of doing it is a bit daunting      
333,1.0,                       i bought iphone   from this seller  barely used for   days and from  th day all of sudden the display is gone  touch isn t working  so i asked for a refund and now they came up with  as it is customer damaged we can t refund there is not even a scratch on the screen so i don t recommend this seller for future purchases  had a worst experience      
334,5.0,                       the battery life  touch screen and camera quality are all great  i especially like the ease of setup  less than   minutes  i m a return customer and i look forward to more purchases in the future       
335,1.0,                       i specifically ordered this phone to be compatible with t mobile  i called my carrier because the phone wouldn t connect to the cellular network and they looked up the phone information and said this phone is not in their records to have ever been a tmobile phone and that it isnt compatible  the phone only works with wifi  i m processing a return refund process  i m very disappointed     
336,5.0,                       dislikes    because this was a refurbished unit  the battery life is not that of a new phone    the wi fi hotspot loses connectivity   at times it is better to is the bluetooth connection  which eats more data    i came from android  so the inability to put widgets on any multiple screens is disappointing  this makes the  home screen   which is the only place you can put widgets  useless  i want my weather widget on top of my most used apps on the first page of my phone  apple offers very limited widgets  most apps do not have one    there is a glitch in the iphone   that causes it to very frequently turn the volume all the way down at random times likes    not requiring anti virus is nice    siri is worlds better than google assist   waiting for some developments that would allow additional voice activated options  like  siri  read me the content of website xyz   etc    siri is the main reason i switched from android  it is awesome        
337,1.0,                       i am returning the phone because it won t turn on  please contact me on when you will send me a new one or return the money i spent     
338,5.0,                       don t be discouraged if it comes in a verizon box  i was and i have metro pcs  phone is unlocked and ready to use when you get it  barely any wear on the phone and i only noticed a tiny scratch around my camera  that is is  the graphics are amazing  the sound quality is impeccable  definitely recommend this phone  only downside is no aux port  but still has the button unlike the iphone x series      
339,3.0,                       i ordered this phone because it was a newer version and priced good  when i received the phone everything seemed fine but then i discovered that the camera does not work on it  i have a young daughter and pictures are a big part of my life so very bummed out camera doesn t work      
340,5.0,                       phone looks great and works just fine i waited to do the review for a few days to make sure it worked like it should fast shipping would recommend them to friends and family if your looking to buy a phone      
341,1.0,                       when we tried to activate this unit with verizon  we found unit had been locked on find my iphone and could not be gotten into   had to be returned      
342,5.0,                       i am a    year old girl  and i payed my own money for this phone  it came in the mail on the last day that it said it would  so kind of on time  the only cosmetic problem is that the outer ring of the camera is a bit scratched  but you can hardly see it  the touch screen works perfectly  the fingerprint reader doesn t read your finger when your hands are sweaty  but that is the only time  i put in my left thumb  right thumb  left pointer  and right pointer into the thing and all of them work     of the time  the battery life is good  but i leave it on dark mode  true tone off  and i always like to keep the brightness down  the phone adapts to the brightness of your surroundings  and so if you re in a dark room  it goes dark and vice versa  overall the phone is great  and i definitely recommend it  especially for the price  i hope that this review is helpful      
343,5.0,                       i m a verizon prepaid customer and wanted to upgrade phones  i had a little trouble trying to use ebay  so i came to amazon and this was by far the best experience i had with ordering this phone  it came the next day after i ordered it and i only needed to put my sim card from my iphone   into the new iphone   and it connected right to the network  i didn t have to go in the store or call a number or anything  wonderful phone upgrade  it s much better than the old one  would recommend to anyone looking to upgrade a verizon prepaid phone      
344,1.0,                       camera was not working properly i charged it fully and turned on the day i received package  camera screen is shaking while focusing  had scratch on back side of phone disappointed with the service      
345,5.0,                       i was really nervous to buy a used phone  but i am so glad i did  everything on it works and looks like it s brand new  the battery life works       i have not found anything wrong with this phone  i bought it from verizon used phones  and i would definitely recommend      
346,5.0,                       overall the phone was great physically  he battery was     upon arrival and stated  service  b t my dad was still super happy with it  no biggie i ve changed many iphone batteries in the past  everything else is      great and functional      
347,4.0,                       my phone was delivered in a timely manner and came in nice packaging  no scuffs or scratches on the screen or outside of the phone  i m very content with the condition of this phone and it was easy to set up with the existing sim card i had in my old phone through verizon  i will never buy a brand new phone from the store again  i do need to invest in a converter or some new headphones for the new port      
348,5.0,                       very great product  especially for the price  came very quickly with charger and packaged very nicely  battery life is great  very durable  very minor scratches on back glass  i have used and tested this product for about   months  i can t compare it to any other renewed devices  it performs so greatly for being renewed  the camera quality it awesome  after some research i found out that nothing had been replaced  and it still had apple care capabilities if i wanted to take it to apple to fix if the screen broke      
349,5.0,                       arrived before the date  well packaged with no imperfections   all works well and i am very happy with this purchase  saved a lot of money       
350,5.0,                       omg such an upgrade from my    use my phone for work and this just made it so much better  it s in perfect condition and so much faster      
351,5.0,                       i bought this phone for my daughter and she s very happy with it  it was in very good condition  not a single scratch  the setup was very easy and quick  touch screen works perfectly fine  i m actually thinking about getting another one for my son      
352,5.0,                       the iphone was all that i expected  i was comfortable with a refurbished phone because i knew amazon would stand behind it and would have no reason to sell anyone a defective or misrepresented product  i m pleased      
353,1.0,                       my son opened this on christmas and we took it to get it all set up and we found out it is still attached to someone else so now i have to return it and he has no phone  i m sorry but people should not be able to sell these phones  if it s truly being checked out then how can they not know it s still on someone s account  also the person who had this phone still owed money on it  what a let down on christmas           
354,5.0,                       i got my phone today  iphone      g  and was able to get my data  contacts  text messages  etc moved from my note   to my iphone   without any problem  i m giving a   star rating based on the condition of the phone which was excellent   it came in mint condition  i ll give another review based on battery performance battery review  love  love  love this phone      it charges within about   hours and can go about a day and half on one charge  i do play games  shop  use the internet a lot plus quite a bit of texting throughout the day  very happy with this phone       
355,4.0,                    me llego estado nuevo  funciona todo y lo est tico est         no le doy   estrellas porque me hubiera gustado que venga con los accesorios originales  i arrived new condition  everything works and the aesthetic is        i do not give   stars because i would have liked it to come with the original accessories        
356,1.0,                       bought the phone with high hopes  once i received the phone  i did everything as instructed  the service wasn t working for some reason  i took it to the verizon store and was notified that the phone was locked for verizon service when i specifically bought it for the unlocked status  returned it and hoping that the next one isn t another failure   to be continued      
357,5.0,                       i got this almost   months ago  so far it s performing good  just the battery came at     of its capacity  apart from that it s a pretty good deal for a refurbished iphone  recommended      
358,5.0,                       delivered a day early and came as described   the phone i received was in like new condition   i slipped in my sim card and the phone started to work as soon as i turned it back on   i am very pleased with my purchase      
359,5.0,                       i bought this phone and was super easy to set up and super cheap    plus the color vibrancy is amazing     never going back to cell phone stores to get an expensive phone that s just going to glitch         
360,5.0,                       verizon refurbished phone indistinguishable from new  setup was easy and price is great for    gb

363,5.0,                       we ordered from kiss electronics  and maybe we were one of the lucky ones but the phone was in perfect physical condition    no scratches  scuffs  or other sign of wear   brand new tempered glass screen protector applied   came with a white charger from a zte phone  it works  and a generic lightning cable   battery health is at      not great but not bad either for a used phone      
364,2.0,                       this product looked new  started having a glich from day one  reset it a couple times  it continued to freeze  then the screen turned black   wouldn t do anything  sent back waiting on refund      
365,5.0,                       many people are saying the battery life is bad but i have had it for a month and zero problems  great time connecting to wifi  completely unlocked and isn t lagging  i was very stressed but it s great      
366,4.0,                    todo esta bien mi  nico error fue escoger el celular m s peque o es lo que no me gusto e estado notando que la bater a del cel  se descarga muy r pido no entiendo que le pasa a mi cel  pens  que estar a exelente todo everything is fine  my only mistake was to choose the smallest cell phone is what i don t like e been noticing that the cell battery is discharged very quickly  i don t understand what happens to my cell  i thought it would be exelent everything        
367,5.0,                       great prompt service my iphone gold arrived as described on amazon here  well packaged ready with a screen protector all around the cell phone is in a very good condition everything functional hundred percent copying my previous iphone  s to this iphone   was a breeze and only took    minutes i m super happy with the purchase  i would highly recommend this seller you can tell they respect the customers and sending the item well packed with care and love  on the other hand i order from a different seller here on amazon a black iphone       gb and it was in a horrible condition completely muddy and dirty he was a shame to even open it and try activated by return that the following day  the seller send me a grapevine in a very good price  if you don t feel like dropping           on a new phone as i have done in my last two iphones i would highly recommend purchasing it from here as i am super happy  and i am very careful when it comes to electronics purchasing online  thank you amazon i appreciate your business and thanks for amazing product      
368,5.0,                       i purchased as an upgrade for my mom   it s january      and she s still using it   it works perfectly      
369,1.0,                       i bought this for my daughter in april  and now in december it doesn t work   nobody can hear her when she calls   of course it s out of warranty so i m out         here you go amazon  stick it      
370,1.0,                       the camera sound  the  click  when you take a picture  cannot be muted  not even if you switch off the sound with the button on the left side and you activate the silent mode  i went to the apple store to verify if it was a hardware issue and it could be repaired  but they said no  they informed me that this is not adjustable as the phone comes from japan and this is one of those countries where the sound of the camera cannot be silenced  i found it extremely disappointing  as i would have never bought it if i knew in advance   and i am very surprised that this is an amazon  certified and inspected product   did not you realize while inspecting the phone that the camera sound could not be muted  at least you could have advised that in this particular device the sound could not be turned off as a loyal customer of amazon  prime too  from several years now  i found it extremely shady  you sponsor a product as certified and tested by amazon qualified supplier and you should be transparent while describing the product and its specifications  given that amazon is an international platform and your buyers are based all around the world  i am based in the usa and knowing that the product would have come from japan and the camera cannot be silenced  i wouldn t have completed the purchase but switched to a different supplier this is a lack of primary information that should have been disclosed by amazon and would have guided and helped me in the purchasing process lastly  the battery is weak   it lowers down very quickly and i have to charge it at least three times a day      
371,5.0,                       purchased for friend in columbia   works great there      
372,5.0,                       still gets all the updates to ios  large screen  great battery life  good cameras and all the tech you d want for  at the moment  way under     usd  so happy i did this instead of get an x or anything new which right now is more than double  my particular refurbished unit came with an aftermarket  but still very fast  charger and cable      
373,3.0,                       overall this product was very well working  no visible scratches on my phone and upon arrival the battery health was at      however the shutter noise for the camera will not turn off leading me to believe that this product originated from another country      
374,2.0,                       everything about this product has been perfect  the quality was indistinguishable from new  it has functioned reliably and perfectly since i received it  this would have been an easy   star review except for one thing this is a refurb unit from japan  which means that the camera shutter sound is hardwired in and cannot be muted  turned down  or turned off that one little thing is enough to make this unit borderline unusable for me  as i primarily  used to   use my phone camera for wildlife photography on hikes  now a single exceptionally loud click sends every critter in the vicinity scurrying for cover      
375,1.0,                       when i bought the phone it would turn off randomly  just with normal use  now after   months of use the phone will not even turn on anymore  i have tried charging it  resetting it and literally every trick in the book to turn it back on but nothing works  i got a defective product and should have returned it as soon as i started having issues with it which was from day one      
376,1.0,                       by reading some other reviews and based on my own experience i feel as though kanga supply  probably doesn t do a very intensive quality assurance on their products  if i could guess  they get a lot of refurbished used phones  which for the majority of the time work fine  but there are going to be quite a few phones that are faulty  the phone i received wouldn t even turn on  despite trying to charge it with   different chargers  i guess it s my fault for not looking at their website  where they make no guarantees that their products work  if you need a phone immediately  i wouldn t suggest buying from here  unless your willing to wait     business days for an exchange or refund      
377,5.0,                       i gotta be honest i didn t expect to get a damn near perfect iphone   it was sim locked to at t but less than    minutes after getting an approved unlock from their website and restoring the phone i was able to insert my sim card then use it on the cricketwireless service there is one small tiny paint blemish on one of the edges but honestly it really isn t a problem because a case would cover it up easily  other than that the phone has no scratches or dings anywhere else  battery is great  no cloud lock and everything functions normally i don t know if i got lucky or people are writing fake reviews but i am very pleased with my purchase and the fact that it comes with a    day warranty is a plus thank you for blessing me with a phone i could give to my mom cuz she loves having touchid and having some newer features like wireless charging is a plus too  even though she s never going to use it       
378,2.0,                       the phone was beautiful and perfect in great condition  however  the shutter sound would not mute  which meant it was probably from japan where it is illegal to mute the camera shutter sound  you can t even turn it down  there was nothing i could do to mute the sound  i tried everything  even running it on another app  i returned the phone   i was sad because it was perfect  if you don t mind the sound  you should but it   be beware      
379,4.0,                       the iphone   works fine the battery life is good  touchscreen works fine but it had few scratches here and there      
380,1.0,                       i ve been using this phone for   weeks  calls are so quiet that unless you re in silent a silent room you can t hear the call even with the volume turned all the way up  the keyboard occasionally doesn t pop up  you have to turn the phone off and back on to get the keyboard working  made worse by the fact that it ll only turn on after being turned off if it s connected to power even if it s fully charged  and there s an annoying feedback noise on the playback of videos made using the front facing camera so calls  text  and camera are bad  hopefully amazon honors the    day guarantee because i won t be able to return it until next week and when i tried to return it to the seller it said that had to return it by tomorrow      
381,1.0,                       the phone arrived not charged and after    minutes of charging had    life and nothing would work on the phone   after getting in person help from my carrier cricket  they confirmed that it doesn t work and i need to return it   unfortunately   then i had to pay    to return it because amazon requests you print the label and box yourself      
382,1.0,                       took hours to reach     charge  must be a defective while the front and back has no scratch the rounded corner has dents  the phone has been dropped  which most likely lead to the charging issue in package only the phone is original  plug and cable are oem and no instruction  no lightening to earphone jack adaptor read some of the reviews and people had same issues  hope this return isn t going to someone else      
383,5.0,                       i was a bit hesitant with this purchase because of the mixed reviews but i ended up buying it   it came in just today and works perfectly fine  the phone came without any scratches and without any trouble connected with cricket easily   i ordered the phone full unlocked and based on others reviews was a bit scared of getting it with another company or getting it not unlocked  the phone came in with a charger but no headphones  you ll have to use your own tool when it s time to remove the sim card  overall for right now the phone works fine but will update the review if any problems come in the few days      
384,1.0,                       i got the iphone   and im returning it now to the seller in exchange for a new phone  the phone im sending back restarted at least     times and turned off completely     times and took forever to turn on  audio was bad to and couldn t hear people talk     
385,1.0,                       leason learned with this one   i received the phone a couple weeks ago  but waited for my daughter to get home from college for christmas before activating it   after she activated it  she was having problems sending messages  etc   so she went to the verizon store for help   she was told the serial number for the phone is blacklisted because it has been reported lost or stolen   when we tried to re active her old phone  her number had been blocked for fraud associated with the stolen lost phone   she and my husband were on the phone with verizon last night for more than two hours trying to get this mess resolved   don t do it   it s not worth it   just get a new phone      
386,1.0,                       i gave this phone a   only because the seller is not describing it properly   it is a gsm phone and  as such  does not work on verizon or sprint the same way a verizon or sprint phone will work   those carriers use cdma phones  so a gsm phone will not get the same coverage   it worked in as far as i could get it activated to make calls  receive texts and be fully functional  but only in certain areas   i had an iphone    an iphone   before that  both with verizon   both of those worked all the time at my boyfriend s house   never once lost service in   years   then i bought this phone   had service fine until i got to his house   then my phone said  no service    it did this repeatedly for a few days every time i went to his house   stayed that way the whole time i was there even though my boyfriend s verizon iphone   worked in the same house at the same time   never lost service   i called verizon   they said this phone was a t mobile phone   is a gsm phone   explained that if i want the same level of coverage i had before i need an unlocked phone that was originally a verizon phone so that it is a cdma phone   i guess an original sprint phone would work  too  since those are cdma phones   i told amazon that they need to require the sellers of cell phones to identify the phone as gsm or cdma      
387,5.0,                       i bought this for my husband for christmas  he has wanted an iphone for a long time  the phone was in really nice condition  it did have an        slight scratch on the screen  but once i put on the tempered glass screen protector on you could barely even notice it  all functions of the phone are in working order  very happy with this purchase      
388,5.0,                       the phone looks perfect  and i bought an unlocked version and it worked perfectly with my verizon network  came with an aftermarket charger  but quite honestly it ll probably last longer than an apple charger  as long as the phone holds up this review will stay good  if it craps out i will come back and update      
389,5.0,                       i bought this for my son  he is    and into gaming  streaming  watching movies and videos and he is more than happy with it s performance   especially the storage capacity   phone is as advertised   in like new condition  fully unlocked  we use verizon  and functions as it should  very pleased      
390,3.0,                       i purchased this phone from buyspry   the phone works great  except you cannot turn off the sound of the camera shutter   it is a japanese model   in japan  there is a law that phones must make a sound when taking a photo   the sound does not play when taking a live photo  but in any app that uses the camera  it will make a sound when taking a still photo even if it is muted   quite annoying if you are trying to take a photo of something in a quiet room      
391,1.0,                       good phone  bad battery     
392,1.0,                       this phone is defective and i am not getting a response when attempting to contact seller  you can t hear people during phone calls  you have to either have the phone connected to bluetooth headphones or use speakerphone  also this pop up keeps coming up and the phone restarts  i bought this as a gift for my mom and it s not usable due to these problems      
393,5.0,                       the phone came as described in awesome packaging  as in  not just a cardboard box   the phone works great  it s fast compared to my iphone se  and was nearly flawless cosmetically  it had the signs of good use with a couple of scuffs  but that was covered up by the case i purchased  besides  cosmetics don t affect the performance of the phone something i was a little leery about was the description  so here s my experience  the phone i received was unlocked and works great with ting  the description said unlocked  but some reviewers mentioned that they received a gsm phone  and i was looking for cdma  i received a phone that was unlocked that worked on either carrier network  i purchased from buyspry  i hope they don t mind i mentioned them it is my understanding and from my research that unlocked and fully unlocked are roughly the same as carrier unlocked and factory unlocked  however  if the description specifies a specific network like  unlocked gsm   then the phone will only work on gsm networks  make sure to do your research on the phones before purchasing and contact the seller with questions  that s what i did and it worked out to my benefit      
394,5.0,                       i bought this phone for a relative  it works great so far   this is our second iphone   and i would say it is almost as good as my brand new one      
395,5.0,                       despite it is sold refurbished i attest it came in high quality  the battery  which is always my main concern  lasts almost as new      
396,5.0,                       i m always nervous about buying phones  the reviews on this one looked good sooooo i went for it and was not disappointed the phone is great  looks like a new phone i ve had it for a couple months and it s been great      
397,5.0,                       as expectedfast shippinglike new     
398,3.0,                       my teen son likes the phone and has no problems with it  it s a good value for the money      
399,5.0,                       just thanks  iphone   came with     battery and in close to new condition  i would say to any observer is really new  there is no reasons to complain  i m very satisfied  thanks a lot      
400,5.0,                       the product feels brand new  sometimes i forget that i purchased a refurbished phone  the only thing i do wish they included is a pair of headphones  other than that i am completely satisfied with this purchase  battery life is great  and the phone has not slows down at all  if your coming from an iphone se or  s i would say this is your best bang for your buck      
401,1.0,                       i don t even know where to start  i didn t even wanna give this one star  i bought this as a gift for my niece for her birthday once she got it activated all it did was mess up didn t want to stay charged  no one could even hear her talking to us she couldn t hear anything her volume didn t wanna work everything about this phone is broken i m still trying to figure out how to get my money back and a response from the seller   i took the phone to the nearest phone store and they told us it was a defective phone and that s why were having the issues were having        
402,2.0,                       seemed like a great deal  battery life was only around     but we just dealt with that  then   months outside of amazons    day warranty period the phone just dies and will not charge anymore  now the phone only works for   minutes unless connected to a charging cable  which makes it useless without a new battery  obvious battery issue  i should have requested a replacement when i noticed the lower than expected battery life      
403,1.0,                       i bought this phone  got it all setup  everything was good   until verizon suspended my phone number because the iphone   i purchased on amazon was marked as fraudulent stolen   returned right away but customer service didn t seem too bothered by the fact that it was a fraudulent item      
404,4.0,                       i almost returned it after i couldn t get it to read my sim card  but after multiple attempts  a tiny piece of metal fell out onto my lap and i attempted once more to insert my sim card into the phone and it slid right in  where as before it must ve been being blocked by that tiny piece of metal  and the compartment that holds the sim card wasn t being inserted all the way and was actually protruding out of the phone  but it wasn t that noticeable until i compared it both mine and my sisters iphone  and those were both flush with the phone  i m extremely happy with my purchase after that issue was resolved  i ordered the silver case  its white on the back side not silver  but i still like it  with a case on all u can see is the silver apple and i guess the white makes it stand out  otherwise it doesn t seem like it would  the circle around the home button is silver though  this may be what they consider silver       regardless i m happy with everything  works and looks like a brand new phone  if i have any issues i ll update      
405,3.0,                       shipping was fast but the phone was scratched  sometimes it wont shift between camera settings  and there was no sim card  i was very frustrated i lost my iphone    so the iphone    is my back up  the camera quality feels so poor compared to what i m used to but that has nothing to do with the seller i just really wish i would ve been more aware that the seller did not include a sim card with purchase of the phone i live six hours round trip from a verizon store so they had to ship me the sim card before i could even activate the phone  that took another   days      
406,5.0,                       phone came back in good shape good shipping battery life was ok fingerprint reader worked all in all good phone for the price i am happy with it it s been my phone for the last year almost     
407,5.0,                       so i got the phone today it was totally unlocked so i was able to connect with metro pcs right away was annoyed that it was completely dead but small fix  phone has no damages or cosmetic issues in very pleased and happy good buy     
408,5.0,                       phone delivered fast   in pristine condition  set up of all functions complete in about one hour  battery life while not in use over night   went from      to      in   hours  so far i rate purchase as outstanding   if long term function goes well   this will rate a happy face       
409,5.0,                       i was having some trouble with the sound fading out and i was going to return the phone just   days before the deadline to return would be up  and the seller immediately provided me with a postage paid return label   then i spent hours on the phone with comcast and apple and it was determined that the problem was not with the phone but with the cell phone service    i had started having the same problem with my android phone as i have   phones   it is a long story but before i bought this phone i bought the same phone from the same seller because i had tried to cancel it because i had failed to get the    financing and failed so i returned it ad ordered it again   had received my refund right away   so i am happy with the phone and with the seller  buyspry      
410,5.0,                       a really nice refurbished iphone   for a great price  we have had it about a month with no issues  good battery life and phone was in great condition      
411,1.0,                       wholly unimpressed with amazon s  renewed  service    i bought a phone compatible with t mobile  but our sims wouldn t work  after an extended support call we found out the phone was locked to a carrier in japan  it was suggested that i could call them to ask for the phone to be unlocked    yeah no thanks    also  the phone just randomly shuts off  mid use  and the phone s screen is black and the button is unresponsive  nice job at  renewing  so whatever  renewed  means to amazon  it is not  refurbished  functioning phone   returning it and shopping elsewhere      
412,5.0,                       after two bad iphone purchases on ebay  both refunded  and no luck finding a decent iphone   on gazelle i was hesitant to order another pre owned iphone  however  this iphone was as advertised  mint condition  excellent battery life and yes  it was actually an unlocked  model       dropped in my metropcs sim card and was up and running immediately  good purchase and would buy again      
413,5.0,                       this iphone has great features good screen sensitivity  even case on  great battery life it came well protected and in mint condition  i ll follow with an update  right now just getting started      
414,1.0,                       the phone was clearly defective  the touch screen did not work at all  this is extremely frustrating since i need a cell phone for work  this makes me question using amazon when clearly defective products are shipped  apparently without assuring that the product is operational      
415,5.0,                       i don t write reviews but i do read them to make my decision i had a sub of mine but me two gold   gb iphone   s unlocked they are currently running on metro by t mobile  all i had to do was call in and give them my imeis i almost didn t buy them because of some negative reviews but i m very glad i did i downgraded from an xs so i m not      satisfied  but i do love my iphone   s it s been almost   mo this since having them and they work perfectly  no flaws      battery health  almost brand new iphone  came with two original apple chargers no headphones generic box not iphone box      
416,5.0,                       i bought this iphone for my nephew  i was hesitant at first because it was refurbished  when it came he was so excited to open it   he loved it   it looked like a brand new phone  there was no scratches on the screen or the phone  he was able to use the phone with no problem   the picture are so clear  this is definitely worth the price      
417,1.0,                       recieved the phone fast and at first it was working great  then out of nowhere on the very first day the device shut itself off and then locked itself into a reboot loop  could not set the device into revovery mode using a hard reset and the device would not connect to itunes for a system restore  very dissapointing after waiting a week to get the phone to have it fail so badly less then    hours after startup      
418,1.0,                       sounds like you are in a cave  microphone must have been damaged  do not recommend this seller      
419,2.0,                       i bought this for my wife because i had bought one just like it a month ago  mine pretty much set itself up  it was totally painless  she has had this thing since christmas and still can t get it set up  apparently an update has not be done and because of that it is kinking the whole set up process  however it won t allow the update to be done now for some reason  beins how this phone is a refurbished maybe that s the reason it was sent back  i think she has given up on it so it looks like i will need to get involved  i ll keep you all posted on how it turns out      
420,2.0,                       buyer beware  the phone arrived really looking great  almost unblemished however it started having screen issues i e  dark screen  sadly  right after the    day warranty expired  i ve bought this for my aging mother in law that lives far from me  i ve had my reservations prior to purchasing it for this simple fact but i thought i d take a chance and hope the seller would be helpful if something does happen but clearly that s not the case  so if you don t want the headache and money to burn  don t do it      
421,5.0,                       a major upgrade from my iphone   which died after many years of use  i use a phone to talk to people  text   and play solitaire so i didn t want to spend a lot of money on a new model so this was perfect      
422,4.0,                       i bought this phone to replace my grandmas iphone she had  it came in a bland cardboard box with the phone in bubble wrap and the charging cable and charging wall plug wrapped up nicely but everything could shift around a lot in the box but luckily everything was safe and nothing broken  the batter life of the phone was at     meaning that was the max life of the battery so not too bad but a little low for my liking  decent price  decent phone      
423,5.0,                       i was a little hesitant to buy a refurbished phone   my daughter has had it for   months no problems at all  everything was as described  saved me a lot of          
424,5.0,                       the renewed iphone   arrived with no visible scratches  dents or blemishes   the battery life is excellent and every button and feature is in perfect working condition   i couldn t be happier with this purchase   now i have retroactive buyer s remorse   i wish i had bought my  last  phone as an amazon renewed product      
425,1.0,                       ordered this phone and was very excited  i was even more excited when i received it because it looked brand new charged it overnight    went to       unplugged it the am and phone died about   minutes later  not exaggerating  i thought i didn t charge it and repeated the process  put to charge  went to work  came back  said       unplugged    dead less than   min later packed it and returned will order a  nd one once i get my refund to give it a  nd try     
426,5.0,                       do simple to upgrade my   to an    apple makes it easy  everything from my last back up downloaded to my new phone  and great price       
427,5.0,                       i was a little hesitant ordering a used phone online  but i couldn t be happier with this buy  it came with no flaws scratches and honestly looked unused  it charged to      within an hour too  my daughter is extremely happy with her phone and hasn t put it down since getting it      
428,2.0,                       i bought the iphone   with a hesitation about the quality    you can check the quality relative to new of the battery in the settings   battery   battery health settings of the phone  the battery dropped    in efficiency in the   weeks i had it  it was annoying returning it  just saying      
429,2.0,                       battery is draining very quickly  need to charge multiple times in a day  am a big fan of iphone and have been using iphones since      but this phone sucks   this is the first time am giving a review for any amazon products  not happy     calls disconnects while you are talking and it only connects back when u completely switch off and dial back in     a big noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo         
430,5.0,                       i picked up the phone to replace my wife s iphone    prior to buying an iphone   through this method i read through a bunch of reviews  i admit that i was a bit nervous about buying the  renewed  device  i took the chance and bought it  the device was in really good shape  these phones are all glass  there wasn t a scratch on the thing  it is pristine  my own  plus has been in cases the entire time i ve owned it and it looks more worn than the   i purchased here  there are zero signs of wear on the lightning port   battery was at     health  i updated it to ios     it had     the phone looks and runs as if it were brand new   i can safely recommend this product and seller      
431,5.0,                       just received the phone  came earlier than expected  even came with a few extra  goodies  from the shipper  back case and front cover   looks brand new and metropcs was able to switch out my old motorola g  phone   all my contacts  photos  sim card   everything into this phone  now i need to learn how to use it so far i am very impressed i ll update my review in    days      
432,4.0,                       i seriously love this phone  i was impressed with the quality provided at such a low price  the phone works like new except for the battery which seems to die slightly faster than expected  perhaps the previous owner kept leaving the phone charged overnight always unplug your phones once you see      battery          
433,2.0,                       this device functions pretty well  but impossible to hold a conversation using voice   out of the box  the mic does not work well at all      
434,5.0,                       i am very satisfied with this purchase great price for     gb i phone    it works very well screen is brilliant all the features work great  today was the third day and battery life was better than my older i phone  need to charge it after   days      
435,2.0,                       can see lot of scratches on front and back and battery life is at     and generic packing and no headphones either and generic cable      
436,3.0,                       bought it as a gift  i sent the return label to the recipient they couldn t print it eventhough the phone was sent there      
437,4.0,                        refurbished iphone     gb  bought on jan        as the price difference between iphone   and iphone   settled on a rather negligible sum          i reconsidered my decision of buying the former  for         and thought it to be wiser to obtain the newer model instead     the phone arrived in an amazon iphone box  the box contained the phone  a booklet  an iphone needle  a charging cord and a chord wall connector  these last two were of different colors and do not appear to be of apple brand   the box came without any earphones earbuds   unlike what was testified in some of the earlier reviews visually  the phone had no scratches or marks   neither on the screen nor anywhere on its body  the entire exterior appeared to be completely indistinguishable  to a naked eye  from that of a new phone  fingerprint reader functions slightly worse than expected  because the inconvenience is minor  i e  several attempts being required before successfully unlocking via fingerprint vs  the usual single successful attempt when using the fingerprint verification method on my old phone   the effect of this issue on my opinion of any given phone is not so significant negligible thus far  i have been using this phone for about a month and overall it has been working well  however  for me  one of the most important aspects of a phone is  undoubtedly  its battery life  unfortunately  in the case of this phone  the battery life had been somewhat compromised well before its arrival for comparison  the peak battery performance of this phone     iphone     gb    is     upon      days of use after purchase  purchase state  refurbished   whereas the peak battery performance of my old phone    iphone     gb   is     upon     years of use after purchase  purchase state  refurbished  an observation to be tested confirmed  the phone rapidly loses its battery life upon mildly cold weather conditions             celsius or            fahrenheit    despite having a rather thick leather cover on and barely being used  a fully charged battery is completely drained in about an hour or less if used under comparable weather conditions  if left unused  the result seems to improve by approximately halving the battery drainage speed  i e  approximately  doubling the battery life  the battery life seems to be affected also by the background app activity  but to a much lesser extent if compared the cold weather conditions   however  it is much trickier  than it may initially seem  to control this parameter  the  background app refresh  on off button in the settings menu does not appear to serve its intended purpose   most of the applications continue to function in the background as it pleases them  and  as far as i can tell    perhaps even completely  independently of any of the phone settings on the other hand  considering its refurbished state  as an informed buyer i  admittedly  understand what i had signed up for  so  as sad as it can be  it is hardly surprising to discover most of the cons of this phone to be connected to one of the most significant  for me  aspects of the phone   battery life finally  taking into account the affordability of the product  its quality  as well as factoring in its projected short life span in this rapidly innovating world       i wouldn t hesitate to recommend it to all those in search of a new phone  i will try to update my review as new and significant issues come to light                                                                                                                                 although it may be worthy to note here that the two phones at the above mentioned price points had different memory capacities  i find it difficult to reconcile that a productive person may use need   gb or more memory space in a personal phone  thus  any memory capacity succeeding this number is categorized as  a phone with enough space  and treated similarly in terms of that parameter      considering the fact that most of us use any given phone for a very short period of time   i wouldn t guess it to be longer than     years   and considering that this already short time period tends to get even shorter over time   due to innovations happening faster and faster and the pace of the change   the development    accelerating with an overwhelming rate  a phone that already has seen years worth of usage  represents the yesterday  and thus is soon to be replaced with something way more interesting   and costs the fifth of its initial price while functioning essentially only       worse than it used to when it was completely new  in my eyes   is a worthy trade      
438,1.0,                       the product looked good with few scratches  the battery health was on     which was disappointing  my reason for sending it back is that the headphone jack did not work      
439,1.0,                       the applications in the phone freeze sometimes  when it happens that way  i always turn it off and turn it on before they start working  also the home button is a bit displaced right from the day it was delivered  it makes some displaced sound when i use it  i am thinking of returning it to get iphone         
440,4.0,                       got this particular phone because it came from hybrid it who gets great reviews from others  phone was in nearly perfect condition  just a few barely noticeable scratches  one negative is the     battery  although it s guaranteed to be at least      hence the   stars  not     i ll replace it at some point but still way less expensive than a brand new phone  it came with a charging cord   adapter  screen protector  and a sim card removal tool  i was able to easily backup the new phone from icloud and move the sim card with no problems at all  very happy so far and hope no issues arise  if they do i ll come back here with an update      
441,4.0,                       overall  this phone has been exactly what i expected   everything functions well   the only reason i gave it   stars is that the screen had a few minor scratches  and the battery maximum capacity only reaches       i know these are all things within the expectations of a refurbished phone  but for the hundreds of dollars i spent  it s still a little disappointing hence   stars not     overall  though  i m very satisfied      
442,5.0,                       the phone looks and feels like it s new  the phone has a    battery heath when it arrived and touch screen worked fine until i put a protective cover and it acts ups doe time i don t know if it is the phone or it s the  extra glass  touch id works better than it did on my iphone se  i also like the water proof it has      
443,1.0,                       not happy about receiving a locked phone  we have tried to reach out to the seller but they have not communicated with a solution to the problem  we are very disappointed      
444,4.0,                       its good but for some reason   out of the   i bought just turned off on me within   months and hasn t turned back on  idk what to say but i wish i could get my money back     
445,1.0,                    el equipo no estaba desbloqueado  apenas lo recib  coloqu  mi sim  t mobile  y no funcionaba   preocupado hice pruebas con sims de otras operadoras y el  nico que funcion   fue at t  llev  el aparato a una tienda apple y a t mobile y me explicaron que la  nica raz n por la que no le a mi informaci n era porque no estaba liberado mi mayor molestia fue que al recibir el reembolso de mi dinero me descontaron    dolares  no puedo estar de acuerdo con eso  me venden un equipo que no funciona y adem s me descuentan dinero espero que esta p sima experiencia sirva para tomar correctivos y mejorar su costumer service   the computer was not unlocked  as soon as i received it i placed my sim  t mobile  and it was not working  worried i did tests with sims from other carriers and the only one that worked was at t  i took the device to an apple store and t mobile and they explained to me that the only reason i didn t read my information was because i wasn t released  my biggest nuisance was that when i received my money back  i was discounted    dollars  i can t agree with that  they sell me a computer that doesn t work  and they also discount me money  i hope that this terrible experience will serve to take corrective measures and improve your costumer service        
446,5.0,                       it was such a nice relief to receive a renewed phone that looked new  packaged as a new device with vinyl covering on front and back and everything to get my son going   the customer support was phenomenal   to be fair  i ran into a small issue with the battery  battery health was     after opening it and using it for   weeks   did we check that status before   no   the seller says it should always be above     and will gladly refund  return and replace it or pay for battery replacement if i visit an authorized apple store   i chose the easiest for everyone and scheduled a repair and replaced the battery   seller not only reimbursed the total amount  it was actually more that the receipt i sent  maybe for my time and effort   in any case  totally happy with the purchase  completely satisfied with customer service and highly recommend this seller   phone looked perfect and still acts       like new    months later      
447,5.0,                       i thank the seller because i was skeptical about the purchase and debated for a bit before taking the leap and purchasing  i am so glad that i did  i can understand why the seller is listed as the best and are ranked as     just like others who purchased this phone  i expected it to have issues and not be worth the purchase  however  i received the phone   days earlier than noted  it also arrived literally looking brand new and it works as if i had just purchased a brand new iphone  let s just say i am overly excited that i got such a deal and an amazing purchase  i am ready to buy all kinds of cases and accessories for my new phone  yay      
448,1.0,                       this says fully unlocked but when i called boost mobile to switch phones they said they cannot be used with boost mobile   very disappointed because the phone is great looking   i ordered a different iphone   fully unlocked and i hope that i don t have the same problem     
449,5.0,                       i researched the iphone      and   as replacements for my aging  s  i also sought out sellers with good ratings for this purchase  i settled on mywit based on their reviews and their volume of sales  the phone arrived a day early and it is absolutely pristine  if it is a refurb  there are zero signs of that as there are no marks anywhere on it  not even finger prints or dust  it came with a nice flex lighting cable and apple charger  no sim as advertised  i put the sim card from my old iphone  s in it and went through the setup questions  i had a fully functional iphone    in   minutes tops   i selected the iphone   over the   or   due to the advanced technology in the    it is worth the extra      over the same size     it is fast but the battery lasts all day without showing significant signs of needing a charge i also purchased a speck candy shell case for this phone  the iphone   has a glass back for wireless charging and it is very smooth and slick to hold  with my dry fingers  it is difficult to even use the phone so a case is necessary to give it some grip  the speck case is a perfect  anti slip and lots of drop and screen protection  see this case here https   www amazon com speck products candyshell phone iphone dp b  k   iz very pleased with the seller too and i would certainly use them for another phone purchase without question      
450,5.0,                       so far so good i will get it programmed with our phone company bought if for my daughters birthday its in a few days but it came no scratches it turns on i charged it already battery had about     charge i was very scared from reading reviews but like i said so far so good i ll change my review if it wont connect to our carrier     
451,3.0,                       the battery does not work   last just a couple hours or nothing i think it was old because ask me for a change   i wanted send it back but i just have not time and now it s on the drawer expecting a new battery     
452,5.0,                       i like it  it help keeping communication between families and friends  helping in studies     
453,1.0,                       battery was terrible from the moment i activated it  phone started randomly shutting off and restarting just weeks after receiving and now it s completely gone and won t even turn on  not worth the investment and such a hassle and inconvenience  would have much rather put that money towards a new one since it costs about the same between the price of the phone and now the cost to fix it      
454,3.0,                       i love the phone but it was not    g only   g and i really wanted the phone for the storage  i could have gotten a cheaper phone by just getting the iphone  s that was advertised as   g  i hate i didn t get to save money since the phone is the exact phone i already had but i had already promised my little sister my old phone and didn t want to make her wait by sending this one back for false advertising  great quality and was boxed very professionally      
455,1.0,                       this phone came in great condition  no scratches or marks  easy to set up  but the battery life was horrible  it only had     capacity and i couldn t even get it to charge passed     while using it  lost about     of battery life in the ten min i used it  i would have kept the phone if it weren t for the bad battery  great packaging and even came with a like new charger  but what good is a phone with out a decent battery      
456,3.0,                       i got this for my wife  we have always had android phones  so the setup and apps are way different  the screen size was the real issue i returned the phone      
457,5.0,                       i bought from hybrid it because of the amazing reviews and i was worried it might be too good to be true  but i was wrong  everything is running perfectly without any cosmetic imperfections  so far i m really impressed        
458,4.0,                       for     this is a great deal  only problem is this is a japanese model and should be advertised as such  one  and very annoying difference is the stupid camera sound is forced on no matter what  all those perverts over there in japan need to calm down  besides that  the phone is of above average condition with a few minor blemishes  but that s to be expected at this price  battery is at         
459,4.0,                       physical condition almost perfect and very happy with that  screen perfect  did not know would have  anew battery and it does not last very long  battery life shows    in settings  gets down to        and then super quickly depleted remaining battery life in matter of minutes of use  if battery was replaced with new before selling these refurbished phones it would be an excellent deal  as is you can consider it a decent deal i expect a year or two out of the phone        
460,5.0,                       so i don t really do reviews but this product legitimately surprised me  i ordered this in doubt  because of all the really bad reviews i saw  i was very scared and didn t want to waste         i finally bit the bullet and bought this refurbished phone on thursday  it came on saturday  earlier than expected  in a regular box  not apple  but that s ok because it is refurbished    the packaging was nice  and it was protected  the phone already had a nice screen protector on it  and the phone literally looks new  like i don t see any cosmetic issues or anything  i ll add photos soon   it was already partially chared  as i was setting it up  i put my sim card in and it said  invalid sim   i use at t   so i was afraid  i popped the sim card out and put it back in and it worked fine  the battery compacity was      which is great for a refurbished phone  everything looked and performed fine  i ve had this phone for   days  so i will update this when it has been longer  so far really great      
461,5.0,                       this phone was like new  it was perfect  no scratches or even fingerprints  i would buy from this vendor anytime  it came to me just like they advertised  great product   it was a great experience working with them     
462,4.0,                       i ve just had this iphone   for a few days  so far it s just like having a new phone  i had a little trouble getting all the apps and data transferred from my  se but with a little bit of help from apple it went quickly  so far so good      
463,1.0,                       the i phone was defective and did not receive a sim card and therefore we are sending it back to the seller      
464,5.0,                       this iphone was in great condition  all i did was turn off my old phone  switch sim cards  turn the new phone on and bam  the iphone did the rest  synced my icloud  upgraded  let me set passwords   within    minutes  my new phone was ready to use  the battery life is perfect  strongly recommend      
465,4.0,                       standard iphone   working great only thing it came in a box that said mobile device phone on it total knock off really cheesy and the headphones and charging stuff was gone it was also very clear that it was refurbished     
466,5.0,                       i ve had the phone for two weeks without any issue  the phone and the accessories came neatly packaged  phone included a temporary protective cover  front and rear glass appear to be new   the only cosmetic flaws are a few scuffs on the metal bezel  i would consider that to be expected for a used phone  not a big deal for the flaws are unseen once the phone is in a case  i would definitely buy again when my wife or i are in store for a better phone      
467,5.0,                       good product just like brand new also very fast shipping     
468,5.0,                       when i bought this used refurbished phone  i was just happy to get an  upgrade  from my ancient iphone    what i needed was something secondhand  affordable and still usable i was pleasantly surprised to receive this order in a condition like new even pristine  as promised by seller in terms of functionality  the sensors and controls feel as though i ve bought a new phone  all    gb was available  the speakers  microphone and display work very well when i was switching out the sim card from my old iphone    the iphone   started detecting the switch and offered an immediate transfer  without my activating the migration function   very cool  the transfer was so near perfect that the iphone   migrated all my whatsapp messages  which i was expecting to lose  because i don t use icloud   the migration was near perfect because for some apps or platforms  i needed to type in the initial passwords again  even though they were transferred to and saved on the iphone      just the slight bother of retyping a few passwords one more time by the way  i am a singapore buyer  and this order was routed through an oregon transshipment facility  before it was shipped to singapore what s the takeaway i can offer in this review  buying a secondhand product could be a lucky draw  there is a chance you may get a dud  in this order  i am happy to say that i got exactly what the seller promised  so here s my   star thumbs up      
469,5.0,                       great product  arrived on time and functions beautifully      
470,1.0,                       this is a stolen phone         
471,3.0,                       upon opening it there were no damages to the device  it was perfect  came with everything i needed  but the camera was down right awful  there s a glitch inside the camera where it doesn t take pictures properly  iphones would usually take amazing pictures but this phone is no bueno  everything else is rather decent  it still connected to my airpods and all of that  but i will be replacing this phone soon  i definitely have to have a decent camera on my phone while traveling happy shopping      
472,5.0,                       ordered    to give away for x mas   out of    had batteries that would not hold a charge  will not buy from here again     
473,5.0,                       i was definitely a bit concerned of buying it due to the reviews and this was my first time buying a phone offline but i must say this phone is perfect it came just how it looks and just how it says with a charger and screen protector already on the phone  and the battery life is amazing     
474,3.0,                       did not work on arrival    stars is for the customer service that processed the return with no issues  ended up buying new        
475,1.0,                       phone came with only     battery health  drains very quickly  also  the phone is from japan  there is no way to switch off the camera shutter sound when taking a photo on snapchat  this is because of the laws in japan  would love if amazon was more forthcoming about the origins of these phones  would not recommend buying this phone      
476,3.0,                       the phone works great but i was disappointed with the amount of chips and scratches on the screen  i understand that i was ordering a refurbished phone but chips and large scratches on the screen are intolerable in my opinion  rather than send it back to seller and wait another week for a different phone  i just bought a new screen and replaced it myself  no other issues     
477,5.0,                       i purchased this unlocked iphone   to replace my daughter s iphone  s  it arrived on time  in great condition and exactly as described as advertised  the maximum battery capacity  viewed in battery health setting  showed     on unboxing which is expected for a phone that s three years old  i have two boys that both have the iphone   plus and it s consistent with their battery health  i put my daughter s verizon sim card in the renewed iphone   and haven t had any issues  i would say this was a great purchase for the price  i could have got a similar deal from verizon but i like the    day purchase warranty provided by amazon      
478,1.0,                       don t buy this    was told it had apple care  the serial number on the sim tray showed it did  but the actual number assigned to the phone itself did not have apple care  phone started smoking after a couple months of use and had to pay full price for a new phone from apple  very sketchy and not worth it  just buy a new phone through apple and cut out the unnecessary  renewed  middle man     
479,1.0,                       box was not sealed   when i opened the amazon box  the phone was not protected and was loose rolling around in the amazon box   the white box the phone should have been in was opened up with all parts not secured   also  the plug and cable shipped are  rd party junk that did not work      
480,5.0,                       i love this upgrade to an   from a    the phone was delivered sooner then expected  the quality of the phone i d have say is very close to new  the only thing i don t like is the battery gets hot when playing a game but that otherwise i m happy with my purchase      
481,3.0,                       i bought this phone for myself last year  it has held up  in pretty good condition  and works like a charm  the only downside to it is that i cannot turn my camera shutter sounds off  everyone can hear if i m taking a video  picture  voice recording  or screenshot for safety reasons  other than that i am happy with my purchase  hope that helps       
482,2.0,                       this phone was shipped and received on time  the condition is great  however the phone does not hold a battery charge for more than   hours without recharging it  would not buy from this company again      
483,1.0,                       a bit disappointed in the battery health condition of the phone  it s almost time to change the battery on this phone  how can this be certified refurbished and ship with a questionable battery          update   have contacted seller twice about battery issue  no response  so far   have dropped review to   star   will keep you updated      
484,5.0,                       i read a lot of reviews prior to ordering   since i didnt want to get ripped off  i ordered this phone  expecting to possibly having to send it back  it came almost   days  earlier then amazon saying  all the buttons work great  no scratches  the first day i thought the battery was weak  but battery life status told me it was a      i must have not had it fully charged    havent noticed any issues at all very happy about my purchase  will try to write another review down the road seeing how its holding up      
485,5.0,                       phone came exactly as described  no imperfections and works great so far  for the      price tag  i highly recommend to anyone in need a replacement but not wanting to pay apples retail price tags      
486,1.0,                       refurbs are tough i guess i purchased with already having fear of rerubs  what i received cemented that fear for me unlike some refurbs that i have gotten in the past the hardware seemed to be in full working order   but one of the phone looked like it was bathed in an apricot puree  or fecal matter  i prefer to hope it was apricot  then lightly wiped down  leaving tons of gross still       
487,4.0,                       this is a great little phone and it doesn t cost        got this for my wife because her samsung battery would drain all day at work  i phones are sooooooo user friendly  good phone so far and it s been a few months now  signal is good  battery is good and it had no visible scars or damage on it  i plan on getting another one for myself if i can win the lottery         
488,1.0,                       arrived almost two weeks later than expected as soon as the battery was  starting to run low  i charged it  after that  the screen got black  battery wasn t drained  and it never turned back on  had to return it  no problem at all when requesting a refund     
489,5.0,                       bought this phone to replace an older android due to purchasing the apple watch   still in a learning curve  about the settings   i did not receive an instruction manual and the ones online are not too helpful   however  my biggest concern is the battery seems to drain rather quickly    maybe this is quirk with all apple phones   overall  i am pleased with the phone      
490,1.0,                       we returned the phone because the sound did not work   we received a full refund      
491,5.0,                       i needed to replace my old iphone  s because of the slow processor speed and not so great camera   the iphone   was priced right and i m very happy with it   the hardest part of the upgrade was getting the sim card tray to open on my old phone   my previous phone was also a refurbished unit which worked flawlessly for nearly four years   i ve had the new phone for about a week now and there is a lot of new functionality that i have yet to use so it will keep me entertained for a while becoming familiar with them      
492,4.0,                       awesome how you can get a great phone for cheap here  i took off one star because the was a small nick on one of the edges but otherwise it looked pretty good      
493,1.0,                       if i could i would give this product zero stars  the phone after   days shut off and did not turn on again even though it was fully charged  when i went to return it  they said i had to pay restocking fees which were a lot and i only got     dollars back from the almost     dollar phone  would not recommend      
494,5.0,                       product had no visible damage  it works well  sound  camera  touch screen  etc  i was worried seeing some other reviews  but i am happy with the product      
495,2.0,                       to note  i am obviously returning this product  but will give time for the seller to make things right   i will change delete my review if the seller can remedy the situation to the seller s credit  this phone was delivered much faster than expected  almost a week early   however  what good is a phone that arrives early if it isn t as advertised   one of the only guarantees this product comes with is that the battery capacity will exceed       that s directly from the description from the listing   imagine my disappointment when i go to settings and see the message  your battery s health is significantly degraded      maximum capacity         this is worse than the iphone   i currently have and was trying to  upgrade   and keep in mind i had my current iphone   for about   years now   completely unacceptable if even after all that  you still decide to purchase one of these  i should also mention  if you look close enough  you can tell you bought a used phone   this isn t to knock the seller or the product  it s clear you re not getting a new product  just shows minor signs of wear and tear      
496,5.0,                       this phone works great and came on time  there is one small crack on the side of the screen but i hardly notice it and the product description explained there could be small imperfections  great product for the price i paid      
497,4.0,                       the phone arrived in great condition  no visible scratches and everything seems to work  very pleased with the fit and finish  the battery health reads     after a few days of use  when i thought to check it  entirely possible the vendor shipped it with     remaining i am replacing an xr  and i have to say i forgot how limited my last iphone   s battery capacity was when it gave up the ghost  if you are replacing an iphone   this may not be a big deal  but i m going to have to charge multiple times a day if i talk for any amount of time  just keep charges around your home  office  and vehicles and this shouldn t be a problem  i feel that was the one trade off i made with a refreshed unit battery life      
498,5.0,                       i bought two phones from this seller and one of them didn t work  i contacted the seller and they stood behind their work and sent another phone to us after we sent the other one back  i will definitely buy from them again  they work like brand new phones      
499,2.0,                       the touch screen of the mobile phone is not sensitive  especially in the four corners  it takes many times to press it to get a response  the sound of the microphone and receiver sometimes is very small  and sometimes it is difficult for the other party to hear clearly when making a call  sometimes works  so this phone is not stable  battery easy run off  probably will return it      
500,5.0,                       this phone was a  renewed  phone but you couldn t tell  there were absolutely no signs of use anywhere on the phone  no scratches  no issues with the screen  all buttons and all functions work perfectly  no complaints whatsoever      
501,5.0,                       had to replace my moms iphone  se  and i was a little hesitant because of some of the reviews  it shipped very quickly and it showed up very well packed  opened and gotta say it looks brand new  not a scratch or dent  came with like a   ft charging cable  put the verizon sim in and bam set it up  was easy  no issue at all  my mom loves it and would definitely would buy again      
502,1.0,                       i just received the phone  it seems to be in working order but since it is a gift it will not get set up until after christmas  i want it noted that it is not like new  it has scratches at the upper right corner  they do not look horrible but they are noticeable and also the speaker on the top is dirty and crusty looking  it had a screen protector on it but it was not sealed on  it was taped on  i m going to give it as the gift  but if the recipient has an issue with any of this i will be returning it      
503,5.0,                       like very much thank youcan t seem to get new credit card installedyet very pleased with the quality andfunctionality of this phone     
504,5.0,                       i was extremely skeptical about going with the certified refurbished option but this company did not let me down  you can trust this purchase completely and i m so glad i did  it saved me hundreds of dollars and this phone works perfectly  i might as well as bought it new  no scratches or noise deformations  i m pumped      
505,3.0,                       people are right about the camera    even when you try to silence the camera it still makes noise  even on apps like snapchat  etc  haven t had any other problems so far tho   update  i returned the phone  it overheats while on the charger if you re using it at the same time and will keep powering off it untilit cools off  don t waste your time      
506,5.0,                       i bought a used iphone   and it was amazon certified  i opened it and saw no scratches or any damage whatsoever  i wanted to use it for a while before i did a review  i have had it about a month now and i havent had any issues at all with the phone s performance  battery lasts a long time  no dropped calls and fast internet connection regardless of wifi no wifi i was so leery about getting a used phone  i ve always gone new  when i saw it was only       it s worth a shot vs spending      on a new phone again  they gave me a    day return policy as well for the piece of mind  so far  this was the best bang for buck deal rather than buying a new phone  as long as i dont have any issues in the near future  i will continue to buy used phones from amazon that are certified      
507,4.0,                       iphone is my third or fourth iphone   previous phones worked until they simply quit this phone requires sim card which the online videos plainly show how to install   unfortunately  amazon web site did not mention that a sim card and phoneservice was required for phone to work   so i spent labor day weekend withouta working phone   shame on amazon for not mentioning this   if i had known could have had sim card home waiting for iphone to arrive and iphone did arriveon time      
508,5.0,                       ok  only the battery     
509,5.0,                       i purchased this device as a temporary replacement for a phone that died  in the time i used it everything functioned perfectly and other than a spot on the bezel around the charging port where the finish was worn it looked brand new  according to the built in battery health utility it was in need of service but it lasted me all day with frequent use all in all i would buy another without a second thought      
510,1.0,                       these cannot possibly be certified refurbished as stated  both phone batteries were so dead when i received them it took a day to charge  one phone has a camera that does not work      
511,4.0,                       the phone arrived in good condition  there is a small inner crack but i barely notice it  everything works well and for the price i am happy  it was easy enough to set up  i will update if anything changes  the battery charges fast  it was at     when it came and after    minutes of charging it was almost full  looking forward to using this phone more      
512,1.0,                       this phone stopped working in less than a week  it got no cellular service and i was told by my cellular service company that it had a defective antenna  total piece of garbage      
513,1.0,                       only had this phone for   months  its already acting up  constantly freezing up and dropping calls  my screen goes blank and i had to force restart this phone multiple times  dont waist your money     
514,5.0,                       i needed an upgrade from my old phone  it was an iphone    and the home button didn t work  and the battery life was terrible  this phone was like new  no scratches or cracks  and it works flawlessly  came fully unlocked like advertised  and all buttons all worked perfectly      
515,4.0,                       phone was a  renewed  phone   in excellent condition and arrived ahead of schedule   battery life isn t great  but not sure that s the sellers issue   i bought the phone to be able to face time with family and grandchildren   i typically use an android  but this phone does what i need it to do   i would purchase from this seller again      
516,5.0,                       i usually seek refurbished products as it is a good way to get quality devices at slightly lower costs than buying them new  i found this listing and i will admit that i was a little skeptical about making the purchase because of how few reviews there were  i contacted the seller and asked if there was any way that i could be assured that this would be a good purchase  they were very polite and gave me all of the info on the warranties provided by both them and apple i received the product and it was in mint condition  the phone had absolutely no sign of ware whatsoever  it has been working perfectly for   months now  and i could not be happier with my purchase the packaging clearly wasn t original and the charger was not oem  but this is stated in the product description so i knew what i was getting into  no big deal if you re the type of person that is willing to give up a fancy unboxing experience to save about       this is an excellent option for you additionally  i had no problems switching this phone over on my verizon account  as long as you are a verizon customer  this should be an easy process through the verizon app thanks      
517,3.0,                       the phone works amazing  the battery life only came at     which i am kind of bummed about  but the thing that really bugs me is the back camera won t focus  i looked it up and tried all the methods of fixing it  updating did nothing and can t get it to focus      
518,2.0,                       phone was manufactured for asian markets therefore i am unable to silence the camera shutter sound  returning for refund      
519,5.0,                       came in and looks brand new   absolutely no problem setting it up   everything works great on it  i would buy again and recommend            
520,5.0,                       this was a great phones for the price they work great and came with a screen protector      
521,5.0,                       the iphone   arrived within two days  phone looks great like it s brand new  it s rose gold color  received the phone yesterday and got wireless service for it today with at t  nothing bad to say  there are many negative reviews on refurbished phones  but just do your homework and research before purchasing      
522,5.0,                       phone looks and has been working  for a few weeks  perfectly  physical condition was        set up was easy  charged it for about   hours and inserted my sim card  everything transferred right away  no technical or battery issues  would buy again     
523,1.0,                       beware        i give this phone a   star because the phones are not fully unlocked or carrier unlockedi bought   of the iphones   for my childrenas these phones for christmas presents  and tried to get them activated  to xfinity  which is with verizon   i was told that the imei are locked so hopefully amazon will refund me and take these wifi only phones back    i have called the third party seller but as of yet i haven t not received any respondence         
524,1.0,                       i bought this phone and it immediately started having problems and i try to contact the company but no response  i contacted amazon and one person told me i can mail it back for my money back   i then talked to someone else who said the first person was wrong and that if i were to have sent my phone back  i was waiting a day because i wanted to buy a new phone so i would have one  i would of not received any money and would be out a phone and money  i contacted the company again and they replied but are refusing at the very least a return  suggesting i take it to a  repair shop  and have them look at it  it freezes constantly and the volume doesn t work most of the time and at random times every day it makes a loud beeping sound and goes black for about a minute  i m very disappointed in the whole situation      
525,5.0,                       so far i think i like android phones better than iphone  but this phone operates and looks like new  the ios seems counter intuitive  maybe i ll grow to love it  what i do like is that it doesn t deplete its battery like an android  seems like a high quality phone  and not as pricey as new after several months of use  i like the device very much  it does what it claims and doesn t seem to have a lot of stuff running in the background depleting the battery and causing overheating like androids i ve had  still frustrated by the arcane lack of file management that forces everything through itunes  some files just don t get transferred to the phone  not the fault of the phone  apple corp just won t allow convenient computer operations      
526,2.0,                       the title itself says it s  fully unlocked  but when i tried connecting it to a certain carrier it wouldn t let me  i d be more careful buying from this seller      
527,5.0,                       at first i thought i got scammed because the box it came in was just a generic smartphone box  which sounds fine at first  but the box had the details of a completely different phone so i was sweating a bit when i saw that  the phone was correct  though  and came in good condition  it wasn t perfect  as you d expect from a refurbished phone  there was a tiny scuff in the metal on the upper right corner  but that doesn t bother me one bit since it s covered by my case  i think that      is a good price for a well refurbished iphone    since it also comes with the trust that it s in top renewed condition versus buying for less from fb marketplace or something like that  i also purchased the protection plan which covers drops  cracks  water damage  etc  and it is well worth it to me  after the initial     payment  paying     to have my phone repaired or     to have it replaced in the case of it breaking is a great deal of a protection plan to me      
528,1.0,                       the renewed phone already had     charge cycles  battery should have been replaced in renewing before sale  apple recommends replacing battery after     cycles due to battery degradation  battery discharges quickly     
529,5.0,                       update i ordered the same phone from hybrid it which ive bought from before so i knew this would be better  of course it was the best experience  hybrid it is the best renwed seller to work with   previous post for loop mobile i learned my lesson  only buy refurb products from a reputable third party on amazon renewed  the phone came with a passcode so i had to send it back  i ordered this same phone from a previous seller i trust from amazon and of course it came passcode free like a new phone would be  loop mobile please do better      
530,5.0,                       apple products are expensive   many people cannot wait to upgrade   our family just waits for people to do just that and for companies to refurbish perfectly good phones   this one came in less than   days  all functions working properly  just as advertised was unlocked  bluetooth transfer of data in less than    minutes   the only slightly negative comment is that the refurbished phone came with generic charger and not apple products   no ear bud jack in this phone  so remember to get wireless earbuds      
531,2.0,                       my daughter bought this phone with all of her savings and only   months later it has crashed  the message is stating press home to upgrade but it will not go beyond that screen  verizon told us to check with apple store  which is   hours away  but it may or may not be fixable  very disappointing      
532,1.0,                       very disappointed to see i that its defective  works totally find except that it restarts itself every one or two minutes and the batter says its dead even when its fully charged i guess this happens sometimes so ill try one more time with this seller     
533,5.0,                       this company provides beautiful renewed products    i wanted to allow some time to pass before writing a review  i couldn t be happier i m very skeptical making larger purchases online especially when it comes to tech products  i m so glad i took the great deal this company offered as they delivered my phone with perfect quality         i purchased the phone renewed and it arrived in seemingly brand new condition  everything works like new  a glitch once in a while is normal for all iphones and i still haven t even seen one  i ve been enjoying this phone every day since i received it        
534,1.0,                       got the device in and the charging port didn t work  jus save yourself the time n money n don t do it  and it had a crack on the front screen     
535,1.0,                       apparently this product comes from some international market that does not allow for the shutter to be muted or changed  the noise is particularly loud and effectively renders the camera unusable in public places      
536,5.0,                       seller   hybrid itbattery life     no cosmetic imperfections of any kindtouch screen and camera  as newall buttons  volume   power and silent  clean and responsive as new this is the best refurbished set i have ever bought hats off for the seller for maintaining mint condition inventory     
537,5.0,                       perfect  phone came unlocked and in mint state  packaging is a general phone box no the original one  charger and cable are aftermarket     
538,4.0,                       i activated this phone a couple days ago and so far it s been what i expected  the one issue i have found is that on snapchat you have to turn the volume down  open the snap and then turn the volume back up to listen to it but this is probably an issue with snapchat rather then the phone  would recommend      
539,1.0,                    no andaba la pantalla touch  tuve que devolverlo  un trastorno  the touch screen wasn t on  i had to return it  a disorder        
540,5.0,                       phone arrived as described and had my metro pcs store turn it on to their network      
541,5.0,                       this phone is great  we are on fixed incomes and didn t want to spend an outrageous amount of money to upgrade from our iphone    so  we purchased this refurbished phone from amazon and have been very pleased  the phone  although used  looks absolutely brand new and operates like a new phone as well  we were so pleased with the phone i got  that my husband bought a similar one from amazon just last week  thank you for making options like this available for people who don t need  want  or can afford the latest and greatest gadgets      
542,1.0,                       it didn t work  and we had to buy a different phone      
543,5.0,                       it worked great and looks great     
544,5.0,                       there are several people on here that wrote reviews saying the phone didn t work on verizon  broke shortly after  etc   it certainly made me pause before purchasing  but i really needed a replacement phone for my son and wasn t going to pay top dollar for a new phone again i ordered the phone on a tuesday  and was surprised when the fedex box showed up on thursday  a full   days earlier than estimated    next  the packaging was decent and included a genuine charger plug and cable   finally  the phone looked absolutely brand new   not a touch or smudge anywhere   i immediately took it to the verizon store  and they got it registered on the network within   minutes i know there are other reviews that had similar experiences as mine  but you always think that you are going to be the one that gets the dud that doesn t work   it would seem like it s a good company though and perhaps they d swap it out if you happen to be unlucky  i can imagine it has to occasionally happen   it is a used phone after all  each with a different history    apparently i got one from a grandma that didn t take it out of the box    overall  very happy   hopefully you will be just as fortunate   and if not  i d feel safe about working with them company to make it right      
545,1.0,                       had multiple problems  the seller took it back and promptly refunded my money      
546,4.0,                       the phone came as promised  externally it looked good  and after updating the software it accepted my sim card with no problems  the screen protected it came with cracked within the first day of use  the battery had a maximum capacity of      which was expected  however  the phone does discharge when being used very quickly  it can go from full to empty in only   hours  very good quality for the price  except for the battery life      
547,3.0,                       i was surprised at the high price for a phone that came out   years ago  the phone looks like it s in like new condition  it arrived spotlessly clean in an amazon branded box with an aftermarket charger  according to the  battery health  function in the phone  the battery is at     of original capacity  not bad      
548,1.0,                       phone originated from japan which means that the camera shutter is always on  other than that it was an all right phone  i am getting a replacement in the next few days if that one also has the japan problem i will return it and update my review here update  received another japanese phone  very disappointed  do not buy this unless you want your phone to blast the camera shutter noise when you take a photo      
549,1.0,                       not happy with this  renewed  iphone   from ae cells  according to amazon  this should be like new  but all   corners have damage  the back is heavily scratched  the screen has been replaced with an aftermarket product  the battery health is at      barely meeting the minimum requirement  there s nothing about this phone that is like new or refurbished  it just looks like someone s old beat up used phone  amazon needs to either change the product description or get rid of some third party sellers      
550,2.0,                       i always buy a refurbished phone on amazon every   years  i ve had great success with this  i bought this one   months ago or so and a week or   ago it was shutting down while on a facetime call multiple times  then today it just shut down again  it seems like the home button gets stuck doesn t read a fingerprint or me pushing on it when it shuts down  super disappointed in this      purchase that s already having problems  shop somewhere else      
551,5.0,                       the item description said something like  looks like new if held at arm s length   the phone looks like new even when looked at from the closest distance  shipping was way faster than advertised  and the battery is at     maximum capacity   great stuff  i am super happy with this seller  thank you very much      
552,4.0,                       physically the phone functions and looks great  the only drawback is that the phone is likely from japan or another country that has laws requiring camera shutter sounds to always be on so i can t take selfies because everyone around me will hear it  and the sound isn t quiet      
553,4.0,                       i just received my phone yesterday and it works good and looks good  the reviews are correct  the gold is the rose gold which is what i wanted  however  i have put in my straight talk sim card and the data does not work  it says verizon at the top and i ve had an issue before buying a verizon phone not working with my sim card  i m not sure what to do      
554,1.0,                       you might think since buyspry is selling this on amazon that it would be legit  but it s not  they sell it as an iphone    but it s not and now that they have received the product back  it s going to take another week to send a refund      
555,5.0,                       i am so impressed with these phones we ordered  they really are like new  ours came without any physical blemishes  the battery health for each is     and     which is so much better than i was expecting  they included the necessary charging items and a sim card removal tool  i was able to switch out both sim cards for both phones myself and never had to make a trip into our phone provider  easy peasy  we are both pleased with this purchase and would definitely order from this place again  also  the phones came a day early      
556,5.0,                       feels and looks like a brand new one      
557,1.0,                    compre un iphone   de     gb tal como esta en la publicacion y en el recibo de compra y asi me lo cobro  pero cuando me lo mando era un iphone   de    gb  cuyo valor obviamente es menor es un pesimo vendedor  un estafador    tengan cuidadosi algo de decencia le queda que me devuelva el valor de la diferencia  i bought an iphone   of     gb as it is in the publication and on the purchase receipt and so i charge it  but when i sent it was an iphone      gb  whose value is obviously lower  he s a pessious salesman  a swindler    be carefulif you have any decency left for me to return the value of the difference        
558,5.0,                       amazon asked about face recognition  don t think the   has that so no stars there  generic box  generic charger and cable  tossed those in the trash as i don t trust them but after a week the phone has worked well and we are satisfied  no lightning to headphone adapter      
559,4.0,                       it s a great phone for a great price   my o ly issue is that it was originally intended for sale in a country where you can t silence the camera click noise   not a huge deal but it confused me for a while   the battery life is excellent and the fingerprint is perfect   those were the two things that had gone wrong on my old iphone   so i m happy to have those functions back      
560,5.0,                       just as advertised  i literally cannot find a single flaw with this refurbished phone  inside and out  i popped my tracfone sim card in and it activated immediately  definitely worth the money  highly recommend     
561,1.0,                       the battery itself isn t bad but the phone keeps shutting off for no reason and freezing     
562,5.0,                       the phone itself looks great and works perfectly  honestly it was in better shape than i expected the battery life was really bad  it could only hold a charge for a few hours so i had to have it replaced at the apple store within just a few minutes of me leaving my original feedback  the company that sold it to me  hybrid it  called me directly and offered to pay for the battery replacement  which they did  just simply wow  in less than    minutes they called me and made it right if you want one of these phones i highly recommend you choose the vendor hybrid it for it      
563,5.0,                       thoroughly pleased with the way this product was shipped  delivered faster then expected  and exceptionally met expectations  thank you     
564,2.0,                       very impressed  i received yesterday expected a view flaws it is pristine no scratches or dings  took to my carrier for a new sim card  i have not done a lot of web searching  i made a few phone calls connected to my car bluetooth no problems so far  i did not rate battery life  i was surprised it came with a charge on it  battery life is a long term comment      
565,1.0,                       it was someone else phone from a couple of yrs ago  they never paid it off  not worth it  sprint couldn t do anything about it     
566,5.0,                       my   yr old son needed a new phone and every store we went to was literally out of iphones  sooo i checked on amazon and found a refurbished iphone he actually liked for a decent price  i was really worried until the package arrived and we opened it up     he s had this phone for almost two weeks now and it has been great  i am so happy i decided to purchase this iphone  will be purchasing in the future      
567,5.0,                       thank you so much for a quality product for good value  my original phone died during this pandemic and it is crucial to have some way to stay in touch during this time  you saved my world      
568,5.0,                       i wrongly believed this iphone was defective   wrote a negative review   due to the corona virus our at t store was closed  the fact that i d already received a horribly defective phone from another company  and my total lack of knowledge about new iphone technology all lead to this wrong conclusion   cellcow staff were very courteous   promptly shipped me another phone   i want to apologize for my previous rant review   there is nothing wrong with either phone   i will keep one   return the other      
569,1.0,                       was told by customer service there was no way to unlock the phone and that it was gsm unlocked as stated  i contacted apple who checked the number and found it was still registered to at t  i logged in and unlocked it from at t but this was not gsm unlocked  it was an at t phone  hope the phone works better than jem jem s indifferent customer service      
570,5.0,                       after three bad buying experiences on both ebay and amazon  this iphone   arrived as advertised  it is not always easy finding a reliable  working used iphone  however  i was finally able to find a reputable seller  this iphone   is everything i wanted  compatible with sprint  in great working condition  unlocked  and in excellent condition  don t mind the used phone case  the iphone inside it is immaculate  thank you      
571,1.0,                       charging cable sent with phone obviously wasn t for that iphone because it wouldn t even charge it   the only way it charged was when it was on a charging pad  also sim tool was way too big to open door for removal of sim card so had to use an earring  with that being said all i want is a r e f u n d        
572,1.0,                       received phone in box with charger  switched over to iphone from android with my provider to find out the phone could not pick up audio from my end  text worked fine  incoming and outgoing calls worked other than the fact that   my voice could not be heard   i believe it had a bad microphone is my only assumption  the phone also would not allow me to download any apps i contacted seller and they said to send back the phone and they would refund my money  they kept their word and was issued a refund   days later i had to pay the shipping for the return      
573,4.0,                       believe this phone came from overseas because the camera shutter sound will not mute even with the silent switch on  called apple and they told me overseas phones have this feature that is not controlled the battery life is at      the cosmetic of the phone is outstanding and the phone did come in a apple box  daughter can t get passed the shutter sound and battery life so we will are returning      
574,4.0,                       definitely worth the purchase for the price i do not have think you will find something this cheap and appearance of the device is great     
575,5.0,                       this renewed phone came in perfect condition   no scratches or any signs of use   it even still had a few months of original apple warranty   though i know that is not the case most of the time   would definitely recommend amazon renewed for quality      
576,5.0,                       very happy with my purchase  i just  upgraded  from my refurbished   unlocked iphone     gb  and this phone is a great value for the money  i could not justify shelling out more than        for a phone  so after researching i settled on the iphone     gb in gold   i shopped around  and decided to purchase on amazon because of  the amazon renewed policy  as well as the ability to purchase   year accident protection  my phone arrived with a few very light scratches on the screen  as described   which doesn t bother me one bit as i always add a glass screen protector  the speed and functionality are also perfect  and setup was easy   the battery life is not as great as expected  but not enough of an issue to decrease the rating  i purchased from breed  highly recommend      
577,5.0,                       everything was perfect even came two days early  no scratches or any signs of use either  after reading some bad reviews i was slightly worried but figured i could always return it if it s not what i expected  but i couldn t of asked for better results      
578,1.0,                       i bought this phone as it is unlocked but then i went to put my sim card in and it said that it was locked  don t buy from this seller     
579,5.0,                       i will admit that i was a little skeptical about buying a iphone from amazon  but it was the best decision i could have made  i was very impressed with the  newness  of the phone  everything works perfectly and they also threw in a free tempered glass      
580,4.0,                       the phone was on time and great however  there was no sim card included which was a huge hassle as my iphone   card was not compatible  i spent about   hours on chat and driving to the sprint store to get this figured out but eventually got it working  all in all it s a good phone though      
581,5.0,                       upon opening the box there is a packet of information with  open me first  on it   if you do that the set up is flawless   once you turn on your new used iphone and enable bluetooth and set it next to your old iphone it pretty much transfers all your settings  address book and apps in a matter of minutes  it could not have been any easier  you then use the tool provided and put your sim card in and it s ready to use  on the renewed premium phones the battery health is supposed to be at least     or better  to my surprise it s at        the iphone itself looks like it s a new phone  not a scratch on it  it even has a month or so left on the original apple warranty from whoever owned it before   i ve been wringing it out  texting  taking pics  making calls and using all of the new features this has to offer that my old iphone   plus didn t have and so far so good   while i liked the bigger screen on the   plus i could never get used to the size and wanted a smaller profile with more processing power and this fits the bill for me   i don t know if all renewed premium phones are like the one i got but i m really impressed  better yet i have a full year to put it through it s paces   i wanted to upgrade to a newer faster model iphone without breaking the bank   my hats off to amazon and the tech   mm in new jersey that tested and signed off on the    point inspection certificate  nice job on an outstanding phone      
582,1.0,                       this company sent me a phone that did not work  the home screen button   the side turn off on button did not work  i sent it back immediately  my refund was rejected because the phone did not work  it obviously didn t work that is why i sent it back  they kept the phone and didn t refund my money  it s a scam  don t purchase from kiss electronics      
583,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          fingerprint works greatbattery life is at    there s a really small faint scratch at the back of the phone   nothing major  i seriously  dont mind at all barley noticable the phone was actually  sim unlocked  i got it activated  with at t  great buyi bought it as a gift my sister will love it  it was a great affordable price i was looking for nice phone as cheap as possible you provided it thank you     
584,5.0,                       these refurbished phones cost way to much to be in the condition that they are  the iphone   i bout looked almost brand new but the battery life is horrible and the volume button doesn t work  now i have to go through the hassle of waiting on a refund with no phone  don t waste your money      
585,1.0,                       worse place to get a phone  after the phone didn t work and returned it  they still won t return the money  if you can buy from someone else     
586,5.0,                       i ve had this phone for a little over a month now and i love it  i was somewhat scared to buy a refurbished phone  but so far this phone is working wonderfully and arrived in nearly perfect condition  there was a teeny tiny little scratch on the side of the phone  but it is barely noticeable  i only noticed it because i was looking for imperfections when i received the phone  it is much cheaper than buying an apple certified refurbished phone and is probably the exact same quality  unfortunately  the charger is not an apple product  but is working well so far  if you re looking for a quality new phone that is not ridiculously expensive  i would highly recommend purchasing this one      
587,5.0,                    el vendedor envi  el tel fono bloqueado con una clave de seis d gitos y no inform   tuve que pagar     para desbloquearlo  adem s la publicaci n dice este anuncio incluye     apple iphone    desbloqueado  funda protectora transparente con absorci n de impactos     soporte ajustable y plegable   cargador de coche usb     de carga r pida     cable lightning de carga adicional    cubo de alimentaci n usb adicional  pa o de microfibra de limpieza de lo cual s lo trajo el iphone    cable usb y cubo de alimentaci n deben ser m s transparentes con lo que publican y con lo que en realidad env an al cliente  the seller sent the locked phone with a six digit key and did not report  i had to pay     to unlock it  plus the post says this ad includes     apple iphone    unlocked  transparent protective case with shock absorption      adjustable and foldable stand    x quick charge usb     car charger     extra charging lightning cable    additional usb power cube  microfibre cleaning cloth from which only brought the iphone    usb cable and power hub  they should be more transparent with what they post and what they actually send to the customer        
588,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i do like writing reviews especially for used phones because it helps everyone  a special shout out to the synergy phone renewal program team  my iphone   came in perfect condition with the battery capacity of          really  when i ordered this phone last week i was having second thoughts about needing an iphone just for work as i already have a iphone   mini but didn t want to use it for both personal and work so i took a chance and went with the    i was going to get a   but the   is only     more  i kind of hoped it would have some scuffs and that the battery was at    something percent capacity  so i could send it back and just use my    mini but i don t want the wear and tear on that battery alone as the    mini already has a small battery  i told myself the phone would need to be perfect and i would keep it  well perfect it was  i have ordered a samsung galaxy s   and it had screen burn in as well as a galaxy s  plus that had a swollen battery  not from synergy  so used phones can be hit or miss but this iphone is brand new just in a different generic box but it came with the official iphone cable and charging brick  all for           tax  so yes i am keeping this for work and am as happy as i will ever be from a used phone  thank you synergy  you all rock      
589,1.0,                       phone arrived early with a note that its a small business  all seemingly huge bonuses set up for a   star review but the phone doesn t work  it will not recognize my phone number  only apple id and only on wifi emailed rep as the note said before leaving review  their response was to question if it s user error  reset the phone as suggested  read apple forums to troubleshoot  turned on and off imessage  restarted  reset again  no apologies from the  customer service   seems like they erased data from a broken phone to sell as refurbished  huge disappointment     
590,5.0,                       phone was in near perfect condition  packaging was basic  but that s a good thing   less waste than original apple packaging  popped in sim card from old verizon phone  turned on  and booyah   worked perfectly  my daughter has been using for over a month now and no issues at all i will probably be buying a lot of phones for the family in the future through a refurbished seller like this shipping was a bit slow  and the tracking didn t update until it was literally in the mailbox  but that s probably due to the christmas rush   still received it in time for christmas morning  so no complaints      
591,1.0,                       phone was either not unlocked or was broken   sim card was not recognized even though it should have worked   very disappointing   return was easy but it would have been nice if they had tested the phone before sending it to me   grrrrr          
592,4.0,                       i had the same experience as the commenter prior to me  the phone is great  however  it did not come with a sim card  i was on the phone with sprint for about an hour determining why the phone wasn t getting cell service  it was only    to order  however  i wish i had known this in advance so i could have ordered one earlier      
593,1.0,                       i bought one of these only to find it was originally korean or chinese because in silent mode the camera still makes a very loud shutter sound  to adhere to their privacy laws     and there is no way to turn it off  so i bought a second one    only to have it to the exact same thing    so both are being returned  don t waste your time      
594,2.0,                       the phone is almost new and i didn t find any obvious defects  but the charger and usb cable are not original  they are good in quality but the seller didn t say  no headphone connector  the price decreased from        to        before i receive the package  disappointed somehow      
595,2.0,                       bought it on oct      today is feb     and the battery is already draining in about an hour  i am   weeks beyond the    day return policy  not good      
596,2.0,                       this phone is not worth buying  the volume for talking on the phone is horrible  i can barely hear people talking to me  the people on the other end of the line are always telling me they can never hear me  when you get your notifications sometimes the sound is quiet sometimes the sound is super loud  when i close out an app and then turn the phone off and then come back to it later the screen will come up with something that i was doing three weeks ago and have since deleted     
597,5.0,                       i got a nearly brand new phone  it is definitely      worth the upgrade from the  s  nearly everything about the phone is better  it didn t come with the headphones or a headphone jack adapter though  so make sure you get that too  this was an incredible deal being as the iphone   goes for twice the price from apple      
598,1.0,                    la verdad me defraud     se apaga a cada rato  no funciona bien  muy defraudado        the truth let me down    it turns off every time  does not work well  very defrated             
599,1.0,                       the product description says compatible with all network carriers  including sprint  but after receiving the phone and attempting to activate it  i was told by   separate sprint reps that the imei number will not work on their network  when contacting the seller they acknowledged this and only offered to provide a return label  i asked for a exchange for the same phone this time one that works with cdma  not gsm  and my request was ignored  why does the seller advertise  all network carriers  untruthfully  it s a waste to time to buy from here is the need is cdma   sprint and verizon      
600,3.0,                       a word to the wise  have breed check the imei of what they re sending you  imei s are specific to gsm or cdma  and even if the phone is fully unlocked  if the imei doesn t match  it won t work  for example  verizon and sprint have compatible imei s  and at t and t mobile are compatible i got a phone  and the imei did not work with my network  which is how i learned about all of this a word on breed  though  they are very easy to talk to  and very helpful  i doubt you will have any trouble reaching someone who can help you get the right phone for your network  i returned my phone with no problems  and they were very understanding about the difficulty      
601,3.0,                       i been having this phone for a couple of months now  i bought it right before going away for training  the speaker   is broken  i sent an email to the sender hoping to get a replacement before leaving  unfortunately they refused until they received the defective item back  that was impossible for me  since i didn t have a replacement  they always want their money upfront  regardless of how they send their items out  which is not fair       
602,5.0,                       i ve only had the phone for several days but it seems fine   what was amazing is that you can transfer via bluetooth all your photos and contacts  everything from your old phone  iphone    to the new phone and then just remove and swap the sim card   done   didn t have to go to the at t place at all      
603,2.0,                    esto es muy extra o ya que no est  empacado en una caja de apple  this is very strange since it is not packed in an apple box        
604,5.0,                       this is the real thing  phone works perfectly  it is at t locked as described  but not a problem if you have them as your carrier      
605,5.0,                       super happy with the purchase  battery health came at     which is well above the guaranteed      no scratches on the exterior of the phone  and there is a screen protector still attached which is actually pretty nice as i am waiting for my blue light screen protector to arrive and i don t have to worry until then  super happy it came with a sim card remover so i didn t have to go into the store to get it changed out  great price  no glitches so far  all around happy      
606,5.0,                       seller was prompt and the phone was flawless  after a couple months  i have had no issues      
607,5.0,                       came exactly how i expected     
608,5.0,                       it took me a while to actually write a review on this because i wanted to be sure about the battery life and use it for a while  i m usually  skeptical about refurbished products because something is usually wrong with it  but this phone works like brand new  i m glad i didn t regret this       
609,5.0,                       in comparison to the      and even    iphone   is a step in the right direction by improving the phone in most aspects  the camera is better  battery life is somewhat improved but far from perfect and it s bigger  i have no complaints with the iphone        
610,1.0,                       speaker stopped working after a month  very disappointed  phone glitches almost everyday      
611,5.0,                       i bought this for my daughter for christmas and she loved it  i was skeptical about the purchase because it was a refurbished iphone but it worked out great  she s had no complaints at all  and it came unlocked so i was able to take it to my local merry pcs store and have it activated immediately  i d purchase this phone again        
612,5.0,                       i bought this iphone for my birthday  i was very skeptical of buying a renewed phone  but it came in basically brand new and everything working well  it came in one day earlier than the expected time and so far everything is great  really pleased with this purchase      
613,1.0,                       the battery only stay    minutes after fully chargei never saw worries iphone like that they don t received even my money when i ship to them       
614,5.0,                       just received it and transferred my data from my icloud  phone appears in perfect condition  i even checked around the corners where it could ve been dropped but it s flawless  went into the battery status in settings and it s at      efficiency  for half the price of a new iphone  i can t justify spending more on my phone than my television  so far so good  but if anything happens to pop up  i ll update my review      
615,1.0,                       the camera never worked and the phone died after  only having it for a few months  super annoyed  they re saying it s  user error         
616,1.0,                       was extremely happy with the phone out of the box   no damage to it whatsoever  i live in poland but bought it when back in the states for vacation   was acting weird with my polish sim card in the us but chalked this up to the fact i was in a different country than my sim card   got back to poland  and problems continued       of the time i have no service  phone or internet   even though i have an unlimited plan   even when in a safe wifi area  i have no service   basically  i m without a phone if i don t have wifi to use whatsapp or messenger   phone is useless   very disappointed      
617,5.0,                       have only had the phone a couple of days but so far it works great   it is an iphone      gb model   it looks brand new and everything functions as it should   a note to straight talk users   that is my carrier and when i put my straight talk sim card in this phone it works great but i went to the straight talk website and logged in so i could transfer my new phone and register it   the website kept giving me an error when i entered the phone s imei or serial number so i called straight talk support after working with me for a while  the rep said  you can t use your current sim card because you have an unlocked phone   you are going to have to buy a new sim card and then register that and the new phone with our  bring your own phone  system on the website    i asked if i did that could i keep my phone number and he said yes   i did some research online and got the impression the the bring your own phone is not for existing customers  but for new customers or existing customers with new phones who want new phone numbers   not sure about that  but my thought is that since the phone works perfect as it is  i am not going to try to upset the apple cart by buying a new sim and trying to register it with straight talk   i think they don t want us users to have unlocked phones and especially ones that were not purchased through the straight talk website or an authorized supplier so i am leaving well enough alone   the phone works fine with my sim card  the only thing is that on the straight talk website it shows i have a samsung galaxy instead of an iphone     no harm  no foul      
618,5.0,                       i was surprised  especially after all this reviews  but i think it was my lucky day  so everything works fine    week use   i tested it in special app  hope it will remain the same      
619,1.0,                       unable to activate with t mobile like advertised  tried over the phone with tmobile and at the tmobile store with new sim card both new cards always said invalid sim card  should have listened to the crappy reviews  amazon renew service is a joke      
620,1.0,                       i would give this seller a   star in everything if i could  do not buy from this seller they sell you unpaid iphones and they are not locked  they can t be connected because they are not paid off so basically useless      
621,4.0,                       unlocked does not mean easy to activate  you must buy a sim card and fight w your service provider to activate it  you better always be home to sign for this item or you will never get it  all this and it was cheaper and easier to get from the boost store      
622,4.0,                       this is a better iphone than the  s and any before it and at same time it s not a better phone than  s or any that have come since i think the renewed standard has set a high bar  one which was not met with my order  there is a visible scratch on the screen that can be seen at an arms reach  i m not sending it back to wait phoneless for a new one  but i think it s a valid complaint  one that is probably common in occurrence but not often acted upon otherwise the screen graphics and interface is really nice  the processor doesn t leave me wanting  and all these things are known by almost all iphone owners  my review is about renewed  and the difficult standard set that may offer more than what this particular  supplier is able to provide      
623,2.0,                       after   weeks of having this phone  there s one problem  the bottom main speaker stopped working and now i can only hear audio from the top speaker  the speaker used for hearing calls  now i can barely hear audio even at max volume  i don t know how to fix this  i guess i got unfortunate and got a bad phone  this shouldn t happen to anybody  by at your own risk      
624,1.0,                       the phone works fine except for the call volume  i can hear fine when the call is on speaker but not when i hold the phone to my ear   i would think that would be tested on a refirbed phone  the company has offered to replace the phone but i would have to return this one  st and be without a phone while i wait

626,5.0,                       i was looking for an older model iphone with a good amount of life left in it  since the   isn t sold new anywhere  this refurbished option seemed worth a try  upon arrival the phone was unlocked and in great shape with only a few minor scrapes on the outside edge  battery life was at     of original  the only small problem i was having was that the response to touch on the screen was intermittent  something with which i could probably manage i decided to ask the seller about a replacement  once i started the return process  with a request for a replacement  the seller communicated very quickly and had a label for me to mail the old phone back that same day the replacement came in as quickly as the old went out  it had a more responsive touch screen and even better battery life  so far no other problems i am very happy with the used   renewed phone and even happier that the seller was so easy to work with  thanks seller was pdi mobile
