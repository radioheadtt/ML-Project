0,5.0 ,                       for years i wore carhartt  until their price whent beyond reasonability  i started looking around for a new standard and tried many  i don t know why i didn t think of dickies early on  because i use their work shirts a lot  i bought my a t shirt   pack to try them out  they were great  i like the heavy weight of the cotton  i haven t had them for more than a couple months now  but have purchased many more  however  the final test is how long they stay really black  die stability in black died cotton is often very hard to come by   it was my biggest complaint of carhartt and another reason i wouldn t accept the  cost increases  so far they re holding up very well through several washings  excellent shirt for the price  you won t be disappointed      
1,3.0 ,                       shirt seems to be of very good quality  but did shrink up after a couple washings to being too short for me  so i ve ordered a couple of xl tall in hopes that they will keep me happy      
2,4.0 ,                       size  xl i like the product  heavy weight tees are hard to find  very durable and very comfortable  the only issue is in the description it says its made if pre shrunk cotton   what does that mean   because my  xl shrunk to a loose fitting xl and shrunk up to about  inches below the belt   which is fine for going out  but not for physical activity or work   yes i dried it  i thought being  pre shrunk  cotton it wouldn t shrink so much  so now i need to order another one and not dry it  otherwise its a nice shirt      
3,5.0 ,                       great quality t shirts  used to buy carhartt till we tried these  similar fit and quality for a lower price     
4,5.0 ,                       xmas gift for my son  bought some last year     
5,4.0 ,                       feels like i m wearing a tee shirt like that in clothes     
6,4.0 ,                       purchased xl dickies shirts from store locally before  but  these seem a little tight for xl  still a good quality work shirt      
7,5.0 ,                       finally a quality pocketed mens tee shirt that s heavy and high quality  i used to buy ll bean but they stopped selling black tee shirts and black v neck tee shirts too  thanks amazon and dickies       
8,5.0 ,                       and i m wearing one of the same ones now  none of them are gone for any reason  and they pass for just another tee in my drawer  just wanted some new ones  any way  if you can afford these  especially the heavyweight  then i think your dreams could come true  gotta have a pocket  though  righht      
9,3.0 ,                       soft  but the sleeves are too short     
10,5.0 ,                       quality shirt     
11,3.0 ,                       heavy but very rough feeling  thought washing would help but not at all  will have to wear a shirt underneath it which defeats the whole purpose  not impressed for a dickie product      
12,5.0 ,                       although we want to purchase clothing made in the u s   most of the quality      cotton attire that we ve considered are union made  seems the same thing that initially helped the u s  labor force  only later to decimate u s  labor  driving manufacturing overseas  is still negatively impacting u s  manufacturing we purchased some union made  expensive       cotton pocket t shirts and the fit is terrible  too small through the chest  historically  and amazingly  these dickies have not only maintained their high quality  truly heavy weight cotton  without being  too  heavyweight   but the fit has been phenomenally consistent over the many years we have been buying them my frame  over           lbs and very physically fit      
13,5.0 ,                       i love    that came fast and those are really cheap     
14,5.0 ,                       i like the feel of these shirts   they feel thick and solid and don t seem like they will get threadbare i ve worn and washed them for several weeks now  the neck is holding strong   my biggest complaint with tee shirts is when the neck stretches out   these are holding up great   i m buying a few more already      
15,4.0 ,                       i just purchased a carhartt tshirt and was disappointed with how thin the fabric was   this dickies shirt compares favorably  the fabric on the dickies shirt is heavier  which i like  and it looks great  the large is a little on the big side compared to other tshirt brands i own  such as champion   but may shrink a bit when it s washed  if you re looking for a heavier cotton tshirt to wear for work or for casual wear  this is a great choice      
16,4.0 ,                       it was a birthday gift for my grandson whose in the navy      
17,5.0 ,                       very nice shirt  it has body and hangs well  the material isn t to thick and just the right weight  my husband really like the extra weight in the material  they wash great with no shrinkage  fits true to size and come in real nice colors  the shirt fits great  great brand great quality  i recommend this shirt for all men for an all around good t shirt that will last many washing and hold its weight all around      
18,5.0 ,                       it s frustrating when i bend over and my pencil falls out so when dickies started adding the pencil chute they became my favorite  dickies tshirts hold up just as well as the higher priced brand       
19,5.0 ,                       best t shirt i can find  well made  nice  heavier than most t shirts in this price range  i am            the x lg is comphy in size  if you want to show off muscles get a large heavy weight etc are just terms the manufactures use to sell product  if you go by ounces per square yard for the material you can get a better idea of fabric weight shirt weight  this info can be found on amazon or manufacture web page these t shirts are heavy weight and the fabric has a nice feel  i recommend       
20,4.0 ,                       black olive looks like brown   not sure why they don t just call it that   was disappointed in the color  material is not soft but not scratchy either  definitely a work shirt good shirts for the price   thicker material so they take more of a pounding so to speak   good for working in jobs that require a heavier duty shirt like construction   have washed and dried on normal heat  no shrinkage      
21,5.0 ,                       my husband loves these shirts   the heavier weight is great and they keep their shape  the neck does not get stretched out   we are replacing his first purchases nearly two years ago   and he still wears them   the colors on the bright ones are a little duller but still look good enough for everyday      
22,5.0 ,                       thick strong comfortable cotton tshirt  love it  i am a          lb woman and needed a good work shirt  i got this one and am really happy  ordered medium  could have gone small if i wanted it tight  which i didn t  it fits appropriately  soft and i can tell it will last  great color  too     
23,5.0 ,                       this is the first dickies t shirt i ve purchased  since it s the first  i wanted to see how the t shirt fits  its finish  and construction  it s made using nice  heavyweight material  but still soft  and should be great while working  i looked specifically for a t shirt with a pocket and this dickies t shirt meets what i was looking for  i ll wear this t shirt for a while  time will tell if i will purchase another dickies t shirt      
24,3.0 ,                       certainly heavyweight but there are two issues   put t shirt on to check fit   good fit   then washed them before wearing however they shrink more than my regular weight dickies t shirts   now they just go below my belt and shoulders are a bit tight after washing one time   worried they will shrink even more as i wash them again   the pocket is encroaching the arm pit  way off normal position for a pocket      
25,5.0 ,                       bought for my boyfriend in several colors  they re heavy material and good quality  he wears a medium and the medium fit him perfect      
26,5.0 ,                       good durable pocket t shirt     
27,5.0 ,                       i am a big fan of these t shirts   i have about       of them   they re well made  durable  and fit nicely   no need to buy the high price shirts  these will do nicely      
28,5.0 ,                       i just received these pocketed t shirts this afternoon  weighing in at      oz  on my kitchen scale  they were exactly what i was looking for     until i washed and dried them on low heat  the shrinkage was more to a large than the extra large that i had ordered  so i will return them and see if i can find  xl  granted  they are heavyweight cotton  and the colors look great  but the shrinkage is more than i expected update  i re ordered   more shirts in  xlm washed and dried them on low heat  and they shrunk down about     size  this is perfect for me  and that s all that matters  i will buy these again in the near future  as these are very comfortable heavyweight cotton compared to what i currently own from lands end  which cost twice as much  and are half the weight   by the way these weighed in at      oz      
29,5.0 ,                       fantastic quality  thick fabric and seems very durable   a bargain price  same price as no name brand shirts   and i will be buying more      
30,5.0 ,                       nothing cheap about the quality of this shirt  exactly what i was looking for  very heavy thick white pocket t      
31,5.0 ,                       fits just fine   husband really liked this shirt   a good thickness   does up well  he likes the way it hangs on him   wish i had ordered more   a great buy      
32,4.0 ,                       great shirt for the price  these are not thin shirts that will wear out quickly my grandfather was an airplane mechanic and always wore these at work  now i see why  quality product  easily the best work shirts i have ever owned not only are they durable and comfortable but the look good as well  just because you have a  dirty job  doesn t mean you can t look sharp while you do it      
33,5.0 ,                       quality  made well       cotton    which means no lint balling  i hate lint balling  i hate lint balling in a t shirt  i hate lint balling in socks  i hate lint balling  this t shirt in a word  substantial      
34,4.0 ,                       very long  looks silly untucked  good quality is appears      
35,1.0 ,                       the shirt fit amazingly great when i received it out of the bag  i followed all the directions exactly to wash it  it shrunk about a full size smaller  this has never happened to any dickies shirts i bought in the past do not recommend at all      
36,5.0 ,                       i have these shirts in just about every color  they are very durable shirts      
37,5.0 ,                       material strong yet soft next to body  excellent for working in  or anytime      
38,5.0 ,                       top quality heavy weight t shirt with pocket  minimal shrinkage  i normally wear a size medium dress shirt  but most t shirts i buy large because of shrinking  this shirt a medium fits      
39,5.0 ,                       great work shirt     
40,5.0 ,                       i love these   they fit great  aren t too short  i hate too short shirts    the material is nice and thick  but not uncomfortable   and the price is right      
41,4.0 ,                       like that material is very heavy duty  they wash and wear for a very long time and maintain their structure well

43,2.0 ,                       bought to wear at work  came with a small hole in the back  inside the shirt was a green sticker next to the hole      
44,5.0 ,                       i m a fat guy    lbs and     i wear  xl  fits great  loose but not baggy  i like the thickness  the only thing i don t like is the black starts to fade away after so many washes but they are cheap shirts  most shirts are

46,1.0 ,                       i buy my dickies shirts from walmart normally and the fit on these are not even close to the others i buy  although they are tagged as dickies i m skeptical they are authentic      
47,2.0 ,                       runs small and short

53,5.0 ,                       bought them for work when i go back      
54,5.0 ,                       i love these tee shirts and all of the colors  they are offered in multi sizes and i know one size will be perfect for you i found my size on the first purchase of several colors  they were much better than expected      
55,2.0 ,                       not a very good fit like the others i purchased in stores     
56,5.0 ,                       have tried several other brands of t shirts  they all fit tighter than the indicated size   dickies shirts are true to size and fit perfectly  even after being washed   highly recommend      
57,1.0 ,                       ordered a size large as i wear in every work shirt  this one however shrank in an odd way on low heat dry  the fit is great everywhere except the shoulders that shrank a ton  making it  uncomfortable and has made this into a yard work or garage work shirt only      
58,5.0 ,                       this is a comfortable  durable go to heavy duty t shirt for work  the pocket is sized appropriately  not too small  not too large   and can securely hold items such eyeglasses  a small notebook  or a mobile phone  iphone x  for example   holds up well to multiple washings  limited fading  stretching  or loss of shape  a solid value      
59,5.0 ,                       heck yes for the price   unbelievable quality for     work shirt   i purchased   for a trial run and bought   more since   great tshirt   turned me into dickies fan      
60,5.0 ,                       love the heavy thickness     
61,5.0 ,                       terrific tee        cotton     poly   wash wears well   remove from dryer asap for a wrinkle free shirt   i bought an additional   tees after receiving the first order   good value especially since amazon has them on sale   they are well made and are of a heavier weight  neck is not tight  shirt does not feel cheap   delivery was swift  i am one happy camper  thank you amazon         
62,5.0 ,                       these t shirts are just what you d expect from dickies   a t shirt to do work in  i was tired of buying t shirts that seem to be made of thinner and thinner material  after a few washing  they are ready for the rag bag  not these t s   i do a lot of work in the yard and garage  i m running farm equipment  chainsaws  wrenching under the jeep  you name it  i m always getting my shirt caught on something and then rip  the dickies t shirts can withstand more abuse than your average t shirt  because they are a little thicker  they can get warm in the summer  but are great for the fall  winter and spring      
63,5.0 ,                       i will start by i am          lbs and it s hard to find shorts that fit just right  i m short and very bride  the shirts fit great  they are very heavy duty  did shrink a little after the first wash but shrunk evenly with and length  they are sized a little big but not enough to be to baggy  just right for good movement and again very comfortable  i wore cathart until i tried these dickies shirts  slightly better quality than carhart but more comfortable and more durable and cheaper      
64,5.0 ,                       grat fit   comfortable     
65,3.0 ,                       quick safe undamaged delivery  fits well  except the i do not care for the label on pocket kept it anyway hard to find the ones without label on t shirt pocket  update  bought newer ones since revieweed  it appears only  the white t shirts are     cotton and now are medium weight feel as of        no longer the heavier softer cotton feel they once had  like in         era      
66,5.0 ,                       nice shirt     
67,5.0 ,                       fits just like i like after washing  a little loose but that s what i like     
68,2.0 ,                       not      polyester so they don t wick     
69,5.0 ,                       i m a repeat buyer  quality  heavier weight materials  well made and consistent sizes  i like heavy weight t shirts and these fit the bill  will buy again when needed      
70,3.0 ,                       price was a bit high   i will let you know about their longevity later       
71,5.0 ,                       these are my favorite casual shirts well made and excellent price comfortable and machine washable if you choose your usual size  these will be a tad large which for me is comfortable i have used them for years and the colors available allows me to vary appearance which my wife likes highly recommended      
72,5.0 ,                       fits just right for me  great shirt for the money      
73,5.0 ,                       shirt length and fits right     
74,5.0 ,                       i like dickies tee shirts because they fit well and are good quality  they last a long time       
75,5.0 ,                       these dickies shirts are really good  they feel very durable and look good on me  for the price  you cant go wrong  anyways i have no complaints  try them for your self      
76,5.0 ,                       if you like a heavyweight t shirt material  like they all used to be   dickie s are the best  i ve had many brands  so many t shirts today are thin and do not hold up well      
77,5.0 ,                       i love the thickness  i get x large as i like a loose comfortable fit   i m       and    lbs and wear a    blazer  if you want a thick  solid and well made t  this is the best available wife s  get him a couple for christmas  he ll without a doubt love them for around the house in colder weather  i ve got   and i m getting more      
78,5.0 ,                       great fit   comfortable     
79,5.0 ,                       i like that they re pre washed so you don t run the risk of then not fitting after the first wash  especially because i bought them as a gift      
80,5.0 ,                       nothing to dislike   these dickie s t shirts are heavy weight  but comfortable cotton material  very nicely sown together and selling for a reasonable to low price  check around  price varies between     and     per t shirt and by color    if you prefer a very light cotton fabric  these may not be to your liking   but the heavyweights are durable  colorfast  so far after    washings  are fine on their own for for mild weather and make a fine base layer in cooler weather   i don t know where else you can find this quality for this price      
81,1.0 ,                       i ordered   of these medium size different colors  they all fit me well before washing  these are labeled pre shrunked  after only one washing they all had became size small and fit like a sausage casing  i tried to return or get these replaced with large size but the return online of amazon does not work at all and i do not know what to do  they do not have a telephone service number and it is only a few days before the deadline for returns kick in for my orders  i hope amazon reads this  star one      
82,5.0 ,                       nice heavy      cotton         
83,5.0 ,                       nice pocket t shirt  heavyweight as described  fits well  xxl      
84,5.0 ,                       dickies makes good clothes   sturdy   long lasting   this is no different    it s actually a bit beefier than most t shirts    seems well made and the seams are done nicely   i can recommend      
85,4.0 ,                       good value     
86,4.0 ,                       my husband and son both extra large and this shirt is a tad too small at extra large  i ordered them  x large and it was better fit  my husband is      and     pounds  guess it depends on how loose or tight you want your shirt to fit  my husband does construction so like to have room to move  i did like the thickness  so many shirts i find now are much thinner than they used to be      
87,5.0 ,                       like the material and workmanship   the fit was as described      
88,3.0 ,                       disappointed that it wasn t large enough to match my stafford tees   want made in usa  shirt was made in mexico  but not overseas      
89,5.0 ,                       just what i ordered  the color was the same as how it looked on my fire  it is well made  and made with quality material  and it s soft even before washing    no one wants to hug their hubby in a rough shirt and this shirt is snuggle worthy  thanks dickies    i will be buying more  and  thanks to amazon who makes it so easy and fast to order the things my family need      
90,5.0 ,                       product and quality     
91,5.0 ,                       i wore one of the tees this past weekend and everything seem good  nice fitting tee   i have a question  will they shrink after every time i wash them      
92,5.0 ,                       great fit   comfortable     
93,5.0 ,                       i started wearing dickies when i was working on a dusty summer  home remodel job  i needed a shirt pocket and i didn t want to wear a button up shirt i had been putting my carpenter s pencil in my back pocket  but it would break when i sat or squatted  i bought the first dickies t shirt just so i d have somewhere to put a pencil  but  i discovered that the dickies shirts are very durable and the knit neck doesn t stretch out as quickly some of the other pocketed t shirts do  i also like the cotton  some of the other  work  t shirts use synthetic material  i like the feel of cotton i tend to buy the dark colors dickies   so they don t work very well under dress shirts  but  i wear dickies under the heavy sports shirts or pendleton shirts i often wear in the fall  winter and spring      
94,1.0 ,                       not      cotton     cotton      polyester  i bought a number of these in different colors  the heather grey are a blend  deceptive     they all feel like sandpaper to the skin  i have tried washing and softening them      times  no luck  i can t wear any of them for more than a few minutes      
95,5.0 ,                       good brand  nice shirt  one of my favorites      
96,1.0 ,                       i ve been buying dickies t shirts for quite some time and never had one shrink  that has passed this and another i bought shrunk at least one size      
97,4.0 ,                       the cotton material is heavy weight and the length of the shirt is long  as shown in the photo  it has a pocket   something i wanted that may not be for everyone  the only minor negative is the  dickies  logo on the pocket   i would have preferred solid black  no logo  overall  this seems to be a very well made t shirt that should last last many years      
98,5.0 ,                       great for hunting in warmer weather      
99,5.0 ,                       t shirt was a good weight  very roomy even after washing  really looks good and fit well  a really good  economical find in this market      
100,5.0 ,                       nice shirt fabric is heavier weight  yet is not too hot  fits good even though i am slim  i am very happy  with the quality      
101,5.0 ,                       dickies t shirts are always good looking  an excellent cotton and weight and still have a pocket  sometimes hard to find  i try to pick up a few when they are on sale  over time the colors  red  do fade a bit but they so always look good      
102,5.0 ,                       great fit and quality shirt  shrank just slightly but we wanted that  my son is between a medium and a large men s and we bought a large  nice thick cotton      
103,5.0 ,                       these are really well made shirts  i work as a mechanic for a construction company and my clothes take a tremendous amount of abuse  these dickies ts last for months and will go through the wash repeatedly  by the time the color has finally faded the shirt is about worn out but has given a great deal of service for the price  recommended      
104,5.0 ,                       purchased for my    year old son who is hard on everything   these shirts are inexpensive but the thickness and fit seem to suit my teen perfectly   would buy more       
105,5.0 ,                       i ve been wearing carhartt heavyweight pocket t shirts for years  this dickies heavyweight      cotton t shirt is now the one i ll be buying  i work hard in these shirts  and i stay cooler with      cotton instead of the new blended treated fabrics  dickies is offering what the other companies used to offer  a quality heavyweight work shirt that stays cool on the skin  i ll be purchasing more of these      
106,5.0 ,                       they are very well made  heavy duty stitching  should last for a while and keep it s shape     
107,5.0 ,                       its a pockets shirt and its a long tail  just what i need for the professional look  worth the price paid      
108,3.0 ,                       good     
109,4.0 ,                       the fit is perfect for me  the fabric looks great and is substantial  it is a little on the heavy side and       cotton so it can seem a little warm  it does not cool like a      cotton does  but i do live in phoenix so cotton is the way to go  in a little cooler weather      degrees   this is perfect and really looks so much better than a plain color  it is  heather  like   did i mention the price  you can t beat it   i have bought   so far      
110,5.0 ,                       these are my new favorite t shirts  i ve bought at least a dozen of them   not only do they fit well  but they are of great quality and the material seems heavy  not like most t shirts today   they remind me of the quality of gap s t shirts back in the   s  versus the poor quality material they sell today    i like the large selection of colors as well   i haven t noticed much shrinkage or fading yet from washing   drying      
111,5.0 ,                       well made quality material kudos to dickies     
112,3.0 ,                       don t like the material  shirt feels jersey like  like cheap sheets  stretchy  bit shorter than i like  much prefer the weav  fit  and length of wrangler riggs ts      
113,5.0 ,                       really like this shirt   well made  sturdy fabric   great value     
114,5.0 ,                       wow  this is an incredible shirt   the material is soft and thick   the fit is perfect   i washed this shirt  yesterday  and there wasn t any shrinkage i will  definitely  continue to purchase  dickies  shirts    as long as they continue to be cost effective thank you for a great shirt      
115,5.0 ,                       my husband loves these shirts  they are heavy and not that thin  stretch fabric you usually get in t shirts these days  the fit is true to size or just slightly larger  i ordered   and will probably order more      
116,5.0 ,                       i m a       chest they try on big and shrink a little after first wash     
117,5.0 ,                       excellent quality  i am sure these will last a long time  very well made  the material is thick the way t shirts used to be and is obviously high quality material  only thing is they need a few washings to really soften up and get that cotton soft feel to them but   so what  these t shirts are great      
118,5.0 ,                       was looking for a good quality pocket tee for my husband   we know the dickies brand name from other work shirts he s had   this shirt washed well  no shrinkage  he s happy      
119,5.0 ,                       these are the shirts that my husband prefers   they last a long time  the colors are good and don t fade fast   and they are comfortable      
120,5.0 ,                       that s what i wanted and it s hard to get anymore      
121,5.0 ,                       theyre perfect  you can never go wrong with duckies tshirts     
122,5.0 ,                       i buy these for my husband as it is hard to find t shirts with pockets  quality   material is great  they could make them a little longer  but i hang dry almost everything so they dont shrink up  i have bought   or more short      long sleeve of this brand   will most definitely buy more      
123,5.0 ,                       perfect buying experience  arrived on time and as described  great transaction      
124,5.0 ,                       these are great quality and feel great for any occasion  can t beat the quality x price mix here  they also look good      
125,5.0 ,                       love the heavier weight  the t shirt does shrink     of a size after wash and dry  i bought xl  very roomy  a bit large  however  after washing and drying  perfect  just don t want anymore shrinkage  buy every color      
126,5.0 ,                       high quality product  perfect fit  now own three of these and use regularly      
127,5.0 ,                       my job has me outside mowing  trimming  digging  and painting among many other physical activities so it was great to find a tough comfortable shirt available in orange  a must for my job that s frequently near busy roads  i m roughly          and the large fits great though it is a little long which i happen to like  the shirt is thick enough to provide a bit of shielding from my edger s flak so that s a major plus for me and the chest pocket comes in handy more than you might realize at first glance  all of this is combined with a low price tag so you can t go wrong  i ve been wearing these all summer and will continue to do so      
128,5.0 ,                       i like the length of the shirt   it s extra long   color does not bleed in the wash looking to get more     
129,3.0 ,                       these shirts have been great  until my last order   nice heavy weight  fits good and true to size but   they have changed  as others have mentioned the pocket is now under the armpit  others i have ordered  exact same ad offering  were nice  the little dickies logo on the pocket was always on my left chest  but this last shirt the logo and corner of the pocket disappears under the armpit  leads me to believe these are seconds or rejects   anything i put in the pocket will now rub under the arm  i only ordered   this time because they were sold out on a lot of the other colors  i will just keep it as opposed to sending it back because i washed it before wearing it for the first time  too bad because i am afraid to order them again      
130,5.0 ,                       i have a few of these shirts   very heavyweight and durable   i definitely recommend if you want a heavyweight shirt  and i will also buy again      
131,3.0 ,                       i like dickie s for work but their sizes are all over the place  one shirt i wear an xl and then the next i need a  xl  it all depends on the thickness of then material  their thinner safety orange and yellow shirts from w mart fit perfect as a xl but then the thicker one are too small and need an  xl  then i got some that were really heavy duty thicker material shirts and they are huge as an  xl  to the point where they look ridiculous to wear      
132,5.0 ,                       the shirts fit very well and are excellently made      
133,5.0 ,                       it definitely runs big   i got a medium  i am somewhere between a medium and a large  and it fits like an xl  but still  this is a thick  durable shirt      
134,5.0 ,                       nice heavier weight t shirt   purchased size medium for  my son   he is  ft but thin so the medium was the better choice      
135,5.0 ,                       these t shirts are made well  my husband is very pleased with them      
136,1.0 ,                       the neckline stretched out quickly      
137,1.0 ,                       i bought   shirts   months ago  now they are all shop rags  because of grease stains that cannot be removed  this is not true of any other t shirt i own  you ve been warned      
138,5.0 ,                       i got this for my hubby s birthday early dec   he loves it     soft  flowing with body movement  fits really well his wide shoulders  and some cool color options      
139,3.0 ,                       on the first wash my two shirts shrunk from a xl to a l  keep that in consideration  no real big deal for me since i m on a weight reduction plan      
140,5.0 ,                       true to size     
141,5.0 ,                       this is a heavyweight all cotton tee shirt that can be comfortably worn as your primary outer shirt   i wear tees every day  and these are the softest  most comfortable  and most durable ones i ve ever worn      
142,2.0 ,                       i just wanted some simple shirts  neutral colors  no fuss  but  the sizes were odd  then i found that they were inconsistent  of the same shirt  and the same size  they were physically different sizes  not only that  but the stitching is commonly off  there are all kinds of weird angles and bulges that washing does not even out  these aren t worth it  even as work shirts  i prefer hanes beefy ts  the quality and sizing is far more consistent      
143,5.0 ,                       high quality  thick cotton   not a cheap product  would buy it again   this is my second purchase     
144,2.0 ,                       these heavy ts are not the soft cotton i am used to getting from dickie s  these are rough and uncomfortable  i don t know why manufacturing doesn t remain consistent within brands      
145,5.0 ,                       great quality     
146,4.0 ,                       heavyweight materials is put together well  but it s really big through the chest   i ordered a medium expecting a tighter fit  but after a trip through the washer and dryer  it s still too bulky to wear underneath a flannel shirt      
147,5.0 ,                       these shirts are well made  with a thicker than normal t shirt material  they seem sturdy  and i anticipate them lasting quite a while      
148,5.0 ,                       purchased one to try the fit in large  i typically wear an xl   first use the neck was to small  after washing two time it has become softer  and more loose around my    inch neck  i especially like the heavy wide neck band   my shoulders are xl and my chest is     i can wear either large or extra large comfortably but i like a snug fit that will stretch after    minutes of use in the large size so i am buying   more in different colors  they should last about   to   years as they are the same quality as j c penny stafford heavy weight v neck that i typically get   years of use      
149,5.0 ,                       this is a very well made shirt  the fabric is a bit more substantial than normal t shirt material  the sewing is top quality   i highly recommend this product      
150,5.0 ,                       excelente     
151,4.0 ,                       i bought these for my fianc   and was impressed with the quality  i was not impressed with the white chalky looking sweat rings that appear every time he wears it  it washes out but then comes back next time he wears sweats them      
152,5.0 ,                       this shirt was worth the purchase  good quality  true to color      
153,5.0 ,                       nothing compares with a      cotton t shirt for comfort and utility  and i have tried almost every manufacturer of t shirts out  there   i can t say that i am disappointed with any of them   however  over time  i have come to prefer heavy weight t shirts  with a pocket  and there are not that many labels making these   i have become rather picky about my t s over time  and have not been completely satisfied with any of the ones that i had bought       until now   i purchased couple of these a few months back  and was immediately  impressed with the quality  fit and feel of these t shirts   it is all that i buy now  and have them in most of the available colors   i don t even mind the logo on the pocket anymore      
154,2.0 ,                       the shirt did fit great  i had to update my review after   wash  shrunk so much i had to throw it out  didn t fit l anymore     
155,4.0 ,                       shirt material is thicker than a regular tee shirt  fits well  the pocket is nice  but is in an odd spot  closer to the arm pit than normal      
156,5.0 ,                       i got tired of those thin flimsy t shirts from other stores that just don t last long at all  this is a perfect replacement  it fits me well im     and    lbs and the  xl fits nicely  for the price i feel its a good purchase its a great work shirt that have lasted me for quite awhile with no issues    stars from me      
157,5.0 ,                       nice heavy material  dickies brings the quality      
158,5.0 ,                       love these shirts  full cut  thick soft cotton fabric  good sized pocket  reinforced neckband that won t sag  perfect basic cotton tee      
159,5.0 ,                       these t shirts are made from a thicker material than most t shirts  the shirt feels substantial and is well constructed   exactly what my husband was wanting    thank you      
160,1.0 ,                       well i opened the package and the shirt arrived with a gash in it  hard for me to do that with only opening it by pulling the thin plastic  shirt was big for someone who normally wears a large  let s see how easy returning a t shirt is going to be      
161,1.0 ,                       i have worn dickies clothing for more than    years   i ordered   dickies men s short sleeve heavyweight crew neck pocket t shirts     black and   dark blue   i washed them several times and wore them for work several times   unfortunately  they never softened up   they feel more like burlap and don t hang right when worn      
162,3.0 ,                       shirt felt like it was made of strong thick fabric  i wear medium in almost every t shirt i own but this was way too big  i m a skinny guy with skinny arms  the shirt is extremely long  arm holes and diameter of bottom of shirt opening are huge as well i didn t even bother exchanging for a small as i doubt it would be a drastic difference  i just asked for a refund  good for big beer belly guys with big arms but i m not one of them      
163,5.0 ,                       the material is heavier than ordinary tshirts but i wanted that  i ordered a size up expecting shrinkage from the laundering and there is shrinkage  overall my husband loves the color  fit  and the texture of the tshirt      
164,5.0 ,                       good quality  my husband wears them daily and likes them  he says they are better fitting and quality than those he has had recently  will buy them again      
165,4.0 ,                       i have the same tee that are several years old the after wash fit is fine but laying one washed from you on top of my old one and i found the sleeves about two inches short on the new one the pocket smaller and about an inch to the left  i carry my single fold wallet in the pocket  the wallet does not fit in the new one  fits fine in my old ones      
166,5.0 ,                       this is old school type shirt that feels good when put on      
167,5.0 ,                       if you know  you know  if you dont  watch more seinfeld  this is my golden boy  i love this shirt     
168,5.0 ,                       i like the fact they dont have tags on the neck area  they didnt shrink when washed and kept the color     
169,4.0 ,                       this was a gift but was told it s great      
170,5.0 ,                       one of the better tee shirts  nice fit  comfortable  did not shrink when washed   i will be buying more      
171,5.0 ,                       the only quality pocket crew neck t shirt left on the market   they wear very well and the neck will retain their shape      
172,5.0 ,                       nice heavyweight tee shirt   seems well made and i expect it will outlast others i paid more for   as usual  i am very pleased with dickies brand      
173,5.0 ,                       perfect work shirt   does not fade   went through many washes   perfect sizing just long  lose enough while on  jobsite       
174,5.0 ,                       i am       and    lbs and normally wear a size large t shirt  i had to get this in a medium because they run big  i am a large in hanes  gildan  canvas  goodfellow  uniqlo  and fruit of the loom t shirts  when i hold this shirt up to any of my large t shirts they look almost identical except these dickies shirts are about   inches longer      
175,4.0 ,                       my husband likes plain black pocket ts for work  and they aren t always easy to find in the store  i use to buy similar dickies ones at my walmart  however  for some reason  they don t carry them any more in my store  i ordered these thinking they would be the same as the walmart dickies ones  but they are a little different  they material is a little thinner and slightly rougher than ones i ve previously purchased  they were a smidge big  but after washing they fit fine  the material did feel softer after washing  would purchase again      
176,1.0 ,                       shirt dimensions measure differently than another shirt ordered at the exact sometime from same source  material is stiff and scratchy  very unlike dickies shirts available in stores  one shirt fits well while another fits oddly smaller      
177,2.0 ,                       when i put it on new i really liked it   it lost a good   inches in length in the wash   not acceptable      
178,1.0 ,                       it fit great when i first got it  washed it and dried it once  now it s way too small and the bottom of the shirt doesn t even cover my belly  not your typical dickies quality item in my opinion      
179,5.0 ,                       it s  a very nice feeling one has while wearing it  great color   warm  comfy and fashionable no stress while wearing it      
180,3.0 ,                       it fits ok  other than it s short  my husband looks like he s wearing his little brother shirt  i always order xl and they re fine  but the last two were short  i m going with the xl tall next time  he s           
181,2.0 ,                       if you re slightly fat  go to the store and try stuff on   the guessing game on what looks good won t work with these child size stripper shirts      
182,5.0 ,                       these tee shirts are really nice  especially for the price    the material is thick  which i ve always liked  similar to a carhart tee thickness  but at a better price    the neck does not shrink or shrivel  and the breast pocket does not pucker   they re a perfect tee      
183,5.0 ,                       bought for my husband who is tall  it s a nice heavy weight tshirt and we both love the color  i think it s a great value and fits great     
184,5.0 ,                       that material is thick and very supportive   the collar on this shirt will not stretch out or become loose   just wish there were more colors available      
185,5.0 ,                       this t shirt has a thickness to it that others don t  perfect for working in  doesn t rip like the thin ones  cost a little more  but will last a lot longer  have bought more and will continue to do so      
186,5.0 ,                       a great shirt washes up great and stains come out  nice thick fabric  i m ordering more     
187,5.0 ,                       love these shirts  and the pocket is a bonus      
188,5.0 ,                       great     
189,2.0 ,                       just not cut right for me   chest is too tight while shoulder width is correct  waist and length are good      
190,5.0 ,                       i really like these shirts they fit well and don t shrink too bad except for the length they seem tough i work as a mechanic and have to wear plain shirts where i work so i have purchased some of these to try a lot of shirts shrink too much for me at xl and i like thicker tougher shirts for work they are great     
191,5.0 ,                       heavy weight  great look  my husbands favorite tee  it looks expensive      
192,5.0 ,                       bought for my son and he likes the tees      
193,4.0 ,                       fits perfectly for an xl  material is thick and durable  a little stiff out of the washer and dryer  ironing makes it softer      
194,4.0 ,                       nice shirt  definitely will wear it under a flannel this fall here s why it s not five stars  really not big deals  thinner than what comments and descriptions lead you to believe sizing  so usually i m sitting between a  x and an xl but typically i fill out the xl with a large frame bulky athletic build while sitting comfortable with the  x  in this order  i got an xl and it almost seems like i could drop down to a large  the shirt fits but for those of you who wear xl that are on the taller thinner side  not that short thicker side  i m          lbs   i would definitely go to an l or else you might be swimming in it overall  nice shirt and i m satisfied     
195,5.0 ,                       pk     
196,4.0 ,                       but good quality  it will last     
197,2.0 ,                       this product came to me with a good fit   large       cotton after very carefully washing it so not to shrink it much  it shrunk too much now  it s not a good fit      
198,5.0 ,                       i need some thick shirts that are casual  these are the best i ve bought  i wait for the price to come down to ten dollars and then i buy them  for that price there is nothing better      
199,1.0 ,                       not as advertised   each package contains one shirt not two as per the description  duluth is a much better shirt for a few more dollars      
200,5.0 ,                       i buy these for my husband who works in manufacturing  and he loves them   the quality of the shirts are well worth buying as they hold up wash after wash with no fading  shrinking  or stretching out of shape   he just loves the pen holder in the pocket tee   i buy these over hanes  fruit of the loom and gildan as they are just made better      
201,5.0 ,                       these are great shirts   not made with that flimsy material that looks like crepe paper after its washed   the neck is a nice crew neck instead of the  new look  thin strip of material that doesn t hold it s shape   a great shirt that will hold up for a while      
202,4.0 ,                       i like the heavy material  slot for pens  and the fit i don t like how fast it fades but all shirts fade      
203,5.0 ,                       very nice texture for a work shirt   color very vibrant      
204,5.0 ,                       this is a quality t shirt for work or leasure  the color is good and the fit is as expected  a  transaction      
205,4.0 ,                       like most dickies products now its hit or miss  it was a bit big for me  i washed it and put it in the dryer and it shrunk a bit  but fits better then it did before i washed it  no complaints  shirt is thick  good value for the money      
206,5.0 ,                       we will be back again to purchase these      
207,5.0 ,                       i wear these for work  construction  and they are consistently the best as far as comfort  weight  and durability      
208,3.0 ,                       it s a work shirt  but it sits on you like a box  i m        so prefer a tapered fit  this is formless  material is thick  and i m sure will be sturdy  but thicker than i prefer  also  it s got a pronounced neck ring which is annoying  all in all  it s just a work shirt without any thought of fit  also  it did shrink close to      which i didn t mind because was hoping for a better fit      
209,5.0 ,                       i do a lot of work on the farm and it s pretty hot in my area when working   t shirts are my preferred covering when working and dicky s have always been my favorite   the stores in my area rarely carry medium sizes and rarely carry any other color than grey or blue   those that i buy at the store are not as good of quality as i get at this vendor   good heavy durably fabric that breaths just fine for me   might be paying a little more at this site but the array of colors they offer and in my size  for a better t shirt is worth my time and money     
210,5.0 ,                       these shirts are twice as thick as your typical t shirt  they re perfect for a work shirt  they breathe well and fit just right  i m         lbs and after a couple of washes they shrunk a little bit honestly i like the way they fit now than when i first tried them on  you can t go wrong with the price or quality of these shirts     
211,5.0 ,                       i like the mid weight of the fabric and the side seam construction  it makes these t shirts feel more substantial  look  and hold up better in my opinion  i have these in a few colors and all of them fit the same a little on the roomier side but snug up after a cold wash  got these in   different colors and probably will stock up on more as these will replace my  beefy t s  that simply don t hold their shape      
212,5.0 ,                       i like     cotton shirts if they have polyester in them they usually pill  i only buy      cotton shirts      
213,5.0 ,                       i usually by tshirts from fruit of the loom     bucks for     i splurged for these over eleven dollars each   i got what i expected one thing i didn t expect was the glue that stayed on the shirt when i took that tags off      
214,3.0 ,                       i purchased this product for my husband and i am not happy with it  the material is very dry  stiff  it just doesn t look right on my husband and he does not feel comfortable in it either      
215,5.0 ,                         star product      
216,5.0 ,                       great heavyweight work t shirt with ample room on chest   arms      
217,5.0 ,                             
218,2.0 ,                       after reading the reviews and measurements about the sizes  i went with the large  which is usually just right in length at sleeves and overall  but almost always too large at the waist and chest anyway  when i got it and tried it on it fit great  although the sleeves were just on the verge of being too short for my liking  since i m on the skinnier side with narrower shoulders   i was happy with it  and seeing that it was  pre shrunk  i figured i d be good   after washing it in cold water and putting it on an air dry in the dryer  no heat   it came out quite a bit shorter in over all length and at the sleeves and now is just way too short for my liking  which in unfortunate since i bought an extra before i washed the first one  so once again i m stuck with more clothes that don t fit   everything else is fine except for arm and waist length  which unfortunately makes up half of the overall fit and look of a shirt   don t fall for the  pre shrunk   it will shrink just as much as every other cotton shirt   i bet it would shrink even more if i actually used any amount of heat to dry it fwiw  i m about        and    lbs   maybe the large tall size would work out better  but i m afraid to waste any more money on these guessing games  and with my luck it would end up looking like a dress  even after washing and drying      
219,5.0 ,                       been buying these for   years now for my dad  he always raves about these shirts so whenever christmas or fathers day rolls around i buy a few  sturdy cotton not too thin or thick and fits him perfectly as he has a long torso      
220,5.0 ,                       these are light weight great for summer many colors to choose from my husband loves these      
221,5.0 ,                       i bought these shirts to have a thick t shirt while doing weight lifting  especially squats   these shirts are thick enough that the bar knurl does not aggravate the skin and doesn t slip  as a bonus  absorbs a lot of sweat  perfect      
222,2.0 ,                       it wares like it is on backwards and pocket is close to being under armpit     
223,5.0 ,                       these are very good quality  thick cotton with sturdy seams      
224,5.0 ,                       i finally found a heavy duty white t shirt that holds up to washing  doesn t stretch  and just looks damn good   maybe more expensive than the   packs of t shirts you ll find at dept  stores  but way more worth it i bought the xl   i m          wear a   suit jacket  and evenly proportioned and the fit is fine  even after washing      
225,2.0 ,                       was not certain of sizing  so purchased   large and   x large   price is right  wash dry a few times make up my mind and buy    next time around   not much shrinkage  looked at label       cotton and     polyester   wanted      cotton heavy duty  that is why a purchased the tee shirt   maybe it is me  but there seems to be a difference between      and       in summer heat   disappointed  not as advertised   not certain whose fault in mis labeling the product   amazon or the merchant   thoughts   have to examine products before washing next time around   just don t like returning things      
226,5.0 ,                       these are high quality tee shirts   they are made with a heavy fabric that fit just right  not too loose   i wear a     sports coat and ordered a large tee shirt   also  after washing and drying  they fold perfectly   will be ordering more      
227,2.0 ,                       very heavy weight   like the pen slot   not for summer   good for all other seasons good value for the money   change my mind  faded after   washes   the collar is falling apart     
228,5.0 ,                       i bought this shirt for my husband to work in   he loves the material and its durability   this is why he bought the same brand after the ones that lasted for years finally gave out      
229,5.0 ,                       i have a few older dickies tee shirts that have held up better than my carhartt tees and they were about half the price  i ordered these new ones and i habe two small complaints  first they put a long tag along the left seem that bothers my side  scratches  maybe it will get better with more washing  second  they sewed a pen slot into the pocket  i am a smoker and now it is harder to put smokes and a bic lighter into the pocket      
230,4.0 ,                       it s a quality well made tee shirt  but the lay out cut is bulky looking for a medium size and material could be much more softer too  color is a nice heather chocolate brown      
231,2.0 ,                       searched for a pocket tee   liked the looks and bought   should have read more closely   this is as thick and heavy as a horse blanket   highly recommended for iceland  maybe      
232,4.0 ,                       these are all i buy for my husband now for work  good shirt for the money  the tall is too long for someone who doesn t tuck      
233,5.0 ,                       i like shirt it great shirt it has a pocket and wear good very good shirt   get you like it   thank you for the great shirt     
234,5.0 ,                       value     
235,5.0 ,                       fits perfect for a big guy           lbs  usually these are too long if you get them to fit your chest  nice heavier material feels like it should last longer than ordinary tee  would recommend this shirt      
236,5.0 ,                       i personally find the material too rough  but i m not wearing it   my husband thinks it s the most comfortable shirt in the history of the world  this is our second order  i think he now has every color  and several doubles   the size large fits him perfectly      
237,4.0 ,                       dickie makes very good t shirts  i am happy with this purchase  the heft of the fabric is better than most      
238,4.0 ,                       well made heavyweight tee   only complaint is the sleeves are too short   like more coverage     
239,3.0 ,                       this was a well made shirt  although it wasn t quite what i was looking for  the fabric is a little stiff and scratchy to me  and the neck opening seems a little small  it is also a little short for my liking  maybe over time it will soften up and be more comfortable      
240,4.0 ,                       i bought this in a size larger because it s     cotton  after the first wash it shrank as expected  still a nice and comfy shirt      
241,5.0 ,                       these shirts are perfect work shirts and we are very pleased with the quality  they are of a heavy tee shirt fabric and will last in the wear and tear of daily labor work      
242,5.0 ,                       this shirt looks and fits great and is perfect for hot weather      
243,3.0 ,                       i ordered two new heavy weight t shirts from the same category that i ordered   other ones but these are not      cotton they are a       mix and no wear near as thick   i don t like them as much as the first ones      
244,5.0 ,                       decent t shirt  not thin  good weight   i always order these xl when i normally wear large in thin white t shirts      
245,5.0 ,                       i bought a black dickies shirt just like this a couple months back from a department store and i loved it  but these ones were pretty big compared to the one i have  i m not sure if i just need to wash them a few more times or what but definitely not the same shirt  other than that  great quality of course  can t go wrong with a dickies   even if it s too big or small  hehe jokes on jokes  great product      
246,5.0 ,                       i bought t shirts in xl and i am very impressed   i also bought some large tall shirts to try out the size  however  they were tight on the chest and extremely long for me who is   foot one in     pounds  this wasn t expected though considering the sizing chart already mapped us up  i really like how thick the shirts are they seem very durable and are a great work shirt  i am a nurse for reference      
247,5.0 ,                       best t shirts since j peterman stopped offering them  no sags st neck good weight material  good pocker  modest  id sign  good pricr      
248,5.0 ,                       this crew neck short sleeve tee is perfect for winter time work      
249,5.0 ,                       these are the exact same shirts i wear at work  minus the company logo   i love that i can now have   shirts  with the   pants i was given      
250,5.0 ,                       great value for the money i wear them all the time i like the extra tall     
251,2.0 ,                       bought  xl but they run small compared to other t shirts  bought for working in but shirts appear to be skimping on material as they are about an inch shorter than the carhartts i usually buy  also a bit narrower  weight is ok  feels the same as the      oz  i usually buy  smaller sizes may be ok  but for larger guys they may show  plumbers  crack  when bending and stooping      
252,4.0 ,                       fit great out of the package  shrank like crazy  after one washing its to tight     
253,3.0 ,                       its very thick  so if thats your type of shirt this one is for you   me  not so much   good quality just way to thick and heavy      
254,5.0 ,                       we purchase these for my husband and coworkers to wear in an automotive shop  they fit good and hold up to the dirt and grease  the pockets are nice as most mechanics know you need to have that little screw driver close      
255,5.0 ,                       these are my favorite work shirts   love the fit  great quality and i like the pocket with the pencil pocket      
256,5.0 ,                       these shirts are made to last  very fine quality material and cut real well glad that i ordered them they last a long time to      
257,5.0 ,                       great for your working spouse  my husband works in oil and needs a lot of t shirt s to get dirty in  theses are light weight and comfortable and they wash well      
258,5.0 ,                       shirt length was perfect for my body very thick and good quality fit at chest was also perfect and was not tight  but the fit at waist is a little big      
259,5.0 ,                       excellent     
260,2.0 ,                       not the same as the dickies shirts i had previously purchased at wal mart  these shirts came out of the package feeling really stiff  even after a wash  the material feels stiff  and isnt that comfortable  they are alil shorter in length  compared to the other dickies shirts i have  in the same size  im not sure what the difference is between these  and the ones i buy at walmart  but they are different for sure      
261,3.0 ,                       good wearing shirt but expect more than average shrinkage after a few washings     
262,5.0 ,                       very good heavy tee shirt  the material is very coarse but softens after washing a few times  fits well as expected  good value and should last a long time      
263,5.0 ,                       very happy with the quality and fit of this dickies t shirt  excellent heavy cotton material is the best i ve found  and i ve owned these shirts in the past  very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend to anyone looking for old fashioned dickies quality      
264,5.0 ,                       i really love this shirt  i bought a  xl for my husband and it fits perfectly  this will be my go to shirt to buy for him from now on  it is thicker than the average shirt which helps it lay nicer on his big ol belly  he s about         lbs  so if you are built like that  this shirt will work great  it s a decent length too      
265,5.0 ,                       dickies tees have the fit and quality i look for  they are higher priced than most others  but they re the only ones i will buy in the future      
266,3.0 ,                       these are the same   as previous   t s  but are made in pakistan and about      smaller in chest and belly as previous fuller fit that were made in honduras      
267,5.0 ,                       great quality  doesn t shrink in the laundry  long lasting durable and looks good  found my new favorite t shirts  fyi the fit is more on the larger size compared to other t shirts i have but that s my preference anyway      
268,4.0 ,                       can t beat a nice looking durable t shirt with a pocket      
269,3.0 ,                       i recently been using black pocket dickies t shirts for work and decided to try a new colour    turns out the xl in olive which i ordered is bigger then a black xl for some reason and black shirts were made in pakistan and this olive green one was made in nicaragua    the quality still seems goo but if i knew the sizing would be different for other colours probably wouldnt have ordered it        
270,5.0 ,                       great quality     
271,4.0 ,                       this tee has a nice thick feel  but is big and boxy  i have a size    chest and the large is a bit much  but not so much that returned it   it s good quality at a nice price  so i might try a medium      
272,4.0 ,                           because there is no perfect shirt   yet that i ve found   this is among the best with a heavyweight cotton poly blend  breast pocket   flattering  professional yet stylish fit ordinarily  i ll wear champion ringers or ralph lauren polos but i decided to go all dickies so this is my new go to i m         and i find the fit flattering   it s a work shirt so you can move and bend without it sliding up your back or having it too long while working  perfect length for that   so far  no pit swamps either      
273,5.0 ,                       i bought this shirt to wear at work instead of the typical   pack of hanes or fruit of the loom thin shirts  well you do pay a little more here but you get more shirt  i haven t had it long enough to know about the neck stretching but i put money it will hold up a lot better  i ll order more slowly because of the price point      
274,5.0 ,                       good if you like a heavy durable tee shirt  deep color  very comfortable perfect for me      
275,5.0 ,                       these shirts  i ordered four  are great quality and fit just right  mine did shrink up a little which is why even thought i wear an xl i ordered an xxl      
276,3.0 ,                       the collar tends to look like  bacon  after   or   laundry cycles      
277,4.0 ,                       love these shirts  only complaint i have is the placement of the tag  its on the lower side seam and went to remove and tore the shirt right at the seam      
278,5.0 ,                       i really like dickies shirt products  they fit a bit better than carharrt shirts  very good quality like the other brand  but fits different  better for me      
279,3.0 ,                       decent shirt fits comfortable      
280,2.0 ,                       as headline says  fabric is not nice  i bought two of these shirts  and as much as i hate to give someone s product a bad review  i have to be honest so they could at least change their product  st johns bay shirts have much better fabric that i bought from jcpenneys      
281,4.0 ,                       nice heavy tee     
282,5.0 ,                       these shirts are true to size and fit   fabric is somewhat heavyweight for summer but is what is expected from a quality shirt   fast shipping and great price      
283,3.0 ,                       did not realize it has a pocket  did not read info clearly enough  hubby loves the fit but pocket eh  not toomuch      
284,4.0 ,                       most of the hundred percent cotton shirts i buy my husband i realized will shrink a size that s i always buy one size larger  even at that oftentimes they shrink in length and he can t talk them properly into his pants where is these we have washed and the length stayed very much the same and he s happy that his stomach isn t hanging out that he could talk these into his pants     
285,5.0 ,                       these dickey t s are good sturdy fabric  lots of colors to choose from and only        a piece   i bought four for my teenage son  who likes the brand and the pocket on the front      
286,5.0 ,                       this is a very well tailored t shirt  the material  fabric  is thicker and stronger than any other brand i have ever purchased before  at first the shirt seems somewhat stiff but this disappears after the  nd washings      
287,5.0 ,                       good heavy weight tee that is well made  better than shirts costing much more      
288,5.0 ,                       i like that the shirt is very very thick material  it will work good on winter  well la winter      
289,3.0 ,                       shirts fit great and they don t shrink up when they re washed  the collar is heavy and some working men don t like tight collars around the neck  the only real irritant is a tag that is sewn into the side  it s uncomfortable and scratchy  even if you tear it out  there s a piece of it sticking into your side all day      
290,5.0 ,                       finding these on my size was almost impossible so to amazon i ventured and found them     
291,4.0 ,                       have a height of   feet  bought the size of the m  a bit longer than the expected      
292,5.0 ,                       heavy duty  well fitting t shirt with pocket     
293,5.0 ,                       i had a pocket tee in this color from the gap that was around    years old  it was coming apart  but i couldn t ditch it because the color was so unusual  brown tees are usually closer to either chocolate or khaki  rarely in this caramel like in between now i can pitch the old one  because this shirt is built to last  double stitching at the hem  sleeves are a decent length without breaking at the elbow  shirt itself is long enough without looking like a sun dress  definitely a thicker fabric  i love it already      
294,5.0 ,                       amazing work shirts   have had these for a couple years now and they still fit like they did when i got them   a little dirty now  but the quality is great      
295,4.0 ,                       i use them as work shirts around the house  i like that they are not  see through  so i don t have to wear a bra      
296,1.0 ,                       fit before washed   washed before wearing and it shrunk a couple of sizes   also stiff and rough   do not recommend this shirt      
297,5.0 ,                       sometimes these shirts are cut a little bigger or smaller than expected  but this one was just right   must be a goldilocks thing      
298,5.0 ,                       nice durable shirt     
299,5.0 ,                       our son loves these shirts  nice and thick good quality   great price  fits great     
300,5.0 ,                       i can t stand tee shirts that have a neck hole that either starts out to big or stretches out to be to big  these shirts have thick  ribbing on the neck and i like the way it fits  they are a nice heavy weight cotton and the whole shirt fits nice  i have paid   and   times more for premium pocket tees that i didn t like as much as these  these will be the only one i buy now      
301,4.0 ,                       purchased one to compare to carhartt  i like it  so far and     the price of carhartt       cotton  fit was great  i ll purchase some more  t  washed up good with minimal shrinkage      
302,5.0 ,                       excellent  thanks      
303,5.0 ,                       quality material  comfortable  color didn t fade after several washes  i bought this t shirt for my husband to wear to work and he went back and purchased almost every color      
304,5.0 ,                       good  strong t shirt  i like a pocket so i can carry a pen      
305,5.0 ,                       i ordered   shirts for my husband   he loves them and wears them everyday      
306,5.0 ,                       very well made heavy t shirt  perfect for casual wear and very durable  so much higher quality than typical t shirts plus colors available at amazon provide a lot of selection  i ve bought several of these in different colors and patterns and haven t been disappointed      
307,5.0 ,                       fantastic dickies quality  the polyester blend makes them super comfortable  i would never buy a      cotton t shirt again  thanks dickies      
308,5.0 ,                       dickies are a good competitor for carhart   dickies xl is smaller than carhart s xl  so i went up a size with dickies   i got the perfect fit doing this      
309,5.0 ,                       for the price and fit  these are perfect  i m       and order a medium and it s just loose enough to be comfortable  and because it s thick it shows less gut  smile       
310,3.0 ,                       i have an issue with these shirts  i wear them for work  i work as an automotive technician  i prefer these shirts to the work uniform my issue is that both of these shirts developed a hole in the upper left side at shoulder  both shirts and same spot      
311,4.0 ,                       great quality thick shirt but runs large like carhartt and shirts really wide and short  however  the quality is outstanding just the size was a problem  will order again but i ll order a large instead of xl      
312,5.0 ,                       i don t have a big neck but i felt as if these shirts were tight around the neck    almost felt like someone was grapping my neck   the shirts made in honduras were about       inches bigger around the circumference underneath the armpit area   those shirts felt more relaxed to me   the shirts made in mexico were a bit more snug  but still somewhat comfortable  around the armpit area      
313,5.0 ,                       these are super nice t shirts   i thought they would be sturdy but i didn t expect how nice they would wash up   they are heavy duty   my husband uses them for work and he likes the pocket to put his pens and tools in   i highly recommend them      
314,1.0 ,                       bought   shirts of these shirts in january      which i would rate highly and of great quality  but these two shirts i just bought were of thinner   less  comfortable material   also there was some minor defects in the material itself   have been using dickies shirts for most of my adult life but now i have to rethink that   do i try dickies again in   to    months or try another major brand      
315,5.0 ,                       i was unsure of what size to buy after reading the reviews but purchased size  xl   this tee fit perfectly for my husband who is      tall  around     pounds   washed shirts before wearing in cold water  and washed well without any shrinkage   i would purchase again      
316,4.0 ,                       i bought this t shirt in a  x because i like them loose to lounge around in  also  if it shrinks  i won t have to worry about it too much  the material is on the heavier side  which i wanted   i wish the neck area was smaller  but that s what you get in this size  i can tell if something is the correct size by measuring it across to      even though this measured at       i also like having a tight front pocket   update  the collar looks okay and not as large as i thought      
317,4.0 ,                       nice shirt for the price     
318,1.0 ,                       i this exact shirt i purchased at walmart so i figured i would be safe ordering the same size well i was wrong  with covid    issues going on i tried the shirt on and it fit fine i removed the tags and washed it and the shirt shrank so now its to short and un wearable  looks like i m stuck with an expensive rag      
319,3.0 ,                       shirt is very nice  but the large did shrink slightly the first time in the wash  not much  but enough to recommend going one size larger if you are an in between size  also note that while the ad title doesn t specify these shirts having pockets  that information is mentioned in the description      
320,5.0 ,                       got this product for comfort and it does not disappoint one bit  the fabric is pretty thick and the size is perfect in my opinion but unfortunately i got a little bit of pit stains on mine after months of usage but that s not a big deal  i have two pairs now and might go for a third since it s extremely comfortable      
321,5.0 ,                       i m       lean   hard to find shirts that are tall enough  but not so baggy that you act like a kite on a windy day  these shirts fit like their supposed to  i take a medium   perfect fit      
322,5.0 ,                       love the fit for the most part  it s a bit long though  the shirt itself is a thick cotton  which helps hide my nips when they get hard  i like that it protects you from  g radiation  meaning  this shirt should help fight the spread of covid  i have not yet washed the shirt so maybe it will shrink a little      
323,5.0 ,                       fits great good work shirt     
324,3.0 ,                       i ordered two black in med and two dark blue   got the black first and since they are to large i canceled the blue ones  i wanted good t shirts with a pocket which they are   they might shrink   i hope so  time will tell      
325,5.0 ,                       this is my new shirt i will buy nothing else the quality exceptional the price on target overall great shirt     
326,5.0 ,                       very well made shirt that has thicker cotton than most shirts made today  fits well and is very comfortable      
327,5.0 ,                       very nice  high quality heavy tee shirt with pocket  exactly what i wanted  i am a dickies fan   one thing that s very important to me is not to have a big loose neck  these necks are perfect  not over sized at all   only one thing i would improve on is the sleeves just a bit longer  i would buy again      
328,3.0 ,                       i have worn and washed this t shirt maybe   times since receiving them and not happy with the material coming apart as shown in the photo   like tiny moth holes starting in the fabric and only worn and washed the t   times     
329,3.0 ,                       bought two of these for my boyfriend who wears a size medium  so naturally i ordered a medium with the shirts  but they were way too big  the quality of the shirts were very nice so for that i will give it the three stars  but you might want to order a size down      
330,5.0 ,                       love these but dickies shirts are all different sizes  sometimes a medium fits like a medium and sometimes it fits like an xl      
331,2.0 ,                       tee shirt is well made and nice  if u are a medium size don t buy it  it will be to large  if u wear a large get the medium     
332,4.0 ,                       this shirt looks good  the fabric is substantial and durable  and i like it  as i do the same shirt i previously bought in a different color and the same size  the only issue i have is that for both shirts the xl size is a bit smaller around my waist than most other t shirts that size  i think a larger size would be too big elsewhere  i d just prefer a fit more like my other tees  the model in the photo is as thin as i was about    years ago  so who knew      
333,5.0 ,                       i wanted a short sleeve shirt that had a pocket for my penlight and pens and that wouldn t droop this shirt fits it to a tee  heavyweight tee  great fit and long tail keeps shirt tucked and sharp looking      
334,5.0 ,                       the dickies brand of t shirt is of the highest quality   the material is thick and long lasting   my son absolutely loves these shirts   you cannot go wrong with this t shirt      
335,5.0 ,                       great quality  perfect fit item as describedthese are the best quality t shirts on amazon period      
336,5.0 ,                       this is my favorite pocket t shirt because of the pin pocket there s a partition in the pocket to hold a pen or pencil it was really helpful because the mountain pins i lose it work good material good color great work shirt      
337,5.0 ,                       i got two of these to se how i liked them  i am      about      and the medium was a nice fit  the collar is just right for a crew neck and it didn t lose shape thru the day  the weight of the tee is nice and overall i am very happy with them  they may just be my new go to tee shirt  we ll see how well they hold up but i don t expect i will be disappointed      
338,5.0 ,                       great shirts for work or otherwise  despite not being as thick as other competitors they hold up well to repeated washing      
339,3.0 ,                       too long  and the material is not so great  i normally use j c  penney s st  john s bay      cotton t shirts  large  and they fit me perfectly  but jcp is in financial trouble and they are not offering much choice  this dickey s t shirt is about    too long for me  may be good for extra tall persons  i am        returning      
340,4.0 ,                       fits well but is so high on the front of my neck that it touches my throat  im not used to that and its annoying  but its not tight or uncomfortable otherwise  its thick fabric and doesn t attract to much dirt or fuz      
341,5.0 ,                       it is so hard to find a men s t shirt with a pocket  although i wish they offered in v neck too   with this quality and price point  let s face it  this shirt will see its share of stains  battery acid  paint and other  oops  i forgot to change into my cruddy shirt  disasters that paying for a little lizard or pony  vs  dickie label is a waste of money  these wash beautifully and seem less wrinkly out of the dryer than other brands  great color selection too      
342,5.0 ,                       a nice shirt for work     
343,5.0 ,                       nice thick crew neck t shirt for sure   nice quality    being dickies  i m sure it will hold up   target t s don t survive even   wash   look like crap    being brand new it s fits perfect now   isn t too long   i wish it were    shorter    eddie bauer t s are my favorite but they are now             dickies are         fitment   i m           lbs  big shoulders  i m thick  normal toursue length   an xl fits great      
344,3.0 ,                       i ordered    t shirts  two had small        holes that looked like moth holes but maybe not  probably should have returned them but they are ok as work shirts     
345,5.0 ,                       i like this product as it is not flimsy   the cloth is thicker than a lot of tee s that you find   they stand up to any type of wear and don t fade or shrink      
346,5.0 ,                       since these shirts are pre shrunk  there was no shrinkage   they fit as expected   the material is heavy weight  heavier than an undershirt   would recommend   the colors did not seem to fade  although  i wash the darker colors in a dark load of laundry      
347,5.0 ,                       great and different color  great quality too  my son just loved it under the tree      
348,3.0 ,                       i very much dislike that they have a tag sewed on the inside of the shirts that can irritate your side  they are thinner than expected for a  heavy weight  shirt  after    or so washing s they tend to wrinkle easily and get thinner  i also bought several charot  shirts and they are almost perfect      
349,5.0 ,                       fit really nice very well made product     
350,4.0 ,                       the color brown duck is definitely more of a true brown than what s shown in the photo  aside from that  the shirt is great  i bought this for myself as a woman so i could have the front pocket  something lose fitting  and a shirt that s long enough to wear with leggings  i m pretty impressed  one star off only for the color misrepresentation  will definitely be ordering more      
351,5.0 ,                       these were bought as a gift for my brother  he loves dickies t shirts  they fit perfectly  are heavyweight      cotton and are super well made      
352,5.0 ,                       if your skinny and have absolutely no fat size down but stay true to size if you go one size up it s a complete blanket     
353,5.0 ,                       as described will order from this seller again      
354,5.0 ,                       great shirts for the money     
355,1.0 ,                       the  comparison  of like items shows this as a  two pack    it s not   just one   jc penny s used to sell a three pack of their  double weight  for      this is close to the same thing but at   times the cost   i can t see how a  working man  can afford to wear these on a daily basis  they are not that special and at     a piece      i ll be looking elsewhere      
356,4.0 ,                       they shrink  like a lot  buy at least one size bigger otherwise they are good shirts  i prefer heavy duty shirts as i work in temps that are above     degrees for    hours      
357,1.0 ,                       the size chart is way off  the bust of the shirt is     when i got an xl and way too big and the shirts are way way way to long a little over     they are down past my thighs and i m         and wanted to exchange for large but they don t do exchanges only returns so no shirts for me haha      
358,5.0 ,                       i wanted a sturdy pocket t shirt   this fit the bill  to a t     the clincher is that i like to carry a writing instrument in the chest pocket and the pencil slot is perfect for that      
359,1.0 ,                       i like dickees   they ususally are a very good value and hold up   these however shrunk     started so he had more than enough to tuck in   to barely able to tuck in   then the tag on the side   impossible to get all of the tag out without putting a hole in it        sorry    stearing away from dickees now     
360,5.0 ,                       this is very subjective as everyone s build is diff  i m older  big in the chest and waist and the xl fits very nice  if you like your tee tight cause u have a good disease then by a size down      
361,5.0 ,                       this is the best t shirt by dickies ever   the men s big tall heavyweight crew neck t wears well in cool and in hot temperatures   the fit is as expected according to size and gives ample room for movement   the item comes in various colors and is appropriate to wear year round   i recommend this t to everyone      
362,5.0 ,                       a tough  comfortable pocket t shirt  made to last  with steadfast colors  all others i tried felt too flimsy and couldn t stand two or three washes  without starting to fade or deteriorate      
363,5.0 ,                       there are multiple different listings for dickies t shirts here on amazon   they aren t all the same quality of shirt so be forewarned   these are made in mexico   or nicaragua   these are the shirts you want   the other listings are dickies shirts made in pakistan   they are terrible even though the reviews say otherwise   these shirts are prime fabric       cotton   that s very stretchy   it s highly wrinkle resistant   lays flat   is easy to fold   something is terribly wrong with the shirts made in pakistan   they will not lay flat   they re always wrinkled    literally  like you balled them up   put them under your mattress   these shirts offered here are the winners   they have a pen pencil slot in the chest pocket   the bad shirts don t have that slot these shirts do shrink a little after washing drying so i d advise buying one size larger than your actual size   you re gonna love  em        
364,5.0 ,                       nice quality shirt for      amazed at such a big difference in price based on the color  it s not quite the same quality as carhartt  but the same weight cotton  and less expensive  i would say the xl is a  normal sized  xl  which means its about the same size as a large carhartt tshirt      
365,5.0 ,                       very nice  sturdy material not that paper thin cloth  does tend to creep up at the belly      
366,5.0 ,                       all the dickie shirts i ordered were a perfect fit for my husband  he liked that they were longer than most other shirts he s tried  only complaint is that they were a little on the heavy side for hot summer days  but our winters are long here in the northeast  colors were very nice also     
367,3.0 ,                       guess i m just spoiled for nicer fabric and better fitting  these are made from a tough material i ll give them that  they fit  me  kinda strange and the pocket is over near my arm pit  overall i just do not like them      
368,2.0 ,                       when i first got this shirt it fit just a tad bit small  however  when i washed it one time on cold water it shrunk quite a bit  if i had to order it again i would order it one size bigger      
369,1.0 ,                       prior purchase of same shirt   months before  dec         was made of soft pliable good feeling cotton  second shirt purchased may      is made of stiff uncomfortable cotton that is already abrading at the neck  cannot trust dickies products anymore  may      purchase was made in pakistan  new shirts are made in mexico  buyer beware      
370,5.0 ,                       what s nice about these t shirts are  the material really is heavyweight   i like the assortment of colors   prices vary greatly between colors  not sure why   royal blue is        while hunter green is            
371,5.0 ,                       me gusto mucho el precio el material y por lo regular son muy caras y las encontr  a buen precio      
372,5.0 ,                       imho  there s only one time a cheap  thin t shirt is called for  and that s on a humid      degree summer day  these t shirts are pretty thick  and worth every penny  while they are perhaps not the softest or thickest cotton available  for the price they are more than excellent   they are  after all  t shirts         
373,5.0 ,                       well made quality material kudos to dickies     
374,5.0 ,                       i used to love carhartt shirts  now i love dickies shirts  the fit of these on my larger body is great and the quality is just as good as carhartt  sizing is also the same      
375,5.0 ,                       i bought   of these and   from carhartt  both where xxl  the dickies have amuch more closer for than the carhartt ones which are slightly bigger      
376,2.0 ,                       nice cotton  nice color  nice pocket  but the sleeves are way shorter than the picture   they even stick out like a dress with too many bustles   i guess that s the sytle      
377,4.0 ,                       i love the color i bought  but i do not love the fabric  i now have   different brands of work shirts to try and honestly  they do the job  but i do not love them  they are all rougher than i think they should be      
378,4.0 ,                       i like the fact that after the first washing there was little if any shrinkage and they still fit fine it s a wonderful product thank you dickies     
379,5.0 ,                       was looking for a xl shirt that was a true xl and less ne er than usual    this fit the bill        
380,4.0 ,                       these are nice heavy weight ts  they run large but that s ok with me  i buy medium and they fit closer to large  i ve bought several at separate times and i ve received     cotton blend on a couple of the shirts but most have been      cotton  the weight of the material also varies but all have been heavy  some just heavier than others      
381,2.0 ,                       this is a thick work shirt   it is too small in the chest   i washed once i cannot wear it anymore im tall not that big a bit of extra weight   order one size up from reg sixmze it should work      
382,5.0 ,                       fits well  not an expert but seems to be very well made  see how it does in   months  not as soft but feels like the material is substantial   made to last      
383,5.0 ,                       nice and durable     
384,5.0 ,                       i like these shirts as far as fit and looks is concerned   the only thing i wish was better is that the material is a bit coarse  rough    hopefully they will soften up over time      
385,5.0 ,                       i bought one of these tee shirts to see what they were like and i love it i m ordering   more   i ve been buying designer tee shirts for four times the money and they nearly as sturdy or nice   i can get   for the price of   designer shirts  i m very pleased with this product      
386,5.0 ,                       perfect  great fit      
387,4.0 ,                       mens clothing seems better quality  bought my husband tshirt  and sweatshirt   glad these are heavy fabric       
388,5.0 ,                       great shirt     
389,5.0 ,                       good shirt     
390,5.0 ,                       nice and durable     
391,3.0 ,                       needs to be longer will shrink   inches longer would  fix problem      
392,5.0 ,                       what can i say  i love these t shirts  having the pocket is a must and with the small  side pocket  is a perfect place to hook my glasses to and not having to put them in the same pocket with other stuff  i ll always buy these      
393,5.0 ,                       quality     
394,5.0 ,                       love these heavy weight shirts but was surprised that some colors were       cotton polyester  and some were      cotton      
395,5.0 ,                       very highly recommend  thick material and made to last  i only wear dickies clothing because in the long run  it costs less  extremely durable and comfortable      
396,4.0 ,                       good product   i bought several of them   would buy again      
397,3.0 ,                       very misleading that this is called a      cotton shirt  i bought three of them because that is what they were supposed to be   good bright colors though      
398,3.0 ,                       the fit of the shirt was as expected the quality of the shirt seem to be ok but after a couple washes the collar becomes fuzzy   i m not how sure to explain it other than fuzzy  i ve never had a dickies shirt do this until these  i purchased   and   different colors blue  gray and brown and all of them done the same thingi m glad they re just work shirts     
399,5.0 ,                       i ordered six shirts altogether  and they all fit okay  but when i pulled the stickers off of two of the shirts  some of the sticker glue didn t come off   i washed them and it still didn t come off   in fact it left a permanent sticker stain on both shirts    never mind  i found a way to get the sticker glue off  duct tape adhesive is stronger than sticker glue  so i pressed and peeled until the sticker glue came off  now the shirts are perfect   thank god and google      
400,5.0 ,                       like the color     
401,1.0 ,                       fabric material misleading  depending on what color shirt you order the fabric material will vary  i learned this the hard way  the description for the item indicates      cotton but i received two shirts that were     cotton     polyester  not sure why they falsely claim the shirts are      cotton     
402,5.0 ,                       shirt is well made and material is thick      
403,5.0 ,                       i ve been wearing these for twenty years or more they were thicker at one time but still the most rugged and the color seems to keep better then most i m in the welding trade and they help prevent weld burn around my neck and chest where my weld jacket is open on the top a lesser grade shirt leaves my skin with flash burn     
404,5.0 ,                       this product fits well and is made of good quality cotton      
405,3.0 ,                       the for is true to size  however  the material is crispy  the pocket that also had room for a pencil seems like it took the size away from the pocket  that aside it is a great fit  material is just too rough      
406,3.0 ,                       product given only   stars due to the coarseness of the fabric  although washed   times in hot wash   mildly uncomfortable   otherwise it s a well constructed and apparently sturdy shirt with minimal shrinkage      
407,4.0 ,                       good shirt for a good price  i do have  the same complaint as others  that when they get a little oil on them  even like vegetable or olive oil  it doesn t wash out unless pretreated  the other problem is they do fade fairly quickly  but the shirt itself is very durable  i will still continue to buy these though  they are very comfortable      
408,5.0 ,                       these dickie heavy ts  are  by far  the best i ve encountered   i hate the trend toward flimsy  wispy shirts with loose collars   these are truly heavy weight  with great crew necks   they offer plenty of room around the belly for those of us with  extra there   i m slowly replacing most of my t shirts with these      
409,5.0 ,                       very good quality fits perfect packaged very well came on time for my husbands birthday he loves it iam very pleased with this item i would  recommend this product and company to anyone thank you so much     
410,5.0 ,                       my son s favorite shirts      
411,5.0 ,                       it s hard to find a well made heavy duty t shirt anymore  it seems everything is so cheaply made any more  i saw this and thought i d try it  this t shirt is perfct  fits good  looks good and it s alot thicker then every other one i had  bought    loved them so much i bought   more  i ll be getting more just in case      
412,5.0 ,                       i like this shirt  fits very well all around  i can tell it is made well  it will get much use this summer too  color selection is very good  thanks  sincerely  rick l      
413,5.0 ,                       this is a very well made shirt  cloth is heavy and well knit  i ve ordered   different colors    every couple of weeks  first have gone through the wash a few times and still look great  i carry a folded piece of paper with all my notes at work  love the breast pocket especially for carrying this      
414,5.0 ,                       love these slightly heavy weight shirts      
415,5.0 ,                       love to throw on this shirt whenever i need to run a quick errand or just for lounging around     
416,5.0 ,                       i bough   of these in the us   years ago  loved them  so wanted some more but had to buy online  the ones i got from amazon was great  they fit perfectly  but the fabric is not as rough  or heavy weight  as the ones i bough in the us in           
417,5.0 ,                       you can never go wrong with dickies clothing  durable and last a long time      
418,5.0 ,                       great product  exactly what i expected      
419,4.0 ,                       i usually wear another famous brand but decided to try these unfortunately  they must run really small   the xl size shirts i ordered fit more like mediums  after wash    they did look small before washing  too they seemed to be well made but i didn t want to play  guess my size  by ordering larger sizes to see if they d shrink to the right size      
420,5.0 ,                       nice thicker shirt  unlike like those paper thin cotton t shirts being sold at target  kmart  and elsewhere  so paying     is worth it  not too hot for the gym  besides sweating is good for you  sizing seems to be running a little large as i m a     chest and the medium size fits a tad loose ish   so i don t recommend large size unless you ve got a pot b      
421,4.0 ,                       fit was somewhat small  nice weight  sending back but reordered in a larger size  suggest you buy a size up      
422,5.0 ,                       so far  so good  the material is thicker than others      
423,3.0 ,                       although it is      cotton  the material never developed that soft  comfortable feel that you expect in a good t shirt   i wouldn t buy it again for that reason      
424,1.0 ,                       too big and heavy   returned and received refund  thanks      
425,5.0 ,                       husband wears a  xl ordered  xl  fits fine  he likes carhartt  no exactly the same but close enough and less expensive for working in the grease      
426,5.0 ,                       excellent  durable  right fit      
427,5.0 ,                       nice thick and soft tees  fit on the large is good      
428,5.0 ,                       nice work shirt  great fit  heavy duty and great price      
429,1.0 ,                       i bought a number of these in different colors  the heather grey are a blend  not      cotton     cotton      polyester    deceptive     they all feel like sandpaper to the skin  i have tried washing and softening them      times  no luck i can t wear any of them for more than a few minutes  if these were soft  i would compliment the heavyweight fabric  slight oversized fit and value at a sale price  but i cannot wear them  whatever is in the fabric makes them unwearable like the worst chemical laden poly cotton shirts of the    s      
430,5.0 ,                       finally  a men s tee that wont fall apart after a couple washes  love these tees  sizing is on target  i am an xl   the xl fits me  no shrinkage or tiny holes after waering once or twice     
431,5.0 ,                       really like this heavy crew shirt for fit and everyday comfort  especially like the shirt pocket because i like to take on and off my eyewear      
432,5.0 ,                       buy these for my husband for work   he likes having a pocket for a pen  small tools and his eyeglasses   they hold up pretty well   he wears them every day and it is going on   years that he is wearing them   wash well and don t lose color      
433,5.0 ,                       it s very hard to find t shirts of such high quality nowadays   it s well made  nice to touch  it s a bit on a longer side though      
434,5.0 ,                       the shirt is perfect  not to thick  not to light  i like a good strong thicker shirt  i am also a big guy  so sometimes  xl isn t really  xl  this shirt is perfect  i definitely recommend      
435,5.0 ,                       perfect   plus it was cheaper than anywhere else i like     
436,5.0 ,                       the dickies heavyweight t shirts are the best i have found  they fit well and seem to be made well  i have been wearing them for years and they hold up well through many washes  i ve tried other brands and haven t found any as good as these  i can t always find the colors i like best  but they always have at least   or   that i like      
437,5.0 ,                       this shirt is very good quality and i recommend  perfect for wearing by its self or layering      
438,5.0 ,                       these shirts are always generously sized which is why my husband likes      
439,5.0 ,                       i m loving these shirts so far   it s a little early to comment on there durability   the shirts are a thick cotton  but not overly hot   the chest pocket is very useful and includes a separate area to place a pen or pencil   the shirts arrive a little large  but shrink to expected fit once washed   if your trim i think you will like the fit of these shirts   if you have some extra in the middle then i would go a size larger   the shirts are a great length to cover your backside  but don t look like you re wearing a nightgown  the royal blue is a really true blue and great for anyone that loves the color   have held up to carpentry work environment so far  but time will tell how the really hold up to tough work      
440,3.0 ,                       i like dickies t shirts   they are made of heavy material and have a good variety of colors   this last shirt was disappointing however   the stitching on the pocket had a couple of loose loops on it that will probably start unraveling at some point   i decided not to return it over the flaws  but i do hope the quality is not lowering on these shirts      
441,5.0 ,                       the shirt fits very good like the color      
442,5.0 ,                       it s ok     
443,5.0 ,                       i bought these for my husband and i wasn t sure if it would last multiple washes  he can only wear cotton clothes and my other fear was shrinkage  the fabric is heavy duty which is really nice  i do wash with cold water and dry on medium heat as i personally do not want to deal with shrinkage  it does hang loose on him  but that is his preferred fit   based on the heavy duty material  i am confident this will last him a lot longer than an average t shirt      
444,5.0 ,                       these dickies pocket tees have been my favorite for some time and they haven t changed  they re outstanding shirts for their fit  their sturdy construction  and their longevity  and the price makes them even better      
445,1.0 ,                       the material is stiff as a board   fits like a stiff cardboard box      
446,5.0 ,                       nice heavyweight shirt  washes nicely too  really like the colors available and the fact there is a pocket is a plus      
447,5.0 ,                       i love these t shirts   i m     and about     lbs  and the fit was perfect   these are really heavy weight and the collar is really thick and should hold its shape for a long time   the pock is a really good extra feature and comes in handy   i will be ordering more of these      
448,5.0 ,                       i was looking for more plain shirts to wear for work  something that would hold up to not only the washing machine and dryer  but the general hazards of working in a production environment  i was also wanting more length  tired of other shirts with hems that seemed to roll up as i sat  stood  and bent over  so many other shirts labeled as unisex or men s don t always work for women when part of the length has to go around a larger chest i ordered an xl first since i usually wear that size in other brands  t shirts  but found it to be too baggy even after the initial wash and dry  i got the regular l next  and after the first wash didn t notice any shrinkage  and it fit perfectly  it was exactly how i wished all of my t shirts fit  roomy yet fitted  and long enough that i didn t have to constantly worry about pulling the hem down throughout the day as i moved  when i first wore it to work  out of habit i d go to pull the hem down only to realize it was still good where it was  this fact alone made me so happy i decided to purchase this shirt the price point is a little higher than what i ve normally paid for a plain t shirt  but with it being heavyweight and fitting me practically perfectly  it s worth it  i ve already added more to my cart to last me a full work week  and i m happy i ve found something i feel comfortable in at work      
449,5.0 ,                       the pocket on the newest version has a normal width opening and also has a half inch wide section that is perfect for one arm of thin framed reading glasses  it is too narrow for my normal wayfarer sunglasses  but that s fine  great  comfortable year round shirts  i have some dickies shirts that are more than ten years old that still retain their shape and collar elastic  great shirts      
450,5.0 ,                       i now have six of these as they fit me very well           lb    the neck size is just right  not too tight and more importantly not too loose compared to other brands   the pocket has a separate pen compartment  which does prevent my phone from fitting in the pocket and limits which pens i can use  but that is a minor issue and not worth down rating the product      
451,5.0 ,                       it s time to buy new clothes and i found dickies there shirts are always high quality and there jeans are also great i would recommend them highly over lee or levis       
452,3.0 ,                       fit more like a large than an x large shirt  too tight      
453,5.0 ,                       great shirt  warm as an under shirt in winter and great during summer  fit is great and price is good too  they are well made and comparable to carhartt shirts      
454,5.0 ,                       like the fit and look and i use it for everyday wear like a polo shirt     
455,3.0 ,                       these t shirts seem to be a good quality  but are huge  i bought my son the same size  m  in several different shirts and jackets and these t s had to be returned since they were too big      
456,5.0 ,                       for years i wore russell athletic shirts  but the quality went down hill  i decided to try the dickies shirts  and discovered they fit well  come in many colors  and are very sturdy  i recommend this product      
457,2.0 ,                       these shirts fit perfect   until they were washed  they shrank so bad i had to give them to my neighbors son who wears a medium i bought these as a large i expected some shrinkage   but not an entire size never again      
458,5.0 ,                       this shirts  fabric is of much heavier weight than i had expected   because of that  i m confident its  lifetime will be longer   it also has a chest pocket   where i often carry my large smartphone   again  due to the fabric weight  my cell phone will not stretch the shirt out of shape   it fits like it s supposed to  and is very comfortable   i intend to buy more of this brand   with pockets      
459,5.0 ,                       these are well made shirts out of heavy duty material   i expect a long wear and will order more      
460,5.0 ,                       i got both sizes a s fitted me much better  i am      and    lbs  its a relaxed fit tho  so it tends to be wider      
461,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i want to start our by saying that i am  in general  happy with both the quality of the product and the timeliness of the delivery i used to buy champion tee shirts  with featured a decent weight fabric and a generous cut   a few years back champion was bought out by fruit of the loom and the fabric got lighter  and the cut got skimpy  now resembling the fruit of the loom tee shirts i then switched to dickies  regular weight  which i can buy at walmart   it featured an even heavier fabric and an even more generous cut than the champion tees of old   i am happy with the dickies standard weight tees   but walmart carries them in on black  white and gray only   i wanted colors i ordered the dickies heavy weight  when it arrived i tossed it in the laundry along with a brand new dickies standard weight   when they were laundered i handled both and they did not feel much different   i examined the construction and they appear to be the same quality  excellent    the heavy weight was made in nicaragua  and the standard weight was produced in the honduras   but both seem of similar assembly quality i decided to weigh them on my kitchen scale   stardard weight  xl       ounces  heavy weight  xl       ounces a difference of     ounce           hardly a heavy weight so if you are not interested in colors  i recommend the standard weight  if you want the colors go with the heavy weight if you want a true heavy weight tee i only know of duluth trading whose tees are of a true heavy weight fabric and the cut is generous but the product is expensive   i find the dickies to be a much better value   for tall men  the dickies are available in a  tall  too a good product  but not really a heavy weight      
462,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       the dickie s men s short sleeve shirts are perfect for my husband  here is a picture of him in the orange color  which is great for his job  the shirts are heavy weight material and they hold up nicely for a long time   he is      and about     lbs  he wares size large  they shrink just a touch on high heat in the dryer and then it s a perfect fit      
463,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i bought this shirt because of it s pocket  high rating  and low price   i m dissapointed   first  if your a big guy  nfl  lumberjack  you ll probably love this shirt   i m           lbs  career military   this fits me nice in the shoulders and chest  but hangs like a dress around my middle  because there is no shape or form fitting   i could live with that   wouldn t be the first shirt made for larger people that i have to have tailored to fit me below the chest  but here s the real kicker   there s something about the design of the sleeves and the weight of the fabric that causes the whole shirt to lift up and bunch around the chest and neck if i lift my arms up shoulder height or higher   that s definitely something you don t want in a t shirt that is supposed to be soft and comfortable   this cotton is pretty stiff   maybe after a few washes it ll be softer  but it seems like a fairly stiff weave   it certainly doesn t hang drape like the pictures shown   lastly  the pocket  as shown in the picture  wraps around the side of the chest and is largely useless except for keeping a pen in   it does have a separate little pen spot in the pocket  but the opening is too small to use most modern pens with a rubberized grip   so  all in all  pretty disappointing for me

465,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       don t buy dickies t shirts  i was looking for the perfect crew neck t shirt  i thought i found it with the dickies brand  the material was thicker than most other t shirts of this price  the stitching was good  and the crew neck was perfect  or  so i thought at the time  so  i bought a bunch of them  i invested a lot of money in what i thought would be a great all purpose product  sadly  and to my great dismay  i have learned that the crew necks are not the high quality i first thought  the crew neck itself starts to wrinkle and fade at the top within only two washings  as it is the crew neck that makes this t shirt look good  that means the shirt is essentially ruined  i bought so many of these and enough time has passed that i will never get my money back  so  don t buy dickies t shirts  no matter how good they may look on the amazon website  just don t do it

467,2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       as my headline states  please be aware that your shirt might not be      cotton  as the description states  too bad  it has a nice weight  but polyester gets too hot  it s tough finding a      cotton  heavier weight  pocket t shirt  in case anyone wants to know about sizing  i normally take a large  i m           with     chest  this shirt fit almost like an xl  a medium probably would have been too small though      
468,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i have been on a quest to find the right tshirt for many years now   i almost thought this was going to be adequate for me until i washed it   i m so tired of the huge  fat  tshirts that carhartt makes in the k   workshirt line   i m         lbs   the carhartt xl shirt is huge on me  but the large is too small   this dickies xl heavyweight tshirt fits almost exactly like a carhartt large  except the sleeves are shorter   the sleeve length on these dickies is pretty much unacceptable and need to be about   inch longer   i like the colors available  but these definitely are not heavy weight shirts   medium weight at best  which is ok too the best  most accurate sizing in a tshirt i have found so far is the wrangler riggs workwear tshirts   they are also definitely a heavy weight shirt and well made   unfortunately  they don t keep their shape as long as i would like   the neck  sleeves and bottom get kind of curled after a dozen or so washings and start to look a bit tacky i have also tried key tshirts  which have good fabric and stay nice for a long time   however  they have the same fit issues as the carhartt shirts   the xl is short and fat and just way huge and out of proportion   the large fits pretty nice as long as it is the heather  stretchy fabric   the all cotton key large shirts are too small   i may try a  xl dickies just for kicks to see if i get lucky and the fit is right   otherwise  it s back to the quest to find a proper tshirt      
469,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       much like the rest of the folks on here  i came for an alternative to my carhartt work shirts   ordered a few colors of these dickies to try on  fit wasn t bad    shirt length was a hair long if you ask me  but not terrible   chest fit well and there s tons of colors to choose from my only complaint is the description of  heavyweight    these shirts are just a bit thicker than your standard haines pocket t shirt  i wouldn t call them heavy weight by any means   now are they as thick as my carhartt work shirts  no  but are they half the price of my carhartt shirts  yes  they sure are i ll probably keep them to lounge around the house  run errands  etc   i like that there is a ton of color options   but i doubt these shirts will hold up at a job site very long not a bad shirt  i ll probably buy more in the future   but you should set your expectations before buying      
470,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       argh  most recently i ordered the  black olive    which is a unique and nice shade of very dark olive green  but i received plain black  since i prefer to rate products based on the product and not on a careless shipping mistake  these shirts still have to get   stars  they re larger  girth  and longer than hanes beefy t s of the same size e g  xl  and notably heavier fabric too  that makes them very similar to the big  capital c  car that ends in hart brand of work clothes  but significantly less obnoxiously pricy  in other words  they re real work clothes  not trendy and overpriced  they ve got good stitching and an excellent pocket that has a pen slot but is still just wide enough to slip my galaxy note   in the main part for easy use in speaker phone or podcast mode   these are my go to t shirts now  and are quickly replacing my disintegrating collection of beefy ts note that some very popular colors of dickie s t shirts are available in   packs that come out cheaper per shirt   warning   they are not the same weight or overall quality as the single packed t shirts  the fabric is thinner  stitching is lower quality  i ve had to re sew sleeve hems  for example   and the pocket does not include the pen slot
