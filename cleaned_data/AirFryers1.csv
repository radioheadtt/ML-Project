0,5.0,first off  i absolutely hate cooking  i don t like the mess  it takes too much time  my recipes never turn out like they show in the cookbooks   and my cooking is pretty awful  i got the cosori air fryer a couple of weeks ago  and i ve been happily cooking every day  multiple times a day since   you just pull it out of the box  and it s ready to go  the detachable basket and pan are all that needed cleaning in soapy water before adding food  the buttons are self explanatory  you ve got a snowflake for frozen foods  fries for fries  bacon for bacon  and also preheat and keep warm   when i first turned it on  i wasn t sure what to expect  i wondered if it was going to get hot and scorch my counter  or me   i thought it would be noisy  it was none of those things  it does get a little warm on the outside but not hot like an oven  you do need to be careful when you re pulling the basket out or any food from inside the fryer because it s deceiving that it works so quickly and gets food that hot that fast  as for noise  you can hear the air moving  but i wouldn t call it noisy  my alexa is near the air fryer  and the alexa hears me just fine when i m talking while the air fryer is running  also  since my alexa is near the air fryer  you can tell that the air fryer doesn t get too hot or spit things at you or i wouldn t have the alexa there   the air fryer looks great on my counter too  it s already become a conversation piece in my kitchen  i had family over this weekend  and they wanted to know what it was  i put on a kitchen demo of sorts  and everyone stood around and watched  then ate all of the food  not a crumb left on the plates    and then they said they needed to get an air fryer too   so far  i ve tried recipes in the included recipe book as well as a recipe for chicken fried steak in an air fryer cookbook i purchased separately  what s great about the cookbook included in the cosori air fryer is that each recipe has a picture with it  and the ingredients aren t intimidating to those of you like me who don t care for cooking  most recipes call for ingredients you ve actually heard of and probably have in your pantry    a real plus for me because i also hate wandering around in a grocery store searching for a random ingredient i ll only use once   the very first recipe i tried was sweet potato fries in the included cosori cookbook  i like my fries a little crunchy  so i probably could have left them in the air fryer a few minutes longer than the recipe called for  but they were still delicious  definitely the best sweet potato fries i ve ever had   for fun  i then threw in some frozen okra i had bought in the freezer section  i bought a water bottle and filled it with olive oil  so all i did was lightly squirt the olive oil on the okra while in the air fryer basket and then just pushed the snowflake button  the okra came out so crunchy  just the way i like it  and i couldn t believe it had gone from frozen to crispy crunchy in just a matter of minutes  most of them were golden brown  but i could tell the ones that i had missed when i sprayed the okra with the olive oil  those were white    still crunchy and tasted fine  but a weird looking white  i ve since bought a pressurized oil sprayer can that s specifically for spraying olive oil  and it works much better at spraying everything evenly than my plastic water bottle   same night and onto my third recipe  chicken fried steak  now  this recipe wasn t in the incuded cosori cookbook  this particular cookbook didn t have a picture  so i wasn t at all sure how it would turn out  it s so good  i ve cooked it twice in three nights   that night s entire meal was cooked in the air fryer  sweet potato fries  frozen turned air fried okra  and chicken fried steak  it felt like an elaborate meal with hardly any time invested  and my kitchen wasn t a disaster after cooking all of that  i only had a few plates and a couple of bowls that i d used instead of pots and pans and baking dishes all piled up on my counter with a greasy stove to clean   the next day  i tried the mozzarella cheese sticks in the included cosori cookbook  i totally botched this recipe  using baking soda instead of cornstarch  did i mention how bad i am at cooking  even so  the mozzarella sticks worked out okay  but not great  which was likely my own fault   they crisped up nicely and quickly  they just didn t look a thing like the picture in the recipe book  i would have also liked the cheese to be more melted on the inside  it seemed like the outside was really crispy and the inside wasn t really melted  this could all be because of my using the wrong ingredient  so i ll give it another shot because  even with the wrong ingredient  they weren t bad  they didn t taste like mozzarella cheese sticks  but they were still good   for dinner  i cooked the kids grilled cheese sandwiches also using the included cookbook  these didn t turn out as expected  at least i used the right ingredients this time  but the cheese wasn t gooey like it would be if you cooked it on the stove  if i had doubled the amount of cheese the recipe called for it would probably be perfect  the bread was golden brown  though  it was a bit of a pain to have to melt butter on the stove  then brush it onto the bread  then grate cheese before putting it into the air fryer  i can get a grilled cheese sandwich in a pan quicker than that  but it was still fun to try  i ll try the recipe again with more cheese  i think it s a recipe i can tinker with to make perfect   i then tried the pizza from the cosori recipe book  i didn t use pizza dough  i prefer pita bread  i followed the instructions as if it was pizza dough  which means you preheat the air fryer  brush your crust with olive oil  and then put it in the air fryer at     for five minutes  then you take it out to add toppings  on mine  i put pizza sauce  pepperoni  mozzarella  and parmesan  pop it back into the air fryer for another five minutes at      and it s done  it was so good  i ll be making another for lunch  the only downside was having to cook one at a time because i couldn t fit two pieces of pita bread in the basket together   my most recent recipe to try is the coconut shrimp  which is also in the cookbook that comes with the air fryer  what would normally be a giant mess of the kitchen was only three bowls to dredge the coconut shrimp and then a plate to put them on  you preheat the air fryer while you re getting everything ready  and then pop the shrimp in for eight minutes  they were very tasty  but i ll add more coconut in my dredge next time than the recipe calls for  the recipe was good  but i couldn t really taste the coconut   i keep picking out new recipes to try in the cookbook  which is a first for me with my loathe of cooking  i ve included pictures of the country fried steak  pizza  grilled cheese  mozzarella sticks  and coconut shrimp that i ve made so far   even owning the     quart  you have to get used to cooking in batches  i wanted to make four chicken fried steaks that first night  but there was only room for two  not a big deal  you just have to cook in batches  making three pita bread pizzas  i just had to make each one separately since i could only fit one round piece of pita in at a time  for the grilled cheese sandwiches  two actually fit into the air fryer at the same time   like i said before  the cookbook that comes with the air fryer is full of pictures  it also has more than     pages of recipes  for example  you ll find recipes for strawberry cream scones  stuffed french toast  bbq bacon  ribeye  meatballs  fried chicken  crab cakes  wings  pigs in a blanket  french fries  onion rings  roasted corn  cheddar buttermilk biscuits  cinnamon rolls  pound cake  and orange cranberry muffins  i would be lost without the cookbook  it also tells you exactly which button to push on the air fryer too  so you re learning about how to use your air fryer while you re actually cooking instead of having to read an instruction manual cover to cover before you even have enough confidence to cook something   i mentioned not having many dishes to clean after using the air fryer  what i love most about cleanup is how easy the air fryer itself is to clean  everything just slides off of it  i m barely scrubbing it  and it s clean  i know the description says it s dishwasher safe  but i just wash it in the sink because there s nothing ever dried on and stuck to it  i love how i can put a little soap on it  and it s clean and ready for my next recipe  the water beads on it  so it dries really fast   the only negative about the air fryer is probably my own impatience with one of the controls  the temp time is shared by one button  if you have a recipe that calls for you to adjust the temp and or time  you have to toggle the button  it starts with temp  so if you need to change how long to keep something in  you hit the temp time button again  somehow  i keep managing to hit time when i mean temp and vice versa   also  the air fryer cuts off when you pull the basket out  just as it should so it s not running while there s nothing in the bottom  when you pop the basket back in  it defaults back to the original temp and time settings when you turn it on  not what you last had on there  it would be nice if it remembered what your setting was   minutes before  for example  the other night when i had to make the pizzas in batches  i had to run the air fryer   minutes for one crust  then five minutes for the next  and so on  every time  i had to reset the time and temp when i pulled a crust out  that s when i began noticing how bad i was at toggling the temp time button i mentioned above   both the time temp button being shared and the air fryer not remembering your last time temp are extremely minor downsides  but they re the only negatives i could think of because this air fryer has quickly become my favorite kitchen appliance   i have never had any experience with an air fryer  so i have nothing to compare the cosori air fryer against  but i did my research  read the reviews  watched videos  and crossed my fingers that i was buying the right one  i couldn t have made a better choice  i m actually excited to cook for the first time ever  tomorrow on the breakfast menu  french toast sticks 
1,1.0,                       air fryer works  one major complaint is the basket   drawer leaks steams as it cooks which leaves puddles on whatever surface you have the air fryer  if you press lightly on the basket   drawer the steam stops leaking out which means either the product wasn t designed well or manufacturing tolerances are poor  even though it works  i wouldn t recommend as the mess it makes it just too annoying to keep cleaning up after every use    updated            after cosori support saying that leaking steam from the basket is normal  i am reducing my overall rating to   star as this product is clearly made cheaply   poorly designed  definitely do not recommend buying from this manufacture and go with a competitor s product that doesn t leak steam and make a mess on your countertop      
2,1.0,                       after hearing rave reviews from family and friends about using air fryers i thought it would be a good solution for preparing meals for one that didn t take long to prepare  made for easy cleanup  used less energy and would allow me to have a variety of delicious meals  unfortunately my experience with the cosori air fryer has been nothing but disappointing  i ve used it to cook steak which took much longer to cook than the literature suggested and it didn t brown up at all  i ve tried cooking french fries using raw potatoes and after nearly    minutes at     degrees i had limp fries that i wasn t interested in eating  i ve tried frozen french fries that i even sprayed lightly with canola oil hoping to help crisp them up  and again ended up with limp fries after nearly    minutes  i don t know if the fan isn t working or what the problem is but i m not at all happy with this product      
3,5.0,                       i chose this particular air fryer over hundreds offered on amazon   features that were the most important to me were the number of presets  counting defrost         the warranty    yr   cosori accessories  and ease of use   it is easy to clean in the dishwasher  and the preset settings mean that i don t have to calculate time or temperature  but it s also easy to add time or subtract it if you need to  the night i received my air fryer  i made the most amazing steaks that were so tender and moist inside   since then  i have made cornish hens  bbq ribs  blueberry muffins  tater tots  and many other dishes  the fryer is not heavy and it is not loud when in use   do yourself a favor and buy this      
4,5.0,                       my wife and i purchased the air fryer and received it sunday   so far we have only used it twice   but so far it is great   we cooked crab cakes last night with some tater tots and biscuits this morning for breakfast   really easy to use and easy to clean   so far we both love it updatewe have had it a few weeks now and continue to enjoy it   we did buy some accessories that work  but i wish that there were some designed specifically for the     qt air fryer   these were made for both which means they are really too small to take advantage of the     qt volume   they only  kind of  work we still love the fryer   that is why i did not change the star rating   but i really would like to see some specific accessories designed for the increased volume of this fryer      
5,5.0,                       this air fryer is awesome  i need a large basket for walleye and this is the largest i could find    x     which was a selling point  however  there are so many benefits  the programmed options  the ease of cleaning  the safety button on the basket  the price  just to name a few  i ve only had it a few days and i ve already made a home for it on my counter and replaced my smaller  less versatile phillip s air fryer with this dynamo  i ll keep the other one for things like fries or potatoes  while using this one for the main items   i haven t looked at the recipe book but i m going to do so soon  one more thing  i shop on amazon very often and this is one of the few reviews i feel compelled to write      
6,5.0,                       purchase this air fryer  i did all the research for you  i spent   days researching air fryers pouring over hundreds of reviews  specs and videos very convenient  i purchased for my     year old mother s birthday on august           although mom was a great cook  she no longer enjoys the hassle of cooking now  but this cosori air fryer has reunited her joy for cooking  she enjoys trying the many recipes included with the device as well as going on google to find new recipes chicken thighs and hicken wings are big hit  i actually prefer the wings from the air fryer than any restaurant wings  even shrimp came out great  i worried the texture of vegetables such as squash and zucchini would not do well but i was wrong  the vegetables were great as well the preset cooking settings make cooking super simple  the shake alarm is really helpful because it s important to turn food to prevent burning and insure even cooking i highly recommend this new model of the cosori air fryer  it s basket is relatively larger than others in same price range so you can cook more at same time  also it has a smart wifi feature which allows you to control the device with your phone      
7,5.0,                       i ve had this about a week  i ve made cake  sweet potato fries   wings and chicken thighs  i love how amazingly crisp and juicy everything is  the presets are extremely accurate and is a great size for   good size thighs or    wings      
8,5.0,                       i love this air fryer   i use it to make hamburgers  chicken wings  sausages  bacon  to cook vegetables  and to reheat already cooked foods  i do  a lot of grilling in the summer but i don t like cooking meat indoors because of the smoke and grease that gets everywhere   this air fryer does not smoke and grease does not escape   everything i have made so far has come out very well cooked and delicious   it s also very fast   i have no complaints so far and i m very glad i got this air fryer      
9,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i ordered the wifi model and ended up having to use the wifi only on my phone to get this device started  the push buttons on the front of this device are unresponsive and really  just complete garbage  the buttons seem to be touch capacitive  maybe  for being easily cleanable  or maybe there are real buttons behind the panel   i really don t know  all in all  but they just don t work consistently  if at all   i am going to send this heaping pile of trash back for something that works  i don t even know how this made it past their internal quality assurance and i don t know why amazon rated this device so high for customers to purchase  i trusted that this would be good  but i was wrong  i won t be trusting amazon ratings in the future      
10,5.0,                       i love how easy it is to use and the fact that i use it on a daily basis whether i m making the kids cheese fries for a snack  potato skins  meatballs  potatoes chicken fingers  etc  i m still finding new things to cook  the only con is i had to reconfigure some of my own personal recipes to make sure chicken or hamburger meat doesnt get dried out  i still love it   best money i ve ever spent on a counter appliance   it definitely has plenty of room for a family of    i made   good size stuffed chicken breast at one time  i can make    med  large meatballs at one time just to give you a general idea of how big and deep it is  buy it you wont regret it      
11,5.0,                       this air fryer is amazing and i bet this would be my best purchase on amazon in       i ve watched air fryer for a long time and hadn t decided until noticed this one  most air fryers can only work manually to set up time and temperature  which is not suitable for me  i m always trying to make my kitchen smarter and this wireless connected air fryer would be the best choice for me  i can prepare meat or veggies in ahead and just put it in the air fryer  i only need to open the air fryer on my way home  everything is super easy and the receipt book really helps to prepare notes for cleaning issues  put aluminum foil and get rid of washing it      
12,5.0,                       we loved how the product worked the first two times we used it but it stopped working after we preheated it to cook with it our third time  after only having it a week we had friends over  tried to cook wings and the air fryer stopped working after a few minutes  it acted as if the timer went off and it completed the cooking process and would not restart  after troubleshooting it would turn on and immediately turn off  we even tried waiting a day and re try it but it did the same thing  product is being returned and replaced so hopefully it will work next time around    update   we received our replacement quickly and absolutely love this airfryer  it does seem to cook a couple of minutes quicker than the recommended times for air fryers which is nice  it s been a few months and we haven t had any problems with it      
13,5.0,                       i ordered this a week ago after looking and reading tons of different reviews about air fryers  asking what friends thought about theirs and what kind they had on fb  and even signed up for consumer reports to find the  very best one   i have a      house and anything that is going to  take up space  has to earn its spot  while doing all of this research i still didn t like the egg shape of the other air fryers    then pops up this beautiful cosori   after reading all the reviews and showing my husband we were sold   i received it last thursday and have used it everyday since  it cooks perfectly  noise level is low  and is it gorgeous on my countertop  i m a person that doesn t like anything sitting out  but i love walking into my kitchen and seeing it  i am also not a person that leaves reviews and here i am leaving my first review  i would definitely buy this again and have already started tell all my friends and some strangers about this beauty  i wish i would have known about cosori before i bought my instant pot  thank you cosori for a well made  and thinking out of the box  or egg  design      
14,1.0,                       we have used this item several times and  as yet  have not had one item come out crispy and not burned  seems like by the time the fries are done and crispy  the ends are burned  am going to try just a little longer with other foods and if i m not satisfied not sure what i will do other than send it back to amazon  even if i don t get a refund   very disappointed         
15,1.0,                       i set up the cosori air fryer as instructed and placed it on the counter with plenty of ventilation for all sides  initially the unit worked as described  after about a month  the unit started to shut down intermittently  i thought it was because it was getting hot  i was confused as to  why it would perform this way  i plugged it into different outlets to see if that would resolve the issue  this did not  finally  it died  it was used less than a dozen times during a three month period i called amazon to initiate a return  the rep issued a return label less the cost of shipping  which reduced the refund by about      i asked why as the unit was clearly defective  the rep said that it was because it was after the    day return window  i said that the defect did not manifest until after a month  and that there was no way to know that it would be defective before then  i asked to speak with a manager  who basically repeated the same policy  the manager did offer to give me the contact information of the manufacturer  she made clear that they would not issue a refund  but would likely reissue another unit  i had lost confidence in the unit given how quickly it puttered out  the manager stated that the refund less the shipping was all that could be done left with two options  a  refund less shipping or b  risk another defective unit and another return scenario  i opted for the first option  i was  nevertheless  deeply disappointed and frustrated that amazon came short on rectifying the situation  to be clear  i do not blame the rep or the manager  they were friendly and professional  they seemed limited to the policy the policy is at issue  this is an electronic unit with electronic complexities  customers of such units would be better served with longer return windows than    days  or whatever the scientific average is for electronic units to manifest defects amazon  if you are reading this  please consider variable return windows given unit complexities categories  perhaps  algorithms can figure out reasonable expectations      
16,4.0,                       i received this air fryer a few months ago as my wife wanted one   she has tried a lot of ones on here but she always found fault with either them being too small or not powerful enough  she noticed many of them had baskets that the non stick flaked off just after a few uses so she has informed me that this one has a great coating  i think it may be ceramic but anyway she says it is a breeze to clean she thought it was making weird noises so she contacted customer support and within a few hours she had a response  they asked her to video tape the unit in operation and once reviewing the video they got right back to her and said it was normal so we know they stand behind their products my wife uses it every day making bacon  sausage and home fries for breakfast and many scrumptious meals we get the frozen battered haddock fillets so on fridays we make our fish fry and it cooks in half the time of the oven she made bacon wrapped pork tenderloin and bacon wrapped fillet mignon and they came out crispy on the outside and juicy inside i have posted a picture of our last nights dinner  she put a dry rub on the wings and cooked with fries and they too came out crispy and juicy and the fries were nice and crunchy but fluffy inside i am so glad she kept trying fryers til she got the one that is the best available i really do recommend purchasing this air fryer   they do have a smaller version but we find this size is good especially if we get company great air fryer       
17,3.0,                       this is the second air fryer i have purchase  other manuf  did not work so order this one   the clear button should be removed and redone by cosori   t fal has a better way to separate pan   think how this is manuf  could be a lot better am sure it will break sometime soon the way it is made   also the pictures show bread and cakes able to be baked  yet not recipes are in enclosed recipe book or are any on their website   nor have i found on any air fryer cookbooks for sale      
18,1.0,                       my mom had wanted an air fryer for her birthday so i got her one   good reviews convinced me to go with this one   big mistake after getting it setup and getting familiar with the controls  we preheated it and decided to make some fries about half way through  after we had shaked them and the heating resumed  it suddenly shut off   the lights simply wouldn t come on  no matter what we did   the basket was in fine  the outlet worked  no power issues  there was no explanation   we waited a bit and tried again  but no luck   the lights never came back on i returned it  after it failed to even cook a single small basket of fries   this wasn t just a broken air fryer   it was a major disappointment for everyone celebrating her birthday      
19,1.0,                       the product is a total piece of trash  the first time did not turn on  after about   minutes it did  and worked   the second time barely made it for five minutes  and the third   the third never did worked  total waste of money      
20,5.0,                       i have used this every day since getting it the    presets are convenient in automatically setting temperatures and times to cook food crisply and evenly  i have made fried chicken  fries  steak  vegetables and more in this handy machine  for all kinds of meals the non stick basket is easy to clean  as all the oil and excess water drips to the bottom basket  you can cook your proteins  then sides without using multiple pans or watching over the time like you would with a stovetop  you can even defrost i chose this model as there is an app with recipes for inspiration  and also a way to start cooking from your phone  and get notified on when to shake or flip halfway it also looks modern in my kitchen and makes a nice futuristic humming sound to boot      
21,1.0,                       opened box on saturday night     added apple pies sunda morning    mins        and after   mins it quite and will not turn back on i m very upset with the price i paid and the other reviews

25,1.0,                       i bought this for my husband s birthday  he follows the keto diet and i thought this would be great for him  we followed the setup instructions  he preheated the air fryer and put in a layer of chicken wings  halfway through  he pulled the basket out  flipped the wings and put the basket back in  it started cooking again for about    seconds and completely shut off  it wouldn t turn back on at all  we tried another appliance in that outlet to make sure we didn t blow a fuse  the outlet is working fine  my husband plugged the air fryer back in a few minutes later  it turned on and immediately off  this is getting returned      
26,5.0,                       took forever and did lots of research online  couldn t find on without negative feedback to took a chance on this one  i love it    i use it for everything  i made a cake in it   use a little cake pan it rises like crazy   i made scrambled eggs  when you put in a pan of course  and all kinds of frying  our favorite is when i make chicken or beef in that montreal rub  first  and make a batch of frozen vegetables after and tilt the pan so the meat juices cover the vegetables  wow so good  cooks food in no time  use it daily  one of my favorite purchases on amazon         now a word of advice  something i wish i knew before hand  don t shake the basket with the base on       it has a nonstick surface  not a smash proof  surface  when you shake your food  the basket taps the inside base and now i have a scratch on the inside base  so  just disconnect the basket then shake  then your solid  i got the white     and its great for a family of three  super easy clean up  i wash mine by hand  really really enjoying my fryer

28,5.0,                       i have shopped around air fryer for quite some time  i bought crux     exclusive for macy but i had to return it due to the quality  size concern  eventually going back to my favorite pressure cooker brand cosori and i found this widget  a bit bigger than i used to have  voltage is my main concern  but it square out when i actually used it  fried chickens received compliments from my wife and daughter  easy to use  touch screen  sleek design and etc  a bit pricey but you pay for it for your family safety and food presentation     now i know why people give   stars to this widget    i measure the basket for you guys      x       good size for anything  no electric issue    well done cosori team      
29,5.0,                       broke after   months the inside melted so handle doesn t close  must say  customer service was amazing   just received a brand new one after they saw my review very happy   i use it all the time was just upset that it broke but they reimbursed me and sent me a new one and i m more than happy       
30,5.0,                       i found the fryer of my dreams    is that even a thing  okay    maybe not     i own a smaller air fryer and love it to pieces and was looking for a larger model     i bought a different one before this one and it was a nightmare     so i looked up some more info on air fryers and came across this cosori model  bought it and have loved it since i took it out of the box  soooo easy to use and soooo easy to clean too  i ve cooked   lbs  of chicken wings in it since i got it  italian sausages  hamburgers  fresh french fries  cornish hens  biscuits  eggs  stuffed mushrooms  pizza  tater tots  fish  i can go on    i really use this machine a lot    in fact  i use this and my other fryer when making meals for my family    quick and easy to do  i haven t had any issues with it    it turns on easily  cooks quickly  and clean up is a breeze    my disabled husband who only has use of one hand can use it easily as well    he even cleans it without a problem    one of the best investments i ever made in a kitchen appliance      
31,1.0,                       please do not buy this product  i purchased it in june and absolutely loved it  recommended it to friends and loved trying new things in it  today i had it on preheat to warm up some pizza for my son and we heard a weird sound and then saw a spark from underneath it  luckily  we were both in the kitchen and saw it happen  i quickly unplugged it and my son said that he saw a flame from underneath  i turned it over and sure enough there was a flame and a burn mark on my counter  i was able to put it out  but it was a very scary moment for the both of us  amazon was amazing and gave me a full refund even though i was way past my return window  please be cautious it you have this product  don t leave the room while using it  it could have caused a lot of damage if i wasn t right there  i am now in search of a new air fryer because it was something i used frequently  i will be contacting the company also as soon as i get their information      
32,5.0,                       actually received the air fryer the day after it was ordered prior to cooking  i ran the fryer on a preheat cycle of     deg  f for   minutes to eliminate any possible manufacturing electrical residue   there was somewhat of an electrical smell with this process  but that has been normal with other kitchen electrics i own    some manuals will even direct you to run the appliance a few minutes to let it  cure in   and to expect an electrical odor    the odor dissipates and isn t an ongoing issue after curing started off with cooking tests of   inexpensive items   meat  potatoes and bread   i didn t use fresh items for the testing  but chose frozen sausage patties  frozen  cubed  hash browns  and canned biscuits   i made certain to preheat the fryer for every item at the cooking temperature being used   the results were impressive for the sausage patties  the fryer was preheated at     deg  f for   minutes then cooked at     deg  f   cook time was    minutes and patties were flipped over at   minutes   the finished patties were tender and moist  just slightly browned around the edges  but not at all burnt or hard   wonderful result    quite a bit of time saved over skillet cooked patties which i usually cook low and slow to keep them tender and avoid hardness burning  the fryer was cooled and preheated again at     deg  f   the frozen cubed potatoes were lightly spritzed with evoo  and cooked at     deg  f for   minutes   with   minutes remaining  the potatoes were tossed well  seasoned with salt and pepper and lightly spritzed again    the potatoes weren t seasoned initially because i wanted to clearly see how well the fryer was browning them    the end result was light brown crusty edges and tender centers   perfect   better than oven roasted saving the canned biscuits for last   i really thought this would be the challenge and was prepared for a re do    i haven t been very successful in the past with canned biscuits in the gowise turbo air fryer    i set the fryer to preheat at     deg  f for   minutes and used the time to lightly butter both sides of the   biscuits the biscuits cooked almost   minutes on     deg  f   at   minutes remaining  i pulled the basket out and checked them with the intent of flipping them over   but i decided to wait and see what the end result if they weren t flipped   i was very surprised to see the end result were biscuits that looked as if they had been cooked in a conventional oven   i literally could see no difference   they rose perfectly  browned without burning and even had a light brown crust on bottom   so there would have been no need to flip them at all    another time saver and great looking biscuits   let me tell you i was happy  keep in mind these tests weren t even run with fresh foods   so i can imagine how great fresh chicken  wings  ribs  steak  fresh seasonal vegetables and homemade breads will be   there may be occasional tweeks with with temps and time  but from what i have seen thus far  this fryer will produce very good results if proper temp  time and techniques are used    and barring any unforeseen errors and issues with the unit of course  almost forgot to mention the keep warm feature is going to be a real help to me since hubby s work hours aren t stable    then there s that gorgeous cookbook that came with the fryer i need to cook through    registered right away to capture the extra year warranty p s    i also have the cosori multicooker which is a stellar performer   it has bake  boil  roast  steam  slow cook    levels   low med high    saute  simmer  brown  yogurt  rice functions and also manual programmable temperature and time input    you can also sterilize items with the boil function    fantastic appliance      
33,5.0,                       this item works well overall and i have had zero serious issues with it   it seems well built and i think that most of the reviewerss that mention the basket attachment point melting on their first use screwed up and didn t put the basket latching mechanism together correctly before running the machine that way   that is technically a product design flaw that requires a modicum of caution for inexperienced users   if the basket is sitting loose in the tray  it s not in there correctly and you will screw your machine up   i have used mine at the highest temp setting for quite some time  i tend to run it hot because i like my food extra done    my basket attachment point has not had a single issue thus far and i expect it to hold up nicely as time wears on   i know a little bit about plastics as a  d printing enthusiast and this stuff seems built to hold up well enough to me unless you screw up putting the basket in the tray in use  the machine works really well overall   it fries things with very little oil needed  but if you want the same texture as actual deep fried foods  you sometimes have to add a little extra oil if something has to cook for a while   preheating is absolutely necessary unless you like very badly fried food   some foods don t react like you think they would to the massive amount of air circulation and you get kind of a staleness or dryness   others like the broccoli and cheese veggie tots were amazing right out of the gate when properly cooked  best i have ever made    bacon in this thing is just incredible and so easy to make   it shrinks up like mad  but it s all perfectly cooked with very little effort   going to try my hand at country ham this weekend   spam needs a low cook temp      or lower  to not flood your house with smoke  the fat in spam has a low smoke point    this thing is amazing at continuing the cooking process for lightly fried potato chips and tortilla chips   no need to pay more for expensove dark russet potato chips from a major brand   this cooker makes the cheap chips sing cleans easy   the software design is not the best and requires a tad more button pressing than it should to use  but it s a minor complaint   you can t press the buttons rapidly as they won t take input very quickly   i wish the temp could go about    degrees higher overall  but it works pretty well regardless and it s far less messy than an actual grease deep fryer and uses less oil      
34,5.0,                       excellent product   i have been exploring healthy cooking now i have a toddler   this air fryer allows me to prepare delicious fried food to my family without the excessive amount of fat and calories that traditionally come with deep frying   the fryer is super easy to set up  use  and clean   food came out so much better than expected and i definitely recommend it as a better alternative to deep fryers   i have a lot of kitchen appliances but i already see myself using this on a frequent basis      
35,5.0,                       i love  love  love this air fryer  i literally use it everyday  i researched several before taking the leap and purchasing this one and i m so glad i did  large square basket that feeds atleast a family of    the preset buttons cook spot on  so far  i have tried the fried chicken from the recipe book and my family said it was delicious  nice and crispy  i temped the chicken and it was where it should be  i have always been nervous about cooking chicken on the bone  but not anymore  being able to preheat the fryer makes cooking even faster  which i love  i m on an eat clean low carb diet so i cook every meal in it  when i m cooking my food i normally just keep it at the     degrees    minute temp time because it cooks so fast  it has a shake reminder  which i find very handy  roasted mushrooms  zoodles  jalape os  i couldn t even name all that i cook in there but it s very convenient and everything tastes great  it even crisps up frozen eggplant slices i have vacuum sealed in the freezer  chicken slices coated in almond or coconut four come out crisp  when you register your fryer you get an extra   year warranty so a total of   years cosori will stand behind their product  the recipe book has tons of recipes with pictures that i can t wait to tweak and make them where i can eat them  or i could just make them how the book says and feed the others in my family    very detailed instruction booklet and quick reference guide included  oh  and all the buttons on the touch panel are easy touch so you don t have to worry about holding down a button or trying to get it to set right when you re in the middle of cooking  i can go on and on about how much i love this thing  but i would probably put people to sleep   i highly recommend      
36,4.0,                       we have owned the appliance for a little over week now and used it almost every day in some fashion   it cleans up very well and haven t had anything really difficult to remove yet that a few minutes soaking didn t resolve   chicken fries  stromboli and french fries came out much better than just oven baking   it preheats faster than the toaster oven and cooks in less time one quirk we don t like that it doesn t remember last temperature   time used   also  when shaking  sometimes it forgets the current settings causing you to have to input them again the larger model is very tall   we had problems storing it in the island cabinets   had to make room under the kitchen sink for storage beware that the max warranty for this item is two years   we thought that you received a two year warranty  and then by registering on their site we would receive another year   that is not the case   you get one year warranty at purchase and another year if you register on their site   i confirmed this by contacting warranty support in conclusion  we really like the air fryer   we think it will be great on camping trips where you can cook food outside the rv and having that extra heat stay outside on a hot  summer day edit   fast forward   monthsstill working great and we have used it on our rv trips   the large size works well for a family of        
37,5.0,                       overall this product is a great addition to any kitchen and amazing at adding a unique flavor to your food  unless you re deep frying now  i wouldn t say this is  healthier   i don t add oil to my food unless i m cooking in here so this is still our not so healthy meal cleaning cleaning this is horrid    i despise it  it is dishwasher safe but if i hand wash the basket every scrubby i have gets caught on the air ventilation holes foods it s excellent for frozen freezer veggies  reheating food etc being a bigger basket does not mean you can put piles of chicken in it  it won t crisp  so it s not necessarily faster if you re making a ton of food overall i do like it and use it maybe twice a month  it s also fun to offer guests delicious home fried food      
38,2.0,                       did not work right out of the box  it would not shut off when you removed the tray you had to hit pause to shut it off  it s so much trouble to return i worked on the part that worked the switch and with a little modification i made it work  just shows you thing are not tested before boxed  i m very disappointed that i had to work on it to make it work right  and you can t go by the recipes  if you do you will burn everything  so play with it to find the right temp  and time  i ll keep working on it       
39,1.0,                       i just bought it last month    we might use once or twice a week     key pad it s not easy you press and nothing happens you have to keep pressing in order to hopefully set the temp and time    if it wasn t for the keypad all would it be great     
40,5.0,                       best purchase i ve made all year  it s quick and easy to make a meal  i made chicken wings with no breading and they came outcrunchy and delicious      
41,1.0,                       not too pleased with the results     
42,1.0,                       as with so many others my wifi unit has failed the temp and time buttons   returned it and the accessory kit to amazon    please stop selling these defective units      
43,5.0,                       i bought the     qt on       and to be honest  i dislike cooking   i have never in my life cooked wings before and  because the recipe was simple  i did them twice in one week  and they were delicious  as you can tell by my pix  i cook like a beginner  i ve always opted for the microwave for its speed and simplicity   but the cosori cooks faster than a regular oven   it s like having an easybake oven  which i never had as a child   if you re sitting on the fence debating about getting one  get off your butt and do it  there are more expensive ones around and some a lot cheaper  i got the red one because it was under      the day i purchased it   my eating habits are certainly becoming much more healthy   there are     recipes in the book that comes with the air fryer and they call for items you probably have on hand      
44,4.0,                       i researched air fryers for quite awhile before buying one and talked myself  out of buying one several times   glad i finally said yes to my arguments though   i made a baked potato first  then crab cakes  fried catfish  sweet potatoes  chicken drumsticks and tomorrow pork chops   kind of a learning curve to see how your appliance cooks   keep a journal of temperatures for your preference   its super easy to clean and looks good on the counter   not a lot of buttons until you turn it on and then it looks like cockpit controls   my three favorite appliances are my air fryer  crock pot  electric grill and instant pot    ok     happy frying      
45,5.0,                       i love this product  i have tried several recipes   they all came out great with a few little common sense tweeks here   their  i was a little leary about having to cook in batches but it cooks so fast that it is an non issue     
46,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i really like this air fryer  i have only had it for two weeks and have used it three times  every time i use it excessive smoke comes out of the supposedly seals of the pull out drawer  see video  and sets off my smoke alarm  usually around     minutes    this will be my third air fryer and have never experienced this before   also  i have reviewed all of the other reviews and did not see a pattern that this is normal   i am literally afraid to use it   if i still had the box i would return it   i am just going to throw it out   the food did come out good though and i absolutely love the smart features   i am really disappointed because i have read really good things about the cosori and many of the youtube videos i have watched for air fryer recipes use it   guess i just got a lemon update   i was contacted by cosori  they actually contacted me  and just like other reviewers  they addressed my issue and sent me a new air fryer   great customer service   it is so refreshing to deal with a company who stands by their product   as i type  i am making wings for the first time in my new air fryer  and guess what  no smoke   smells amazing      
47,5.0,                       arrived on time  tried it that night  made excellent breaded pork chops  see picture   my only concern is that there is a rattling noise that gets progressively louder and then abruptly stops  sounds like a loose part of some sort   i did line the outer basket with aluminum foil but i don t think that caused the noise  overall  i can see myself using this for many years to come  the chops came out juicy and crispy as if i had deep fried them  with the satisfaction of knowing that it s healthier to some extent   for those that bought this  is the noise in my video normal or do i have a defective unit  i don t really mind the noise i m just scared that it will break down in the future or heavens forbid catch fire    stars if it weren t for the noise update          arovast reached out to me via personal message and asked me to send a video of the appliance directly to them for analysis  it turns out that the unit indeed had an issue  i was ordered a replacement unit free of charge within    hours  shirley was excellent in handling the issue and bringing a swift resolution  great customer service and great appliance  i will be sure to spread the word      
48,4.0,                       this is my third brand of air fryer  i had a habor that malfunctioned after   months  bought a     dollar breville smart oven that malfunctioned on day one  i had it    but i wanted an air fryer because i didn t want to fire up the oven every time i wanted to oven fry   pieces of chicken  i caved and got the cosori pros  large capacity      qt  small profile compared to others  non stick seems more durable than others  my habor started chipping after a few uses and hand washing    after having made fried chicken in other air fryers  this one reigns supreme  it achieves something that other air fryers couldn t do  normally   crispy  fried chicken in an air fryer just describes the skin being rendered to a point where its like a shell on the chicken  sure  its crunchy  but it lacks the texture of fried chicken  the cosori somehow manages to get those little  bubbles  in the skin like real fried chicken  it has more of the texture of real fried chicken cons  how long will it last  my past experience with other brands doesn t give me confidence  sure  cosori gives you a   year warranty   but i would rather have something that lasts than something you need to trade in every now and then   keeping in mind that once the   years is up   no more trade ins only time will tell if you want to slide the basket out to flip food  its probably best to pull it completely out  otherwise the electronic control panel gets a blast of hot steam  which can t be good  maybe the panel is protected from this  i m not going to chance it  if it s not protected from hot steam  its a design flaw update  while performance on this air fryer is great  the unit died after    months  cosori sent me a new one    but said  because its close to the end of warranty  they will send a new one  but this new one will not be covered  this product  is advertised as a two year warranty  i appreciate them sending me a new fryer  but i think they need to read their own literature you will not be disappointed with the performance of this air fryer   when it works      
49,1.0,                       love the convenience and size  love the flavor and crispness  love the functional aspects as finish of the cooking unit however  the teflon on the cooking basket is already rubbing off  we use teflon safe sponges by scotch and haven t had any similar issues with our cookware  primarily im concerned about the safety of the coating since its pretty  suspect  if its already wearing off  is it getting into our food  i dont know but i have two children which isnt worth the risk   it has the feeling if one of those  dollar store  pans   secondly  for it to show so much wear after   months is  cheap  and surprising for a unit that is so well designed otherwise  if it is a part that needs regular replacement  fine  then sell the replacement baskets and perhaps dont use teflon      
50,1.0,                       stopped working after a few uses super sad going to return and buy a different brand      
51,5.0,                       used it once and the touch screen did not work again until after cooling down  after the second use the heating element does not work anymore  was looking forward to using this often but not now  hoping customer service is awesome when i call to talk about this update      cosori customer support is wonderful  they stand behind their product  they are sending a new one and don t want the other in return  no hassle  i even got a follow up call and email to see if there was anything else they can do  thank you jubilee      
52,5.0,                       i ll admit that the only reason i bought this  is because several people told me that air fryers make great steaks i love a good steak  and have never been satisfied with any that i ve made indoors every recipe i ve seen says to cook steak at      but i usually cook very thick   lb ribeyes  and that seems to dry it a bit too much on the outside  while leaving the middle undone  so i reduced the temperature to     and slightly increased the cook time  and it came out perfect of course  the thickness of your steak is going to make a difference  so experiment a little i simply marinated in mccormick s garlic  herb   wine marinade and had the best homemade ribeye i ve ever eaten i have only had the thing a week so far  but have made steak   times  taquitos  frozen corn dog mini s  and frozen pre breaded okra the okra didn t turn out so good  so i ll need to experiment a bit more with that  but everything else was great i read that spritzing a little oil on the okra first will have it coming out just perfect i love that the flavor is sealed  foods are perfectly cooked on the outside and crisp when they are supposed to be crisp  like the corn dogs and taquitos   but not dried out on the inside it is my first air fryer  but i believe i made the right choice going with the cosori it is super easy to use and super easy to clean i wouldn t hesitate to buy this brand again      
53,1.0,                       it caught fire  i never leave my appliances running unattended   i smelled smoke and to my shock it was the cosori air max  flames quickly spread under the bottom plate  we put out the fire  there was no warning or breakdown   it simply started to burn  thank goodness i was in the kitchen  i could have lost everything   i have called  cosori   times and left messages  no one has called back      
54,5.0,                       after months of research i finally decided on this model  i went back and forth between the models with windows vs the basket style like this one  many helpful reviewers stated how easy it was to clean this unit   i think that s what finally sealed the deal for me  i just wanted an air fryer that was easy to use and clean   if these factors are also important to you  look no further now let s talk about what a great cooking job it does  the first meal i prepared was jerk chicken thighs  boneless  skinless   i marinated the meat overnight with jerk seasoning and cooked them in the  pre heated  air fryer at      for    minutes  i pulled the tray out after    to flip the meat and realized there was no need   they were perfectly cooked  crispy on the outside  juicy and tender on the inside the fryer has a sleek  low profile design and won t take up too much room on your counter top  no more than a standard toaster oven   if you re lucky enough to have lots of cabinet space  it will tuck away nicely i am just getting started with this thing but am very happy with my purchase  happy cooking      
55,1.0,                       waste of money  giant piece of crap    will never buy this product again       
56,3.0,                       i bought this and it worked great for about   weeks  then i began having issues  it would turn on and off during the cooking process repeatedly anytime i set the temperature above     degrees for very long  it eventually shut itself down completely and would not power up after i tried     degrees for cooking  i thought it was dead and was going to throw it out in anger  a few days later i tried it again  and it powered up fine  i tried to preheat to     degrees and it made it about   minutes or so before it began cycling on and off  i backed the temperature back down to     and it works fine for any length of time at that temperature  maybe i can push it to     degrees  but i know         degrees causes problems  the thermostat seems to be shutting the unit down due to overheating of the inside of the unit  i have noticed this air fryer seems to cook a little hot for the displayed temperature  french fries start to burn at the end of cooking the allotted time when the readout says i m at          maybe the display and actual temperature are not calibrated correctly  maybe this is only my unit  or maybe its more prevalent in other units  i don t know  in any event  it s pretty functional and is a of good size  just average in overall quality as all these air fryers are almost the exact same regardless of brand in this price range  all made in china  you get what you pay for      
57,1.0,                       buyer beware  it may seem like an amazing deal but these air fryers are shoddily made  i purchased this air fryer and it worked well for a day while using the app  but when i went to use it without the app  the three buttons did not work  the temperature setting buttons  the whole middle area of the touch sensor did not work  so i asked for a replacement and that one was even worse      of the touch areas did not work  including the power button  i also noticed they sent me a refurbished one instead of a brand new one  that is not what i paid for  i can no longer trust amazon s supply chain to order appliances  i feel like the whole chain is tainted by bad actors and they are too big and oblivious to take any credible actions to mitigate this  all they can do is offer a    credit for your troubles  i do not know about you but i value my time and it is worth more than     think twice before ordering any appliances from amazon      
58,1.0,                       i purchased this air fryer based on the reviews and videos i saw  the first unit came and the touch screen was not interactive  the unit would only power on if i asked alexa to turn it on  after alexa powered it on  the buttons still did not work  i called cosori and they did not question my issue  seeming to me like this was a very common issue i did a replacement through amazon and my second unit came  i was able to power it on with the power button  but trying to switch between presets was difficult  trying to adjust the temp and timer would not work at all  sorry cosori  this is a poor product  i am going to find another brand   do not buy       
59,4.0,                       i have nothing but great complements on the design and results based upon first two uses   on third time it failed completely   shut down and screen was blank   after    minutes it beeped and restarted   so i tried it again   same failure occurred again   shut down and reset after       minutes   as i kept trying it the failure problem seemed to disappear most of the time   i was so satisfied when it worked i just kept trying to figure out what was going wrong   some component internally is a problem in the first one contacted cosori   they were very helpful and would assist in replacing it   excellent customer support received a replacement the next day from amazon while i initially received one with a defect i am very satisfied with the second air fryer   it is well designed  the right size for       people depending on what you are cooking   i am developing my own recipes for food my wife and i like   we ll take the air fryer traveling with us this summer in that we prefer our own food over restaurant food most of the time   we have cooked biscuits  muffins  corn bread  chicken  turkey thighs  hamburgers  pork ribs  pizza  home made   kabobs  etc  as we see how much we can do with an air fryer very pleased with the design and replacement air fryer      
60,2.0,                       after using this for the first time  i can honestly say there is no such thing as  air frying  this is nothing more than a counter top convection oven  heating unit up top to brown  hot air circulated within the chamber to heat i used my oven fried chicken recipe and tried it in this air fryer  the chicken came out the same  aside from the fact i had to make it in   batches  due to space  as oppossed to one batch maybe it s because i already make my food in my large convection oven  the results are the same  crispy on the outside  moist and tender in the middle  little to no oil as for french fries  i won t even try them  fries you find in the freezer isle of your local grocer are unhealthy to begin with  read the ingredients  some of them require a degree in chemistry to understand what s in them  plus  they are already laced with oil and sodium  making them in the air fryer does not change their ingredients  or  in my opinion  make them healthier for you as opposed to making them in my convection oven  i now opt for fresh russets  toss with oil  and roasted on parchment paper in my oven so  i guess it is just a matter of opinion  as for me  there is no such thing as  air frying   trying to cut sodiuim  fat  and carbs  i ll continue with my tried and true tested methods used in my convection oven  low oil  low to no sodium  roasted on parchment paper  sometimes going back to basics is so much healthier and easier than all these new  must have latest devices      
61,4.0,this is my first air fryer  i was skeptical about air fryers but i have barely used my oven in the     weeks since i got this  the controls are simple and intuitive  i like the pre sets which make it easy to simply put my food in and push a button  i can use the pre set temperature and time  or fine tune it to my liking  i can also choose not to use a pre set  and instead i can manually enter a temperature and time   be advised that by manually entering a temperature and time you will not get a reminder to shake or turn your food  i like that it is quiet during operation  i like that the non stick inner basket makes clean up very easy   there are a few things i would like to see improved on this air fryer   the handle which attaches the inner basket to the lower basket feels like it will not stand the test of time  i think this would be better if the inner basket and its handle were one solid piece instead of a plastic handle fastened to the basket  the clear plastic piece covering the button which releases the inner basket from the lower basket feels like it is about to fall off at any moment   the biggest issue  in my opinion  is the app itself  there are things this app has permission to do on your phone which make me refuse to install it  such as  directly call phone numbers   excuse me  in what way is this needed to control an air fryer  read your contacts   no thanks  this will be followed by those on my contacts receiving spam calls  modify or delete contents of usb storage take pictures and videos uninstall shortcuts  there are other permissions which i find questionable  but those are the ones that i find most concerning   that being said  i do like the air fryer itself   if you are reading this and considering buying it  my advice is to buy this air fryer  just don t install the app 
62,5.0,                       at the end of december i finally decided to purchase an air fryer   after looking at several i decided on the cosori     qt   everything i have tried in the cosori  frozen french fries  onion rings  breaded okra  beer battered fish  chicken nuggets  fresh salmon  tater tots  and pepper poppers  have turned out crispy and delicious   i find it very easy to use   it has several presets as well as manual controls  i like the shake reminder when using the frozen preset and that it turns off when you pull out to shake and back on when you return the basket  the square basket allows everything to fit inside nicely and clean up is a breeze   the size of this fryer is too large to leave out on my kitchen counter but it is easy to lift in and out of my pantry when needed  i was impressed that they offered a two year warranty  tells me they stand behind what they are selling and i am hoping if i ever have a problem their  need help  talk to us  statement on the very nice recipe booklet i received with customer service information will prove to be as helpful as the statement sounds   i am not sure why it took me so long to take the air fryer plunge  but i am glad i chose the     qt  cosori air fryer and hope it continues to prove to be an excellent decision and purchase on my part      
63,1.0,                       it warmed up french fries after    minutes  i sprayed the fries with olive oil and they did not get crisp    very disappointing     i sent it back   after doing more research there is no way to fry food unless its submerged it oil in a frying pan          as in there there is no such thing as an air fryer          it is a toaster oven with a fan in the back and the fan in mine is broken            i am looking into a convection toaster oven  same thing as air fryer only honest      
64,1.0,                       got in mail plugged in it flashed a couple times and never worked again     
65,3.0,                       the fryer itself is good  i hesitated to get the wifi version with all the data leaks  etc  but after using it  was glad i did except    the app is junk    it s a generic control app  it let s you set your fryer to preheat and cook  it notifies you it s preheated sometimes  if you are actively using your phone  notifications work  god forbid you set it down and the screen goes off  no notifications  garbage  i have resorted to setting separate alarms for preheat and cooking  so many possibilities  such poor execution      
66,1.0,                       so disappointed  my daughter has an inexpensive air fryer so i decided to go better expecting more than looking nice  so loud i would never use with company in an open kitchen  going back in the box relegated to the closet   basket size is nice  that s the most positive comment i can make for an expensive mistake well i have to add their customer support team called today and offered to help me including a refund  great customer attention  debating my options but i will always do business with a company i trust      
67,1.0,                       cooked the food well  but my hash brown has the burnt plastic aroma afterward  igree with one of the reviewer  while cooking the food  it smells so weird like a burnt plastic and when i tried to eat the food it s taste like burnt plastic   it s definitely a big no for cooking equipment      
68,5.0,                       my wife and i didn t really need anything for christmas  so she had the idea of purchasing an air fryer   we had purchased a pressure cooker a while back and we don t really use it  even though it s a nice one   in part  i think we re kind of creeped out by using a high pressure device  and that s no doubt just an  us  problem so i read about these things and bought this cosori     qt model with alexa   wifi connectivity  not that i think i ll ever use that connectivity  but for     more after a coupon  why not   and we are a full alexa house  so you never know   it allows you to upload recipe parameters so far we absolutely love this cosori   we ve purchased a french fry slicer and made outstanding french fries   we ve made burgers in it   both frozen and from ground beef   we ve done the grilled ham and cheese and tuna melts  though these will take some experimenting with as the top can blow off of the sandwich or the bread can end up too dry  maybe more butter     my wife has done frozen fish in it   we also bought the extra accessories and have even made pizzas from pre made dough and we re getting ready to try premade crusts that don t have to be thawed   we ve also done the breakfast sandwiches   it makes excellent bacon   this is probably some of the best bacon we ve made the recipe book does have some minor issues  the one that i remember first and foremost is that if you get a pound of ground beef to make sliders  and this is what the recipe calls for     pound of ground beef   the recipe then tells you to fashion it into   evenly formed patties   but that s a     burger   that s not a slider   it makes about   sliders using my burger press with the slider piece  and they re great   we ve encountered a couple other minor things in the recipe book  but if somebody as bad in the kitchen as me can figure those out  anybody can   if only there was an easy mechanism to recommend corrections originally  i rated this as a   star due to what was definitely a defective control panel that made changing the temperature and time a serious hassle   amazon exchanged the unit and while the replace did have a periodic vibration  that appears to have gone away  hopefully for good   the control panel on the new unit appears just fine in addition to the extra accessories  i even went so far as to buy the ramekins in two sizes for both eggs and deserts  basting brushes for spreading the olive oil nicely on the burgers  etc   i just ordered additional pizza pans so we can have them stacked up and ready to use   and that leads to the next thing   if you re like me  you ll find that you actually enjoy using this thing so much  you ll want to use it as often as possible   the problem is that  for example  making pizzas for three   well  you can only do one at a time   same deal when making an   pack of ready to bake biscuits   you can only do   at a shot   we ve jokingly tossed around the idea of purchasing a second unit  or maybe a bigger one   we ll have to see   i will tell you this   i m horrible in the kitchen and this thing is actually making me look like i m talented at preparing food      
69,1.0,                       a couple months of using this the tiny screws keep falling out into the food i m cooking  i have managed to get them out and screw them back in tight as i can  but they always fall out  well  today i missed a washer that fell off the screw  thank goodness my son is old enough to notice and didn t break a tooth eating it  very disappointing reading all these good reviews and feeling like i got a lemon  i m trying to contact the manufacturer because its dangerous  but i m not sure how   i just want a replacement that doesn t fall apart      
70,4.0,                       i heard so much about these things that i had to give it a try  the fact that this one has a pre heat setting is what tipped the scales for me  that helps with the crisping of foods we are a family of   and i got the    qt  size fryer  it holds plenty  yet it has a low profile and fits under my kitchen cabinet for those of you  like me  who were confused on what this appliance actually is  it s really a counter top convection oven  not a  fryer   it circulates hot air around your food  the result is nicely cooked veggies  seafood  etc  in a short amount of time  the veggies turn out great    similar to roasting but it takes a lot less time  just toss your what you re cooking lightly in olive oil and the machine does the rest it s also very easy to clean   the only thing i would improve is the release button on the basket    it s a little tricky at first to get the hang of    but after a few surprise drops  i m now trained to make sure it s resting a counter before releasing the basket  we re having fun with it so far this would be a good appliance for very small apartments  motor homes  or boats because it can actually function as your main oven      
71,5.0,                       i added this product onto our wedding registry because i was running out of items we needed   we didn t even know we needed this  but we love using it nearly every day   actually  the one we were gifted was broken and cosori sent us a brand new replacement immediately so high praise for their customer service  we love the larger     quart size and is non stick and cleans  super  easily which is great for someone like me who hates to wash dishes a few tips to convince anyone on the fence about getting an air fryer     costco pre cooked bacon tastes amazing in this     leftover pizza tastes even better than fresh pizza in   minutes  no preheat needed     tons of trader joe s frozen foods cook perfectly and really easily in this like their cauliflower gnocchi  chicken tenders  corn  and turning fresh asparagus and butternut squash zigzags into alternative fries     leftover veggies reheat well in this with a nice char which makes it better than the fresh dishour so called  instant  pot is never coming up from under the counter again while this cosori air fryer is the only table top appliance we don t store away between uses because we use it so often      
72,1.0,                       i love using the air fryer  it cooks almost as fast as a microwave  but with way better results  that saidthe reason i m giving it   start is the  touch  screen  it s not responsive and sometimes takes several pushes to start working  it s terrible and if i didn t throw the box away it would be returned update after using this fryer for a few months it gets   star  it cooks fine  when i can use the buttons    however the basket has screws that need to be tightened regularly or the basket will not lock together and the base will fall off  this has happened twice while loaded with food  which ended up on the floor lastly the  rd party app that they use to control the wifi  which i only use because the buttons don t function properly  tracks your location  i find that completely unacceptable  when i spoke with the app company they say it so they can set the clock   seriously            
73,1.0,                       i was a huge fan of this machine   used it daily for the first week i had it   then while using it on day   it stopped running in the middle of cooking   thought it may have over heated so turned it ofd and let it cool for an hour and i even tuned on a fan to help cool it down   it started again but would not stay on   the lights would flash on then off and then back on   i  cleaned it up and put it away for the week and decided i wpuld give it one more try before returning and no luck   started and the turned off   went through it twice and then it would not turn on again   returning tomorrow     
74,4.0,                       ordered model cp    af  which is nice matte deep red  on oct           with delivery window of the   th by   p m  it arrived before   p m  it was packed nicely and the manufacturers box has a handle so it was easy to lift from packing box  there is a user manual which you should take the time to read and a recipe book about     pages of recipes  was starving but i went over it and over the manual as my pictures show it was larger than i thought as i live in an apt  make sure you have counter space to have    from your wall as steam escapes from the rear     there is a plastic cover over the basket release button   please make sure it s in place so it won t be pushed by accident  it will release the inner basket which is holding the outer basket and also have a solid surface to place it on before you release  i put mine on the large burner on my stove as there wasn t enough room on counter  it was enough room to pull it out so i could flip the scallops i didn t release it until i was ready to wash it  i had to give a slight tug to remove basket from fryer because it is new  it should slid out easier with more use  the manual is very informative and the display is easy to use with pictures of preset food items i will purchase additional accessories such as ramakens  cake and pie pan as some recipes call for them  i do have some small glass containers i can use  you can use pyrex or anything you can use in an oven  also a sprayer for oil my first use was for jumbo scallops  i didn t have a sprayer so i used paper towels to dab olive oil lightly and old bay seasoning  there wasn t a recipe or temp and cook time so i did a search online  i did preheat of     and cooked at     for   mins each side  checked and did another minute  i should of used the preset fish instead of shrimp but i m learning they came out delicious  they don t get brown like searing them in butter but the old bay added some color to them  i have alaskan pollack fillets i am trying next and pork chops  so far i love it and look forward to using it daily i will do an update    update    love cooking with this  issue is the cookbook fell apart and i had only browsed through it once and a metal prong seperated from the skewer rack so i went down a star      
75,2.0,                       we love our cosori air fryer  it s working and has worked as it is supposed to be working  however after   months of use we started to notice that the exterior of the air fryer  is made of cheap plastic  has started to crack i will still recommend the cosori however youhave to be aware that the exterior is made of cheap plastic i will update my review on a few months      
76,5.0,                       this is my first air fryer   it is basically a small convection oven that needs       minutes to pre heat   cooking is about        faster than a normal oven   get the bigger size  we need to make a meal for       people and you want you food to lie flat for the best roasting  temperature max is     degrees pros   preset   buttons are easy to use   french fried  carrot  root vegetables   meat  etc   the cooking book and recipe manual are very helpful   clean up is super easy   the metal is very non stick as is the bottom pan that catches the drips  you can use a preset button to get an idea of recommended temperature and time but use the time temp button to adjust it down  on the presets  it beeps half way through for you to  shake  the food which is helpful to see how cooked they are  i finally was able to make roasted brussel sprouts with a maple glaze that have not worked out in my normal oven  there was a plastic smell the first time i used it and a faint hint in the food  but now i do not notice it  the cooking area where your food is is metal cons   big and high so it does not fit in my pan cabinet  french fry preset was way too long   need about    minute instead  total tips   adjust the time to less than what is recommended or else they may be dry and overcooked  spray the vegetables with olive oil and i use tongs to  toss  them around at the mid point alarmi was worried about buying this brand since i had never heard of it before   i have made complete meals  cooking the veggies separate from the cut chicken in the air fryer  and i am very happy with the purchase   i have been using for about   weeks      
77,5.0,                       it s almost twice the size of my other one   if they made a bigger one i d get it   i own a smoker and would cook ribs in it for   hours   i ve cooked ribs in my oven   but     minutes in this air fryer makes the best ribs i ve eaten   i don t even use sauce   just seasoning bacon just    minutes for crispy just right   fries are great   steaks come out like they were on a grill      
78,3.0,                       stopped working after   uses and i left a bad review   customer service contacted me immediately and sent me a new one   hopefully this one will work longer   it does an awesome job of cooking food and easy to clean   good customer service   would recommend     
79,5.0,                       i adore this machine  my mom and i have been wanting an air fryer for years now and shopped around everywhere for the very best one  of course  amazon had the best deal but was it the right one  for us  my mom s not good at computers yet i am  what can i find that will work for us both  she needs something that she can easily figure out to use on her own while i want something that isn t archaic looking with knobs and a cvs receipt like list of instructions  well  this was the answer to our prayers it s modern  easy to use  functions operate like a regular oven   easy to clean and figure out  also  everything you put in it comes out instantly more delicious we bought the accessories and the recipe book  as well  and i m planning on cooking up a storm for mother s day      using just this air fryer and the recipe book  i don t even like to cook forget that foods are     healthier because of less oil  this is so much fun  from breakfast to dessert  i ve never been so happy to eat p s  my one complaint is that it is noisy to me  nothing above annoying level but it does make a consistent sound when powered on  dependent on your kitchen layout  it could be annoying  if i m in the kitchen with it  it s annoying  if i m not  it s fine  my mom doesn t mind it because she says you need to know when it s on  depends on the person  i guess      
80,4.0,                       works amazingly well  i ve had another air fryer  but it s nothing compared to this one  cooked my fries within    min  crispy  and tasty  my only complaint is the basket is difficult to dislodge from the pan itself  and i ve almost dropped it as a result  why i gave   stars instead     they need to work on a better means of releasing the basket so we can wash it  and retrieve the food from it  other than that  i m very happy with my purchase  i ve already registered for the warranty to get the extra year  very satisfied customer      
81,1.0,                       the thing  reeks of burrning plastic and the food tastes like plastic  it s horrible i was really looking forward to this but now i am totally put off of any air fryer  i may keep trying but today was worse than yesterday   it did cook frozen fries and onion rings well bit i could have the same result from my oven  it s too bad they tasted like burnt plastic  i will never consider this product again     
82,1.0,                       i m sorry to say i ll have to change my review from   stars to one star   i had learned to cook many different foods in my cosori air fryer   i have bragged to my cooking friends and relatives about how good the food was when cooked in the cosori   my daughter from tn visited us today and i was showing off demonstrating how to use the cosori when the heating element in the cosori quit   the fan started blowing cold air   my husband and i were cooking with this air fryer almost everyday   i loved the foods i had learned to cook in my cosori   i am extremely disappointed that it only worked for four months   i ll have to try another brand of air fryer      
83,3.0,                       review cosori smart wifi air fryer    qtpro  good size not to big and tall  inside is wide  fast cooker  simple to use have good wifi rang smart feature can notify me on the phone when the food is done  also custom your meal setting  easy to clean con  inside might be wide  but  the basket is wasting some space when the pan under it is so much larger  poor height  this might be wide  but also short  can t or have hard time fitting a whole  large chicken  small  lb is good  i did got a  lb fit  but need to push flat as possible for it to fit  it had about  cm clearance from the heating element  which is not ideal and it came out dry  the  lb was still juicy due to more clearance and space for the air to heat it  so much plastic on the front cover  as it trap water inside after wash  because it traps water  after rinsing  when you cook again  there will be steam comes out under or inside the basket  some people have noted this as smoke  but is just steam   nasty smell  i don t know what it is  but after   min of cooking there is a nasty smell  like plastic or non stick coating  i really don t know what it is  but i would guess is the thick plastic from the front cover  it s still there after weeks of use    i also did washed before using it the first time   pre set options are awful  they always over cook and burn my food   unless you are cooking very large or fill whole basket full  don t use the pre setting   the key touch pad buttons as one of the worst i have use  it either reads your touch to much or don t at all  as other have stated  mine so falr haven t fail yet  no dehydrator option  even though it can do it  but since cosori sells a dehydrator oven they left this option out  other fryer in the market have this option handy  final thought i only pick this cause it was on sale under       and it has smart wifi  the app is handy as it can control the unit if the touch pad does fail one day  cooking food is great as long you don t use the pre setting  like cooking frys and pre cook chicken wings from the freezer does not need   min  rather a   min is done  and that s fast  my conventional counter oven would take      min  food comes out not as crunchy crispy as some other fryer i had used i wish the height of the basket would be taller as another brand i had that was a  qt was just enough to fit a whole small chicken even though it was only a little less wide as this finally the weird smell really kills this review  i just don t know why  i had used my friend s fryer another brand which doesn t have this issue  i really think they over used the cheap plastic cover that s causing it after it heats up  or i could be wrong  this fryer is  really a  heat dryer  as it doesn t fry anything nor it will replace my counter oven  because it just can t do large item or frozen bun  which best to steam  however  it does cook fast and can keep the juice in the meat  plus reducing the fat  again it s great with meat and that s about it  everything else is just okay  it s also a bit pricey for something with so many cons  you can find way cheaper air fryer this size on sale if not for the smart wifi feature   even cosori s other lower model which is the same size cheaper by     update        after months of use  the smell is still there  it has to do with the plastic  the smell is from the top of the unit  anytime i cook over   min i can start to smell it  won t find this toxic smell from my counter top oven  i have my windows open and fan on to escape the smell  if not i would of trashed this  now i m just waiting for this fryer to fail one day so i can get something else  otherwise  it still cooks not to bad  they have so far a second firmware update   don t know what they tried to improve on the unit  wish they would have a history log from app      
84,5.0,                       this air fryer is the best kitchen supplies i bought this year air fryer with wifi is awesome i don t have to go to kitchen to control it this is not just fried i can make a dessert too  i am glad they gave me the recipes book so  it makes much more easy to cook and this size is totally enough for     people pretty incredible      
85,1.0,                       deserves zero stars  the air fryer sent to me has not only been used  but was not even washed  very disgusting  i will never purchase from cosori again  i m very surprised that it came directly from the brand manufacturer itself  not a third party  it was sold as  new   thankfully it can be easily returned but it was needed for the holiday weekend      
86,5.0,                       i guess that it didn t  die   it just decided be lazy  my guess is a faulty temp sensor or some such malfunction  as it will run for   minutes or so  and then shut off until the whole thing cools off again  it literally behaves as it s unplugged   if i set it to a low temp  like     or so  it will work for longer  but what good is that  unfortunately  it s just out of the return window by a couple of weeks or so  and i had just discarded the original packaging thinking that it was good to go after using it every weekend for a month  i figured that i was out of luck cosori customer service contacted me  see comments  and after sending an email as requested  they shipped me a new one right away  i m typing this as delicious corn on the cob is frying in it  yum  they shipped out the new unit quickly via fedex and it got to me fast  i am very  very satisfied with cosori there s going to be a failure rate with everything  even if it s a very small percentage  and great customer service can make up for it  it did with me      
87,5.0,                       when the air fry craze first hit i thought a multi task unit was for me   i used the cuisinart for a year before i decided to buy a dedicated air fryer   the cuisinart gave me a great learning experience but it was an awful chore to clean   also the heating element consisted of   ceramic rods at the top which didn t air fry the whole basket evenly   i settled on the cosori after a week of you tube videos and internet research   in the   days of owning the cosori i ve only been able to fry   items   ie   chicken wings and this morning   breakfast sausages   i can tell you that i do not miss the cuisinart at all   reasons for my liking the cosori are   very easy to clean   the exposed heating element seems to burn off any grease splatter before it hots the fan grid work   the square pan allows more food in a single layer than a round pan   the large heating element eliminates any hot cold spots in the fry basket   much smaller footprint than the cuisinart   there is a learning curve   the   items i fried were a little too well done for my liking   the cosori cooks much faster than the cuisinart so i will adjust my recipes accordingly   i am glad that i had a year s air fry experience   i know how to correct recipe instructions for my liking   the experience is sufficient to allow me to review the cosori without prejudice   between the cosori and my instant pot i can use my range s oven for storage      
88,4.0,                       i don t usually do reviews so i ll keep it short first off  this air fryer for the most part was great   a few coworkers talked me into it so i decided to give it a shot what i liked i don t think there s anything prepared i did not like  some of the best fresh fish i ve ever had  this by far is the one thing that i can say may be worth the purchase alone     phenomenal  potatoes  chicken  the crunch in asparagus and broccoli that i ve never had before but could definitely get used to  just a spritz of olive oil and seasoning  just set and forget  cook time is short and clean up is easy  basket capacity is good enough to cook multiple items at a time what i didn t like    some may not consider this an issue but i can t get over the smell  it s overwhelming and can last for days   it s not a plastic smell that some complain about  that goes away in time  it s a deep fryer smell that permeates through the house and lingers for days  an issue that others i ve talked to don t seem to have with their air fryers  maybe better air filtration would benefit     i found   of the screws in the bottom of the basket after a few uses  this actually didn t bother me as much as      just a small phillips head and problem solved    this contradicts one of the reasons i liked this model but     it s big  make sure you have counter space to accommodate  likely fine for most  just takes up too much space for me personally so in summary  i liked it   recommend it and most probably would agree   but i have to return this one      
89,3.0,                       i ve used it twice   so still getting used to it  last night i made chicken thighs and they took much longer to reach the proper temp than the recipe had called for and i had brought them close to room temp  not quite sure how to get the crispness on veggies like broccoli and brussels sprouts  have to adjust to learning curve  appreciate your interest      
90,1.0,                       just ordered this last week   i have used it at least    times already   as much as i love how it cooks food and everything comes out crispy   the burning plastic smell has not dissipated   it makes my whole house smell terrible and makes me nauseous  i really wanted to love this air fryer fromhow good the reviews were  but the smell is terrible        
91,4.0,                       problems fixed     please see end of review for update i want to love my cosori air fryer   i saw it used on a youtube cooking channel  and so i figured  this must be a pretty mainstream product   i got it seven months ago and it has become a mainstay in the kitchen  and all but replaced the toaster oven  the frying pan  and even the grill the one problem i have is that the buttons  or whatever you call those little circles on the front panel  are very difficult to press  especially with damp fingers   it just doesn t work  what s more  when i press them  they don t activate the function immediately  they seem to work only after my finger is lifted   a kind of delayed reaction  in other words  i can t understand why they couldn t have used an old fashioned set of push buttons  or even a mechanical dial switch   these technologies have been around for at least     years and are pretty well understood i have tried and tried to figure out how to use the buttons but they are just persnickety and only work part of the time   extremely frustrating and that s why i knocked the rating down from   stars to     i m planning to finally contact them and ask whether i have a defective unit  and if they can somehow fix the problem  i ll be happy to alter this rating apart from that  mrs  lincoln  how was the play as a cooking appliance  if you can get past the awful user interface  it s a great cooker   it can cook     chicken drumsticks in    minutes and they come out absolutely delicious  juicy and tender  not raw in the middle  not burned on the outside it makes toast reasonably well  though we don t make a lot of toast in this house    it is great for reheating things   it is wonderful for vegetables  one of our favorites is broccoli florets sprinkled with hoisin sauce and garlic    just don t over cook or you get these nasty black bitter bits that are quite unappetizing there are hundreds of videos out there demonstrating how to make just about anything in these gizmos   i was an air fryer skeptic until i watched a few  then decided to take the plunge and get one  and now i m sold    albeit  i wish i d gotten one that was easier to use they do make an app that allows you to control the air fryer from your phone   it s what i would call a work in progress  the name of the app is  vesync    you run the app and it detects the cosori as one of the appliances it can control   that s fine for them  i suppose  but from the user s perspective  it would be so much better to have an app called  cosori    i have so many apps and it s impossible to remember that vesync means cosori   come on  who decided this was a great idea anyway  more on the app   it sort of works well   i say  sort of   because it promises more than it delivers   there s a  cooking history  section  but no search function    you can tap on a history item and it will start the cosori for you  remotely  you can also alter the temp and cooking time   right now i can see last night s chicken  but it doesn t list this morning s pop tart from    minutes ago  why    maybe it takes a while to retrieve the data    i have no idea   just another annoyance   the app does send you notifications when the cooker is done  if you choose to use that feature i do like that you can add your own recipes to the app   the thing is  it s not rocket science to use this fryer  just set time and temperature and go   the saved recipe thing is mainly to help you not overcook or undercook  and that s a matter of trial and error as far as cleaning and maintenance  it s pretty simple   you pull out the basket and wash in warm soapy water   if you re doing dry stuff like toast or reheating a bowl of soup  there s little or no cleaning   if you re doing meat or wet veggies  you may need to do some cleaning   i use a soft scratch sponge  but a brush also works well  it helps to soak the whole basket in warm soapy water for    minutes  and my wife has run the inner basket through the dishwasher a couple of times  that makes me nervous that it could damage the teflon coating  but so far it seems okay the inner outer basket design has plusses and minuses  you can lift the inner basket out  but if you re doing it one handed  as one tends to do in kitchens  you need a surface under the outer basket or it will fall to the floor   not ideal  it would be nice if the outer basket could be retained in the machine somehow  maybe with a hook  so you don t have to position the air fryer     in from the edge of the counter liquid seems to accumulate sometimes in the space under the outer basket  maybe just condensation   it s probably not a bad idea to wipe that up from time to time  just to prevent rusting or messing up the heat cycle in my opinion  this appliance is still a work in progress  they have some issues to solve regarding the buttons and basket design   air fryers in general are still a new thing  but they ve become very popular for good reason  they work very well for what they do   with a few tweaks  this can be an excellent product worthy of   stars update june        after i wrote to cosori  they generously shipped me a new unit   i m happy to report that the buttons work much better   as a test  i wet my finger and it still works   i will say  the buttons still have a kind of delayed reaction    they don t really engage until you lift your finger  which is odd  but i have gotten used to it   most importantly  the buttons all respond immediately now  and i don t need to repeatedly press the time temp button to activate it   thanks to cosori for properly handling this issue and i ve boosted my rating accordingly      
92,4.0,                       the screws that fasten the inner basket and the handle are loose and lost  i am going to buy some in home depot but i don t know the specification of the screws      
93,5.0,                       so  i ve only cooked one thing in this so far  but it was steak and steak was what i bought this cooker for specifically  i cooked a decent sized ribeye and it was fantastic  well equal to anything i ve cooked in an oven  stove top  or grill  but honestly also equal to steaks from most restaurants  the steak was tender  moist  evenly cooked and all around delicious   winner  winner  steak dinner      
94,5.0,                       older gent       never cared for having a fryer in the house  never  deep fried  or  air fried   except for attempting to make mitford cookbook s  louella s fried chicken  in a skillet  if you know  you know     https   www amazon com karons mitford cookbook kitchen reader dp            ref sr     crid  hnf koiky cs dchild   keywords mitford cookbook and kitchen reader qid            s books sprefix mitford cook  cstripbooks  c    sr     and one equally smelly  messy but delicious attempt at making tempura   just because   when the kids were little  thank you  japanese cartoons of the late    s   gotta catch  em all   but  after both those attempts  our common question was   where do you put all that old oil  if you don t live in the upper midwest  where you can freeze it and throw it the next day or two  when the garbageman comes     fast forward    years  the wife would never have seen the benefit of this device had we  debated  about whether to buy it or not  except that a serious medical emergency  me  mandated some lifestyle changes on our parts  i m ok  six months down the road  gsd  after looking at all sorts and sizes of  air fryers  we  i  chose this model for  a  cost  b  size  c  looks  and d  functionality  couldn t be happier  we have used it alone   just the two of us  to make mustard chicken skewers  amazingly yum    fried  sweet potato fries  regular potato fries  and now that our kids  are home  from college covid  they have used it to make  spicy carrot chips  and  fried tofu   daughter  says  she s now a vegetarian  whatchagonnadoo    but i ll admit  those things did taste good  and no fuss  no mess  no oil  not once this summer we plan to use it at least two to three times a week  to help free up space in a kitchen with only one stove cooktop unit    and too many cooks  clean up takes all of a minute with soapy water  paper liners that absorb most of the oil  the unit itself heats up quickly  runs as it s supposed to do   and is relatively quiet  it s effective  and looks fantastic on our counter next to our single cup coffee maker  daughter is hogging that  every morning  too  lol  and the cookbook that came with it  will give us enough recipes for months to come  as we work on our  slow and gentle  learning curve  but i ll admit   i am kinda lusting after urvashi pitre s air fryer revolution cookbook    https   www amazon com air fryer revolution healthy recipes dp          x ref sr     crid  dxgn c ybko dchild   keywords urvashi pitre qid            s books sprefix urvashi  cstripbooks  c    sr      oh and wife s cholesterol has gone down  not all due to the cosori  but due  we know  to our lifestyle food choice changes  so  is it the greatest thing since the microwave   maybe   but that big little air fryer is now definitely a part of our cooking lives  who d a thunk      
95,5.0,                       i bought this air fryer after seeing the tons of review in amazon  i was very doubtful that it might be one of those marketing tricks tried chicken and spicy fried peanuts unbelievable results  both cooked to perfection  lb chicken took only  mins to cook with  tsp of oil at    deg  lb raw peanuts     tsp of oil  fried to crisp in    mins    deg  opened and stirred every  mins though i couldn t wait to try all the recipes listed in the cook book that came with the unit i wish manufacturer provided more fixtures like other brands super happy with this product these are the other factors i was worried about before buying   noise  i would say half of microwave  much quieter than my hood at   setting    plastic smell  as soon as i received the unit  washed it with soap water  ran empty cycle for    mins  smelled chemical for first   mins   after that there was no smell at all   smoke  there was no smoke at all while cooking chicken i was super impressed and surprised with the performance      
96,1.0,                       i like it that it is easy to use  first  i used it for fries  it says to preheat for better and faster cooking results  the thing that i did not like was the fact that every time i preheat or just started cooking  it will always smoke up inside my house  my purpose in buying this was for easy cooking and cleaning indoor  i took it outside and tried cooking bacon and chicken eith the pre set setting on the menu display and it cooked well  the tray is easy to clean but the air fryer itself inside wasn t easy to clean      
97,2.0,                       sooo i ve been using my cosori air fryer about two months now  one day i was using it to cook up a few turkey burgers for the kids and out of nowhere  and in the middle of cooking  the basket released itself from the fryer  slid out onto the countertop and since i have granite countertops  it kept sliding right off that surface and crashed to the floor  very random  i was thinking i d done something wrong  this device has to be perfect right  i mean it wasn t exactly cheap  i d done my homework and got one of the top rated  maybe i didn t lock it into place all the way  so from that point  i d made it my business to be sure to push it in all the way until i felt it lock  all was all good for about   weeks and then this afternoon  i was making lunch for me and hubby  i d put in two burgers and was preparing us a salad when   minutes into the cooking process  i heard the fan stop and i turned around quickly but i was too late  the basket popped out  slid onto the countertop and then crashed to the floor  but this time  hot splatter popped onto my foot and leg   ouch  i wasn t badly injured but i m baffled    literally baffled  this is obviously a flaw in the design that can be potentially dangerous  imagine if my kid was in there    realistically  i love this fryer  i love the design  i love ease of use and ease of cleaning and i love the way the food tastes when it comes out  but that right there  that s bad  one other issue   there are about   small screws inside that loosen on their own so i find myself tightening them at least twice a week  and lastly  don t ever and i mean ever hit the button that releases the basket from the tray unless you are holding it over a countertop or something  i made that mistake and the entire tray dropped out and fell on my foot  it wasn t hot but it hurt like hell   update  i contacted cosori directly after my blackened mahi ended up all over my kitchen floor  they need to be aware of this problem  at first i was quite offended that one of the reps told me   we will look into this issue immediately  meanwhile  take a moment to read your cosori air fryer manual   what       so you mean to tell me there is a portion of the manual that mentions this malfunction    because i already read the manual and it was never mentioned  anywho    they handled the situation for me and offered to replace my current air fryer and asked me to ship them the old one so that they could investigate this  so i m feeling that this may not be a common problem as i ve only found a few videos of people complaining about this same malfunction  which apparently becomes progressively worse   so as of today  a new fryer has been sent and is on the way  hoping i don t have these problems again      
98,3.0,                       my wife and i love this     qt air fryer  i was never much of a cook until we bought this fryer  now i cook wings  sausages  and lots of other things in it  in fact  i cooked so much that i have now worn out the basket handle after four months of use  two out of three screws that hold it together came out  and the handle just flops around  i managed to find one of the screws in the sink drain just after it fell out and before the disposal ruined it  however  the second one is nowhere to be found  fortunately  the handle will kinda work with just two screws holding it together  but the whole thing feels less secure than it did with three screws  i have ordered a couple of spare baskets so i can keep using the fryer  but i am not happy with paying     a pop for a manufacturing issue  the screws should have been mounted so they would not back out under normal use and washing      
99,5.0,                       i bought this unit  in august      and have cooked with it   to   times a week since  the food turns out delicious every single time  i have no complaints about its ability to air fry food  this is my  th air fryer but  st cosori      
100,3.0,                       these are pretty good overall  but about to replace   of them   it works    of the time  but  the display shorts out  frequently and loses its place the screws work themselves out after a few months on the basket      
101,1.0,                       this was my first experience with air frying  and it was awful  i cooked chicken twice  and although it cooked adequately the meat smelled and tasted of melted plastic  in fact  the smell from the unit  plastic smell  permeated throughout my house  i returned the product  and this unit has deterred me from trying another  not recommended      
102,1.0,                       the food that comes from this air fryer is incredible  i am in love with air frying as a healthy option for quick and crispy food  but  do not buy the touch screen model    i have never wanted to throw something out the window so bad as this thing  it works absolutely perfectly     of the time  the rest it will not turn on or off  i have to unplug to turn it off almost every single time  i want to return it and buy one with a knob  so frustrating  edited to add  cosori customer service is top notch  they are replacing my air fryer with a dial version  the one i wanted  and are refunding me the difference between the two models  they told me to keep the old one to use as spare parts if needed  in my opinion this is above and beyond      
103,3.0,                       i am blown away with the food results  i love it s ease of use  it looks great  holds a decent amount of food  very fast      of it i love however  i bought this as a christmas gift  it s early february at the time of writing this  while handwashing the basket a week ago  i started scrubbing  with a cloth rag  what i thought was baked on food  upon closer inspection  i realized that the nonstick coating was gelling up and easily peeling off with the lightest pressure  i m pretty pissed  i m actually nervous about frying food in it now due to the known risks of ptfe  perhaps the stainless version would ve been a better choice      
104,5.0,                       i had a connectivity  wifi  issue after i moved to my new apartment as i could not connect the air fryer to the same wifi  i contacted their support to try helping me figure it out tia  from the support team  kept in touch for around three weeks trying to help me with this  putting a lot of effort and dedication to solve my problem  they tried everything until they decided to send me a brand new air fryer to make sure it was a hardware problem when the new air fryer arrived  tia notified me that their team kept investigating and they wanted me to try a different thing  which then worked  so  the problem was with my new internet service provider connection  not with the air fryer itself i cannot express how impressed i was with tia s and the support team s dedication to solve a customer problem  they also sent me a prize for being patient as a customer for that long they ve got all my patience because i could see how passionate they were to have their customer s problems solved  also  as i worked on a remote support team in the past  i know how difficult it is to troubleshoot and solve problems remotely  with no access to the customer s environment congratulations on the great product and great  amazing post sale support  you folks are amazing  thank you      
105,2.0,                       i really wanted to love this airfryer  it has a large capacity  heats up well and fast  and easy to clean  it was slightly louder than the one my friend has  but that one has a smaller capacity than what i wanted for my larger family so i decided to overlook that problem  the reason i ended up returning the product is because the yucky plasticky smell just never went away  the first two times  our entire kitchen smelled like burned plastic  so disappointed         
106,4.0,                       i hate hate hate hate the look of this frier  i bought the white one which i paid extra and thought would be a shinny sleak look  it looks like some cheapest matted  d printed parts put together except the digital window looks very nice   i have to be fair   it s too bulky i didn t want to return it  so i m using it and it s working ok so far  made some fast and nice fries  unlike other comments said  it could toast bread  get your fact right people    i bet it could be a dehydrator too if you set the temp low enough  man i m so angry giving review for this air frier i don t know why  i guess it takes me some time to make peace with the ugly look  i will come back and give one star if it breaks on me         
107,2.0,                       sorry  i m not on the   star review bandwagon here   it cooks well  but it s literally a burner coil with a fan that circulates air   you re not going to find one hot fan that adds more flavor than another   i wish i had done more research and bought something else instead first off  it s loud   we have a smaller house with an open concept kitchen dining living area   when this is going it s totally disruptive to watching tv  kids doing homework  listening to music  etc   wifi   why did i pay extra for this   i never use it   i can t think of a practical reason for it   i get random notifications when i m at work that my wife is cooking stuff in the air fryer the buttons are hard to use   they don t always register that i touch them more often than not   the presets are useless   they give you a general idea of temp and cook time  but you cannot blindly trust them it s huge   despite it s huge size you ll find yourself limited in cooking space   for   adults i have to cook fries or tots in   batches construction seems cheap   the screws that hold the handle on are inside the basket   one of them fell into the cooking basket and ended up in my mouth  the other two were extremely loose if you re looking for one  look for something a little more basic   a simple time temp knob is all that s needed   look for something a little more quiet if you re cooking near your living area   save your money on fancy feature  you won t find yourself using them      
108,3.0,                       this product has excellent reviews and i would love to believe that my order is not defective  i saved money and waited for long until they discounted this air fryer but was slightly disappointed  i m having the same issue as one of the reviews mentioned that it has a burning plastic smell while operating  it s still my first try and will keep trying it for a few times and see how it goes      
109,5.0,                       as a working parent  i don t have an hour to spend in the kitchen preparing dinner  nor do i particularly enjoy cooking  yet i want to provide a good nutritious meal for my child  i bought an instant pot thinking it ll reduce my dinner prep times  but most of the recipes have a long list of ingredients that i don t have time for     so when i received this air fryer and the recipe book with super easy instructions and fewer than    ingredients needed  i was overjoyed  so far i have tried frozen chicken nuggets  frozen sweet potato fries  grilled cheese sandwich and teriyaki salmon  my daughter loves every dish made in it  i couldn t be happier      
110,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i have used this air fryer a lot over the past half a year  at first  i wondered if air fryers were worth the hype  and i can attest to the fact that they are  i loved this thing for the first couple months  recommended it to friends who went and bought it too  now  as much as i want to be loyal and keep the brand  find myself worried about longevity i don t know if i would consider this air fryer to be expensive  because with as much as we use it  it is worth every penny and is about the price of a mid range microwave  but it was a purchase i didn t have a lot of excess money for and i was bummed it hasn t lasted six months  it doesn t appear cheaply made so i wonder if i have a lemon or something so let me jump into the issues i have after many  many uses  the worst is that the air fryer drawer pops open sometimes while cooking    almost shoots out a foot or more  clear out of the fryer itself  it had issues remaining shut previously  with steam coming out the bottom sides  i remedied that by firmly pushing it back in again and it typically  sealed  up  now it just pops completely out of the unit onto the counter up until that point  the only thing i disliked is the touch screen interface it uses for programming time  temperature etc  it is finicky and doesn t always register a finger press    sometimes pressing more than a few times to get it to register  sometimes it will not register prints at all so  i m unsure if i got the lemon of the bunch  and i really want to love this air fryer  i still use it    just with caution and while i am around      
111,5.0,                       i don t typically write reviews but i love this thing  so first the disclaimer    this review is for the parents because well that s me what i love the wifi connection with the app  when i saw this feature my first thought was who would need this much gadgetry come on  but then there s the fact you can preheat it before u get home so it s ready or i can start it and walk away and get alerts that hey i have something cooking  you don t think it s a big thing but once you use it your like man i wish every appliance reminded me i was doing something the basket some reviews complained about the plastic piece and feeling flimsy or that the basket came apart too easy  that clear plastic piece covers a button  you have to slide that piece all the way up which can only be done when you have the basket out  then you have to push the button all the way down and that releases the basket which you still have to pull out  again that s my experience    i know things happen but that s how i worked for me  plus the thing is huge  i easily feed my family of   or   when friends are over the food there is a learning curve with already prepared food like chicken nuggets or french fries from a bag  yes i cook that stuff because i have kids and am comparable to their favorite restaurants now with this thing  i have learned to cut the cooking time in half and that s pretty accurate  the app has a ton of recipes too that are super easy for parents and not too gourmet  i do cook things that aren t in a bag and they come out amazing i read reviews for this item and about    other ones  this one looked good on paper but then some of the reviews gave me concerns so i waited a month to purchase it  i m sure there are flukes and things go wrong but for my experience it was as good as it is on paper  from a single mom point of view who has very little free time    this thing rocks      
112,2.0,                       i researched air fryers for some time before i chose the     cosori   it arrived and although it looked great and was packaged well  i will return it   the problem is the drawer  it is very difficult to slide in and out and just feels very clumsy   i will be ordering a different one   since i haven t seen mention of this on reviews  i am assuming it could be defective      
113,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this product arrived on april           today is may           it s only been merely two and a half weeks  ok    days total  and the touch screen on my air fryer is already not sensitive to touch  refer to video  it takes several times to even try to press a button  but sometimes it works right away  it is extremely frustrating to use  especially when trying to adjust the temperature or the time because it stops letting you adjust it after being idle for a while  i cannot believe such product like this cost so much money but it couldn t even last a month  i am definitely returning this product  it s really sad because i was in love with it for the short    days that it shown me potential      
114,5.0,                       this is my first air fryer so i am totally amazed with the technology   instant  perfect results   i was contemplating a new toaster oven when i got this  but one week later i unplugged the toaster oven to be replaced with my cosori air fryer  it makes breakfast bagel sandwiches to rival panera     toast the bagel  fry the egg  and grill up sausage in the cosori     and cleanup is wiping out two baskets   hash browns  fries and onion rings brown to perfection     way crispier than deep fry   corned beef hash cooks up great   turkey burgers from frozen to grilled in    minutes  and the bread toasts up in the same pan   fried chicken is wonderful with panko bread crumbs   hot dogs are perfectly grilled and buns are toasted to perfection   i chose the cosori based on customer reviews on amazon but i checked out other brands in stores and none meet cosori quality   if you are new to air frying like me  an instant read thermometer is a must and something to lift dishes and pans out of the basket is good   i use a lifter that came with a insta pot accessory set   i found most of my cookware works fine    that is  if it fits in the basket   this air fryer has improved the way i toast  grill  bake and fry   it s a popular cooking trend  you can google any recioe you want online       how do you make a baked apple in an air fryer       
115,1.0,                       the preset buttons didn t work well upon purchase and now only a few buttons are functional  i wish i d done more research and bought one with a knob  it s very frustrating cooking something when the temperature button fails to work properly      
116,4.0,                       i was excited to use this for the first time   i turned on and then it turned off its own and that was it  never came back up  a bit disappointed for the inconvenience i have to go through in returning it  i went on and ordered a replacement  i guess things happen  just a bit of disappointing if it is new  the face seemed it had hairlines swirls  not sure if it was a return  all looked new  will update once i get a working unit         update        ok  i received my replacement order monday  thank you amazon  this is a night and day product compared to what i received before  first  the difference in delivered product  first  the external box was an  amazon  badged box and smaller over all   nd  the box inside was a  cosori  labeled box compared to what i had before  leit or something like that   third  the box inside the cosori box was the actual box of the product  with all the pics of it   lastly the big difference was the fact that the basket had tape holding the basket as many  new  products are done  all looked great  plus no swirls on the face  a new product indeed  i have a feeling the first was a return  not cool now for the product review   yesterday  i went crazy and cooked battered frozen strips for kids and they were crispy using the frozen option  wow   also  cooked fresh cut fries came out awesome  i think i cut them to thin  but the bigger ones were crispy and no oil  except for olive oil per instructions   lastly last night  a ny and it was perfectly cooked  a nice med rare  it was great  today  was another test  my daughter and i  mostly her cooked the jalape o popper from recipe book  they were great  only think i would of added to recipe was cream cheese  but followed directions for first time  lastly  i cooked two giant chicken breast  i cooked then at     per online instructions  but i think the chicken preset would of done it just fine  flipped them twice  perfectly cooked at about       min at      the president et is for     for    wish i took pics  but let me tell you  this air fryer is awesome  don t doubt yourself in purchasing  you will be happy with results  i research and went with this brand  plus you sign up for warranty they give you an extra year for free  cant beat that deal  you have nothing to lose  except the oil much to gain with good cooking go for it   the one star less was from the beginning ordeal  enjoy      
117,1.0,                       this thing is seriously just a convection oven but has a smaller cooking area  buy the nuwave or any other generic convection oven  they cook the same  have a much larger cooking area  and are far more affordable  if you have a family of   like i do you would have to have   of these air fryers to cook a full dinner  buy a convection oven  load a whole chicken and veggies in it  hit the button and wait for an amazingly easy  and delicious  dinner is done in very little time      
118,2.0,                       i have loved using this air fryer  until the basket has broken twice now  the handle is constantly coming loose and having to be tightened back down  and after one year the plastic that attaches the handle to the basket breaks and the entire basket itself requires replacing  i have replaced it twice and the second time the handle broke off and caused the entire basket to fall onto the ground  causing the damage seen in the third photo  unless you want to be replacing parts once a year  i cannot recommend this air fryer to anyone     
119,1.0,                         update  stopped working after four uses   update  i ve owned other desktop   countertop ovens  given the reviews i was expecting this to at least measure up to my previous experience first  it smelled awful the first few times i used it even after washing it and priming it with a few pre heat cycles using the preset chicken option my chicken was burned  dry and tasteless  cooking meat in it  even with marinating overnight  was a forgettable meal i think you d be happier with a convection oven plus a rice cooker  if i had to do it over again i would go that route and save a few     and have a known better experience      
120,4.0,                       while it worked  it was one of the few new small appliance gadgets that we used all the time  great for warming up pizza  cooking vegetables  and especially making chicken wings the only problem is that it just stopped working in the middle of making dinner last week  so  it doesn t matter how great it was when it worked  it s broken now and junk  and it s not like it s an inexpensive appliance  if i wanted a disposable piece of garbage  i d have bought an air fryer for       not      update            the customer service department read my review  reached out  and provided a amazon gift card in recompense to cover the full price of the air fryer  updated to   stars   even though it stopped working  and that was annoying in and of itself   the company stepped up with solid customer service      
121,1.0,                       stopped working on me after the  th use  won t power on and return window was up   week ago  thanks amazon      
122,3.0,                       i ve had this since january and i ve loved using it however now the drawer won t close on it and i m not sure what the problem is  and i m down to months past the return date      
123,5.0,                       i just finished making the most amazing batch of buffalo style wings in our new cosori air fryer   honestly  about the best i ve ever had   it is easy to use  easy to clean  and has earned a permanent spot on our kitchen counter   it re heats food like it was made fresh  think pizza etc    doesn t require an oven preheat  no oil now  the customer support part   we ordered this online and used it first for some fried chicken   it was delicious  but it behaved a little strangely   would suddenly cut out for a few seconds  and then come back on   i thought that s weird  but maybe that s what it s supposed to do   anyway  it got worse and eventually stopped working after the  th or  th use   by this time it was too late to return to amazon so i contacted customer support via their website chat within about    minutes we had a new one on the way  no charge  no return required  and   days later we received the properly functioning we have now   i wanted to wait until we got the new one to check out before i reviewed that s how customer service is supposed to work when things go wrong   you back up your product when something s not right   so kudos to cosori for a really great kitchen appliance  and triple kudos for their customer support i would not hesitate to buy another anything from cosori      
124,4.0,                       definitely don t buy a smart air fryer if you don t need it  this is an unnecessary purchase but if you re willing to splurge    bucks for something that ll help you cook in the kitchen this is ideal i m not the best chef in the world  in fact  i think the worst part of cooking is how long it takes and having to sit in a hot kitchen for hours  this air fryer is so quick and easy and it notifies your phone so you don t have to sit in the kitchen or wait on it not to burn  you can go about your day and it will let you know when your food is ready  and you ll really have to play around with the settings  the presets are really good guideline but you ll have to take it upon yourself to really cook certain dishes properly now the main setback i have is actually cleaning it  i don t have a dishwasher so i have to hand wash it myself and if i cook with oil or anything that stains even when i use parchment paper and foil all of that gunk sticks to the slits in the side of the basket  i would let it soak in ajax and dish soap and come back scrub it out and it would still be dried grease stuck in between the cracks  this thing is almost impossible to clean entirely after the first use without a dishwasher another con would be cooking fries in this is not ideal  frankly like all air fryers all fries come out super dry and dehydrated  since many air fryers do this i m not faulting this brand specifically  however i couldn t help but mention it      
125,1.0,                       this unit continuously overheats and turns off after barely a few minutes in  takes      minutes to restart      
126,2.0,                       so  ive had two of these both had touch display issues  the  st the touch screen didnt respond unless you like wipe your hand across the display then random buttons would activate  however when u touch those buttons  lite  firm   hulk smashing  didnt respond  power button wouldnt respond at all  however it worked via app n with alexa   nd one responded to touch for most of the display  power worked but the manual temp n time touch buttons would work intermittently  sometimes lite pressure worked  one time holding your finger for like   sec activated it but not the follow up attempts  hulk smash finger press worked but none of those worked consistently   returned both went with ninja  this was top rated n bunch of good reviews n cheaper then the ninja  after some googling found this is a known and common issue  so much so that i called the manufacture n after describing what was happened just offered to replace it  no try this or that just okay we will send u a new one but it would take upto   business days  returned thru amazon quick and easy  the features it has if touch display works would b a awesome machine  however if your touch display does work then setup to the app  once downloaded  was easy  setup with alexa  once skill for fryer app enabled via alexa app  was easy n part of setup process  it responded to the app n alexa no issues  i loved the features plus having the wireless abilities thats why i opted for a  nd to see if just a bum machine which happens but   for   pretty much same issue moved on  gave   stars just due to fact it semi worked but not everyone has alexa or wants to use an app  mom hates using both   so id say buy it see if you get a working machine if not move on      
127,5.0,                       purchased on march           cosori air fryer     qt  electric hot air fryer from amazon com services  inc with a certified    year warranty   quit working on may            need i say more  worked for two months and would noteven come  on    started turning  off  and would come back  on  two weeks prior to its total failure  i contacted the manufacture on the cosori and provided them with the information on purchased and a new cosori arrived in a few days   great response on replacing failed air fryer  and great customer service      
128,1.0,                       severe safety hazard  during cooking the unit shot the     degree basket out onto my kitchen floor   it narrowly missed me and not the basket will not stay in the unit at all   it just keeps shooting the basket out      
129,4.0,                       i ve had this air fryer for about a week  and so far it hasn t disappointed  i like the square basket i think it fits food better  i was able to easily fit   chicken tenders with room for at least     more  cleaning the basket  and the base that the basket rests in  has been very easy  but i do use a soft bristle kitchen brush on a long handle to get into all the openings in the basket  the air fryer is big and does take up counter space  but it s not heavy to move around  i keep it on my rolling kitchen cart and move it to my counter to use it  i do rest it on a large  wooden cutting board when using just in case the bottom gets warm  the instructions are easy to understand  and using the control panel is fairly intuitive  i haven t used the pre settings  i prefer to set my own temperature and time  the vent in the back releases hot air when in use  i was able to put my hand about two inches from the vent without difficulty  still  i give about    of space on all sides just to be safe  i didn t find it too loud  i mean  it circulates hot air with a fan so there s going to be some noise  but it didn t annoy me so far i ve made french fries with russet potatoes  a chocolate cake  see photo  and chicken tenders  homemade  not frozen  see photo   all three items turned out delicious  the cake was divine especially the second day  i have no idea why   the chicken tenders were crunchy on the outside and not the least bit dry on the inside  the fries would have been over cooked had i left them in for the full amount of time the recipe called for  they were crisp on the outside  the cake recipe stated    minutes at     degrees  my attempt took    minutes at     degrees  i wasn t surprised by this  i thought    minutes seemed too short  my advice is  check your food often at first to get a feel for the fryer  this is really no different than getting used to a new oven or other cooking appliance  you need to play around with times and temperatures a bit  also  get a good air fryer cookbook or some highly rated recipes online pros  easy to use  intuitive easy clean up keeps kitchen cool in summer don t have to heat up your oven for a small amount of food   to   minutes to preheat or no preheating for some recipes large basket  and square shape seems to fit food very well basket has a safety feature so you won t accidentally release it from the base it sits in much healthier than deep fried foods  but you can still get that crispy crunchinesscons  it s large  you will lose counter space unless you can store it somewhere and take it out when needed  if you are cooking for a large group  you re going to be cooking in batches  the basket size works fine for our family of three with two light eaters  but even one more person at the table would have me cooking in batches  if your looking for something to give you the same  exact taste as genuine fried food  this isn t for you  it s not an actual fryer  the name is deceiving  it s really a countertop convection oven  the recipes use minimal oil    tbsp for the fries i made and several sprays of olive oil on the chicken tenders with an olive oil spritzer  i would recommend this model so far without hesitation  but it s only been one week and three recipes  if anything changes  i ll update my review  i hope this helps you make a decision      
130,1.0,                       good capacityeasy to useafter first use the plastic front of the unit separated warped from the basket   interestingly after unit heats up the plastic moves back in placeflaking of whatever material is used to make up the non stick coatinginner basket warped after a few uses   does not interfere with cooking thoughhandle has fallen apart   have to click back in place on two sides before each usebasket has actually ejected on its own while cooking despite being latched   the unit does not operate unless it is latched so it is not operator error   one ejection actually threw the food onto the floorwill be replacing this air fryer with another brand   really like the results of air frying and don t want to do without     
131,3.0,                       we bought the cosori airfryer seven months ago as a replacement for a cheap but sturdy one we used for   years  heavy users   and now we re getting a new one because it makes us nervous  despite that  i m still giving this fryer three stars  because it executes its core function really well despite its quirks the good great fantastic air frying capabilities   the crispy outside to juicy inside ratio is always perfect or near to it and cooks pretty evenly even when we re too lazy to flip items  makes beautiful fries great cooking area   the shape makes for a good surface to put lots of itemsvery easy to clean   cleans well in the dishwasher as well as by hand  easy to wipe up mess pleasing design   i like it s square  shiny red finisheasy to operatethe bad why we re replacing it   months in it blows out of fuses  this has happened several times  and the main reason we re getting rid of it   it s blown out fuses on its own and when other appliances are on the same circuit  our wiring is pretty sturdy  so it s disturbing it s falling apart  from the beginning the basket and the basket tray sorta rattled a bit  and what they ve been doing over time is undoing the screws  we tightened it but one went missing  maybe in the dishwasher   and there s two holding on for dear life  we re constantly having to tighten it  it seems to simply be a side effect of how its built the tray sometimes rattles itself out of place and stops cooking   the tray sometimes rattles itself out and will stop the cooking process  probably a bit of operator error  howeveri would have definitely given this machine   stars when i first got it  but it unfortunately hasn t held up very well      
132,4.0,                       so  i ve had this for almost four months  overall i m very pleased with the air fryer  i use it almost daily  i ve made chicken  corn  eggplant  fries  of course   spaghetti squash  meat balls and more and everything comes out amazing  juicy on the inside  crispy on the outside  there are however a few design flaws that need to be addressed by the company  one is major  the screws in both baskets become loose after almost every use and i constantly have to tighten them  i discovered this when i found one of the screws in my food  the other issue  is that the material of the inner basket  with the holes   is different than the material of the drip basket  the drip basket is a non stick material that is very easy to clean  the basket with the holes  roasting basket thing  does not appear to be  the first few times of use  it was easy to clean and with each subsequent  use  it becomes more and more difficult  i use a variety of cooking sprays when using the fryer and eventually the basket ends up with a sticky  oily residue that is impossible to remove unless you use an abrasive scouring tool  which would obviously ruin the basket  so i haven t done that and try to ignore the fact that i m cooking in a pan that is less than clean  just fyi  i clean both baskets after each use  i hope you find this helpful      
133,3.0,                       when i opened this air fryer  the non stick coating was already coming off  the latch for the basket felt cheap and was tricky to open and close  i was disappointed and did not get to use it before it was sent back due to poor quality  i liked the smaller dimensions of this fryer but the one they sent me was a dud      
134,1.0,                       product turned off withing   minutes of cooking  occasially screen will flash and beep then turned off again  power button does not even display like when first plugged in  will be returning this unit      
135,5.0,                       i never write reviews  but in this case i will  this cosori air fryer is a super nice fryer   it s easy to use and the clean up is so easy   i use it almost every day  i work long hours  this makes my time cooking so much quicker  great product      
136,4.0,                       this is a pretty good air fryer  i knocked a star off because i think its a bit expensive for a brand i ve never heard of  otherwise  i ve cooked pork  fish  brussel sprouts  fries  all sorts of things in it and it works well  size wise  i can easily fit two mackerels in it   three very crowded  food turns out well  i was afraid it would be another kitchen gadget i would buy  use a few times  and end up cluttering the countertop  but i have used it at least once a week  for the past few months  cooking fish  especially mackerel  can be stinky  but i just put this gadget right over the stovetop  turn on the stovetop ventilation  and it is the easiest  cleanest  least stinky way of cooking fish      
137,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          my unit didn t work   took a few pieces of freshly julienned fries spaced evenly      for    minutes then     for    minutes  setting button for fries gives     for    minutes   pics and video upload i posted my first review   days after ordering  when amazon said they needed to get back to me about getting a replacement unit  https   www amazon com gp customer reviews ruz frycliaox ref pf ov at pdctrvw srp  i posted my second review a few months later  after the item  linked to my purchase  disappeared from the site  and amazon said they would get back to me  https   www amazon com gp customer reviews r vja em bp k  ref pf ov at pdctrvw srp    i contacted amazon just now  and they said they will get back to me   crossing my fingers          
138,2.0,                       a reasonable air fryer  it is very easy to use and produces reasonable air fried food  it can be somewhat tough to clean  but i imagine this is a problem with just about any air fryer  the non stick coating is wearing off in a few places because of how the machine is designed and the basket is supported  but this isn t a deal breaker i wish i could disable the beeps  but i understand this isn t a ubiquitous feature yet  so it s ok the biggest problem is the durability  i used this machine moderately for   year    maybe once per week  i was always gentle with it  never abused it  really fair use  but after just over   year of use the handle cracked off  rendering the fryer useless       yr is a lot to pay for an air fryer  i urge you to find another option      
139,1.0,                       i have had this long enough to use it almost ten times  always for frozen food  despite running it empty a few times and these actual instances of cooking with it  there remains a very unpleasant plastic smell that really makes it unusable  the smell gets into the food and stinks up the house to the point where i feel the need to open windows and air out the house  i really wanted to like this air fryer but unless i can bake this smell off somehow i will not be able to use it anymore      
140,1.0,                       update   i initially rated this   starts   i am sorry that i need to update the review   the air fryer is not consistently recognizing when the basket is inserted   while doing a    minute cook  it turned off after   minutes thinking the basket was not present   i have had problems with this before but this time jiggling the basket would not resolve the problem   i had to resort to using  a kitchen knife to get the fryer to recognize that the basket was installed  see photo  i have also had issues with the touch panel not recognizing when a button is pushed but that wasn t a problem as i could use my iphone and the wifi connection to set the temp  time  etc original review i highly recommend the wifi version of the cosori     quart air fryer   we have had ours for the less than a month and use it almost daily while we try out new recipes the iphone app connects with the cosori smart wifi air fryer   you can select a recipe illustrated in the app or you can manually set the time and temperature and start cooking   the app updates you on the progress of the cooking    how many minutes are left  when to shake  when cooking is done if the air fryer did not have the wifi feature  i would have returned the air fryer because the buttons for manually changing cooking time and temperature on the fryer are difficult to use   the time and temperature buttons on  don t always register when you push them   this is not a problem if you have a smart phone and purchase the wifi enabled air fryer i have recommended this air fryer to several family members      
141,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i was excited when i found out that you can operate this from an app  the app itself is great  the problem was that the buttons on the fryer was not responsive  the power button did not work no matter how hard i pressed  so i returned it and got another one  the buttons on the second one worked but not all the time and you really had to press them hard  but i was ok with that because i still had the app to operate it  the thing that alarmed me was after soaking the inner basket and the outer basket in the sink  it was rusted underneath the edges  look at the attached video  so i didn t even get a chance to cook with it  i m going to return it  that will be   that i have returned  i will have to try another brand      
142,5.0,                       i decided to start with the fried chicken  my thought was  if it can t do well with this  i don t want it  wow  it exceeded my expectations   amazingly  it looked like it might be a little dry because the outside didn t have the usual fried sheen  not only was the skin crispy and tasty  inside was some of the juiciest fried chicken i ve had in recent years  the air fryer was a little intimidating  especially when removing it during the cooking process to flip it over  it was super easy to clean which also surprised me  i m really glad i bought it  since then  i ve tried the fries and they were wonderful as well      
143,4.0,                       works great once you figure out how long you want to cook your food for the way you like it  i mean the first steak i cooked in there i murdered it but then the next time i figured out what temperature to pull it out the way i like it and then it was actually pretty good for cooking basically in a tiny electric oven with a fan  great for potatoes and my wife is asian and she loves fish and cooks all kinds different fishnet and it s really good some nice moist salmon  i find stuff to cooking it at this point just because it s fun to use and it s easy but the timing and walk away  i m seriously contemplating on getting another one if i just have the room for it  good chicken wings too  if you get my point now i really like it you can go on rambling just like i already have but in the end it s worth buying      
144,5.0,                       i m super happy with the easy operation and performance from the corsori air fryer i think the    l capacity is ideal and would encourage anyone shopping for one to stay away from the smaller capacity air fryers   i think you get more bang for your buck with the larger capacity overall  i m quite happy with it and have been cooking with it     times per week   thus replacing my oven it s a lot faster to cook with also word of advice for simu frying with this air fryer purchase an oil spritzer   mister and liberally spray down your food before cooking in the air fryer   increase your cook time by an additional   minute using the cooker s presets i think you would be very happy using an air fryer   definitely worth one s attention      
145,2.0,                       this is my second unit so these issues aren t with my air fryer only   i sent my first one back thinking i must have had a defective unit first   the screws in the basket will fall out frequently   they will fall into your food   you will need to check and tighten them frequently or you risk choking on the screws   i m not sure how they can even continue to sell this like with this problem   the screws on the outer portion  the basket holder  will come out too but not as frequently second the timer resets everytime you  shake    those who have air fryers know you are to pull out the tray and shake it around while cooking to maximize air flow and crispiness   air fryers will continue right where you left off when you put the basket back in that s one of air fryers biggest conveniences   the problem with this one is it resets back to a full minute each time you do that   for example  say you are cooking something for    minutes and you  shake    times   if you pull the basket out and there s       left when you put it back in it starts back at       seconds   after   times you might be adding around     minutes extra cooking time third the least of the problems but still a problem   the buttons are really weird on the front and you have to almost press through the panel to get them to work   it was worse on my first one other than the big problems the air fryer is awesome   i love the shape of the basket and the way the basket is designed to maximize air flow      
146,3.0,                       my halogen convection air fryer finally died and after a little research i decided to purchase the cosori     wifi air fryer set up was a breeze and the af worked really well  clean up is fast and easy  i used the wifi connection via my phone and the vesync app to control the af  but when i tried to use the actual touch pad on the af to control the cooking the time temp button did not function properly  sometimes it would work and more often than not it didn t work at all  that meant i could not adjust the cooking time or cooking temperature manually  amazon did a quick exchange and sent me a new af promptly  cudos and thanks to amazon  no down time  when i received the new unit first thing i did was check the touch pad for function and it worked fine  fast forward to the  nd time i used the af and the time temp button was malfunctioning again  the problem is not as bad as before but there is still a problem  sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn t  there is a cosori air fryer group on fb and more than a few people have indicated that they have had the same problem with the touch pad on their wifi models  i did not see any posts indicating problems with the non wifi models  so  not sure what do now  on my  nd af and undecided whether to keep it and use the vesync app or exchange it for the non wifi model  my hope is that cosori will find and correct the issue with a firmware update  if you are thinking about getting a cosori af i would definitely recommend the non wifi model  also  i recommend the     size and you may want to shop for some accessories like wire racks to place inside the af basket for multi level cooking  all things considered i think it is still a good af  if you want help  inspiration or cooking ideas check out the cosori air fryer group on fb update  received  nd cosori smart air fryer and temp time button still does not function properly  have to use wifi app to control cooking      
147,1.0,                       the machine looks good and looks easy to clean however  the the machine makes very strong burning plastic smell in the first several runs we experienced  the smell makes the entire family headache and did not go away after tried   times   the temp we run is not high   we run    f and    f but all times the smell is very strong and penetrates the food certain reviews said that the smell will  go away  after several use but it should not be there at the very beginning because this is something processing things we put in our mouth at where we live not recommend      
148,5.0,                       i ve been wanting an air fryer for awhile  mostly to make crispy pork belly in half the time without heating my entire kitchen up from the oven  my brother got the cosori a few months before me  so i figured i d get the same so that we could try things out and make sure our temps were consistent since air fryers vary  i love this air fryer  the buttons are easy to use  i like the pre sets  i like the shake reminders  i like the overall size as well as the size of the basket  i ve made cornish hens  a whole chicken  spareribs  french fries  kabobs and yes    i ve made the crispy pork belly  customer service is great and they ve got a group on facebook with more recipes and lots of sharing from other cosori owners      
149,5.0,                       we purchased the cosori air fryer  the one with the app  though we don t use the app very often so far  for christmas  mostly because we had amazon gift cards that we haven t used in several years  we have had no problems with the air fryer so far  the touchscreen is pretty easy to figure out  the user guide helps as well  of course  and responds from especially light touches  cleaning is surprisingly easy  we wait until it s cool  roughly    minutes  then put in the sink  fill with hot water and a squirt of dawn  wait until we ve finished eating  then wipe with a soft rag or sponge and rinse  done now  about recipes  you can find a stunning amount of recipes on the web  even recipes specific to the cosori  however  our experience is that we have to test recipes until we get results we like  this is where we think air fryers really shine  you can always adjust the temperature and or cook for a couple of minutes longer  so we check it every   minutes or so  for example  we tried english muffin pizzas and had to cook them twice as long as the recipe called for  same for parmesan red potatoes  chicken tenders took   minutes less than the recipe called for  so it s best to assume you will have to tinker with time temperature rather than count on the recipe being perfect first time every time we found fabulessly frugal  on youtube  to be a pretty reliable source for air fryer info  especially since the host has a cosori    oz and she is very good about giving clear instructions     and because we like her sense of humor  worth a quick search      
150,1.0,                       update    july        i still have not received my refund as promised by cosori   at this point i would give zero stars if that were possible thank you to the customer support team at cosori for their help in diagnosing my touchpad issues   apparently i got a defective one  and they are issuing a refund so i can purchase another    i am beyond amazon s    day return window  this air fryer has a nice  large basket  so i rarely need to cook things in batches  i love the presets and wifi connection  which makes cooking easier   i can monitor the cooking process on my smartphone   however  i find that the  buttons  do not always respond to touch  especially when i want to increase or decrease the time temp   the touch pad just doesn t work   don t know if i am doing something wrong or if the devices is not working properly      
151,5.0,                       i consider myself to be a tough cookie when it comes to reviewing products but also i m fair  i ve had a couple of different machines similar to this one and i wasn t happy with them  if you re thinking of buying one of these  i highly suggest it  you won t be disappointed  i absolutely love this machine   if i could give it      i definitely would  i m a happy customer         
152,5.0,                       we had heard great things and read some good reviews and i decided to try an air fryer  after looking around it seemed that cosori has a decent reputation for support and that their non stick has a good rep for not de laminating  enter a good sale and i purchased one i think we have had it a little over a month and it has been used anywhere from once to four times  a day  we cook a range of stuff from garlic bread to fried chicken   vegetables  fish sticks  hot dogs  fish  beef  french fries etc  in it i gave up eating fried chicken a few years ago  my digestive tract isn t as friendly to greasy foods as it once was  i grew up in the south and fried chicken was a staple at my grandmothers house and my mom made it a lot also  when i left home i made it though not as often as i get irritated cleaning the spattered grease up  finally with the digestive change it left my menu but i really missed it  now it is back on the menu  i cook chicken a couple times a week now at least and it is great for better than my mom s or grandmothers breaded fried chicken i take oil of choice and rub a light layer onto a couple large chicken breasts  sprinkle with salt and pepper  or other seasoning of choice  and then sift a heavy layer of flour and pat it in   i can no longer eat wheat so use rice or oat flour and it is absolutely wonderful   place the chicken in the air fryer and just use the stock setting for chicken  it is crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside  if you cut the chicken up into smaller portions you probably want to reduce the cooking time from    min to maybe    to      you ll have to get a feel for it french fries took a few tries get right   fresh vs frozen are two different ways of cooking  fresh use the recommended setting depending on how thick   if thinner then reduce time a little maybe  frozen you need to reduce time by about a     fish sticks such as gortons frozen i use the chicken setting but reduce it to about    minutes   they are lightly crunchy on the outside and moist and tender inside  other brands with thinner fish sticks need reduced cooking time so that they dont dry out sausage dogs i use the chicken setting with about    minutes to get a bit of blackening and cracking of the skin going  for just cooked but not till the skin breaks probably    min maybe anyways it is up there with our rice cooker and electric pressure cooker for devices we use a lot      
153,4.0,                       this air fryer has a very large basket  i easily fit in    chicken wings  single layer  they are  by far  the best wings i ve ever had  it does a great job with frozen french fries  too  with the frozen french fries  there is a fair amount of condensation that comes out the bottom of the air fryer  not a big deal  but still added wiping up  fortunately  the air fryer is super easy to clean  nothing sticks to it  spray and a little suds and you are done  the only complaint i have is that it still produces a  plastic  odor while being used  i am hoping that goes away over time  i am still getting used to using the air fryer and putting it into my weekly routine  i recommend this air fryer to all the skeptics out there      
154,2.0,                       i got this fryer against my wife s wishes  she wanted to wait for a sales event   so i really really wanted to like this machine  else i m in for a continual litany of  i told you so     the fryer was working fine for the first few days  it was easy to use with plenty of button options  the recipe book was helpful  it was a quiet machine  big enough to cook up pork chops  fries  vegetables  etc   unfortunately  on the  th day  while trying to make fries again  it died   power was not getting to the machine   i swapped it around to different outlets in and out of the kitchen  hoping that it was actually my home electrical system  that s how much i wanted this machine to work    alas  it was not my electrical system  it was the fryer   i tried it again the next day  the same issue  it worked for a few minutes  then died   so  i had to wrap it back up into the box and return it   worst yet  i m now listening to  i told you so  from my wife   and we are not allowed to get another fryer until she sees the sale she wants      
155,2.0,                       i love this air fryer  i love it i chose this one over a cheaper     one because i know it will last me longer  the digital screen is      worth it and makes using it so easy this has made dinners so much easier for myself and my hubby  it s so big that i can use it if our family gets bigger  too  this has changed my life  just like the instant pot did i hope you enjoy it  too update oct       i started noticing the drawer part  not the basket  is bubbling up like the nonstick paint on the inside is about to come off  i am worried it will flake off and get in my food and  much worse  ruin the cleaning process i ve only used my air dryer maybe    times since i got it at the very beginning of july  but for       you would think it holds up better  i only hand wash it changing from   star to   star this is so upsetting i attached a pic  it looks like water droplets but that is bubbles paint update     i found a screw in my potatoes are you freaking joking    do not buy  i ve contact them several times and have heard nothing  coating coming off and now it s falling apart into my food  cosori message me back     
156,2.0,                       alright     first the positive     the food tastes amazing  when it works properly you ll love it  it has a large basket compared to other so you can cook a decent volume of food too  now for the reality check     the screen buttons work about     of the time    almost useless  it forces you to use the app    which works great until it doesn t work anymore    i bought this and i m ready to replace it   months later  look for something that is higher quality and easy to use    the malfunctioning screen and app are enough to make you pull your hair out      
157,1.0,                       as my first air fryer  i was very excited when i started learning the  ins  and  outs  of this thing  i am a stay at home mom of three that babysits so it s important to have food fast when littles are hungry  this was definitely the answer  but   after a year of use i realized how extremely difficult it was becoming to clean  i would scrub and scrub after each use and it would still hold this terrible greasy feeling  everyone assured me it was normal and our food still tasted great  so i considered it only a minor set back then one day while cooking lunch  i had put fries in the basket  i set the fries setting and had already shook the basket   the setting gives you a warning to  shake  halfway through your desired time temperature  a few moments passed when i noticed the screen started malfunctioning  the back of the machine started smoking and i immediately unplugged the item from the wall as quickly as possible  after letting it cool down i opened the basket to inspect  fries were still slightly cold inside  but it looked like a french fry had fallen out of the basket and was stuck between the inside of the machine and the basket  i m assuming it was laying on just the right spot to fry the machine  and the fry  because it was black   had i not been nearby  we may have just had a house fire  i counted my blessings and the machine went in the garbage  i upgraded to a ninja foodi and am so thankful their basket system is not made the same  while i miss my handle   i use tongs to  flip  and i feel it s much safer      
158,2.0,                       unfortunately this didn t work for us  the things were either overdone or underdone  it was however very easy to clean  we tried it   times  the food was not crispy even with the tip of adding   tablespoons of oil  so we ended up returning it      
159,5.0,                       left overs like pizza and fries actually  taste better a day or two old once warmed up in the air fryer  chicken thighs are more crispy in    minutes vs an hour in the oven  less time and taste better  so moist  utilize you tube videos   so helpful baked potatoes so yummy  asparagus awesome in like   minutes  my husband loves crispy chicken wings in the air fryer   best he has ever tasted    easy clean up  so many wonderful videos on youtube   for how long to cook and at what temperature  would highly recommend the cosori air fryer     qt   we had our first one for a couple of weeks and noticed a vibration  we sent it back at no charge and ordered another one that is working perfectly  would make a terrific gift       
160,1.0,                       i ve run this thing for hours now trying to get the awful plastic smell out  after using it in my kitchen for    minutes and getting that nasty smell all through my house i spent the day today running it outside on my porch and then cleaning it with hot soapy water  rinse and repeat  hours  food still taste of plastic  and now so does my porch  i can t see that i ll ever be able to use it so i consider it a waste of       and don t believe the manufacturer responses in here that says there s no way the plastic smell is getting into the food  it does  and has continued to do so all day  after hours and hours i admit that i m a bit sensitive to smells  but from the reviews on here i m not the only one  before you order  if you think you might be one of those people  don t ignore the warning reviews on here like i did  save yourself some money and don t bother      
161,5.0,                       i purchased this unit after internet research on reviews of the best units  this one is rated by many sites as the best of the best  now that i ve had mine for a few weeks  and have used it daily  i am very pleased with my purchase  most of today s kitchen appliances have presets that are actually quite hard to figure out  but not on this unit  the preset choices are extremely easy to use  the temp time menu is so simple that even this old man can do it without getting confused  the basket is square  which gives it a bigger capacity for more food than a round one  it has a higher power rating than many others  so it cooks fast and thoroughly  to clean it  all i do is put the basket in the dishwasher  that s it  nothing else  i have a cabin where i spend half my days  so after i bought my first one for the house and used it for a week  i knew i needed one at the cabin too  so i bought a second  identical one  that way i can cook in it pretty much every single day  this is the best kitchen gadget i ve purchased in years      
162,5.0,                       love this air fryer  we had the power xl air fryer in the   qt model and the   qt model  we used the power xl on a daily basis but began to have trouble with the switch located at the bottom where you put the basket in early on  you had to put the basket in and sort of jiggle it to get it to toggle the switch on to allow the air fryer to operate  eventually  that stopped working and the power xl would no longer turn on  so  it was time to replace it   the cosori air fryer max xl does not have this problem  there is no switch at the bottom  the basket slides in easily without having to maneuver it to catch the switch   i believe it does a better job air frying than the power xl   the preset cooking times and temperatures are great  it is easy to change time and temperatures and it has a pause feature   the basket handle is sturdy and locks into place easily   it is non stick and easy to clean   i like the design of the square basket  it can easily fit a   lb chicken  it is easy to use and does a better job than the power xl   wish i would have bought  this one to begin with   if you are looking for an air fryer this is the one      
163,5.0,                       i had the airfryer xl for years and i told everyone i came in contact with that it was the best thing since microwaves and ovens  and that i would take it to my grave because i loved it so much  lol  having said that  i have ceramic tile floors and i dropped it    or more times  anyone who has that type of floor knows it is rare for anything to survive such a fall  but the xl hanged on   over time the xl became so banged up that i decided once i move i would re purchase it  however  after moving  amazon was having a sale and my pocketbook was tugging at me to make a change   i could always return it if i hated it and buy the xl again   i said to myself  well           i love the cosori more        it has a square basket which fits items much better than the oval one  it s quieter  it s still a spaceship in size but it is very nice looking with the matte textured black plastic  it s truly awesome and is my addiction for life  i use it to warm up food  toast bread  make pizzas  cookies  fries  onion rings  etc   you name it  you can do almost anything with this gorgeous machine and it is super fast  which saves you on electricity and cooking heat in your house   if you are questioning some brands  i strongly encourage you to just buy the cosori because you will be happier sooner than later  lastly  please be sure to take out all the cardboard after unpacking and before cooking anything  i washed the basket but i was so excited to try it i had blind eyes to the cardboard which was still  underneath  the basket area  very careless of me  all is well  and i use my cosori every day      
164,1.0,                       first use was to cook french fries   instructions followed precisely   some fries were overdone while others were under done   second use was to cook grated potatoes for use as a bed for pulled pork   followed an air fryer recipe   noted that the potatoes were becoming very brown and crisp on the outside but not cooking on the center   tried to stir them and continued   checked again before time was up   they were over done  very brown and dry    placed on warm cycle while pork and corn were heated    minutes    potatoes continued to cook and were just shy of being charcoal   third try was broccoli   it also turned out overdone and somewhat charred   last attempt was an egg test   cooked egg in a silicon muffin cup   egg was overdone and uncooked  possibly according to the burner pattern   this is unacceptable   returned the unit      
165,4.0,                       great air fryer   one thing i disliked was the super loud menu beeps   i scoured the internet and emailed the company to no avail   however i did take matters into my own hands and fixed the loud beep   this was very easy to do  however  be warned and do not do this if you feel at all uncomfortable with the steps there is no built in way to lower or disable the beeps from pressing menu buttons   here s what i did   you can pop the top off which is held on with plastic clips all around  oh btw do this at your own risk  i m only reporting what i did which most certainly was dangerous risky voided warranty etc  and for goodness sake people  unplug it and leave it be to cool down and stuff  anywho  pop the top and locate the round black speaker on the circuit board  you can take a pair of needle nose pliers and pull off the black cover to the speaker  you can identify the speaker by seeing the board notated as buzr next to it  the black cover piece to speaker has a hole in center of it  after pulling it off  gentle force  there is a circular flat disc  seen in pic  appears to be possibly magnetic  simply pick it off and replace the black speaker cover  boom no sound  here s the downside  there is no sound at all for anything anymore      
166,5.0,                       i just had to write a review   i have a nuwave af  but didn t like it as much as my cosori   i love the basket vs the nuwave  so much easier to clean   the non stick coating appears to be better as well  my nuwave started to peal just after a few uses   over this past weekend  i used it all weekend   i made chicken drums that turned out perfect and made some honey glazed carrots from the awesome cosori cookbook that it came with   i also  made some muffins and two cornish hens   came out awesome as well   last night i made pizza s     delish   this af is so easy  you won t be disappointed if you bought one for yourself   a very satisfied customer   i have a cosori pressure cooker as well and love it too      
167,5.0,                       love this product  if you are thinking of buying an air fryer this is probably the best on the market  here s why you are going to love it   easy to use  not rocket science   lots of video supports on youtube  easy clean up  lots of recipes to try  two year warranty if you register the product right away  the presets  shake reminder  large basket      more heat distribution which means a faster cooking time  you can pull out the bin to check foot without having to reset the temp time  impressive basket design that makes air flow productive  online af community presence  smart technology  which provides a real time cooking display and tons of recipes and the ability to creat your own    this    and great accessories to purchase  it is fun to use  it has easily become favorite go to gadget we cooked chicken  cookies  kabobs  and so much more  this was so easy the product exterior is not hot to the touch  only the back where the hot air comes out we have tried several air fryers and this was the best      
168,2.0,                       i made salmon and green beans after receiving this yesterday and i was not comfortable with the smoke steam i cant tell which coming from the basket area  the food was not greasy frozen salmon and fresh green beans   i know the steam is supposed to come out the back and i have another air fryer that never has steam or smoke from the basket area and so i have experience with air fryers i just wanted the larger capacity   i will try cooking again but now i am worried how much is will smoke if i actually use oil to coat food ie potatoes etc   i immediately took out the basket and rechecked everything to make sure there was no overlooked packaging that perhaps was left inside      
169,1.0,                       i wanted a new  larger air fryer as my og philips was getting old  albeit still running great     so i decided against my better judgment to try a cheaper brand based on the great reviews    but ended up regretting it immensely  initial impression was that it looked great out of the box  but when using it i noticed the build of the machine was of much lower quality than my old philips just some cons to note  tried it for   month   the basket was really hard to pull in and out of the air fryer as well as difficult to detach from the bottom basket like other reviews mentioned  the touchpad is wonky and unresponsive  i had to touch buttons multiple times repeatedly for it to respond and it was really annoying biggest con for me    the smell  immediately when opening the basket  i noticed a very strong  unpleasant chemical plastic smell  based on instructions  it said to run the air fryer empty on high for      min  however  the smell would not go away and seeped into my food  making it inedible  not to mention making my kitchen smell terrible   i tried washing multiple times  running with lemon vinegar water  running on empty for multiple times  etc  this chemical smells reinforces my feeling that the materials they use are cheap and low quality  final straw    i finally got the smell to be bearable  but when i tried heating up some food  the machine started only blowing cold air and wouldn t work   tldr  smelled gross   stopped working after a month with less than    uses so i returned it and am going to buy a new phillips xxl instead        
170,1.0,                       plugged in  excited to cook  waited a few minutes  only displayed the wifi icon and power icon  push hold power icon does not change state of device  put some food in the basket  insert for operate  and waited a few minutes  provided the same result  instructions did not indicate wifi and app are required for operation  was interested in newest model  fail      
171,5.0,                       i bought this air fryer to assist in making chicken nuggets and fries for the kids   what i learned is it does so much more   i have evolved in to using it daily and cooking almost anything i would normally fry or bake using my stove oven with much less cleanup and hassle   i have to admit  i am a sucker for new appliances   i jumped on sous vide  which i actually think is the most delicious way to cook cuts of meat especially when entertaining or cooking large cuts but it takes time and some preparation and some mess  mainly in that you still have to use the stove or grill to sear the meat    still love it but use less often than at first  it doesn t take much room so no bother    i then jumped on the insta pot   tried to use it a lot but now it has ended up mostly just being a smaller slow cooker than the one i have   the pressure cook feature  and other features  can be convenient but not worth having a bulky extra appliance for if you already have a slow cooker   now comes to the air fryer   i had big concerns because of it s size   larger than the previous two things i mentioned   i saved all the packing material with expectation that i would ship it back   much to my surprise  not only does it cook the fries nuggets  and chicken wings i might add  much better than the oven  it cooks hamburger  chicken  steak  seafood  vegetables  garlic bread       almost everything you could cook on the stove oven quickly and with a really good result  once you get a handle on the temp time requirements    on top of that  the cooking is all contained so it doesn t make a mess of your stove  oven  countertops  or pans and it  s cooking tray is very easy to clean   imagine no grease to clean up from the stove area after frying    i often make     different things sequentially which makes me at times wish i had two   that way i could cook the main and side dishes  ie  nuggets fries  at the same time  although you probably can do it with just one but i have done that yet due to capacity    my stove oven usage has dropped by at least          because of that  i leave this unit out all the time   it is bulky for a small kitchen  like mine  but fortunately i have a small table just off the kitchen in the breakfast area where this fits without being in the way   yes  in the breakfast area because this makes no mess outside of the cooker and it looks attractive enough not to be an eye sore   now lets talk size   i bought the    qt and am so glad i did   one of the only two wishes i had for this unit is that it held more  although i find this to be mostly adequate for a family of four and i don t think i would want it to take up any more space   it can cook       large chicken breasts or   hamburgers at one time and i am sure it would cook bacon very well but you may not get more than      slices in there   i don t think this brand is any better or worse in this regard compared to other brands of the same volume spec   i believe there are some models that have a rack so you can increase food capacity   i m not sure how well this works but from simple observation of how air fying works i think it would   also note  the smaller volume  ie   qt  versions are not that much smaller on the outside but noticeably smaller in cooking capacity now for the fryer review   having not had another  i am very pleased with this model and would recommend   as i have noted  i like the way it cooks and looks   food is very crispy on the outside and finished nicely on the inside and it cooks the entire contents very evenly   it seems to be well built and the cooking pan parts are very easy to clean   the controls are logical and the buttons are touch sensitive   my second minor wish is that the buttons would be more consistent in their sensitivity but i realize they were designed this way for easy cleaning   so probably a worthwhile trade off   in short i highly recommend this brand   i ve only been using it a month and so far no problems   if i have any problems in quality or durability moving forward i will update this review   most of all  i highly recommend having an air fryer   this is an appliance i can see myself using every day and for a long time      
172,4.0,                       the air fryer works great  i use it everyday and i know there s plenty more that i can cook bake in it  i fully recommend the product  however buyers need to be aware of the following    it is not the easiest to clean  the slots on the sides to allow air flow will routinely build up grease and it is not easy to get off    and this is a warning  there are a few screws that attach the handle to the basket  these screws become loose and will fall out   this is a common issue for other people that have purchased this air fryer  this could potentially cause the handle to fall off while carrying extremely hot food  be sure to check and tighten them frequently      
173,5.0,                    no esperaba el momento en que llegara el air fryer lo estrenamos cocinando alitas de pollo y papitas fritas y quedaron deliciosamente crocantes y con un sabor espectacular y no usamos aceite por no tener en el momento pero compramos el aceite en spray de aove y solo lo usamos con un spray y todo el queda incre blemente sabroso      recomendado        
174,3.0,                       i absolutely love the fryer   after having using it daily for almost one year  a screw on the basket felt off  it is not a regular screw so i wrote to the factory for a replacement screw  they never reply   the fryer still working great but i have to hold the bottom of the basket every time i pull it out from the unit      
175,1.0,                       too easy  i purchased the wifi enabled model last week  it makes cooking to easy  if i find myself craving a snack and with in minutes i have a plate of fries  onion rings or jalapeno poppers  clean up is fast and simple  hot water soapy water and a quick wipe down with a sponge  and all done  perfect for a single person or couple  update   i am not very pleased with this product  the control panel is defective  i can only operate it with the wifi app  the fryer works great but i would never recommend the wifi model  i just lowered my rating to a  ne star             i wanted to add to this review  i just noticed that the non stick finish is coming off of the basket  i have used nothing but a sponge to clean the surface  very disappointed  i threw the unit away not wanting to consume any of the material  unfortunately i can t lower my rating below a one star or i would  do not buy      
176,2.0,                       i got this air fryer  cosori air fryer max xl     quart  and used it to fry chicken drumsticks and root vegetables  i had to fry the drumsticks in   batches because of the quantity  there were    drumsticks  so i thought that this would be  a great way to quickly fry and save time without having to deep fry  as the unit cooked there was a smell of plastic but the top of the unit is plastic  i figured that the smell was coming from the top plastic   heat rises  however  the frying basket is metal and coated with a nonstick application  i did not think or believe that the smell was coming from the basket as well  well  all the food cooked in this air fryer tasted like plastic  i had to throw it all away  even my    year old grandson who will eat pretty much anything  wouldn t eat it after tasting it  so    batches of chicken drumsticks and   batch of root veggies was wasted  that s   uses of the cosori air fryer max xl  save your money and time and invest in a deep fryer or oven fry to save on fat consumption  i live in arizona  so running the oven is rough in      temperatures      
177,1.0,                       have never been able to get the touchscreen front to respond  the app keeps making me reload and resume  it mainly just sits there and makes me wish i bought another brand the very few times it has worked the food has been excellent  which is a shame as i cannot use it as intended  to work vs a taken up counter top space spot       
178,1.0,                       the touch controls on the fryer are a joke   they hardly recognize touch so it s very frustrating trying to change the cook time or temperature  usually takes pressing   or   times hunting for the  sweet spot  that works for the button it took me   hours to get the device connected to my wifi network because the application sucks the non stick is starting to rub off where the basket and bottom tray touch  there is no filter or anything on the back so the wall behind the air fryer has grease and small food bits all over it  luckily the wall has tile so i can scrub it off with harsh cleaning chemicals  if it were a painted wall it would never come off on a positive note  the fryer cooks nicely      
179,5.0,                       had this for about a week and have been using it daily  so far it works well  i made simple food like fries  various vegetables  and some marinated chicken  not together  all were separate meals  my fries certainly cooked through but were a bit limp the first time around and i expect this was because i used too much oil when i coated them in spices  the second time i didn t use oil at all and even patted the potatoes dry before cooking  and they came out very crispy  next time i ll try for something in the middle  all of the fried veggies were tasty but nothing that i can t get from baking them on a sheet pan in the oven  they took less time in the air fryer so that is a benefit  the chicken would have benefited from less time in the fryer but that is my own trial and error since meat cuts can vary in size  still came out tasty and moist since they ve been marinating for a few hours cleanup is simple  just have to wait for the whole thing to cool down  then i ve been giving it a gentle wipe down but haven t made anything messy enough to warrant a full scrub yet overall i m happy with the purchase  it hasn t done anything unexpected yet  i saw some reviews about it leaking steam but have not had that happen  my coffee machine makes more visible steam than this thing does   its been a good addition to my kitchen so far      
180,5.0,                       awesome  i have never used an air fryer and did not actually know anything about them  then my daughter described her experience and how much she liked it  she told me the brand and size she used  i started doing my own research and found this cosori had really good ratings and the size seemed about right  i honestly do not have enough words to describe this air fryer  i have been testing it and trying different things ever since it arrived  we are making homemade bagels  tater tots in here are awesome  the list goes on  i am extremely happy i chose this air fryer      
181,5.0,                       my cosori wi fi air fryer has immediately become an indispensable kitchen appliance   we prepare meals a minimum of   times a week   with a tiny amount of olive oil we are able to prepare an entr e or side with an average of   minutes   then we rinse and place the basket in our dishwasher for quick clean up   we purchased the air fryer over   months ago  have used it at least       times and the basket s teflon coating remains intact with no evidence of wear or defect   we use silicon utensils to remove food so not the scratch the basket s interior surface   this particular cosori air fryer has a large capacity     quarts and the outstanding wi fi smartphone and alexia interface with cosori s smartphone software application   this application contains a large number of recipes and permits the user the capability of inputting their own air fryer recipes   my smartphone and alexia bring outstanding smart technology to manage my cooking times and technique with perfection   without hesitation i say my family are extremely satisfied with our cosori wi fi     quart air fryer   imagine during the last   months        uses  we have used less than a half cup of olive oil for cooking   that s very heart healthy   an outstanding choice for a top rated air fryer   yes choose cosori     we are a satisfied cosori consumer        
182,5.0,                       my first meal was two frozen veggie burger patties  and about two cups of frozen broccoli and frozen brussels sprouts i d rate the fryer  promising but not mind blowing   keep in mind the meal choice  at best  is a   out of    no matter how you cook it the fryer made the outside of the frozen veggies sorta charred and crisp  but moist in the center  frozen sprouts are always mushy in the middle so they sucked as usual   i didn t use any oil  but lightly coating them i think would improve the results veggie patties are essentially hockey pucks regardless of cooking method  fryer did nothing to improve them nor make them worse the fryer connects to alexa  but i can t think of a scenario where i d have to remotely tell it to cook or stop cooking with better ingredients  i think it could be pretty decent  though i think figuring out cooking times will be key  gonna go grocery shopping and maybe try some of the recipes it comes with recipes are accessible via the app  then after you prep the food  you control the fryer through the app to cook the recipe to the recommended settings  kinda cool lastly i got the    q size which i think is the largest from cosori in the  cooking bucket  format  personally think is fine for cooking for one person  maybe   depending on what you re making      
183,4.0,                       i was originally going to purchase another brand since it was   qtz in size which was much more ideal for me  however it has been out of stock for a while so i decided to get this one instead and honestly     im not disappointed  this air fryer actually hold its own in terms of size  and functionality  for reference you can fit a whole small chicken or   large chicken legs with no issues  and the pre sets are on point with the cooking time  food cooks pretty fast  within    minutes you can get a few things done  such as roasted potatoes and some fried roasted chicken  totally time efficient cons  the only issue i have with this air fryer is that the heat tends to flow more on a specific side  so food that tends to settle on the  weak spot  usually end up unevenly cooked  not horribly uncooked however  ive had an easy time fixing that by just shaking the basket and setting up   extra minutes to cook  i do like that the air fryer will tell you on the screen at some point to  shake the basket   it will almost always tell you this  so that you can redistribute the food evenly  especially important if you re cooking things like french fries loose foods  another con would be the material for the basket     it seems to be teflon or some sort of cheap non stick material which are usually not that great for our health so id caution everyone to never scrub the basket and simply just use a soft sponge to avoid the material from scraping off over time all in all  the air fryer is doing an amazing job  i havemt used my stove in over a week because i ve been roasting all my food on this  however  if you re looking for something to bake a large cake  casserole etc  then this is not it  its simply too small for larger dishes or a big family  a   to   q air fryer or convection oven might be more ideal  the air fryer also looks nice on the kitchen and doesn t take too much space  the noise isn t too bad either  it won t replace your stove altogether  but it makes an amazing addition for smaller  side dishes  that would otherwise take forever to make on a normal oven or stovebelow for reference are some photos of a medium and mini loaf pans you can fit in the basket both mini pan dimensions         in  x       in  x      in medium    in  x       in  x         in i will update you all in regards to the durability and functionality over time and see if anything changes      
184,5.0,                       i have had   air fryers at this point  different sizes and different brands and so far this one has been my favorite  i love how big it is and the square shape  however  what inspired me to buy it was the fact you can press a release button and the basket comes out  this makes it easy to dump the food right onto a plate or dish  my old ninja  which worked great  just had an attachment that fit snug in the bottom so i couldn t dump the food out with out getting the crumbs  juices  and oil that had accumulated at the bottom on top of all the food  this is easy to use also  there are pre set settings or you can change the temperature and cook time manually  just have to press a button once or twice  i have made frozen snack type food in it and food i battered or breaded myself  both come out amazing  i bought an oil spritzer off amazon and fill it with olive oil or coconut oil and spritz the food every   minutes then shake the basket and continue cooking  that really makes a difference in the final product when it comes to homemade breaded dishes  if you are thinking of buying an air fryer i highly recommend this one  this is even great to reheat leftovers   pizza may even be better the next day if you are warm it up in the air fryer   i haven t had any issues but i have only had it for like two weeks  with in those two weeks i have used it almost everyday  my kids love it and my   year old uses it by herself constantly   chicken nuggets  fish sticks  frozen popcorn shrimp  pizza pockets  cheese sticks all that junk  so yes i d definitely recommend this air fryer      
185,4.0,                        turn the beeping beeps off   cried the dogs as they huddled trembling in the farthest corner of the house  their humans were again making tater tots marveling at how fast their food was cooked to crispy perfection  noticing their rescue dogs  reaction every time  they looked for a volume nob an on off switch for the beeping  nothing  they wrote to the manufacturer asking for help  nothing could be done  you see  the year was       the year of the upside down  the year even murphy ran out of laws to write  the year a family could not enjoy crispy taters without terrifying their dogs  the beeps will only stop when the machine is replaced      
186,5.0,                       i previously purchased one of these when they first came out  unfortunately  it was just a little too complicated for my liking  so  i gave it to my friend  and she loved it  years passed  and then my aunt told me about this wonderful new thing she had purchased and didn t have to stand over a stove  of course  when she told me what it was  i couldn t believe it  so  i started to research in order to find one that was just right for me  because my aunt neglected to mention the brand she had  and i still don t know to this day  and honestly i no longer care  my corosi  however  is the best  everything is pre set  it comes with a recipe book and the clean up is way to easy no matter what you cook  i basically got it to cook wings for football games  but now am cooking most of everything i eat  i have read other reviews that talk about the plastic smell  and even the taste of plastic  however  i can say that once i smelled the plastic i felt defeated  i didn t want to return this possible dream come true  i had dreams of not buying stock in bww  but low and behold  while retrieving the lot number  i noticed that parts of the styrofoam had broken off  and gotten caught up in a crease  after i removed  everything was great   once  i get some of the accessories or air fryer containers for other stuff i don t think i will ever use a conventional stove again  i have already purchased one for my mom  when anyone mentions their air fryer  am there to brag about what i believe is the best air fryer on the market  but don t tell my aunt      
187,5.0,                       like most people  i have a very busy schedule   when i get home  i don t feel like cooking      and  i m just an ok cook because i really don t have the patience when i m tired after a busy day  but now      i find myself looking forward to coming home and trying new things in my air fryer   i am single and cooked a cornish hen in my     qt  fryer   it came out beautiful   i also did some chicken wings and they were delicious   i even baked a sweet potato in my fryer and it was scrumptious   i showed my pics to a friend and she had me order a corsori for her right on the spot   thanks corsori   the fryer is very simple to use   cooks quickly   food tastes delicious and there is practically no clean up at all   i couldn t ask for more  and no  i wasn t given anything to write this review      
188,1.0,                       i absolutely loved this air fryer until last night when i was making multiple batches of french fries   each batch of fries took between       minutes on     degrees to cook and when i was done  i was shocked to see a gaping hole in the left side of the air fryer   i am afraid to use this anymore as this is clearly a product defect and could have started a fire      
189,5.0,                       first  let me say that this machine exceeded every one of my expectations  it is easy to work  easy to clean  and makes food phenomenally i have one single negative  and that is maybe because i am cooking for one person  when i cook according to their specifications it s usually a little overdone  if i make french fries i make them about   ounces at a time and i could probably make   pounds in one batch now that i ve adjusted my times  everything is great i have made french fries of course  marinated chicken breast  chicken nuggets  roasted vegetables  including frozen vegetables and frozen breaded fish  to name a few   i am on weight watchers  so this really adds a delicious dimension to my recipe box my nephew who is not limiting calories says that chicken cordon bleu  empanadas  and mozzarella sticks are amazing i was concerned having read some of the negative reviews about this product  when i got the box i was freaked out because it looked as if it had been re taped  whether or not it was  all i can tell you is this machine has worked flawlessly for the last   days   i will update if there is anything to update you about don t think twice about buying this machine  it is awesome      
190,3.0,                       let me start by saying this is my go to for cooking lots of things  we even use it to reheat drive thru fries that have gotten cold by the time we get home which make them just like they came out of the fryer  i really enjoy is it being the wifi model and it works with alexa on the down side  after almost a year of use  the front panel is very hard to use  i m glad i have the wifi model because that still works perfectly  i press on front panel buttons and sometimes have to do it hard  i often cannot adjust time or temperature  i m afraid it fail completely soon  we wash the basket in dishwasher and found the screws holding the basket to he handle worked out  i lost two and was able to find substitutes and ended up buying another basket since i sometimes will cook different things for the same meal there is a bit of learning curve but the included recipe book and the app are very helpful  you have to experiment because some things come out great and some do better cooking in the oven i would have given it   stars but i m afraid it will not be a long lasting appliance      
191,1.0,                       if i could give this piece of crap   stars i would  it worked ok for a while and then stopped  i came on here asking for help from the manufacturer and they kept asking stupid ridiculous questions like did you plug it in  is there too much grease near the button  it electrocuted me  it was a piece of crap  know that i will never  ever purchase another piece of crap cosori junk ever again  i am so pissed off right now i need to stop  before i say something that i will regret  don t waist your money on this crap  the manufacture won t stand behind their product  i ended up tossing this piece of junk in the garbage  and know that i will take every opportunity to trash your company and your junk products on here and social media and anywhere else i am able  your products are junk and your company is junk  perhaps i have gotten my point across  junk               and to the manufacturer  don t contact me  ever  for anything  i don t want to discuss how much you suck  i don t want to be reimbursed  you had your opportunity to make things right and you blew it  now i will give my money to one of your competitors      
192,5.0,                       this air fryer comes highly recommended   it s reviews were better than that of larger branded ones like ninja  etc   perhaps this is a large brand but i had never heard of cosori before   anyhow  i was excited to upgrade to this after just using a basic one for so long   it is incredibly spacious   it has tons of room and i love that   you can comfortably fit   average chicken breasts  is that a unit of measurement      lol   i like the safety feature it has where if you remove the tray while it s mid cook  it will stop the cook automatically   once you re insert it will resume   it s relatively easy to clean  i personally don t use the dishwasher because i am afraid of it rusting   the only con so far is that it s quite loud      
193,5.0,                       it is very nice and works well   we use it all of the time   but just a heads up to save you a problem   we have had ours for about   months and on the inside of the basket and carrier both  there are   or   philipps screws   tonight my wife was washing it and one fell out and  went down the garbage disposal  she was able to get it back   upon checking i found that all were loose   so save yourself  possible headache and check them and tighten them up      
194,5.0,                       i bought this air fryer two weeks ago  the item arrived fast  it was very well packed no damage  when i opened the box the air fryer looked brand new  however  the display was all scratched like someone has grabbed their keys and scratched all over the display  i called cosori customer serviced  the gentlemen was so polite and professional  they offered a replacement right away  they grabbed my information and amazon order number  i give an a  for their customer services the replacement arrived   days later  brand new no scratch  i am still learning how to use it  but we already love it  i cooked fries  chicken and steak  this air fryer is very hot so you have to be very careful with timing  i love how it beeps when you have to flip or shake as for the taste  i don t know if it is because it is new  but my food tasted a little bit like the cosori  i don t know how to explain in  but i m guessing it is because the product is new  because the same thing happened with my pressure cooker my husband and i definitely recommend this air fryer      
195,2.0,                       after   months  this product is falling apart  the basket inside the drip pan moves and vibrates during cooking  it has chaffed away significant sections of the teflon coating on the drip pan  this immediately rusted  also the crimp at the top of the fryer basket has rust all of the way around under the lip  when you do the   minute preheat  very often the pan  pops  out of the heating area  it moves very far  if you have the fryer on the edge of a counter  the basket will fall to the floor  the plastic on the handle broke on mine after a few of these falls  the flavor of the food is incredible  but i will look for another brand than cosori      
196,5.0,                       i love  love  love my cosori air fryer     fried foods are my favorites  but i hate cleaning up the mess   even though i am on the keto eating plan  i still don t like cleaning up the mess of frying food  especially bacon   i knew a year ago i wanted an air fryer  and it took me awhile to pick out which one was right for me   i researched  and i read reviews   finally i decided upon the cosori   the main reason i picked this one were the reviews  not only for the air fryer  but for the positive cosori customer service reviews i waited to write this review because i wanted to see how i liked it   i ve had it for two months now  and i purchased it at the regular price   i also have not had any reason to contact their customer service   i have used it everyday now  sometimes     times a day it is sooo easy to clean   after cooking  any grease i pour into an old coffee container  and then wipe it with paper towel before i use soap and a sponge  the soft side  not the scouring side    the baskets can go into the dishwasher  but so far i have washed it by hand each time because i use it so often  and i don t run the dishwasher every day i have cooked bacon  steaks  sausage patties  frozen chicken wings  frozen chicken breasts  hamburgers  hotdogs  vegetables  etc   i plan on experimenting with desserts eventually     just haven t done it yet   the first week of using the air fryer  i overcooked a few items  especially frozen vegetables like broccoli  trying to figure out the time of cooking   no big deal   i ate it anyway   it has preset times  which i use every so often  but i wanted to understand the fryer so i experimented more   i only cook for three people  sometimes four  so the size is just right   if there is something in particular that i want to cook in it  i read air fryer recipes and ideas from others  then i adapt it to my likes and eating needs   i am so very happy with my purchase      i hope this review helps make your decisions easier      
197,1.0,                       not sure if it cooks good or not yet     i will let you know  but when you get it and they tell you to remove the plastic from inside it   the big piece of plastic was stuck to the top as if it was put on while hot   appears the plastic is attached to the coil while it was still hot because it is hard hard to get it off   had to take twizzers and pull it from around those coils and very unhandy   hope i got it all   it seemed as if it had been heated the plastic adhered to the coil     
198,1.0,                       i bought the fryer in november        i registered it for an extra year    years  of warrantee   i recently contact the company explaining the drawer no long locked  clicked  in place as would not operate unless i jammed it closed with something heavy in front of the drawer   i sent a picture of the top of the drawer showing the piece that  clicks  when you try to push the drawer in place   i also sent a copy of the extended warrantee i had registered what i got back from their customer support was instructions to send them a video of the drawer being inserted  and presumably popping back out   a copy of the purchase order and a  re  statement of the problem   i suspect all that is designed to make me just go away   it has  except for this review what the company got from me is a  former  customer who will not replace this fryer with another one from corsori if you think you will like this fryer  roll the dice and hope you never need it warrantee service   other than the lousy customer service and the drawer latch design  it s not a bad fryer      
199,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i bought this unit from amazon warehouse and it was listed as  used   very good  the unit was brand new and the packaging was damaged  i used it for a few months and it quit working   it was supposed to have a one year warranty so i contacted the manufacturer and explained that the basket latching system had failed   i could  wiggle it and pull up and it would turn on the unit until you let loose   see video   they suggested that i clean the unit  even though i told them that i had already tried that  and they would not honor the warranty because it was listed a s used because  i bought it from amazon warehouse  the bottom line is that i will not purchase anything from cosori  i believe that this product is defective in its design of its latching mechanism   cosori used a loop hole to justify not honoring their warranty   the unit was never used before i received it   it failed within the warranty period and they will not replace or repair the unit  buyer beware  update i reviewed the amazon warehouse policy and i was not eligible for the  company warranty as they had stated i contacted  support noting that the unit was unused when  i received it and that i was disappointed that they wouldn t honor the warranty  in between time  i tore into the defective unit and found a micro switch that signaled the presence of the cooking tray had failed   i ordered a replacement for    and it is on its way  meanwhile cosori contacted me  and made a one time exception  and was shipping me a replacement unit the bottom line is that i changed  this review to   stars because they considered the situation      
200,5.0,                       controls are well laid out   pre heat makes getting set easy   generous basket size   amazingly non stick  even in the base unit with bacon or longer fried foods   i ve used foil to cover the base under the bracket to ease cleanup  but you really don t have to since it washes out so easily   the snowflake icon button for frozen foods is just right and i have developed a habit of delicious frozen brussel sprouts air fried on a regular basis   who would have thought   perfect for households of two or three  or even four   easy and fast chicken breasts or thighs or tenders  shrimp  asparagus  jicama fries  etc   haven t tried steak since i prefer sous vide slower cooking for those followed by a quick pan sear  but burgers were good   most pics show french fried potatoes  which are good  but don t overload the basket like those many photos show   that won t work well   oh  and i love the  shake  reminder which comes on autamically on a few of the icon button foods   when you take the tray out to shake the oven pauses and restarts at the same place on the timer to continue the cook   highly recommend the cosori air fryer      
201,5.0,                       the quick review   i love this af  i m glad i trusted the        people who gave this corsori     qt af high reviews  i can t imagine anyone regretting purchasing this item detailed review   this is my first af and i read a lot of reviews and watched quite a few videos giving af reviews  i have a family of   and my youngest is a    tall teenage boy so i basically cook for   adults so af cooking capacity was a factor   other factors i considered where ease of cleaning  ease of use  how much i thought i d actually use an af  and cost i only have had this af for   days as of           i will update this post in a few weeks  i have used this af every day since using it   update              i have used this air fryer every single day since i purchased it   i am amazed at how easy it makes cooking chicken breasts  chicken tenders  and pork chops   i especially like how the meat is fully cooked  i test using a meat thermometer  but still so tender and juicy   on my list of foods to try are a whole chicken and steaks   my teens use it to toast their sandwiches for lunch   it s awesome at reheating leftovers  especially pizza       oh  yes  it makes awesome fries and onion rings   i am so happy i finally purchased an air fryer  and this corsori is still easy to clean  even after i made pork chops with a lot of sauce the other night   easy to use  and has made cooking so much easier   i continue to highly recommend the corsori     qt air fryer what i have made so far  french fries  frozen    yes  excellent    easily handled entire bag and the fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside  just how i like them  fried zucchini   the traditional flour  egg wash  breading  instead of frying in a skillet of oil i simply misted the slices with olive oil  they were wonderful  next time  i will try to make a keto version of these  chicken breakfast sausage links   also very good frozen salmon patties that i purchase at costco   very good   what i like about this is that the salmon patties are usually my lunch  i practice      intermittent fasting  i don t have the patience to do a lot of cooking for my first meal of the day and i want protein  this af quickly cooks my salmon patty  it is delicious  and clean up is a breeze  italian hot sausage sandwiches   oh my      i purchased the accessories for this af  i used the cake pan in the af to cook the onions and peppers   then  i removed the veggies and cooked the sausages  my entire family and i loved how the af cooked the sausages   crisp on the outside but juicy on the inside  once the sausages were cooked  i made the sandwiches  sliced the sausage roll  put a sausage link in the roll  topped the sausage with the already cooked veggies  i put the sandwiches in the af at      for   minutes   oh my   i wish i had better words to describe just how good these sandwiches were   disclaimer   i could have squeezed   sandwiches in at once but everything i ve read says airflow is important  so i only did   at a time    update          i have also made boneless chicken breasts  bone in chicken pieces  breasts  wings  drumsticks   and pork chops   everything has turned out great size   the square basket  vs a round basket  seems to make the cooking capacity of the     qt corsori greater than similarly sized af s   i considered an oven style af but i didn t want to lose that much counter space  i am quite happy with the size of this af ease of cleaning   every time i use this af and then clean it  i am amazed at how easy it is to clean     ease of use   as i stated earlier  this is my first air fryer  i find it very easy to use  it s fairly self explanatory with the preset buttons how much i thought i d use an af   this point was very important to me   i have been the proud owner for   years  at least  of a bread machine that i ve only used less than    times  please don t judge me  i hear about it all the time from my family  i have used this af everyday since i received it  some days twice  i see this af becoming an essential tool in my kitchen cost   i am a big believer in  you get what you pay for    that said  i have   kids in college and another one that will be headed to college in a few years  so i can t unwisely throw money around  i don t have any experience with any other air fryers  so i can t comment on whether i think more expensive brands are worth the extra expense or not  what i can say is that i think i definitely got my money s worth with the corsori     qt air fryer final words   if you are lost in the sea of various air fryer brands  in my opinion you will be very happy if you decide to purchase the corsori     qt air fryer i purchased the af with my own money and i am not reimbursed in any way for this review  i seldom write reviews but i am so impressed with this af and i want to help anyone who is as befuddled as i was when i was trying to chose which af to purchase other recommendations   i did purchase the accessories that are available from corsori for this af  i am glad i did  they make the af even more versatile  i recommend having tongs that are safe for scratch resistant surfaces  lastly  i did put an insulated counter protector under my af  it doesn t seem to get that hot under my af but i have new counters  so i am using a protector just in case      
202,2.0,                       while i love this product up until this week  things have changed based on my ability to contact the company   i have had my air fryer for     months   the food is always amazing  however i was cooking pork chops earlier this week and about   minutes in while i was making some sides  the drawer shot out of the air fryer and onto the floor   the drawer broke and doesn t sit sealed in the air fryer any more i figured i would contact the manufacture and just order a new drawer and bin to go inside the fryer   however  they do not have an email to contact only a phone number   while my work schedule in production i can t call during their business hours   this has caused me to go from cooking with it every night to nothing and i don t know how to fix it   i don t want to buy another complete unit  when only the drawer needs to be replaced on this one      
203,4.0,                       i was very skeptical about purchasing one of these  air fryers  but after a visit to my niece s house  seeing how quick and easy it was to cook frozen chicken strips in less time than it takes my oven to pre heat  i decided to give it a go   after it arrived and i initially washed it found a place for it in the kitchen  i went to the store and purchased a variety of frozen foods to put it through its paces  i made french fries first and they turned out great  very crispy just as i like them   next was jalapeno poppers  chicken strips  and frozen battered fish   i just finished making some breaded mushrooms and turkey burgers in it this evening and everything has turned out either as expected or has surpassed my expectations it s easy enough for just about anyone to use and clean up is a breeze   i m only giving it four stars at this time because i have yet to try out some of the other cooking features but will be happy to up it to five stars if i continue to be as please with it as i have been so far   i also really like the look of it  it s not a shiny black  it is more of a matte black which makes it match better with my other appliances   i also like that it s more square than round  fits better on my counter   it is rather large so if you don t have the counter space you might wish to order a smaller version   so far it s been one of the best things i ve purchased for my kitchen in a long time      
204,4.0,                       our air fryer has served a great purpose and constantly provides us with a delicious meal  i was eager to give this product a   star review but here s why i won t  the french fry button should work for majority of all frozen french fry options  however  this has given us burnt fries on more occasions than i care to admit  i typically use the frozen food button for french fries instead of the fry button due to this issue aside from that flaw  everything else has been a perfect meal  cooked flawlessly and doesn t leave a huge grease mess or pot of fry oil to clean up after later      
205,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          my life is changed forever omg  buy it  its not even debatable   i will never cook the same  personally i dont like cooking all that much cause the mess you have to clean up and bc of how much time it takes but this baby eliminates both problems     minutes you have perfect fries  salmon  i cant even express my gratitude for who ever created such magic  the cook book is bomb  cant wait to become martha stewart  cant wait to throw brussel sprouts in this baby  i m literally buying my mom one and celebrating  christmas in july  bc shes an actual cook and this is gonna changer her life  if i could choose one machine out of all i the ones i have in the kitchen this is  st without a doubt now  regarding plastic smell   sure  now  i am noticing a slight smell that comes with the frying  i thought it was what i was cooking  but its so minor and irrelevant  the machine is magic and honestly i m sure they all have more or less of a funk  considering the reviews this one didnt have nearly as many as others  the number of reviews cant lie  do yourself the favor   this is one of those items that goes on the  best life investments  next to pre tsa  so buy it  and as drake once said   you can thank me now      
206,5.0,                       i looked at specs and reviews of a number of products  but one review in particular recommended this one and remarked on the benefits of a square basket and this one has a square basket  i was originally considering spending less but based on the review i bought the cosori  and i am happy with my decision  i love it and have made a variety of foods in it and everything has turned out great  and it is so easy to clean  simple to operate  doesn t get hot on the outside  and for the internal size  does not have a huge footprint  fantastic product  if i had to select the kitchen appliances that i consider the most useful it would be the cosori air fryer  a grill pan with interchangeable surfaces  a k cup coffee machine and maybe a microwave  do not hesitate to buy the cosori      
207,3.0,                       this air fryer is relatively easy to clean and heats fries  fried chicken  and bread fairly evenly   on par with convection ovens  and better than toaster small ovens  however  the annoying thing about this air fryer is the loud beeps that there is no way to turn off  when i originally purchased this product  i was hoping to use it in the morning  but the loud beeps make it impossible since it will wake everyone in the house up  if the loud beeps are not a concern for you  i can recommend this product  however  for me the beeps are a deal breaker      
208,1.0,                       the instructions book and recipe book are missing  i need these books      
209,5.0,                       my husband wanted an air fryer  he kept seeing the one tv infomercial but i when i read the amazon reviews on it  i didn t like the  toxic death smell  comments   so after many days of research and reading reviews  i finally settled on the corosi  first  i liked the supposed size of it   and i also like the reviews of the preheating and shake features that make a difference from other fryers   when it came in i was surprised at the size and after a couple of months of owning it and using it   i am so glad i bought this   size is perfect for family compared to others   i like the squared deep basket  it is big to keep out on my counter but no biggie to pull out of pantry when needed   the nonstick basket is easy to clean and i even purchase paper cooking liners for it that help with things sticking   why you should buy    preheat  if you preheat like an oven you giving food a jump on being crispy    shake feature   no it does not shake for you  but half way through cooking it beeps to alert you to move  flip  toss  shake  shimmy   whatever your food you will need a little oil for maximum crispness  i bought an oil sprayer that allows to spritz the food with enough to cook crisp food   we have used a lot for frozen items instead of using oven   tip  for exception of potatoes like fries   keep things in one layer  if you throw in on top items  the bottom items may not crisp up enough or you will doing a lot of turning  takes one more run maybe but it s worth having crispy spring rolls or taquitos when they are cooked in one layer did cook burgers once  feel like it really shrunk them but they came out ok   did hot dog and those came out great   my husband has done frozen chicken wings and he loved how they came out i did buy the additional kit that has a pizza pan and other items so will need to try those considering in lock down due to covid    right now update  i have read other reviews of basket handle breaking cracking   with all things you cannot manhandle it   it should not be dropped   all it takes is a gentle push of the button and slide out   if you treat it well and take care of it  it will work fine      
210,2.0,                       the  touch screen  has never worked properly so there is only the pre set     degree for    minutes that works  it takes about       button presses for it to even turn the power on and then start the pre programmed cycle  i have learned to make do and the food really is great when you time it just right  i could never actually get it to sync even though it is wifi compatible    i should have returned it but we were moving just after we got it and it didn t get unboxed until after the returnable timeframe    pretty frustrating for the amount of money spent on it        i gave it two stars because it really does make great toast and frozen fries  you just have to set an alarm to stop it       
211,5.0,                       this thing is legit i ll preface why with a little background info    my wife got an instapot a while back and it slowly became the bane of her existence  she went through six dozen eggs just trying to get consistent hard boiled eggs  ruined two roasts and a litany of other dishes in a little over two weeks  she experienced firsthand the fleeting victory of accomplishing what she set out to do only three times  three  needless to say  once she d finished going through the multiple stages of grief  rage  depression and finally acceptance  i came home from work and saw the thing in pieces scattered across my driveway  she vowed  never  again   and that was that until this   months had passed and she s started noticing her friends using air fryers  she liked what she saw but the ptsd from the instapot was holding on strong  she was leery at first  then decided to pull the trigger    which may or may not have been helped along when i saw the pics of fries and chicken wings    fast forward two weeks and i came home to ridiculously mouthwatering smells and tears  only  this time  they were tears of joy  i looked over and our kids were savagely attacking heaping mounds of fries  nuggets  wings  corn dogs  everything  she even fried half out veggie drawer  the table looked like a cartoon version of thanksgiving  only it was a tuesday and only a week into the covid quarantines  my   year old told me to hurry up  sit and eat before she came to her senses and took it all away  to this day  our family has known no greater homemade feast five stars  would recommend      
212,5.0,                       i found that the easy buttons work for some things and others i use the suggestions online  like pinterest or other sites and blogs about food and recipes  the steak setting worked perfectly for three   oz venison steaks  the veggie and root veggie settings probably should be tweaked and set your own the ease of the basket removal is a great feature and it makes it super easy to clean  i have not put it in the dishwasher  yet  because i clean it right away and it doesn t need any deep cleaning bread under the basket for bacon is a must  after two out of four batches to cook one  lb package of bacon  spread the pieces out to cook thru  it started smoking pretty good  the water method is not really a good one read blogs and especially pinterest for ideas  it s a great tool you must turn things if you want crispy browned on both sides you must oil things  mist  to get a crispy texture      
213,1.0,                       i bought this product and i ve probably used it    times  the last   times i have used it  it cut off completely and goes blank  it won t show any of the digital buttons or anything  it s like it completely died  so  i took the food out  went to use my oven  and then left it plugged up and it started up on its own and continued to count down  what if i wasn t home  the outside of the fryer was hot as well  i will try to get a hold of the tech support for the fryer since it s been over a month for the amazon return      
214,5.0,                       as per the other reviews  our oven has become redundant  had this beauty for over   month now and thought i d share our experiences we had one which cooked everything to perfection but rather than trying to time different ingredients we bought another eg  steak in one fries in the other then we bought one for a family member here s what we cook to absolute perfection   bacon  perfectly crispy  just press the bacon button  it s that easy   chicken thighs  gotta admit it i now eat the chicken skin  never used to but it s crispy and delicious  just press the chicken button  walk away  come back  enjoy   steak  you ll never use a pan again  maintains all the juices with a perfect all round sear  just figure out your own cooking times for how you like it cooked   fries  roast potatoes  potato wedges  fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside  roasted vegetables  cooked with a little char  breaded fish and chicken  even the thickest pieces of say chicken are done in     minutes  crispy  juicy and delicious  no fat  amazing we pretty much use these little wizard gadgets for every home cooked meal it will take a while to figure out your perfect cooking times for steak  breaded chicken and so on  after that unplug your oven as you won t be using it anything you can cook in an oven  a pan or broiler will cook and taste so much better in the air fryer in more than half the time and with just a coating of spray oil our biggest gamble and success was had cooking beef wellington and it was the best we ve ever made  the pastry was cooked evenly and to crispy perfection while the fillet was beautifully medium rare  that s a lot of expensive ingredients and preparation time to gamble  gordon ramsey s recipe    minutes at     and   at      job done  gourmet give it a quick rinse and it s ready to conjure up the next delicious meal with the press of a button  feels like cheating sometimes especially with steak coming out so well  press a button walk away come back   minutes later and you ve got restaurant quality steak just be sure to always pre heat not sure about other cheaper airfryers  i know preheating is essential to the crispness which i m not sure the others have      
215,5.0,                       have used it a dozen times and can see it s usefulness now  i think getting a good recipe down for the flour dusting used to dredging meats and seafood breading might take a while  i mock fried some butterflied shrimp i d prepped with egg  flour and panko  it came out pretty well but was clear heavily breaded stuff needs to be raised from the bottom of the basket  solution is to purchase the optional kit of accessories  which i did  plus the extra basket definitely seeing the efficiency of this thing hate learning new icons but once you know the relative temps you re good even after you choose and icon setting you can fine tune the time and temp on the fly nice clear alarms  depending on icon mode you select it will beeeep half way to let you flip items in the basket  and beep again when done even after you choose an icon setting you can fine tune the time and or temp on the fly as necessary      
216,5.0,                       this product deserves more than   stars   it s that good  i have been going back and forth with the idea of purchasing an air fryer for about a year now but couldn t justify spending over      for one  this one came up on a prime day deal for around       after reading all the reviews i decided to buy it and give it a try  the reviews did not lie  this thing is great  my   year old loves chicken nuggets and this thing cooked frozen chicken nuggets in    minutes and they came out so crispy   i am so happy that i no longer have to worry about my   year old asking me     times if his chicken nuggets are done cooking  it also came with a recipe book that has so many other recipes and recommendations   i was actually really surprised at how many different things you can cook in here  steaks  meatballs  chicken parm  muffins  french toast  i can t wait to try them all  the presets are really convenient and the manual cooking is also really simple and it preheats in about   minutes which is awesome  although this one is big and does take up a bit of counter space  it was a great purchase especially at the discounted prime day price  i m very happy with this product so far and i ve already recommended it to my friends  i will definitely be purchasing the accessory set to complete this in the near future  this is definitely the best thing i ve ever purchased off of amazon      
217,1.0,                       update  rumbling noise is louder and louder when using it  also smokes starts coming up from the side and back when used  it just seems unsafe to use  i will be returning it got this air fryer   days ago  want to start eating healthier  made wings and pork with onions in this thing  so far i have no issues  easy to clean as well  it does however purpose a minor rumbling nose while cooking      
218,1.0,                       purchased this air fryer may           i hate cooking  but have enjoyed cooking with this  however  it stopped functioning correctly two weeks ago  it gets     minutes into cooking time and just shuts down  it s very disappointing after initially being so thrilled  before my issues started  i bought one for each of my kids  my fingers are crossed that those units don t crap out on them as well  buy another brand would be my advice      
219,5.0,                       i have gone crazy and been air frying everything  i cooked hamburgers  shrimp  anything frozen  pizza  steak  which turn out awesome and only take    minutes   bacon  sausage and any vegetable i can stick in there  the key is always pre heat  spray with oil and seasoning  the picture i included was all cooked in the fryer  hamburger steak  asparagus  corn on the cob and sauteed mushrooms  well ok  the gravy was done on the stove  i can set the cooking temp or setting on my phone and hit start and there it goes  and the clean up is a breeze  nothing stick  not grease  melted cheese nothing  i have talked my neighbors into buying this model and they must be crazy because they haven t taken it out of the box yet  oh ye of little faith  forgive them lord they know not what they are missing  their loss  but i understand people fear change  this throws everything we have been taught about cooking out the window  the food is done quicker and it actually taste better my only complaint is that maybe just on mine but the buttons are not very responsive  but with always having my phone around this has not been a deal breaker  in fact is much easier to custom set it on my phone i love this and the wife and i have joked that we need more to cook more things at once  but until then it s nothing the warm setting on the oven hasn t solved while i cook more items get one  get two you won t be sorry      
220,3.0,                       the air fryer works well and is taking some time to get used to new cooking times  the rule of thumb of reducing temperature by    degrees and cooking time by    percent does not appear to hold true for this item  i have also found that with only a basket and no additional racks  the space for cooking is limited  i did buy other racks to put into the air fryer but the heat is distributed unevenly with the additional rack and again cooking times and temperatures need to be adjusted  also can only add one additional rack  when i bought i thought a larger size unit would allow for more items to be cooked at once  not the case      
221,4.0,                       i ordered this sept          and received it today  sept   th        i was excited to use it and had the food ready  i preheated it and after   mins  it said e   i called the company and they said its defective     since i just had major surgery  i can not repack it  i called the company and they emailed me information which i sent the information they wanted  i will edit my review when i get a new unit  i tried   times to use the unit and e  kept coming up which is open circuit temperature monitor issue  i am now waiting for a new replacement  such a disappointment since i saw a lot of good reviews for this update           i received a new unit but wanted to wait a few weeks to see how it works  no problems so far  and it works well  i like how it cooks food  i was told that smoke that comes out from the bottom is normal when cooking certain foods like chicken or wings   easy to clean baskets in dishwasher   i look forward to using this product      
222,5.0,                       for the first time we cooked a chicken        pounds   not   piece of dry meat whats good about it is the leftover chicken we will just put it back in and reheat it   i spent at least a week going thru all the reviews and must say it helped alot   i just can t believe it took me so long to get one but i couldn t be happier  now to get my son one   widower with   school age kids  he could get home from work and in   hour have a delicious meal      
223,4.0,                       excellent customer service  basket issue was covered under warranty update  after about a month one of the screws fell out into my food  it stayed tight after screwing it back i m but glad i saw it first   then after about   months it had trouble knowing the basket was closed  if i press down on the handle it turns on but then the basket is tilted out of the dryer  as soon as i let go it turns off original   star  does so much more than appetizers  perfectly cooks chicken  pork  potatoes  anything that you could bake or deep fry  fried chicken in the airfryer is way  better than kfc  reduces prep and cook time with no oil splatter  and an easy to clean basket  dishwasher safe   works well with alexa and the app is handy if you leave the room  very much recommend     
224,5.0,                       i have had this air fryer for   months and use it at least   times a week  i do everything in it  chicken  steak  hambergers  sausage  you name it i use my air fryer  it cooks so fast and clean up is a breeze  when cooking fatty things place a piece of bread between  the baskets this assets to absorb grease  doing this not only gets  the grease but there will be no smoking  the taste with steaks is so good so after   months i noticed that plastic on the outside cover was breaking off and had cracked  no problem i contacted cosori and they sent me a new one  great customer service  i would give it more stars but no way to do that   if you do buy this brand rest assured that cosori has a one year warranty and they do honor it       
225,4.0,                          and it s pretty incredible    minutes or less to pre heat versus my oven that takes    minutes  talk about pizza rolls when needed  i have a large range of foods i ve tried that are better in the oven  some are better in the microwave  and now some foods are better in the air fryer  leftovers are a freaking breeze  just go to the freezer aisle  pick out some random quick meals  like egg rolls  corn dogs  something easy a    year old boy would eat  and i promise the air fryer will not let you down  stick to the oven for meats   the air fryer does seem to dry out more than i d like probably my only complaint about this is the basket itself   the main basket has the handle so even though i m comfortable sticking the metal extras in the dishwasher  the main basket gets pretty gross  it s hard to clean in my opinion because of all the ridges   sponges will be ripped apart  i would definitely recommend purchasing separate dishwasher safe accessories if you re super lazy like me and hate handwashing      
226,5.0,                       as others have reported  mine arrived with a non functioning control panel   everything works fine through the app  this seems to be a recurring issue based on recent reviews   my guess is they ve had a bad batch of hardware as this is an otherwise highly rated product   awaiting a response from cosori support as i type update  support were very responsive and acknowledged the issue   they are sending me a replacement from a new batch once they are available   they also seem genuinely interested in tracing all the bad items and asked for a photo of the etched batch number on the bottom of the unit upgrading to   stars for now   once i get the replacement and verify it works i ll review my rating again update  my replacement arrived very quickly and i m happy to report this unit is fully functional      
227,5.0,                       love this thing   cooking is actually fun again    no more sticking my hands in a hot oven or getting burned by splattering grease on the stovetop   the steaks come out juicy and tender on the inside  as they should  yet they are still cooked properly   and don t even get me started on the fantastic french fries   i even cooked a whole chicken breast in there yesterday   while it just fit in the basket diagonally  i did have to perform a little surgery on the sternum as the basket was not quite deep enough  but it was worth the effort   i have had this air fryer for only a week and a half  but am using it daily to experiment with   as for those complaints about these baskets falling apart easily  i am checking each time i use it to make sure both parts are latched together properly before lifting them  and being careful to not touch the release button  which has a built in safety cover  until i have set the unit down   it seems to be very well built and cleans easily   cosori even provides a customer support phone number  which is rare these days  and they are also offering an extra year warranty for free  if the form they provide is sent in within two weeks of purchase  which i did   all the directions are clear and easily understandable  and the recipe book is quite handy for learning of the possibilities   plus  the machine offers suggested temperatures and cook times on its dashboard  all of which can easily be overridden by any preferred changes   all in all  i am completely satisfied    no  change that to  elated   by this product   if anything changes  i will update this review      
228,3.0,                       although i researched and this came up as one of the better air fryers  i m disappointed with my purchase  biggest qualm is that anything you cook ends up tasting like the smell of the fryer  what i mean by that is  the plastics and material it s constructed from can be smelt and tasted the first time you use  thought that would go away but a month later and all our food still taste like the fryer  wish i could return but we are past our    day return policy      
229,5.0,                       i just recieved my corsori air fryer and i m so excited  it is so large  so much cooking space  came with excellent instruction book and a wonderful cookbook  i m going to have some fun with this i can tell  update    oh my word love this air fryer  love the size and the safety feature from the basket falling out because of hitting release by mistake  i do find it cooks much faster then my old one but that is great   i researched alot of them before buying this one  absolutely   no regrets       
230,4.0,                       this is my second air fryer  my first one i inherited from my parents who love to buy all the gadgets but almost never actually use them i absolutely love it  but one thing drives me insane  the controls  instead of having individual buttons which adjust temperature and time  you have to select the temperature and then use the same   or   to adjust it up or down  then you select time and use the same buttons  it would be much easier to have them separate  also the power button could just as easily serve as the button to turn it on  i can t tell you how many times i have adjusted the time and temperature only to turn it off on accident  it takes a lot of brain power not to  it might be because it is my second and my first had better controls that said  this one is a superior cooker  it is superior at cleaning  it is absolutely beautiful to look at  i love the square basket  the handle and attachment mechanism is much better designed but i must say  if cosori updated the controls  i d buy a new one and pass this onto someone else  it s that annoying      
231,4.0,                       i m not a great cook  but the air fryer is pretty fool proof  there are a few things that catch me off guard when i use it though    the temperature only goes up in intervals of     so if directions tell you to cook at     you have to either go     or     and adjust cooking times  not a huge deal  but still a little off putting if you aren t cooking savvy    cleaning the product is kind of weird  i m very careful about keeping things clean  and this airflow fryer tests me each time  there are these little air hole vents on the part you pull out  whenever i soak the basket to make sure i can get everything off while damaging the basket coating as little as possible  when i go to clean the basket and drawer  little food particulates end up stuck inside  it takes a lot of poking and prodding to get everything out  there are screws holding everything in place  so in theory you could take it apart to clean  but who wants to take something apart each clean aside from that the air fryer itself works wonders  i ve made a couple of chicken dishes that turned out wonderful  crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside  pre made things are good too  like store bought sweet potato fries from trader joe s  i received this as a gift  but i would have little hesitation buying it for myself again      
232,1.0,                       bought this because the wife had been wanting an air fryer and this was the deal of the day during prime day  figured that because of a ll the great reviews there wouldn t be a problem and it would work great  it burned and dried out eveything we tried cooking in it  followed the directions and the receipes exactly and it burned and dried out all the food prepared in it  waste of monmey and food  highly disappointed and returning it immediately  screw the whole healthy thing  at least my fry daddy doesn t burn and dry out the food      
233,1.0,                       beware  i received the smart air fryer two days ago and every single time i used it  smoke comes out from the sides and smells like burning plastic i reached out to cosori customer service through email because you can t get ahold of them through the phone and sent them a video of the problem  they have an automated message reply to me  i replied and the same exact automated message would reply back  this is ridiculous i do not want my kitchen to catch fire horrible customer service  beware of this fire hazard     
234,5.0,                       easy to use  wish it had quick time buttons in addition to the convenient food buttons  i made a rack from stainless steel grid  amazon     see photo  mesh       cm x    cm  must cut down and bend  for tortillas etc  we love it        btw this is not a star trek food replicator  it uses a heating element and a fan to cook food fast which produces moist hot air and sometimes steam depending on what you re cooking  the steam has to go somewhere  i haven t had much dripping or pooling under this unit but when compared to my grease fryer this is easy to clean  if you find an air fryer that doesn t release moist hot air  steam   it s either not plugged in or is secretly a star trek food replicator       ps  please post link if u find a replicator      
235,5.0,                       this is our first air fryer and it was purchased as a christmas gift  it is incredibly simple to clean and the design and look of the air fryer is very sleek and fit in with our kitchen very well  i found using it to be very simple and the preset buttons seemed to work great after a few weeks of use the fan in the air fryer stopped turning on essentially turning this thing into a big toaster  i contacted cosori about the issue and within    hours they got back to me and after a few photos and videos for troubleshooting i received notice that a new air fryer was being sent to my house from the company  we received our new replacement air fryer in a few days and so far it is working great  it was nice to have a company so quickly respond and rectify the situation      
236,5.0,                       amazon replaced the air fryer and the new one works  this is the best invention since the microwave    we use it at least   times a week for corn on the cob and carrots   it makes egg rolls taste even better since there is no grease       half the buttons did not work  the preheat button would not turn blue   everytime we opened the drawer the fryer turned off  i purchased this because of the great reviews but i am extremely disappointed   i will be returning this product           
237,1.0,                       loved it at first  yay air fryer  super convenient  pretty much used it instead of the oven for about   weeks  then one day while cooking some chicken      degrees for    minutes  pulled the sliding hopper out and the entire thing fell off the handle  luckily didn t burn myself as i freaked myself out and then upon examining the basket and all    the screws heated up so much so that they melted through  nasty messy  refunding it  because the manufacturer wants to try and  troubleshoot  yeah  let s troubleshoot plastic melting and the thing self destructing      
238,5.0,                       i love my air fryer  it cooks most things in about        less time than a conventional oven  it basically is a mini convection oven but it is extremely  efficient and leaves your food crispy but not over cooked  i ve made multiple potato recipes that come out great  a mid size potato takes maybe    minutes to bake through  and chicken comes out great  cooked fully but not dried out at all  i also love cooking vegetables in this thing  a tiny spray of oil and a shake half way through and that s it  the fryer is large so you can fit a fair amount of food at a time in it  it has a release button that is covered by a plastic slide so you don t accidentally release it while it s hot lol which i thought was a nice touch  it does not make your kitchen hot like an oven  it s fairly quiet and fits on a countertop  i find myself rarely using my regular oven unless it s a larger item i can t fit in my air fryer  plus you can find literally thousands of recipes online important  make sure to read instructions fully and run the air fryer on preheat before using  you might notice a smell that will potentially transfer to your food  i ran mine twice and the smell went away  i ve read reviews where people say their food tasted like burnt plastic and that s because they did not do this step      
239,5.0,                       i resisted buying an air fryer for a couple of years because i really didn t want another kitchen gadget that was just going to collect dust after a week of use  well  no worries there  i use it at least once a day now  sometimes twice a day  the basket is super easy to clean and i find no need to put it in the dishwasher  even though they say you can  i never used to understand the big deal about wings  but decided to make some for my husband and son   holy cow  wings are great in this  the skin is crispy and the chicken is juicy  i love making cubed butternut squash as well as potatoes   both white and sweet  asparagus is perfect  i like that the cosori has a square basket and allows you to fit more in than a round basket  the presets are great and easy to use  overall   i couldn t be happier with my purchase      
240,5.0,                       i am glad i got this air fryer from cosori  at first i was hesitant to get it because i didn t know the brand and i never owned any products from cosori  the customer reviews convinced me to get it and i am happy i did  i love everything about it  the size  the square basket  very spacious inside  it s smart  well made and doesn t feel cheap  it is a good product  it cooks food thorougly and even  i have been using this baby everyday ever since i got it  i think this is even better than the panasonic air fryer plus that one is over priced anyway  i realized that cosori makes good products  i hope this brand company will last forever and will be known and popular like kitchenaid  cuisineart  etc  i just ordered my  nd cosori product  which is their pressure cooker  i am excited and i can t wait to get it      
241,5.0,                       so i bought this air fryer at the recommendation of my sister who lives in london  she swears by it   i followed all the inst etc but noticed i had to push the buttons a couple of times before it would register and work  when it did it was amazing  food tasted good  chicken was moist  fish was good  fries  omg anyway you get the picture  of course i had to show my sister on facetime  she was the one who told me there was something wrong  and that the buttons should be more responsive  i called customer service  they were brilliant  very accommodating  and shipped me a new one within two days  great product  great customer service      
242,1.0,                       i was very excited about this purchase  after approximately   uses it began to smoke  of course it was   day after the return window          
243,5.0,                       i like the design  it looks so beautiful on my countertop  the basket is big enough for a medium size chicken so there is plenty of space  a recipe book also comes with the package which saves me lots of time  there are   cooking modes and a preheat setting and i can control the machine through the app  which enables me to plan for meals      
244,5.0,                       amazing top tier air frier  price is worth it as i bought a cheaper brand on here that was a nightmare to clean  i eventually tossed the old one and got this cooks everything from freezer food to bread baked goods  now gets more use than my oven  cheese  grease nothing sticks to this air fryer  i handwash and have no issues easily getting anything stuck to the basket off with a normal plastic brush scrubber in a couple mins  i don t think it s dishwasher safe but don t know for sure as i have never needed to do that  no more baking soda vinegar scrub downs for hrs that barely get my fryer clean  tons of settings and a wifi mode  not that i use that very much   boyfriend and a couple family members have bought them  highly recommend corsiar brand  they have been what i was looking for for years      
245,5.0,                       ok air fryer ladies and gent  i am actually doing this review over as i have not had this product for about   months  this review will over this unit and the nuwave air fryer just in case you were thinking of getting it  i had that one for about a year and a half first the nuwave  it cooks very well  you get accurate cooking times and does a nice job of getting items crisp  however  there are a few major cons  the first and in my opinion a deal breaker for me  the basket  the basket not only breaks all the time meaning when you go to close the door it will not it has issues closing  there are times i must let the unit cool then it will finally close  not the greatest when you have to open it to shake the items but then can t close it for an hour  the company would not help at all they said buy a new basket  lol  the  nd is cleaning it  let us just assume the door had no issues  cleaning it is a nightmare  any sponge will either get stuck in the grooves or just not clean well  you can put in the dish washer but who wants to do that after each time  result do not buy thiscosori       cooks a little longer than the nuwave but by a few min  honestly  once you get used to the timings it s a breeze  cleaning  omg so easy i use this   or   times a week its that easy to clean  less than   min to clean  my honest opinion  best air fryer ever  i will say this  chicken wings on the nuwave comes out a tad better but it s just not worth the hassle  trust me      
246,5.0,                       it looks very fancy  coming with user manual and recipes  very thoughtful and friendly for a beginner user  good for     ppl  it s my first step towards a healthier lifestyle  remember to remove the plastic and paperboard inside before use  can t wait to have my first meal cooked by it      
247,5.0,                       i was pretty skeptical about buying an air fryer   when they first came out i laughed and thought they would be a novelty for a year and then folks would move on   it s been a few years and i decided to pull the trigger   lots of research and i landed on the cosori   this thing is big and holds a lot   everything i have made so far has been great   broccoli  salmon  burgers  chicken   you name it   i really love cooking salmon in this thing   turns out perfect every single time  and i avoid heating up the house using the oven   it s less shiny plastic looking if you want to leave it out on the counter   pretty easy to clean as well   this thing is a game changer  kicking myself for not buying it sooner      
248,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          we bought the cosori air fryer this year        in march  we use it about     times a month  today november    after trying to make some tots it would not stay shut thus making it inoperable  the lock latch function is poorly engineered and i m afraid to force it or hold it shut     
249,5.0,                       literally has changed the way i we eat  i eat steaks at home now     ribeyes from the grocery store  that tastes great  way different than the bland taste from the oven  hard to explain why  but there is a big difference  plus  we do the frozen kroger burgers and they re great as well  no after taste  and just basic burger tastes as it should  but putting the bun on top for the last    seconds or so makes the difference as well  kind of crispy  warm bun with mayo  lettuce  etc and it s a thousand times cleaner and easier to make than the skillet  where grease goes everywhere  plus the waste of time it takes on stove  as they all say  the fries are different than when in oven  way better  the wya they taste at the restaurant  but better this from a live long drive thru and take out person  we ve literally eaten more  and way better  and cheaper  at home in past month than ever  it s easy to give up       minutes to make a meal  vs the stove or oven where it takes prep  hour or whatever  then cleanup  not happening with me  never use my oven  mainly because after all that work it never tasted good  eveyrthing they say is true  it tastes different  and is really quick  frozen burgers and crinkle fries together at once  in    minutes   you re eating  and crinkle fries tastes the way crinkle fries in deep fryer tastes  but no grease  i don t even use the spray or anything  they still taste great to me      
250,5.0,                       waited way too long to finally invest in an air fryer  did tons of research which eventually led me to this baby  perfecto  reasonable footprint  quiet  simple to operate  quick to clean  and mostest bestest part  the air fried foods are in sane  p s  i ordered the version w the app although the assumed it was unnecessary  so glad i did  we use the app most of the time we air fry      
251,5.0,                       i didn t think i was going to be a big fan of air fryer until this product changed my opinion   i thought air fryers are just for fried chicken  but actually  this item can be used to cook all kinds of food   no matter it s steak  fish  wings  or even veggies   just put it in and let it be   it will become ready in minutes   the cooked food tastes pretty similar to actual grilled food  but the clean up is much easier than a grill  and also air frying is much healthier than grilling   attached photo is air fried sea bass   i use this item all the time now  recommend      
252,1.0,                       cleaned  plugged in  prepared to use  turned on to see that   buttons are broken including the preheat and temp time buttons  only a few of the preset buttons are working  i ve seen other reviews about how their first fryers arrived defective until they contacted customer support and got sent a new one  it should arrive working the first time  i will update after i contact them update it arrived in original packaging and taped up  similar to the first  buttons work fine  however  the bottom of the air fryer does not completely push in or close  letting steam out the front  i ve included pictures showing steam being released  if i push the handle in and hold it  the gap closes and steam is released from the back like it should  i believe it is a problem with the latch  the review will remain   star until i get one with no defects update   i decided to keep it for a few days to test and see if the gap at bottom of the air fryer that was releasing steam would affect the product  to my dismay  in the middle of cooking chicken strips  the air fryer basket dislodged and shot across my counter  almost scattering my food around the kitchen  i looked in horror as the hot basket lay on my newly refurbished counter before quickly grabbing it and placing it on a heat resistant surface  wondering how  had i not been there watching intently  the damage could have been catastrophic  i am furious and i believe that receiving a faulty product twice  with the second one almost causing damage to my property and food  is not acceptable  do not buy this product      
253,3.0,                       so this is the second one i had to order because the first one was defective  only   of the buttons worked  i had to order a second one which incidentally cost me     more than the original one i bought  called to ask why there was a price difference and could it be matched since the fact that the one i ordered did not work so i was not at fault and shouldn t have to pay more to replace the defective one only to be told the original  was cheaper because amazon sold me a used previously returned one without any mention of the fact that it was either used or previously returned  i absolutely would not have bought used cookware   and would have been right to not do so because it did not work  had i not called to find out why there was such a price difference between the new one and old one when they are both sold by the same seller  which happens to be amazon    or had it worked   i would not have even known they sold me a used     itemsupremely annoyed it s only the first day with the replacement but so far all the buttons work   hopefully it continues to do soupdating the new air fryer works wonderfully  if i didn t have to go through hoops to get a working one   and the customer service  of amazon  had been better i would have given it a   star     
254,1.0,                       i m not happy with the results  it burns your food  the cookbook is pointless  just a beautiful pictures and nothing more  regular oven the best  this one is bad  i don t recommend to but      
255,5.0,                       easy to clean use cook everything really saves timeam a phd student who loves to cook but unfortunately i don t have enough time to practice my cooking hobby but with cosori airfryer the recipes that used to take an hour or more in the oven just take half of the time and with yummmmmi and healthy results i ve attached some of my dishes that i used cosori to prepare them also i bought the accessories of the machine gonna use the skewers to go some kabab can t wait thaaank you    for this smarty invention and cost effective machine       
256,5.0,                       this cosori was purchased as a gift   i own one exactly like it   i have had it for about a year and haven t used my oven for a long time   i have been able to enjoy fried chicken without the mess of cooking it or the guilt of eating it   it is excellent for frozen potatoes as it is fast and makes them crispy like they were deep fried but not grease   fish is tasty and moist   i really haven t found anything that doesn t cook easier and taste better in any other way  crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside   i highly recommend this fryer as it is efficient and easy to use   cleaning is a breeze   when i dish up i fill it with hot soapy water and by the time i ve finished eating it requires a swish and it is clean   so happy i purchased it      
257,4.0,                       ease of use   well  i had to train myself to not press the power button again  which is very easy to do thinking that it is how you would start the machine  no  you need to press the button once to turn the machine on  and then press  play  button above  at first  my hand will automatically turn the machine off instead of starting the air fryer cycle   functionality wise  it is very good  have no complaint so far one thing i have noticed wit the drawer latch   drawer is secured by a little knob at the bottom which will find its place when you push it in  over time  this will wear off and the drawer will not fit   and the air fryer will not turn on without it closed all the way  called cosori and they sent me a replacement   which did not yet develop same issue looking at the design though  that plastic knob looks like it will eventually wear off and will cause same issue      
258,4.0,                       i have used this air fryer at least once a day since purchasing  my family loves the grilled cheese  fried potatoes  crispy chicken  french fries  donuts  and onion rings  we are a family of   and it is often difficult to make enough meat at one time with even cooking  it is difficult to clean properly and get all of the oil out of the slats in the basket  i have used the dishwasher but was not satisfied with how clean it got  i will continue to hand clean after soaking in hot soapy water we are very impressed with the flavor and moistness of the food we cook  i would love a rack for   layers of cooking and a better way to clean but overall love this product     
259,5.0,                       i love my air fryer   i ve only had it a couple of weeks but i ve already made so many things     air fried apple pies  roasted vegetables  chicken tender     i m currently cooking my second rotisserie chicken in it   i ve never done roasted vegetables in the middle of the week    thats usually a weekend thing due to time   but with my air fryer i can dice up some potato s  carrots   anything    and put in my air fryer with a few spritzes of olive oil and some kosher salt for about    min and bam   i throw my sons popcorn chicken and fries in there together for about    min and bam  i love it   i m soooo glad i bit the bullet and ordered it  i honestly was worried thinking i d never use it but i ve used it more in the last   weeks than i ve used my oven in the last month   a great purchase     
260,5.0,                       i habe been using the cosori for a couple of weeks now and it was worth ever penny   great size  which was a must for me   so far i have made fries  frozen   many chicken thighs and many  many chicken wings   the chicken thighs are so good  i find myself now craving them   i spray them with a little oil  season with italian seasoning  salt and pepper  cook at     for about       mins and they come out delicious   skin gets as crispy as frying and juicy meat         mins is decent speed for cooking bone in thighs thoroughly   today i reheated wings i made yesterday and they were as crispy and juicy as fresh   this is my first air fryer  so i have a sample size of      but it is really hard for me to imagine other air fryers performing much better than this   clean up is a breeze  like most things  if you get to it when it s still hot   use pre heat feature before cleaning if you want to put it off until after dinner      
261,4.0,                       overall i love this air fryer  i use it almost every single day   it s so easy and fast to use compared to the oven  and it really makes food crisp   i would ve given it   stars  except for   things   the way the tray pulls out is a little clunky  you have to yank it out  it s not as smooth as it could be   and if you tip it down the oil drips out the bottom of the drawer onto the counter which seems like is a fail somehow   i had a smaller one before and i loved it but it wasn t big enough to make food more than   person so i upgraded to this one  but that one did not have these issues   i would still not trade it in for another one because the overall cooking is great and looks very nice on the counter   i use it to  re heat re fry  fried chicken and it comes out better than when you first pick it up from the store  not to mention healthier because the oil drips out of it and it s less greasy   i also love cooking artichokes in it  ready in    minutes  and i ve never known how easy it can be   air frying raw chicken breasts  not frozen  takes about       minutes and i ve fit   huge size breasts in it to cook together  no oil needed  skin is crisp and meat is super juicy   fresh fries with just spray oil and salt  ready in    mins   brussel sprouts    mins   crisp turkey bacon and hash browns for breakfast    mins   this white one also comes with extra tray and metal skewers so you can make your own meat or veggie skewers   everyone i ve cooked for here is pleasantly surprised how well the food comes out and wants their own  so highly recommended   the drawer is dishwasher safe so very easy to clean one reminder is that it does put out a lot of heat  so you have to pull it away from your backsplash and other appliances when it s cooking      
262,2.0,                       if you can t tolerate the smell of burnt plastic metal all over your house then don t buy it  the smell well make you want to gag  i check everything and took the thing apart the best i could to find the cause of the burnt smell but i didn t find anything  i concluded maybe it is the coil itself  anyway i leave it out in the patio and i cook outside too  the good part is the food does not absorb the burnt plastic metal smell  the latch on the pan basket need a better design  sometime it feel like i am going to break it wen trying to putting it back to the fryer update         okay the metal plastic smell been gone for months now   maybe it is when  fan blow the hot air thru the vent it also heated up whatever it was      
263,5.0,                       i m very happy with this air fryer  i dragged my heels on buying one because i m always buying kitchen gadgets and then never using them  i researched different styles and sizes watching youtube videos and came up with this  i m glad i got the    qt  it s just my husband and i and the smaller size would have been to small for us as i m cooking meals in it  i love how i can make a full meal in it  the pic i ve included in this review i used a precooked chicken sausage sliced up  green beans  red peppers and red onions  put in a bowl and i sprayed with olive oil spray  then added salt  pepper and garlic powder and mixed it all together and dumped into the air fryer basket  set at     for    minutes and shake every   minutes or so  i put in all on some fettuccine but rice works too  i also do this with shrimp or chicken strips and vary my seasonings  the only thing i ve noticed is this is very powerful so i have to watch my cooking times and temps since i m still learning  when done i put some soap and hot water to soak anything stuck for a few minutes  i put the basket part in the top rack of my dishwasher  so easy to clean      
264,4.0,                       there is so much more we can do in our kitchen now that we have this air fryer  bacon without the fuss and muss     yep  fish and chips  check  more than decent dries  check   although nothing beats proper homemade traditional fries     crispy fish for fish tacos  darn right   relatively easy to use and super easy to clean  the wifi thing is a bit of a gimmick but the recipes are nice and useful  the plastic on our drawer is coming off a little   not affecting usability but reminding you this is a sub      appliance made in china  the button are a little cheesy too   not a big deal  just don t think you ll pass this on to the next generation  overall a fun and useful addition to our kitchen  oh try the bacon wrapped cream cheese stuffed jalape o peppers      
265,5.0,                       i ve been wanting an air fryer for some time but have never found one that had good reviews and a good price   i took a chance with this when it came up for a sale price on the amazon treasure truck  and i m glad i did this doesn t take up a lot of space on the counter   it s square so you can fit more food into the pan too   the digital controls on the front basically make this thing idiot proof  but a fair warning  the times on these settings will overcook your food   i usually start with their setting and back down on the time and temp settings until i get it just the way i like it   you can prepare an entire dinner right inside the basket   it comes with a cookbook to get you started too clean up is easy   just put it in the sink and fill it with warm dish soap water and let it sit while you have dinner   then just wipe it out and it s done this is great for the busy life that we all lead these days   it makes eating a healthy  home cooked meal quicker than running out and getting fast food i am definitely a fan of this unit       
266,5.0,                       update  december        cosari reached out to me because of this review and after an email exchange they refunded me what i paid for the unit as an amazon gift card because it was under warranty  actually they offered me the choice of a refund or to put me on the list to send me a replacement as soon as they had new stock  excellent customer service  i then bought the exact same model again  found another one on amazon  and my new one does not have the issues with the freezing buttons i wrote about in my previous review  so in short i am very happy and am enjoying using the air fryer both through the control panel and the app  and alexa               original review                this one was a replacement for one that was a little bit bigger and would not fit where i wanted to stored it and it cooks just as  very  well  i do enjoy playing with the wifi app control but would be the first to admit that it is a bit of a toy what is not good and the only reason i am giving it   stars instead of   is that the buttons are not easy to push and register input  there often seems to be a short lag where it seems like the device is frozen taking the button input  this is pretty annoying as i often have to push a button multiple times to get it to register  even more so when you are changing time temp so need multiple pushes to register  so i generally prefer to use the phone app to kick it off and adjust it  it is possible that mine is just a hardware dud where the senors for the buttons are misaligned with the buttons display  but that does not explain the input freeze behavior i am experiencing  my girlfriend hates using it and wanted me to return it      
267,5.0,                       this is the most revolutionary product i have every bought for the kitchen  i use it almost every day  chicken thighs come out like they are off the grill  they are perfectly cooked  i made amazing catfish with just creole seasoning and a couple sprays of olive oil  i really like making tortilla chips out of small corn tortillas  i have really nailed that one down i m also glad i got the wifi version  at the same price as the non wifi it really is a no brainer  what i like about this feature is you can watch how much time is left on your phone in case you need to shake the basket  you can also select one of the recipes on the app and hit start cooking and it will do the rest very easy to clean and doesn t take up as much space as i thought it would  i m also glad i got a larger basket  it can hold a whole chicken and   chicken thighs without them touching      
268,5.0,                       this remarkable new air fryer is a must for every household   if you love the crunch of fried foods  or the ease of cooking your favorite meal  this cosori air fryer is for you  crispy food without all the grease or calories  it come packed with great tasting recipes in their booklet and the ease of operation makes it something you ll use almost daily  once you try the  fried chicken  or the coconut shrimp  you ll be hooked  plus there s a support page on facebook where everyone shares their own recipes  pictures and answers question  newbies  might have  you ll have so much fun using your new cosori air fryer  you ll wonder why you haven t tried it sooner  bon appetite       
269,5.0,                       bought this on prime day not knowing what an air fryer was but just knowing everyone and their mother has one and swears by them  after reading review after review saying  just buy it  i was convinced i needed one in my life  my husband and i have literally cooked in it every single day since purchasing  the first thing i cooked was chopped up potatoes and my mind was blown when they were perfect in    minutes  ever since  we ve cooked everything from steaks to chicken to veggies to mini pizzas to breakfast sandwiches  it truly is a life changing thing to come home for lunch and just dump some stuff in the basket and have it ready in       minutes and still have time to enjoy a lunch break for once i also really like the pre set options  i noticed other hair dryers just have temp dials and idk how people who aren t familiar with air fryers would figure that out so it s nice to be able to just push a button and let  er go  the drawer is a little tough to get out at first until you get used to it  and the product photo is a little misleading and makes the screen look more high tech than it is  i posted photos of he actual screen as well as a size comparison photo to my standard stand mixer  we also really are happy with the recipe book it came with  so i have to join the others with saying  just buy it       
270,5.0,                       this is my  nd air fryer  loved the concept but hated that my old powerxl was small   hard to clean   and had a round basket  after knowing what i did want i found this  excellent product  have used non stop since i received it after t giving       easy to clean  lots of menu selections almost too many  trial and error  square basket tho  genius  made         pound burgers at the same time and were better than grilled and not messy like pan fried  highly recommend     
271,2.0,                        edit  cosori customer service sent out a replacement basket to replace it without hassle  that bumped my star rating to    original content a screw fell out from the basket handle and into the food that was being cooked without us noticing   only by sheer luck did my kid notice it before he bit down   when i inspected the basket   it was a screw that held the handle to it and it looks like whatever the screw screwed into failed as well because there s nothing there anymore   i was not able to locate the  nut  that held it in place   i m filing a report with the cpsc about this seriously  it s a very dangerous malfunction edit      found the nut  thank god      
272,5.0,                       i had never had an air fryer and with all the reviews on facebook i thought i would try this one  it has definitely been a learning curve as far as time to cook certain items  but having said that it is very convenient does not take up much space on my counter and the food in general is quite tasty after being cooked in this  i am retired and there are just two of us here so the size is perfect  i would say that if you have a larger family that this might not be the one you re looking for  i don t know if they make one bigger but they do stand by their product and even if you have a large family you could use it for things like french fries side dishes hamburgers that sort of thing      
273,2.0,                       i recently got the air fryer and was excited to try it out  i ve made chicken wings in it twice  my concern was that the chicken has a very distinct taste  that i m sure came from the fryer  i washed it before using it and removed all the plastics  but i was totally creeped out by it  i recently tried it again and left some for my wife without mentioning the taste issue to her to see what she said and she had made a similar comment without being prompted  soooooooo i m probably going to return if for a different brand on the positive side  it was super easy to use and clean      
274,5.0,                       i love my     qt cosori air fryer   i use it for almost all my meals and was saddened when the top screw fell out of the removable basket   so i contacted cosori  they immediately responded asking for some additional information and sent me a replacement basket   unfortunately  the basket didn t fit properly  so i emailed them again and immediately adriana sent me an email telling me that they are sending me another replacement basket  that s customer service   i forgot to hit the submit button  so now i m adding a second experience with them   my unit was purchased on october           and the experience about the lost screw occurred in june of        now i m experiencing the air fryer turning off suddenly  and when i close the basket  it continues cooking for the remaining time   i wrote cosori thinking that since it s more than a year old  nothing would happen  but instead after sending them proof of purchase and an id number  elijah wrote back and said they are sending me a replacement unit   i love my air fryer and  use it all the time   i don t know if i ll have to check to see if i need to tighen the screws that hold the air fryer handle  to the basket  but perhaps they have fixed the issue   in any case  kudos to corsori customer service      
275,5.0,                       i never thought i d want an air fryer after buying an instapot and never using it more than   times before reselling it  that being said  this air fryer life is addicting  holy cow  my husband keeps volunteering to cook with it too  which he normally never cooked unless it involved a pot of water  he even wants to but a second one and we haven t even owned it for   weeks  so we can cook the main meal and a side at the same time  i researched air fryers for a couple months on all different sites and am so happy i chose this one  i was a little unsure because i hadn t heard of the cosori brand before this bur the reviews were right  this one is awesome      
276,5.0,                       i chose this air fryer based on my neighbor s positive experience with hers  and i am very pleased with my purchase  my initial frustration was similar to most users  which was the difficulty in getting the touch screen to respond  it took a handful of tries  but now i never have a problem with the buttons because i learned that the touchscreen only requires a light touch  most people  myself included  mash buttons on their electronics and this cosori air fryer does not like that  i use my air fryer everyday instead of the oven and get excellent  sometimes even better results  roasted potatoes and roasted brussel sprouts are way better in the air fryer  compared to my oven  i used the suggested settings in the included cosori recipe booklet and they come out perfect every time  for cubed  marinated baked tofu  i use the  shrimp  setting and they are a favorite at our house now  however  i prefer to use airfryercalculator com to manually adjust temperature and time for frozen foods i cook in this air fryer as i found the cosori presets made the food a bit too fried crunchy browned  i usually pick a preset on the air fryer that is closest to the temperature that i want to use and then adjust according to the online calculator  don t forget to flip or shake your food half way through cooking  i also love the  keep warm  setting to keep my foods hot and crispy  instead of taking it out and making things soggy  while i finish up the rest of my meal on the stove  cleaning is very straightforward  and i would also recommend checking the inside heating coil for any food particles that may have blown around during previous cooking to prevent creating a burning smell  i also suggest lining the drawer with aluminum foil before snapping the fryer basket inside to make clean ups even easier  this air fryer is great for the price point and i would certainly recommend this to the rest of my friends  and you too if you ve read this far        
277,1.0,                       i received my air fryer            i loved the product until yesterday when before i preheated it  i opened the drawer as i always do to make sure its clean and ready to go  it looked great  then after it was preheated i opened the drawer to put the porkchops in there was a screw laying in the basket  i removed the screw and cooked my food anyways  after i was done cooking and the air fryer was cooled i went to clean it and there was another screw laying in the basket   it looks like it may be just from the handle but still this is ridiculous    not happy       
278,5.0,                       okay  i m very new to air fryers but have wanted one for some time  finally got one as a gift from my boo  after checking out a video on youtube  i decided to buy the one the lady in the video was using to air fry fish  well one night  i decided to fry some fish in that bad boy and it was wonderful  the fish came out delicious and not at all greasy  the boo loved it  i loved it  we loved it  you will love it  the cosori air fryer is also very easy to clean and the baskets are a pretty good size  i put   large pieces of tilapia in there   i am thrilled i can fry food without worrying about the sound of my arteries clogging and make healthy meals for dinner  i m in air fryer love     happy birthday to me     thank you baby for the gift  i looveee you         
279,5.0,                       i d heard about air fryers for a while but had never really looked into them before  i always found them to be synonymous with infomercials and didn t really think they could be very useful  then my wife started talking about how d she d been seeing her favorite food bloggers using them and how she thought she might like one i ended up getting this cosori for her b day and it s now her favorite kitchen appliance and mine  we eat a lot of chicken and the air fryer makes the best  fried  chicken i ve had and it s so incredibly simple  we typically add nothing but a little salt and press the chicken button and that s it  we ve made it for multiple friends and family members and have gotten raving reviews as well  we ve also done sweet potato fries  fresh broccoli  cauliflower  eggplant  and a few other veggies  we even tried making some cookies in it we ve transported it on multiple occasions as well  bumping it into things here and there and it s held up incredibly well besides the couple scuffs and scratches  the cleanup is incredible btw  so simple and quick  the nonstick surfaces on the tray make it super easy to quickly scrub and wipe down  one last thing i ll say is that i m glad we didn t go any smaller than this  it does take up a good chunk of counter space but it s nice being able to do enough in one batch to feed the   of us and then have some leftovers as well      
280,1.0,                       touch control panel was defective   strong plastic chemical smell even after running thru dishwasher and wiping      
281,5.0,                       i reluctantly bought this device because my wife insisted she wanted one  researched showed me this was a good mid size unit and it had some great features   like alexa integration  we got it  and i believe we have used it every day in one capacity or another  the normal stuff you would expect   like frying   works well  we found some frozen breaded shrimp that are good  some healthy frozen egg rolls  etc  we never take home left over french fries from a restaurant  but this will perk them  and onion rings  back up to their original flavor  we baked salmon in this device to perfection  preheat    minutes  let it set for   after cooking   and perfection  reheating bread is amazing  we have a nice italian restaurant that we will carry out from occasionally  but by the time we get home with the meal  the warm wrapped bread is soggy and yucky  preheat the air fryer for   minutes to      cook for about   minutes  and it is just like it came fresh out of the over i m a believer          
282,3.0,                       first off let me say this was the first air fryer i owned  it works as you would expect and i did get a lot of cooking out of it over the year and a half but unfortunately that s no more  i went to pull out the tray after it was pre heated   out of nowhere the handle melted off from the tray itself i touched it  carefully of course   to make sure it didn t snap off or i missed used it in some way but the plastic was hot and can see where it began to warp  will follow up if there is a temporary fix to it because it would be really unfortunate to throw away such an expensive kitchen product so quickly with that said it cook great very easy to use i found that experimenting with the times and temps you will get better results than what was pre programmed into it didn t use all the functions mainly my own cooking times and temp so all the bells and whistles aren t that important  the cleaning i found to be very annoying the basket is easy and so is the drip tray but the basket walls are where you run into problems you can soak it scrub it spray it but the crevices are so narrow and so many you won t really get it      clean   that s okay to an extent because i will know myself that my products aren t completely clean i m not satisfiedif i can t fix the product myself then i  will not  be buying it again unfortunately just for it to happen again      
283,5.0,                       having owned most of the other brands out there on the market  i must say that this cosori model is my favorite and the best working of all of them the non stick surface is so easy to clean and it even does not stick without adding extra non stick spray to the surface  the controls are very easy to use and react promptly when touched there are several features in this air fryer that i have not seen in others  my favorite would be  the frozen food button preset  if you select the frozen food preset you can adjust the time and temperature to your desire for your particular food type  once you press the start button  the food will begin to cook and halfway through the elapsed time  the machine will beep and remind you to turn the food  this provides for very even cooking  although i have found that certain items such as chicken wings i did not even have to turn and they browned on both sides efficiently if you want a great air fryer and don t want to go through    other brands before you find one that works for you  i would suggest buy this one first  it really is an awesome air fryer      
284,1.0,                       took over   weeks to finally get here   they say the delivery is scheduled and you have to be here to sign for it   guy just randomly showed up and didn t want my signature   worked great   kids loved the fries and it didn t heat up the house   used it for the third time today and it quit in the middle of cooking   can t get it to work at all   don t waste your money on this piece of crap       
285,3.0,                       i liked the size   i found a fried chicken receipt for an air fryer   i tried this fried chicken to the letter  but it was disappointing   at first  after reading the instruactions carefully i started to cook   i could not get it to turn on   i tried over and over  but no success   i called the number for the hot line for  help   after holding forever  i finally took my place to be called back   i never received a call back for help     finally  my grandaughter who is a good cook   offered to help   within a few minutes she had success  it came on and started cooking   the fried chicken was just ok   i found out the basket has to be pushed into place before it will start cooking   not in the instruction book at all      
286,1.0,                       i purchased this air fryer at the end of october   i have only used it three times and on the third use it broke   we kept smelling something funny and couldn t figure out what it was  as the smell got worse we realized it was an electrical burning smell and quickly turned the machine off i am trying to contact someone about replacing this fryer and the only information provided is a web link that no longer works and a phone number where you sit on hold forever   i am disappointed in the product and the service  i wish i had paid more attention to the people that said this particular fryer broke very quickly      
287,5.0,                       this air fryer has already exceeded expectations   logistics first   so easy to clean   fryer is very quiet you can barely tell it is on   controls are so easy to use   i like that you can set specific temperatures   it is not too big to fit on the counter and light enough to move around if needed   the basket holds a ton of food   other reviews talked about steam and puddles around machine   non existent   most steam i had come out was a little when cooking chicken and i think i added too much vegetable oil spray   no condensation on counters anywhere   i used the recipe book to make mozzarella sticks  chicken and the chocolate souffl  so far   loved them all   i highly recommend this air fryer   can t wait to perfect some recipes and try new ones      
288,1.0,                       there s a bad plastic or chemical odor when using the cosori air fryer  we had to run it outside over   times to try and get the smell out  most of the smell went away after several runs but it still had a hint of the same odor  not only did it smell bad  it made some foods taste exactly like that odor  the air fryer was not as quiet as i expected  also  the bin appears to be cheaply made note  we got the cosori air fryer toaster oven and it s amazing    no smell  cooks amazing food  and super quiet   i highly recommend getting the air fryer toaster oven instead      
289,5.0,                       today we received our cosori premium     qt air fryer   this is our first air fryer  and after doing extensive research on the internet and reading reviews for six plus months  we decided to purchase the cosori air fryer   ordered the extra assessories that they offered  and prepared a hot dog for my husband for lunch using the skewers   rack   he thought it was tasty  but commented there wasn t a lot of difference than in microwaving it   then i cooked up some french fries and they were crisp and perfect   the clean up thus far seems to be easy  and the operation and directions  simple and easy to understand   the unit seems sturdy and well made   there is a great cookbook that is included with your purchase and looks like we will enjoy trying out different recipes   there is only one disappointment for me  and that is  when cooking the french fries there is suppose to be a  shake reminder   this function did not work   other than that  we are thrilled with our cosori air fryer  and would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for an incredible air fryer   it s a great addition to any kitchen and one that we will use often      
290,5.0,                       i literally use this thing for everything from making brownies to making meats  i even reheat things in it and it comes out crispy and juicy  i don t want to use my microwave  i never really liked them  or my conventional oven now that the weather is warmer  it s large enough to cook for my family of five in it and it doesn t take up too much space it get really hot when using it  there was a weird smell when i first turned it on but i just preheated it and washed it again  after it cooled  and it was gone  i put foil in it when i m feeling lazy so there no cleanup but i think it works best it u don t use anything other than a little oil because the air needs to get around the food and with the holes blocked at the bottom it can only make one side crispy at a time  that s fine with me when i don t feel like cleaning up      
291,5.0,                       my husband did some online research before we bought an air fryer   this one is the one he settled on  so we ordered it   it worked perfectly for a couple of weeks  then the digital display went completely berserk   i contacted cosori directly through their customer service   i have to say i was very pleasantly surprised   they asked me to supply them with a few numbers off our fryer  and a picture of what the display looked like   that was it   i had a new one so quickly i couldn t believe it   this one has never had a hiccup   i cooks bacon better than anything i ve ever used   frozen onion rings  corn dogs for the grandkids   i love it   cleanup is so easy   the grease basin and the food tray come apart and they are both dishwasher safe   however  they are so easy to wash that i seldom put them in the dishwasher   one of the things i like best about it is that the frying tray is square   many of the air fryers i looked at had odd shaped trays   i am not a fan of kitchen gadgets   i don t like appliances lined up on my counter   this is an exception   i use it every day  so it is on my counter all the time   it s quite attractive  so i don t mind   if you are in the market for an air fryer please consider cosori   i m very happy with mine      
292,3.0,                       i like everything about this air fryer except that my fries have an off taste  that i can t quite describe  slight chemical maybe   i have cleaned everything according to instructions several times  and still the strange taste persists  this is my second purchase of a cosori that i ve made based on the many great reviews  i noticed that another customer had a similar issue  so it is not just my opinion  i think it might be a defective lot  but i still like it  and hope other customers do not have this issue  because it performs well otherwise  i might try notifying the manufacturer      
293,4.0,                       i just got this today  it appears to be very well made  i registered it online to get the extra   year warranty  it was easy to complete the information   i have used several air fryers and i love the way they cook   my concern is the basket  all the others i have had the coating comes off after just a very few uses  i am hoping this will not happen with this one   i will update my review after i have used the unit   with a warranty i am sure there will be no problems with the unit      
294,5.0,                       this is a great air fryer to use  had it for over a year and mostly use it for salmon fries chicken related products  can definitely be used for a variety of different things  though cooking time will vary a lot  i wouldn t really recommend anything battered to be cooked in it since it takes a very long time to crisp up and doesn t taste as good as a deep fried  which is expected but was still worth a shot   once you find your preferred timing  the rest is simple with only   flip in between during the half way mark  my only complaint is that cleaning the basket by hand  great if you use a dishwasher though  the reason i give this a high rating is the customer support  my basket ended up breaking the handle and making it useless and i didn t sign up for the extended warranty as it was a gift to my mom and didn t see it  after contacting customer support  they were happily willing to send another replacement basket free of charge despite being out of warranty  i very much appreciate a company willing to work with the customer and stand by their products  hence why i highly recommend cosori as a brand  whether you get this one or a newer version      
295,3.0,                       i love this fryer   it s easy to clean and easy to use   it gets the job done   my issue is a safety concern   every time we used the fryer  we would smell a strong plastic smell   we assumed this was from just  breaking the product in    then  one day  i decided to move the fryer to a different location in my kitchen   the fryer had been in front of the window blinds in my kitchen   the blinds melted from the heat being released from the rear of the fryer   i had never head this issue with the previous fryer i had in the same location   i looked at the manual and it only mentions to avoid sticking your hands near the ventilation area   i would there should be a warning in bold letters to not place the fryer in front of any materials that could melt or burn   i m assuming everyone is placing the fryer on a countertop in front of a wall of some kind   depending on the finish on that wall  this could be a huge fire hazard anyway  we moved the fryer to an area where we have a tile backsplash only   i m sad my blinds on my new house are ruined the product itself is great as long as you are mindful of what building materials are behind the fryer      
296,1.0,                       i really really want to like this fryer  i just got it   days ago and was so excited to try it  i ve already tried to make kale chips  twice   bread  broccoli  french fries  and sweet potato fries  i hate to report that everything came out burned completely black  i tried the preset and then followed the recipe book and then tried just doing it on my own with half the temp setting and still everything is burned black  i haven t seen any other reviews about the food burning so i may have just gotten a bad fryer  i will be returning to amazon      
297,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          we use it almost everyday  it s easy to use  easy to clean  gives me fantastic fries  crunchy deep fried pork  and beautiful browned chicken update my cosori airfryer suddenly stopped working after two months of use after initially using is quite often  we slowed down to a once a week usage after a week or two as the novelty of deep fried food died down   while using it to prepare lunch the other day  it suddenly stopped working now it refuses to turn on unless the basket is held   i am very clean with my appliances and am a careful user  most of my machines and appliances work like new despite being a decade old   even the ones that people complain about not lasting long  our household usually manages to keep them running well  so this particular appliance  being only two months old and breaking down in such a short span of time is unacceptable      
298,1.0,                       strong melting plastic oder when cooking  left food tasting   smelling of plastic  very loud fan  returning for refund      
299,1.0,                       it s a mothers day gift so i have no idea how it works      
300,5.0,                       these are the next best thing since a kuerig   so convenient so fast so easy to clean   forget the microwave for leftovers use this to reheat   the food tastes way better doesn t get rubberized or mushy   biggest thing to watch for is drying something out like bread  its easy to dry breads out   fix your stale chips in this it can be done   leftover french fries are now a thing  before i tossed them or gave them to the dogs   quesadilla  grilled cheese  steak  fish  bacon  bagels  all sorts of leftovers   for reheating and cooking i would recommend this over a microwave any day   a microwave can heat water better and faster  that s it   by by hotpocket sleeves if you use this  takes a little longer but you get an actual crispy hot pocket   play with the heat and times  the presets are just a general guide and won t work for everyones preferences   or quantities   haven t burned anything yet either the way this heats it takes a bit to burn something      
301,1.0,                       i decided to give this air fryer a try due to its very high ratings on amazon and c net labelling it as the  best overall air fryer    i recall being conflicted on choosing the dial driven manual vs  touch button electronic version of this device due to quality concerns but opted to go with the touch one for preset convenience   i should have listened to my gut the first device came and only   of the    buttons worked   i looked up videos of other people operating the device and immediately knew mine was broken when i saw how easily others pushed each button and had the machine respond   thinking i just had some bad luck i contacted amazon and they sent me a replacement the next day   i didn t even unpack the next one completely before turning it on and trying the touch screen buttons to see if it worked as expected   this time   of the    buttons worked so i boxed it up and requested a refund one broken device is understandable as manufacturing issues occur sometimes  but two back to back makes me think this company doesn t have very good quality control standards   if you want to order this machine i would learn from my mistakes and go for the manual version  but personally i will be looking at a different company altogether for my air fryer   i feel you will be rolling the dice to see if you get a good product or a broken one with this company very disappointing        
302,4.0,                       i have heard the hype about air fryers and had a delicious piece of salmon that was prepared in this brand and model  at a friend s house  i immediately ordered this air fryer  one of the buttons on the touch panel didn t operate correctly from the beginning and it was taking about double the amount of time both from recipe times and the pre sets i returned this after a couple of days of using it  pretty sure i was done with the air fryer  but  alas    it makes cooking much easier and it doesn t heat up the entire oven  kitchen  house  clean up is a sinch  food turns out pretty good i ordered another brand    times the cost      i look forward to seeing if it provides better results      
303,5.0,                       update cosori customer service is amazing   they go above and beyond any other customer service i have ever seen   their awesome rep shirley reached out to me personally and is taking care of me   as i stated before   this product is amazing and it was a shame that the coating was coming off of my unit most companies would just shrug and go on with their day   but to have a rep reach out to me personally and offer a replacement that i was not expecting  no question   my family and i will stick with cosori for all kitchen gadgets and products going forward   having a company that truly cares about their customers  stands by their products  and want to make sure everything is right      this is a blessingwe love this fryer  and your company   cosori   shirley thank you  original post great fryer for the most part   would rate   stars but the coating on the fryer recently started to come off and we clean ours exactly how the company instructs you to do it s a shame because we love this fryer but have not had it long   why would the teflon coating flake off soo easily on the fryer bins   we have only had it for roughly   months and i fear it won t last which is upsetting because as i ve stated we really love this fryer cosori  maybe i got a model that wasn t coated properly          
304,5.0,                       holy crap i finally stopped buying delivery food because of this  its so easy and you just have to make sure to rinse it out between uses and it stays pretty clean  i eat fresh french fries almost every day  and tuna melts    i ve never had tuna so melty  fried pickles  crisp and tasty  biscuits  just toss em in  flaky and gold without waiting forever for an entire oven to turn on  im in love  my boyfriend was very upset when i took it back home with me      
305,4.0,                       when i finally decided to take the plunge  previous reviews convinced me that cosori was a very good choice  i have since made some very good meals  including eggplant  potato wedges and falafel  i m vegan  and oil free cooking is perfect   the only issue i have had is that it was difficult to remove the basket from the fryer when the cooking was done  after contacting customer service     hours later i was told a replacement basket was on its way to me  amazing service  not too many other companies have such immediate response time  did i mention you get a   year warranty      
306,5.0,                       this a very nice product  i m very happy  but reasonably  a heads up  you need to take care of it too  the touchpad is sensitive to grime  you have to wipe it clean for it to detect touch  the wifi works well  but a hassle when you unplug the unit  need to activate the wifi and reconnect the device to the app every time  if you run into trouble  customer service is there  just give them time under the present circumstances  believe me  i have tested them too  overall it is very good  just don t ask for whats its not      
307,5.0,                       love this beyond belief so far since i bought it two weeks ago  perfect  grilled  cheese was my first experiment and i was instantly sold  made two marinaded chicken quarters  best cost efficient chicken cut  that we re perfectly cooked with crispy skin  frozen waffle fries that i tossed in a little evoo and my mix of spices  came out of the air fryer and i felt like a pro  joked about how i should sell my fries because of how perfect they came out    highly recommend  first air fryer experience and i loved it  single guy who lives in an apartment  thought it would be a huge device and kill my limited counter space  it fits nicely and it s so light and portable i just move it around easily if i need the room  perfect      
308,5.0,                       this air fryer is easy to use and has become a daily fixture in our kitchen  it has held up well to daily use with the exception of one thing  the original inner basket that came with it gave me problems  the screws kept backing out of the handle making for a dangerous situation anytime i lifted moved it  i was constantly tightening the screws  at one point the basket got knocked off the counter and the clips that hold the inner basket into the outer basket broke off so i had to replace it anyway  the new inner basket has given me no trouble whatsoever so i m not sure if the one i originally had was defective or what  despite all that  i recommend this air fryer  it has a large basket that holds a lot of food at one time  i m able to cook for my family of   in it  it is so much easier than heating up my oven and my family prefers the taste of the food from the air fryer      
309,5.0,                       first i have to say cosori s customer service is amazing   i bought this air fryer in july and the buttons were very difficult to push  then a couple weeks ago the door stopped closing  i loved it  i just couldn t deal with the button issue and once the drawer stopped closing  i definitely needed a new one  but i was past the return exchange window with amazon  so i emailed them about the issues    days ago  not realizing they are based in ca  when i found out  i figured it d be a while before i heard back because of the wildfires  i was wrong   they responded in   hours   and within   days had a new air fryer in the mail to me   i got my new one a couple days ago and it works great   i love it and am so excited to get back to cooking in it   buy this fryer    it s fantastic and the company is phenomenal        
310,1.0,                       we were really happy with the product   only until recently did we realize we should have been able to use it manually  the control panel never worked   we were only able to use the wifi app  which was great until we upgraded our wifi   couldn t reconnect it we ve been in contact with cosori   hope to replace the product  we re pretty sure it s a short in the control panel that was always there why would we want another you ask it cooked perfectly   was easy to clean  i have a breville smart oven that i love but the air fryer option is so messy  it s not worth using  the other air fryers look too cumbersome this product was big enough for a family of     small enough to easily store the wifi app is nice  especially with working from home  the recipes they give are also phenomenal i can only imagine getting one that keeps working        
311,5.0,                       as octagenarians  my husband and i are getting a little decrepit   we like to cook but don t want to have to stand over the stove all the time   this little oven is the best thing since sliced bread   we have had it for a week and have used it all but one day   it works exactly as the book says it will   we had salmon in it and it was just like pan fried   ham great   chicken breast great   doing pork chops tonight and have no fear  that they might not taste great   baked potatoes in july   no problem and they were better than oven baked we have found that if you read the instructions completely the oven works great   let s face it  this is a small convection oven   it is not an oil deep fryer   before you get it read the questions and answers   we learned a lot of valuable tips  the best being not to put it in the dishwasher   warm water and dish soap are all you need   always preheat  cosori tells you that for a reason and your results will be better those little aluminium cake and loaf pans you buy in the market work great in this we have a lot of good cooking ahead of us and this little appliance will sure make it easier      
312,5.0,                       before anything else  i bought this product about a year ago and have been using it happily since  it works amazingly and cooks food perfectly with the pre set settings  fully frozen chicken breasts get cooked in no time and i have an easy and healthy dinner now then  onto the customer support experience  i had to deal with them twice so far  first happened on day one  i had a rare issue of the product being defective  i unpacked it and cleaned it as directed  plugged it in  and it turned on  then      minutes later  it would just power down for no reason and not come back on  using their book i figured out it was over heating for some unknown reason as if i let it cool down for a half hour or so  it would turn on and go back to  working seemingly like normal then after another   minutes of trying to pre heat  would shut off again  i was upset and decided to try calling the cosori customer support rather than going through amazon  the people at their support center worked with me for a few minutes trying to diagnose the problem and came to the conclusion  it was defective  they immediately offered me a replacement and sent it out    day shipping  completely free of charge as they should  the key here is they didn t try to accuse me of breaking the thing  or anything else  they did everything they could to help then when they couldn t they offered to make it right  the new one arrived and has been working flawlessly  until today  during regular cleaning a screw fell out of the basket  when i tried to see where the screw was supposed to go  a nut fell out of the handle as well  i m assuming the screw went into the obvious hole in the basket  and locked into that nut which was buried somewhere inside the handle  the issue here is there s no easy way to put this nut back into place  i couldn t take the handle apart past a certain point  and the nut had to be inserted inside the handle somewhere for the screw to then attach  i called cosori support again and explained my issue hoping they could just walk me through putting the thing back together as i figured they must know a way  after hearing what i said they didn t even bother trying to fix it  just apologized for the the basket breaking and offered to send me a replacement basket   i was stunned and agreed  i received an email from them   provided my order details  and my replacement basket will be on the way soon   these people bend over backwards to help you and stand by their product and its so rare to find a company willing to do that  this product alone worked great  but whats really selling me on their brand is their customer support  i can safely buy their stuff and know its going to work right  and if it doesn t they are going to work with you and do everything they can to make it right   cannot recommend them enough and will continue to buy cosori products in the future      
313,4.0,                       i used the cosori air fryer approximately   times when it just stopped working completely   i have contacted support so will report back   very disappointed at this point though   would have given it   stars if it hadn t broken down okay   editing this review because cosori is sending me a new air fryer   they requested a short video showing issue and proof of purchase which was easy   customer support contacted me within   days and acted on return within   day   stay tuned i received the new air fryer in   days and it s working great   customer service contacted me to see if everything was working okay and i was satisfied   i give their customer service   stars   i love this fryer and am trusting it was just a fluke that the first one broke down      
314,5.0,                       never own one of these airfryers so had no reference point to compare  took a chance and glad i bought the     size one  the bigger size made sense because i d rather have more room than less in case i need to cook a bigger meal wow impressed with the quality and how even the food cooks through  super duper convenient to cook many different dishes after owning this for several days i decided to review and had to admit i ve been using it practically eeveryday  it s so easy to clean too  i decided to give this review   stars   and would highly recommend the only little downside  it s a little different to open  my wife and i kind of got used to it so it s not a deal breaker hope this review helps       ok gotta go to the airfryer for my food          
315,5.0,                       this works better than advertised  thank you respectfully  charles e  duvall davperm sp  us army viet nam              th  transportation co  red ball express     
316,4.0,                       we had a smaller ninja fryer we loved  built like a tank and easy to use and clean  we saw this unit as we needed somersetting a  little bigger and with all the good reviews ordered it  the unit feels a little cheap  maybe it is the fingerprint proof plastic coating  the controls are not as granular around timing as the ninja  the cooking baskets also come across cheap and rough making cleaning by hand difficult  the coatings on the basket as not as non stick as the ninja  in the end it gets the job done  but i don t see this as a long term ownership as we will likely look at other alternatives in a  few months      
317,5.0,                       this is hands down my new best friend in the kitchen  as someone who cooks pretty much every meal this is a life savor  just throw your ingredients in   bam great tasting food  i ve made duck breast  burgers  fries  bacon  orange chicken  i ve used this everyday since i got it  everything comes out perfectly done  healthy    flavorful  easy to use  easy to clean    awesome recipe book  i would recommend to use this far away from the wall as this puppy throws some heat out the back  also she s a bit loud   sounds like a rocket is about to take off from your counter  other than that this thing is a beast   gets the job done     
318,5.0,                       i have had this machine for about   weeks now and i love it   it revitalizes left overs   giving a crispiness that cannot be achieved in the microwave and you do not have to heat your entire oven to warm a few things   the   min pre heat is an excellent feature which i could not find on many competitor models   last night my    year old son cooked tomato  provolone  and basil stuffed chicken breasts    they were tender and juicy in a way i have never gotten from cooking in the oven and they took a fraction of the time to cook  the large basket size allows for easy cooking for my family of   with room to spare   i am still learning the settings  but i am more comfortable with it after every use   i could see this replacing not only my deep frier but my oven for many meals  it has a smaller footprint than my current     gallon deep frier and i think it will get a coveted counter top storage place as i can see us using it so much that it would be pointless to keep putting away   very happy with this purchase      
319,5.0,                       my husband has been asking me to buy an airfryer for years  thought it was just  another gadget   received one for christmas   surprise     guess who from   no judgement   received some beautiful jewelry  cologne and clothes and more as well lol  love it so much   i threw out my huge  hard to clean  toaster oven to make room for this  can make toast in if   if you want  fried chicken comes out beautiful  crispy and juicy  bacon   perfect  everything comes out great  i usually google what food i want to cook in an air fryer and get times   temps  no guessing bought the white one   very  very nice looking on countertop  very  very easy to clean  just love it      
320,1.0,                       well the   meals we were able to cook turned out great  unfortunately the unit now will not stay on for an entire cook cycle  it s as if it heats up and has an auto shutoff then will not power on again until it has cooled off  it s basically worthless at this point  and to top things off the customer support link on amazon to the manufacturer sends to a webpage that no longer exists  won t buy this brand again      
321,2.0,                       i had to return it after first use  the instructions do warn that there is a burnt smell of plastic the first few usages  prodect is lined with a teflon type of coating like most cooking materials but they do not warn you that it is so pungent and horrible that the entire house reeks of plastic burning  makes you wonder if it is healthy for our food to be touching the plastic coated lining      
322,3.0,                       the reviews by others is correct  this is the easiest and best air fryer  first made spicy party chicken wings  which turned out great  i need to learn the other setting because the french fries where a little to crispy and hard   my fault    ha ha  franks and sausages came out perfect as if they were grill on a bbo grill  next week i will try to make crispy fried chicken  anyway this air fryer will eliminate my other gagets           update       i ve had the fryer for   weeks now  and it is better then my other devices  the cooking time on some food items  vary a lot  the recipe book photo are very professional so don t have that expectation  yours will look that  good        ok     be prepare for trial and error for cooking times on some items  finally the disappointing issue     the basket with the vents at the bottom and sides are very hard to clean  especially the side vents  i don t use any abrasive material to clean it and i don t have a dishwasher  hand washing with dish soap  even letting it sit in hot water over night  does not help to clean the side vents  because of the difficult time to clean the inner basket  i need to lower the rating  it is a good fryer and probably better then most fryers  but the effort to clean it is a challenge      
323,5.0,                       i ve been cooking up a storm with this thing  fries  fried chicken  heating up pizza slices  salmon    this thing is so great  it cooks food very evenly  salmon skin comes out super crispy  which is the best way to eat them imo  easy to clean  can hand wash or stick the buckets in the dish washer      
324,5.0,                       i was looking to replace my previous air fryer  which i really loved  because it began smoking and acting up  i did a lot of research and i kept coming back to the cosori  which already had some really good reviews  i almost bought the brand i previously had  sorry  brand escapes me at the moment  because i really did like it   but i am so glad i went with this one  i like the square shape instead of the oval one from before    it cooks great   and cleans up so easily  i highly recommend this brand and model  and if you are new to air frying  you are going to fall in love with this  and do not for a moment think it is just an air  fryer   you can use this to reheat everything from meats to sandwiches  and whenever i get chinese take out  with egg rolls  etc   i place the egg rolls in this for     minutes and it heats and crisps them up incredibly well     just like getting them fresh at the restaurant  i obviously i could go on and on   so  what are you waiting for  order it now       
325,1.0,                       it worked reaaly great the healf dozens times i used it i bought this because my dad had heart problems but he died before i could even give it to him  so i honestly forgot about it then i had a heart attack and am having to watch whati eat  i remembered i had this so i opened it up and it worked wonderfully for about   uses now it will not stay on as the connection from the bsket to the unit will not stay put keeps disconnecting and turning the power off completely  its is very frustrating i have to give it one star because i had it for a couple years but never put it to use and then when i need it to work itdoesnt for long     
326,3.0,                       so i love using the airfryer  it is my favorite cooking appliance now     but that makes it worse that the handle snapped off of the basket   this must be a common design flaw because even though it is in warranty there are no replacement baskets available from the manufacturer and even amazon only has used baskets for sale as for the airfryer  it cooks well and cleans up very easily digital touch screen is annoying  i can see why the manual knobs option has come back   the buttons have a delay between touching it and changing the settings so something as easy as changing the temp and time is bothersome  you have to go through temp to get to time  the app on the phone works well  and is good for alerting you if you are running the fryer and leave the room   the app also has good recipes and is easier to use than the digital display to set temp and time      
327,5.0,                       first one worked fine unless it ran for more than    minutes  then it made a clanging sound  contacted cosori   sent them a video of it running  within four days i had a brand new one delivered to me   it runs perfectly  i love roasted veggies   steak is perfect in     min  cooks pork chops in    min that are so moist   tender   reheats leftovers in only a couple minutes   they aren t soggy like from the microwave  i m still learning it  but am having so much fun  i don t care for the presets  it s easier for me to program what i want  but overall it s a fantastic machine   cosori cust service was great      
328,5.0,                       i cook     in my cosori air fryer       stove  oven    microwave   love this thing   wish i d  known about it a long time ago    can preheat it  then throw my son s french toast sticks in for   mins on a busy morning    boom   bfast   pizza reheats like a dream   dumplings  burgers    bacon all crisp up super nice   of course the restaurant leftovers  including fries taste like they were made fresh again   it sounds cliche  but this machine is life changing for our family   made some amazing bacon wrapped tomato   asparagus   getting ready to try spring rolls soon   the only oil i ever used  was a bit drizzled on the fresh russet fries   that was mostly for a bit of seasoning flavor   the  shake   flip food feature that beeps part way through cooking is genius   helps it all get really crispy   can t wait to start using my baking accessories for it   the racks are so darn handy to keep food from sticking to foil i lined in my fryer basket   so worth another appliance taking up counter space     can t live w out it now        
329,2.0,                       i love the air fryer itself  but after about   months of medium use  the controls on the machine stopped working  thank god for the app and or echo that allows me to control it or else i would have to throw it out  regardless  it is a pain to have to control this device using my smart phone instead of just pressing the buttons      
330,1.0,                       i ve used this air fryer the past week  and right from the start it had issues  the time temp touch button doesn t seem to work well  have to press it like   times  and you use it alot to set the cooking temp and time  also  there is a strong plastic smell after the first cooking  a week later and the unit continues to produce a burned plastic smell that stays in the house for hours  as far as cooking  we done a variety of food  including steak  and i ve noticed that most foods don t get done well inside and isn t nice and hot  even though it s done on the outside  i don t have this issue when using the oven range or outside grill  for the price  i would expect better cooking results  the touch pad to work for all buttons  and not a burning plastic smell  what s interesting is that other reviews have said the same issues with the touch pad and plastic smell  so i m returning this and may look to try another brand      
331,5.0,                       oh my goodness  i am astounded by how awesome this thing is  the first recipe i tried with this air fryer is one of my favorites but is also one of the most temperamental  i love fried tomatoes but as anybody knows  unless they are green  then the tomatoes often fall apart in the cooking process  i am entirely impressed with how well this device performed  the tomatoes came out absolutely perfect with a golden crust and not overcooked in the middle  i also decided to throw in some fresh basil to see what happens  and it came out as a wonderful crispy topping  i highly recommend this air fryer because it has outperformed my expectations      
332,5.0,                       i got this for my son for christmas  he s     he loved it  he likes to cook and bake  it s a nice treat when he makes recipes from the booklet that came with it  the whole family enjoys eating the food he makes with it  it is easy to set up  operate and clean  he uses the parchment liners  so clean up is very quick  i didn t get the accessories that are universal and i don t think i will  they look like added kitchen clutter that would be used once and be annoying to clean  we have a tiny kitchen and have very limited space for kitchen stuff   like   or   cabinets that aren t huge for all of our kitchen cooking baking food storage items  so if you have a small kitchen you really gotta love this appliance  because it does take up space and create heat  we just plug it in and put it on the glass stove top usually  so the heat is in an area that is already made for it  we haven t tried it out on the counter yet  so be aware that if you put it on the counter  the hot air comes out the back  after he wipes it down and dries it  he just tucks it away in the cabinet when he s done with it   as far as noise goes  it does generate noise but it isn t any louder than when we use the kitchen exhaust venthood  we have had it in use weekly since christmas  so time will tell how long lasting it is  look forward to trying new recipes with it      
333,1.0,                       right from the first day i loved the cooking ability of this cooker however i didn t like the handle and plastic clamp   we ve used the fryer about   time   today  would have been    but i started the machine and was talking to my kids when the tray auto ejected from the machine   i was standing near so i instinctively reached for the tray in mid air   it seared my left index finger so bad by the time i turned my hand over i had  nd degree burns   the inside tray crashed on the floor sending our last batch of chicken nuggets  kids lunch  onto the floor   not only did it ruin our lunch it burnt my hand so bad i am typing this with one hand   needless to say this device has flaws that need fixed   wasted           
334,5.0,                          update from   months later  still using this air fryer every day  it s so durable  but even so i take very good care of it to keep it that way  i hand wash the basket after every use and only put in the dishwasher once a month to keep the stainless coating intact  i also bought parchment filters that work great on baked goods especially  so happy with my purchase    i love this air fryer so much  i use it every single day  i make egg bites or french toast sticks for breakfast  chicken nuggets and fries for lunch  and lamb meatballs or pizza for dinner  it makes dessert too  easy quick chocolate chip cookies i had an instantpot brand air fryer before this and was disappointed how the top rack burned the food and the bottom rack didn t cook at all  this cosori air fryer has never caused me this issue  it s truly a wonderful appliance      
335,5.0,                       bought this as a birthday gift for the wifey  second day  she cooked baby back pork ribs  she messed it up a bit by running it twice  the second time overcooked it a bit  but   i got to clean the two pans and man  the amount of fat and grease was just obscene  this machine removes all of that artery clogging gunk and leaves it in the pans   try it yourself  leave the pans in cold air i cannot recommend this cooking device any higher than this  i don t ever recommend online  but i will make an exception  i will only eat meats cooked by this machine hence forth      
336,5.0,                       got this for my husband  he loves it  in fact he can t stop talking about what he wants to make   he uses it   or   times a week to cook dinner or breakfast  he says it is very easy to clean  he likes it because he doesn t have stovetop splatters to clean up like when he uses a frying pan  i like it because he uses less oil when he cooks  i also love that he likes using it so much it does take getting use to and it s easy to over cook items if you aren t careful but after some use you will learn how to judge time on cooking  we found timing charts and used them to learn how long to cook items best asparagus we ve ever had      
337,1.0,                       i originally had a philips air fryer for years  i wanted something bigger so i came across cosori on amazon  the smart feature sounded so nice so i bought it  the first one i received  the touchscreen did not work at all  it worked only on my iphone so i returned itso i placed another order but they sent me a totally different model  i returned it again so i ordered it again telling myself this has to be the last time  touchscreen works but now it won t connect to my iphone  the wifi signal kept turning on and off        the food comes out delicious but i am totally annoyed by the fact that their product is partially broken every time i got a replacement buy something else  the smart feature sounds nice but it does not work anyway    not worth your time to try and return         
338,4.0,                       i enjoy the recipe book   i have cooked steak  fish  chicken wings  hard boiled eggs  french fries  tater tots    this has not disappointed us   we love the food without all of the grease there are lots of recipes on the internet cleaning is fairly easy   we put it in the dish washer   the sides can be a little difficult to clean by hand      
339,5.0,                       so far  i am really loving my new cosori   it cooks well and quickly and the clean up is a cinch when you put tin foil in the bottom drawer   i ve made chicken wings  steak and fish and all came out  well   i like my steaks medium so i cooked it a bit longer  but the  flavors  moistness  etc  have been great   i was afraid it would be just another clunky appliance taking up valuable countertop real estate in my small kitchen  but it is proving itself to be worthy of the space   i m beginning to wonder if i will ever need to wash a cooking dish  or use my oven stovetop again      
340,5.0,                       this is my  th airfryer   my first was the gowise gw       th gen which would be my  nd favorite but it didn t fit as much in the basket because it was round and the teflon came off pretty quickly   gave it to my son   then i decided to go big and get the gowise usa     quart   in   gw        it was big and expensive but it filled my house up with smoke and fat globules when i cooked bacon and i had to open the doors and windows   the timer also didn t work correctly   i returned it and got the cosori because of the reviews and price   i have had it for about   months now and i couldn t be happier   it has a nice sized square basket that you can place more food in with more surface area to crisp it   i have cooked lots of items in it and am very happy with the results   steaks are phenomenal     well so is the hamburgers and chicken with a great mallard affect but still moist in the middle   bacon is amazing and cleanup is a breeze   i enjoy the fries and have even made an impressive and delicious calzone with a ww   ingredient dough that was the best i have eaten anywhere   enjoy this air fryer immensely   the last air fryer i got was the ninja which also is pressure cooker etc   i do enjoy this as well but cooking surface is much smaller and so prefer the corsori over the ninja if all you are looking at is the air fryer   get a instant pot with it and you ll be happy and have all the latest kitchen gadgets that makes preparing meals easy and flavorful      
341,5.0,                       after unboxing and cleaning the buttons weren t responding to my button presses  after less than a minute on hold a very helpful customer support person listened to my story and asked for a short video showing what i was doing  along with proof of purchase so she could process a replacement order  she was very professional and nice about it eventually i figured out that using my thumb pad instead of a regular index finger tap made the buttons work properly and since then the air fryer has worked flawlessly      
342,4.0,                       edit   update  the seller is sending me a replacement interior basket for my fryer  good job guys  thank you  i love this air fryer but    months after purchasing it  the handle melted and broke  waiting to hear if they ll replace it bacon tastes the best when done in this fryer  vs  pan or oven   it makes the most gorgeous  roast chicken i ve ever seen  burgers are outstanding  honestly who needs a grill  i d love to have one but this air fryer makes up for it   steaks come out great as well  i ve made a lot of fries with it lol  and the other day i made chicken nuggets for the first time pizza  i haven t perfected making pizza but it s outstanding for heating up pizza  it tastes better than it does when it first comes from the pizza shop the food always comes out yummy      
343,3.0,                       ok i don t know what to do i open my new cosori air fryer yesterday washed it  the food cane out looking delicious fast but when it was time to eat the food tastes like plastic   how do i get rid of that smell i dont want to return it but if the smell continues i cant keep it      
344,5.0,                       absolutely love this appliance   country fried steak and fried green tomatoes are healthier   bacon  yum   potato skins  awesome   i usually cook my filet mignon by browning on the stovetop and finishing in the oven   which smokes up the house and sets off smoke detectors   no more of that   my filets are perfect in this air fryer   rare takes     minutes tops   the perfect compliment to this is this olive oil sprayer which looks nice on the counter with my stainless appliances   misto brushed aluminum oil sprayer   https   www amazon com dp b     spzv ref ppx pop mob ap share     
345,5.0,                       after reading many great reviews  i decided the cosori air fryer max xl was the air fryer for me  i love the square basket that gives you room for air frying lots of food at one time  the coated surfaces are very easy to clean  i read all the instructions before starting including running the fryer first to get rid of any  new  smell it might put out  i have had no problem with any bad smell at all from the newness of the machine  i am a newbie at this  so i learned quickly that i need to pause during cooking to check food or shake it since i way over cooked my first chicken strips   i have cooked roasted potatoes  breaded okra  chicken and even a meatloaf  which was really delicious  i look forward to using it daily to cut time in the kitchen and make healthier meals      
346,5.0,                       i wanted an air fryer for a long time but couldn t decide if i would really use it or was it just going to be a novelty  after reading up on them and speaking friends who have them  i decided that it was time for me to experience the joy of an air fryer  i did my research and read alot of reviews for all different fryers but i decided that the cosori air fryer   unfortunately i had ordered the wi fi one and was having  difficulty getting it to work   a problem that i believe has been taken care of on all the new ones   i called the greatest customer support team and told them my problem  they apologized and quickly sent me a brand new one  i have never had service that quick  cosori has a year warrentee which becomes  a two year if registered within two weeks   others only had    warrentee  i use my air fryer at least   times a week  it makes great baked potatoes  fish  chicken  vegetables  frozen foods and amazing bacon  it is very simple to clean and use  i would highly recommend the cosori air fryer  the delivery was timely and packed very well      
347,5.0,                       this air fryer is awesome  size of the basket is great   i can fit   decent size pork chops  besides the size of the basket the other thing i love is that it cooks evenly and the flavor of the food  is perfect  it s a no brained to use the functions  i use it every single day for cooking meat  making desserts and cooking veggies  i rarely use the stove now   oh and i m eating in a few minutes of putting in the food  cleaning is a  breeze  if you re looking for an excellent air fryer   i highly recommend this one      
348,1.0,                       my brother in law has this model and cooked something for us   i thought it was great  so i purchased one for myself   i got to use it one time and had to return it   the basket wouldn t latch rendering it useless i boxed it up  sent it back and they were going to send me a replacement   when i looked at it today i found that the air frier was     cheaper   they refused to credit me     so i had them cancel the replacement and refund my money      
349,5.0,                       just received it i saw the amazon driver toss the box but good thing it does have styrofoam on the inside so it was protected as far as i can see  it looks really nice and it s not as heavy  i did have trouble pressing the buttons i had to press it many times to change the settings  maybe i was doing it wrong  it was kind of annoying  but i made fries and they came out pretty great  will be using more hopefully it does last  i did put warranty hopefully if anything goes wrong the cosori team will be able to help me  update months later i was able to replace my airfryer because i was still having trouble with the buttons  they were lagging a lot  the cosori team were very helpful  i just received it and tested it out  the buttons are perfectly responsive   thanks so much    starts for cosori     
350,5.0,                       we ve had our air fryer less than a month and i m using it almost every night to cook our dinner  i wasn t familiar with using an air fryer  but the booklet that came with the fryer was easy to follow  i bought the larger size      qt   even though there are just two of us  my reasoning was that we sometimes cook additional food in order to have leftovers and  secondly  because i wanted to be able to cook enough to feed our daughter as well when she comes over the first meal i cooked was thick lamb chops  i marinated them a bit and easily fit all four in the fryer  i followed the cooking time in the recipe book and they were absolutely perfect  browned on all sides  exactly the right temperature  tender  and delicious  next  vegetables  i usually roast them in the oven and get them super crispy and browned  i was skeptical the fryer would be able to replicate this  but i was wrong  brussels sprouts  asparagus  broccoli  squash  all perfect  another outstanding meal was boneless chicken breast  dredge in a little panko and flour  egg wash  and into the fryer  no oil needs  but did spray the breasts with pam   they were incredibly moist and wonderful  also did chicken wings  another winner  salmon  halibut  no problem cleanup is very easy  we do not put ours in the dishwasher  the basket and tray are very easy to wash out  i use the recipe book that comes with the fryer as well as a couple of others i ordered online  i supplement with an internet search when i don t see what i want in one of the books  of the books i have  i think the book that came with the fryer is pretty good  i highly recommend this air fryer      
351,1.0,                       the reason i am only given this one star is because i wanted to alert everybody if they are buying this for a christmas gift  or if you are buying any other gift from amazon  early due to the pandemic thing twice  you only have    days to return it to amazon  otherwise you have to deal with the manufacturer  i just went through this with another product and now i am screwed  i now have a product that doesn t work and i m stuck with it  i bought this air fryer plus one of those hydroponic gardens which were going to be for gifts because of the early sale  however  unless you plan on opening them and using them out and trying them before christmas and gift giving them  the person you were giving them to will be stuck with dealing with the manufacturer of the product and good luck with that  word of warning do not buy anything    days longer than you intend to give it  the gifts i bought just now became mine      
352,5.0,                       i wasn t sure which air fryer i wanted to purchase when i decided to purchase one  i had seen a couple of videos of people reviewing cosori products and they gave them great reviews  so  i decided on the cosori  i bought on the prime membership  two day sale and got it at a great price  i was impressed as soon as i opened the box  a very nice cookbook with plenty of recipes  i purchased a cook book  but the one that came with the fryer was more impressive to me  then a deal to receive an extra year warranty  the fryer was so easy to use and to clean  we made chicken legs in it twice and the taste is great  crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside  delicious  i always stated that i would not ever buy an air fryer because i have so many kitchen gadgets and appliances  i am so glad i changed my mind and purchased this one  thanks  cosori  for a great product      
353,4.0,                       wife was a bit skeptical about air frying  coconut shrimp was excellent  halibut  chicken thighs   sweet potato fries also turned out well  really appreciate how easily the nonstick basket cleans up  perfect for two retired folks      
354,1.0,                       i bought this product in september      and as of november      it s stopped working   it started randomly shutting off and officially today i can t eat my dinner because it s not working     months and i cannot return it  cannot contact the seller and out        don t waste your money      
355,5.0,                       all i can say is this air fryer is great  i had a previous air fryer that i returned because it was too complicated and did not work right for me  amazon s rating system is wonderful  after i returned the first air fryer  i started looking again and this time i paid close attention to the ratings  this product has over        ratings  something to be said about the product  thank you amazon  the best feature on this fryer is the size of the fryer  smaller  but most importantly is the size of the fryer basket  where all the work is done  the basket is great   the other day  i cooked three huge breaded chicken thighs with room for another if needed  yesterday i cooked    bacon wrapped shrimp in the basket  recipe is in the cookbook that came with the fryer   all i can say is two things  thank you corsori and amazon      
356,4.0,                       we ve had this air fryer for a couple of months and are very pleased with it  large size and preheat feature are great  only negative is that the nonstick coating chipped after the first few uses  we are always careful to use utensils designed for a nonstick surface  and to hand wash it with nonstick safe sponges  we hand wash it after every use  we would give it five stars if we didn t have this issue with the nonstick coating      
357,5.0,                       so far    so very  very good   it felt as if i d waited for generations to purchase an air fryer  thus i took the purchase of one very seriously  i m so proud that i took my time in researching brands  and prices   this cosori has added a new dimension to my kitchen cooking    actually i ve only begun to explore and dig in to actually reading and deciding on some of the recipes feature in it s accompanying cookbook     but am having a blast simply cooking basics in it   i m definitely on a learning curve   i started out very basic by simply cooking up some seasoned frozen hamburger patties  and they turned out excellent  nom  nom   i definitely signed up for the extended warranty  but i feel that i may not need to use it   no issues at this point  with my cosori  it is easy enough to clean  but i did go ahead and purchase some parchment paper mats for its pan  as a way of protecting the pan  because i want to keep my air fryer in tip top shape   i do follow all the instructions concerning it  and make sure that it s has room around it for it to  breathe  and not become overheated   all in all  i really don t know why i waited as long as i did to finally treat myself to an air fryer   the experience with it being a cosori    has been an uber pleasant one  so much to the point that i am looking into some of their other appliances  too      
358,1.0,                       i liked using this air fryer   it s easy to use and easy to clean   after   months a screw fell out of the basket   i found a replacement screw and tightened the old ones and the new one and all was well   today the basket that fits in the fryer tray is stuck   the mechanism that releases the basket from the fryer tray broke   i can t find any way to take it apart to see if i can fix it   so  i guess this is really just a rental   you pay about      per year to use it  then you throw it away and but a new one          
359,5.0,                       looking for a way to enjoy all the foods i love in a healthier way  i had been curious about the air fryer for a long time  i first ordered a smaller one and sent it back  there was just no way  unless your single to make all the great recipes and food  so glad we ordered a large one  i was worried that i was just buying into another kitchen appliance that would not get used as much as it should and take up space  i use my air fryer several times a week   more than almost all my appliances  i have not had one thing i haven t loved  it enhances the flavor of everything  there is nothing better than homemade french fries  and they come out just as good as when i use to deep fry them in oil  all frozen food items are better  the uncooked tortillas from costco  egg rolls  wings  i could go on and on  and i m not even following new recipes  i m just making the foods i ve always made  better cons are it s large  and it smells  not that the smell is bad  it just smells like an oven  i just didn t expect such a strong smell coming from a smaller appliance great buy  fan for life      
360,5.0,                       awesome machine to cook your cravings in a healthier way  my wife is pregnant and she is keeping her weight on track with this machine  it has perfectly cooked our chicken  empanadas and sausages  very happy with the product and would recommend    spanish   excelente m quina para cocinar tus antojos de una forma saludable  mi esposa est  embarazada y esta m quina le ha permitido mantener su peso  la m quina ha cocinado nuestras empanadas  pollo y salchichas a la perfecci n  totalmente recomendado      
361,5.0,                       there is not one thing i dislike about this air fryer  the size is perfect and it is actually much faster than other air fryers  take a bit of time o get used to it  but  once you do you will love this brand plus i have lost weight since the only oil i use is out of a spray bottle it is awesome  fun to cook again      
362,5.0,                       first of all i did so much research to buy the right air fryer because i wanted an easy to clean  non stick  hassle free air fryer  the only difficult part was taking all the plastic out and separating the trays  it doesn t explain how to exactly put the trays back together  or which tray gets screwed to the handle  yes  you need to remove screws in order to get a layer of plastic out from underneath the tray  and to screw the tray to the main handle  everything else was extremely easy  cooking is simple  comes with a recipe booklet  comes with easy to read instructions  as long as you keep it clean  its great very important  well in my opinion   is to do the test run as it states in the manual  great investment     air fryer bestseller on amazon   definitely worth the bucks      
363,4.0,                       the design of this unit is very thoughtful and pleasing  i particularly like     the angled  and intuitive to use control panel  and    the essentially square shape of the basket s   which makes it possible to cook fairly large items   my only slightly negative comment relates to the  operating manual    as a person who previously did very little cooking  it would have been helpful to me if the manual included more information guidance re recommended temperatures and cooking times  for example  what temperature and cooking time is appropriate for a small ham  a salmon filet  a fish filet  etc      
364,5.0,                       size  it s not to big or small  you can use amazons virtual feature to see if it fits where you want to put it  the basket is a great size  i was able to fit    chicken legs in with comfort and cooked perfectly cleaning  cleaning the outside is as simple as taking a clean sponge or clorox wipes or whatever you use and wiping down real quick  cleaning the internal cubby where the basket goes is easy as well  quick wipe and all clean  recommend using cleaning wipe  omg the basket is dish washer safe  but if you don t have dishwasher  use rubber sponge or non abrasive sponge to clean it up   so you don t scratch it   takes about   min to clean  super easy cooking  you don t need egg  flour wash  if you want good fried food  if you do  it just comes out even better  i made pork chops and bacon  soooo good  as you see  super crispy and omg so juicy  when cooking in it  it keeps the meat juicy all the way through but nice crispness ease of use  super easy  instructions and recipe book are huge help   there are so many recipes to try  unfortunately   you may have to screw in the screw tight once or twice because it comes loose  the wifi one is amazing   i can preheat my food or start it all from my app  so nice when i m trying to vlean ir study and don t want to burn food or over cook it  lol great for weightloss    lbs down  overall  i would by again and recommend      
365,5.0,                       newest addition to my list of favorite loud things   harley davidson   loud pipes save lives   fast cars   none of that frooo frooo electric jive  we re talking dino sauce drinking sexy horsepower   the super majestic north american bald eagle    ft wingspan of pure  merica coming for you  rockk and rollll   if it s too loud  you re too old  guns  guns  and more guns   come and take  em  my childhood dog   yeah  it was a poodle  shut up   he d bite your arse if you looked at him wrong  al freaking pacino   he s not yelling  you re just not listening quietly enough  the cosori max xl    qt air fryer of the future   food never tasted so damn loud or delicious a few weeks ago  the spouse and i  me and the spouse    were out practicing some delicious social distanced dining  the food was great  cost a lot  and i instantly lost a belt loop  while suffering the inevitable food coma  i looked at the wife and said   there s got to be a better way to eat well and not turn the covid    into the covid      after a few minutes on the google researching better ways of preparing food  we landed on air fryers  next step  off to amazon to see how quickly and easily i can fill a need that i didn t know i had  a few options down  i landed on the cosori max xl   prime eligible   a  best seller   sold early the next week  i pulled the biggest box out of the daily pile of amz packages  the cosori had landed  after a few more powerpoint decks  a spreadsheet  and the accompanying conference calls  i heard a very strange  and loud  noise coming from the kitchen  intrigued  i politely yelled   what the hell is that noise   a miffed voice replied   the new air fryer   weird  but whatever  closed the door  finished the day  and waddled out to test the results the first meal that came out of the air fryer was a delicious meal of marinated chicken breasts   fried  mushrooms  and some green beans  skeptical as i was  it was time to eat  let me just say  it was love at first bite  despite the ruckus  this thing turns out delicious food  and it does it at light speed  within the first week  we ve used it to cook chicken  mushrooms  green beans  bacon  sweet potato fries  and cheese sticks  thus far  it s batting       with the only outlier being some lame arse pre fab cheese sticks from  tgi fridays    my fault for buying them in the first place  frat version   the cosori xl    quickly turns out delicious meals in a fraction of the time  calories and fat content  better still  it s ridiculously easy to clean  yes  it s a bit loud  however  once you fall in love with it  that noise transforms from annoyance to a preview of a great meal  highly recommended   get some      
366,4.0,                       this air fryer is easy to use and makes great tasting fried food but there are some flaws  in order to thoroughly clean the basket  you need to unscrew three screws  they help hold the draining tray and basket together   none of the reviews mentioned that and i was extremely disappointed to find out about this when i received the product  also  beware that when you initially use the air fryer  it will release a plastic smell  which is apparently normal    the plastic smell will disappear after a few usages but just so you are aware before you purchase the product      
367,5.0,                       this is a really great appliance  we ve had other air fryers in the past  but moved to this one due to its size  this unit is able to cook evenly and thoroughly  we opted for the wifi version which  in my opinion seems a bit useless  we ve used it a few times  but at the time of purchase  it was the cheaper option for some reason  fast forward to   months later  we accidentally dropped the basket  and the lower basket assembly broke  we contacted the company to purchase a replacement basket  and they shipped one to us at no charge  really great customer service  without a doubt  would recommend this appliance      
368,5.0,                       this is the best counter appliance i ve ever bought and i ve bought more than i care to admit  the only negative is that it s a big black box on our kitchen counter and so the attractive feature is a little less than ideal but that said  it s super lightweight and easy to move to the pantry shelves when company comes over apparently this model is larger than most which is great and cleaning couldn t be easier  you just pull out the non stick basket and either pop in the dishwasher or clean with a quick rinse  takes less time than it would to clean a roasting pan  so far i ve baked chicken breasts  with skin  without skin  breaded  non breaded   toasted bread  roasted baby carrots and green beans and brussel sprouts  sausages  baked potatoes  and made regular and sweet potato fries  all of it has turned out perfectly  the chicken moist  the french fries crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside  the veggies all with a nice dark brown roast like we prefer  even the chicken breast without skin or oil turned out moist and tender  since getting our air fryer i haven t used our oven and have only used the warming feature on the microwave to hold the cooked meat while cooking the vegetables  my only regret is that i didn t buy an air fryer a long time ago     
369,5.0,                       i actually won an instant pot in a drawing  my husband and i both love it  when i was chatting with a colleague the other day  she mentioned that she loves her air fryer because she could vary her cooking from the steam cooking to the dry cooking that the air fryer has  i purchased cosori on a monday and it was at my door wed morning  we made coconut shrimp on the first night  loved it  be sure that you wash the baskets prior to using for the first time  i made the mistake of not doing that and when i was preheating  the smell was awful  we stopped midstream and washed them both and it seemed to make a difference  other than that   i m looking forward to more cooking      
370,5.0,                       i didn t feel like i had a real  need  for an air fryer but i will say it makes things much easier  i ve only fried chicken cutlets  breaded vegs and frozen snack foods in it but it works really well  just check the timings of things  the chicken icon must be for pieces of chicken so time wise it s much less for cutlets  i haven t needed to use the remote option cause why would i  i m in the kitchen preparing the rest of the meal while i use it  but if you re in the fence   get it  you ll thank me later      
371,5.0,                       i seriously love this air fryer  the first air fryer i had was an egg shaped design which was nice but i honestly prefer the cosori i really like the easy to operate buttons corresponding with specific foods  one of the other things i really like is that you can easily adjust the temperature or the duration of cooking time which is a really good idea while you re learning to cook different things  i have found that it s a good idea to watch what you re cooking until you have mastered how long each food item takes if you are not sure which one to get  get this one      
372,5.0,                       i love my cosori air fryer     qt  machine   i have used it nearly daily for bagels  chicken breasts  garlic bread  toast  roasted vegetables  salmon filets  and more   the booklet is helpful   i bought a rolling stand   sold on amazon  to set it on in the corner of my counter  it fits on perfectly and i can roll it out while cooking for good circulation and its farther from wall   then i roll it back under the counters when finished with meal cleaning   easy to clean the inner basket   i do it by hand with hot soapy water on dishcloth and rinse and dry with dishtowel   wipe the front to keep it free from greasy marks   i love the setting   controls are a touchscreen   no issues with it at this point   there is and air fryer facebook site that i check in regularly and they have recipes and tips   so glad i got this one and this sized one      
373,2.0,                       i quite like this air fryer  i had a smaller dial style model before  while i don t really use the bells and whistles on this one too much it has two major advantages over my old one  first  it has a greater capacity than the smaller one  second  the lift out basket is a game changer  easy to clean  however  there are airflow holes in the plastic front of the basket where food crumbs can get trapped  that s my only complaint  amendment  after nearly two months of use  some glaring flaws have come to light with this fryer  first problem is this thing beeps so loud you ll wake your neighbors  scares the pants off my poor dog  but the biggest issue is that the basket will never be clean  photo is after    minutes of hand scrubbing  the angle of the side vents prevents scrubbers sponges rags from reaching spots  enjoy cooking in a basket covered in rancid stuck on grease      
374,5.0,                       i loved this product and it was easy to clean   being single it is perfect for having a quick tasty meal  even from frozen   however after having it for only   months the pressure sensitive control pad to change time and temperature cooking has went out   i am in contact with the company now and will update this review when the matter is settled   i did have a   year warranty on it i want to update this review   cosori worked fast to resolve my problem and in two days have shipped a new product to me   you can t ask for better service than that         
375,3.0,                       the manual explaining how to connect to the mobile app and alexa is basically  just  wrong  so connectivity wise i d give it one star  however it fries well  so i ll up my rating to three to actually connect to your app     it does not use bluetooth  despite showing a bluetooth icon in the app and saying bluetooth in the manual  instead it uses wifi  so find the wifi network after pressing the button for   seconds  go from there you can not link to alexa if you try to  from the app  despite there being an option for it  and despite the manual saying that s how you do it  you have to start alexa separately and detect the device from the alexa app to get them linked  do not start in side the vesync app  it just ends up redirecting to a non existent web page    pretty sad      
376,1.0,                       ok first of all i never never post any review but i needed to get this off my chest  i have been wanting an air fryer for over a year  i finally decided it s time and ordered this one  mind you money is tight  due to covid and lay off  so i received it and tried multiple recipe and it does what it says but my issue is with handle and the circulator  the handle started to get lose within weeks of use  it s cheaply made  and the circulator gets dirty and brown  it s not easy to clean down there  i want my money back or another air fryer       this was supposed to be an investment for years to come  i m not even sure if it s going to last rest of the       cheaply made  just stealing people hard earned money  i m pissed     
377,1.0,                       this air fryer is complete garbage  it will stop connecting to the app and the buttons do not work  i have an expensive piece of plasric taking up a ton of space on my countertop and i can t turn it on  avoid at all costs      
378,5.0,                       i ve wanted an air fryer for years   decided on cosori because of the reviews and because the basket is square which makes it easier for fitting in more chicken nuggets or wings   it is truly remarkable and produces fantastic  crisp nuggets  wings and french fries or tater tots   cleanup takes seconds   i do feel the basket is durable  but it s good to know you can easily buy a replacement basket on line for a reasonable cost   i m      pleased with how easy it is to use  clean and how much of a time saver it is      
379,2.0,                       this is my first air fryer which makes me pretty new to the usage cooking  i am happy with the outcome especially chicken drumsticks breasts tenderloins turned out to be extremely juicy and soft french fries were not that great  lot of uneven cooking  but may be i added too many in one batch since it has a cake as one of the presetting i baked a banana nut bread  the texture was good but i am not very great at baking  so not sure if i am the best judge for this feature also tried veggie patty which turned out good crispy on the outside and softer on the inside smoke the back outlet emits too much smoke for each cooking  this makes the whole house smell of food  i have to leave one of windows open always when i am using the air fryer which is not very convenient smell after     usages i realized along with the smoke their is a particular smell that is emitted  something like when we reuse fried oil  i have been hand washing and then dishwashing both the containers after each use i turned the air fryer upside down to check the coil which was pretty much greasy cleaning  extremely extremely difficultto get rid of the smell i cleaned the coil and the around surface using water and brush  this was extremely difficult because the coil cannot be removed and there is no way to reach the center or anywhere near the fan  so i guess even if i clean the around area of coil the smell issue is still going to be there for me because of the cleaning hassle i will certainly not recommend this product  even if it cooks well       
380,1.0,                       the touch panelyou change the temperature and minutes is so finicky  don t waste your time     
381,5.0,                       update to my original review   cosori responded immediately to address my issues  they offered to send me a replacement unit which i had planned to accept  then i saw my son  who works a very late shift  starting to use the original one i purchased  i explained the problem and he said  mom  i ve been using it every night when i get home and no problem    so what i experienced must ve been a startup issue only  i ve used it several times since and i love it  easy to clean  easy to use  works just as the instructions state  great taste and again  hats off to cosori for excellent customer service original review   three times in a row  including first use  was trying to cook different meats  and it sets off my smoke detectors  i ve washed and rewashed the baskets  wiped down the inside of the cooking area  checked the heating element visually and see no food or grease spatter  second and third attempts it didn t make it through the pre heat cycle  cleaned everything again tried once more and with   minutes left in pre heat same result  can t use it  planning to return it      
382,5.0,                       i saw my sister in law use her two cosori air fryers and was impressed with how quickly and well they cooked chicken thighs  bacon  and brussel sprouts so i bought one   i made the best chicken schnitzel of my life with it  and the blackened broccoli that takes    minutes in the regular oven is perfect after   minutes  so we bought this second one and can make both meat and veggies at the same time  easy to clean and a delight to use      
383,5.0,                       i actually ordered a different air fryer first from another company as a gift for my mom  while i m sure that model would have been sufficient in it s own right  it turned out not to be quite what she was wanting  so i exchanged it and got this air fryer instead  to my pleasant surprise  it came much faster than i was expecting it would  and we put it to work that same day  we already had an air fryer cookbook  though this unit does come with it s own cookbook too  and made curried brussels sprouts for an after dinner snack  today we tried  fried  cheese curds  everything was simple and efficient to use  though we did find out that the display turns off when the baskets are removed   but it resumes again as soon as the baskets are reinserted   clean up is easy  and the digital display is clear and intuitive  i can see why this is so highly rated on here  i m excited to see what other recipes we can try in our new gadget   next up  sweet potato fries when my aunt comes to visit   it already has a permanent place of honor on our counter      
384,5.0,                       ii had previously written that i was disappointed with my cosori air fryer because the release button that separates the two baskets wouldn t work  well  they saw my post and called me  i didn t want to return the fryer  hassle  but they offered to send me two new baskets  i received them and it s like brand new again  thank you cosori for caring about customer satisfaction      
385,5.0,                       i recently had major surgery and a friend came to take care of me until i was able to take care of myself   my friend knew i was not a good cook  but he is  and said i really needed to get an air fryer  it would make my life a whole lot easier and my food would taste better  it s kind of a set it and forget it thing  i was showed photos of the food he made with his air fryer  chicken  wings  french fries  pork loin  etc  my cosoriu showed up the day he left and i have used it almost every day sin ce   three weeks  i believe it will prove to be one of the best purchases ever made  my favorite parts are  the pre heat setting  the beeping reminders to flip the food  the photo buttons that make decisions for me  i have not experienced one problem with it  so easy to use  i am eating better and my food doesn t take as much prep pr cooking time   how did i live without it      
386,1.0,                       do not buy this product  i researched all the air fryers on the market and cosori consistently came up as the highest rated  our cosori arrived last week and when we started it up  none of the buttons on the  touchscreen  worked when we touched them  nothing  the only way we could work the device was through the app   figured it was defective and returned it to amazon and received my replacement on thursday  just fired it up again and the same problem occurred  none of the buttons on the touchscreen work  we can t turn it on  preheat  change the temperature except when using the app   this can t be correct  how can this product advertise its easy to use  touchscreen when it doesn t work   it s nice to be able to operate remotely  but i d prefer to have a fully operational product  not sure if amazon has a bad batch of these  but we ll buy a ninja or phillips instead next time      
387,4.0,                       still getting used to it  going to try different food types   it cooks real fast   and pretty even browning  not bad at clean up after use  good for a busy family or a single person   i have the big one so i can put a lot of things in it       
388,2.0,                       i m not sure how this product has so many great reviews  first of all  the design is terrible  the button release is placed very horribly and you re likely to have an accident with it  and it will eventually break because it is cheap thin clear plastic the pre heat setting is garbage because after you have preheated it to the temperature you want  you will have to re enter your cook time and temperature after it s done  it won t remember it  that is very frustrating  food will either burn or not cook all the way if you have a lot of patience and money to waste a lot of food to figure out which settings work best for what food  then go ahead and try this  otherwise look elsewhere because i found it not worth it so far     
389,5.0,                       i got this air fryer recently and have already used it a ton  it does a spectacular job heating up frozen foods while keeping a good crispy crunchy feel  i ve tried a few of the recipes in the cosori cookbook and they ve all been great  the buttons on the fryer can be a little touchy  but other than that i have no complaints  i love that it s dishwasher safe and the wifi connection is nicer than you d think  specifically  i like that it sends me notifications when it s done preheating or time to flip or when the foods ready  it makes it super easy to do other things while you wait for the food  also  it s nice to be able to preheat from my room with alexa  the size of the tray is great too  the bigger the better   i ve cooked in a few other air fryers and it can be difficult to get a good cook with the smaller ones  and it s certainly difficult to cook for more than one or two people in the smaller ones  i d definitely recommend this fryer to anyone who wants a bit of a nicer fryer and with wifi control as a bonus      
390,3.0,                       product is great as far as cooking goes  problem is basket always pops out  first when i got it just a couple of times  now i have to put a weight  in front of it to keep it closed while i m cooking  totally at loss for words as to why i can t cook on manual now that wi fi is setup  buttons don t work anyway  since i forgot to hit send   was wondering why i never received a response   i ll add this now  the other day  forgot to put weight in front of basket  basket popped out again putting dinner on floor  and tiny bits of plastic broke off  dented pan  food had to be thrown away  i know i can t send it back now because it is dented and chipped  if you want an air fryer that cooks good this is it    if you don t mind the dents and chips you ll get and going the  extra mile   to ensure it doesn t pop out  or having a back up plan for dinner should your dinner end up on the floor and it was  just about ready   then this is the only fryer you will ever need until you get fed up with losing what ws gonna be a good dinner     
391,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          omg this thing is awesome   keto avocado fries     yummyvery happy that we went with the larger unit  and the first thing we cooked was an avocado parmesan crusted jo jo style fry   these were awesome will be using this much more in our house so much better than a deep fryer  in the recipe book it called for flour and breadcrumbs    i substituted and just used an egg wash  and grated parmesan cheese     keto life     
392,1.0,                       i bought this in late october about two months ago the screws started getting loose  i would retighten  as of two weeks ago two screws would no longer tighten and the basket stayed with one screw  well tonight that screw randomly popped off while taking out my food and the baskets separated  very annoying because some of my food fell  it s only been a few months and i barley use it  broke way to soon and this air fryer is expensive  so not worth it      
393,5.0,                       i replaced a larger air fryer with this one  just from an engineering perspective    this cosori air frier is far and away a better option  the two basket design which allows you to separate the inner basket from the outer one is so much more intelligent than the air fryer i had previously purchased which relied on an insert to keep food up and off the bottom of the basket  but the insert was removable and relied on seemingly nonfunctional silicon spacers which proved useless after only a few uses  you d try to shake the basket to re distribute food  and the insert would come loose requiring you to manually remove all of the food  and then re seat the floor  bottom  of the basket  with the cosori  the inner basket is completely removable from the outer basket making serving so much more convenient and when  shaking  the two baskets they stay together allowing for an easy redistribution of the food  such a clean design  easy to wash  wow  if you ve ever wanted to try out having an air fryer  i d suggest you try this on first  love a good product  dislike rip off under performers that cost me time and money returning them  also    cosori actually provides contact info and encourages you to use it in case you are having any kind of problem with their unit  that s customer service      
394,5.0,                       i read reviews and watched a few videos on different air fryers to see what the pros and cons where   decide on the cosori     qt for size  versatility and cost   we tried it out for the first time to cook sweet potatoes and then turkey burgers without cleaning the fryer   following the cook book that came with it word for word  they came out amazing   the burgers where full of juice when you cut into them   it was way easier than ever to use and clean up was simple   i can t believe how much cleaner the kitchen was compared to using a a cast iron skillet or traditional deep fryer   we are excited to try so many different meals and options in the new air fryer   we are a family of   and to make meals we may need to cook in it twice  however  it s that easy to prepare the foods and then cook them   i would definitely recommend this air fryer to anyone think of getting one      
395,5.0,                       my hubby and i just air fried our first steak filet mignon  we are excited   looking forward to eating salmon  fish  chicken and veggies in our new cosori air fryer   we absolutely love it  easy cleaning too    i did order parchment paper that you can use in the air fryer and a silicone dish that can also be used in the air fryer  have not used as of yet  it also came with a rack and   skewers for kabobs  yay    cant wait      
396,5.0,                       what can i say   so far i love this air fryer  i have used it to make crunchy breaded pork chops and they were delicious and took half the time and were way healthier than frying in oil  in fact we haven t had anything fried in years but with this fryer it looks like my husband will be getting his old favorites back  not only does it have the benefit of healthy dining but it takes less than half of the power it would take to use the conventional stove top or oven  i am pleasantly pleased and wish i had bought one sooner      
397,3.0,                       i have had the cosori air fryer xl for almost a year now pros  makes great food  chicken wings  fries  fish  potatoes  brussel sprouts  steak  pork chops  kabobs   that s what i ve made in there several times and love it  easy to clean  food comes out very flavorful  not dry  nor full of grease like with fried foods con  the outside began chipping a few months after using  the largest con however is the screw that keeps coming loose and has now completely fallen out from the handle  which is a huge safety hazard when handling this product hot  wish there was a way i could get that part or even the whole basket replaced  the chipping and screws coming loose  i took   stars away      
398,5.0,                       this is one of the best purchases i ve made with amazon  the cosori air fryer     itself is truly wonderful   i was afraid of bone in chicken breast drying out because i cooked them longer than suggested they were large  but they were crispy and juicy   my son would not eat chicken breast from anywhere bc he felt they were always dry  but he has changed his mind since using the cosori air fryer   we ve even roasted vegetables in it and they re beautiful and tasty   but it is the company s customer service that makes this purchase even better   i had an issue with the basket coming apart from the base  i contacted the company prepared to argue the issue and was in complete surprise when no defense customer interaction took place   they replied professionally and always courteous   they definitely understand that follow up is very important in customer satisfaction         
399,3.0,                       good price and all attachments and two year warranty    but my wife uses it  we had another brand that we gave away that worked great as a gift  we were going to buy the one on tv  but after reading reviews we found out they were junk and did not cook well   this one cooks slower with a little noise  sounds like a dishwasher   we will keep using it maybe what ever is rolling around inside it will stop  they are all made in china  might be a stowaway   update fix the noise  heating coils on bottom were touching  caused rattle when running  took screwdriver and pried the two apart slightly      
400,3.0,                       i was so in need of an air fryer  at first i thought this is to fancy for me  i mean why do i need it to have wifi    so i got it earlier than amazon said  bonus  i tried to set up the wifi and it wouldn t sync  after    minutes of trying i lost patience   i just need it to cook  it cooked everything to perfection the best thing about this air fryer is it cooks enough fries for   ppl at a time at     qt s  i also cooked   chicken breasts at a time downsides  outside of wifi set up   it s hard to operate when trying to open and separate the basket from the bottom  it s also hard to put back together   my teens  house full of boys  and husband will tear it up trying to use it because of the handling  the air fryer before this one was super simple      
401,1.0,                       air fryer stops a few minutes in and won t restart  we unplug it and let it cool and after it resets  it s starts cooking for a short period and stops  this has been a chronic problem for the month we have it but the problem keeps getting worse  the features and performance are great when it works  however it never works      
402,3.0,                       the fryer works great   once you get it started   like many others have stated  the touch pad is highly unresponsive and only certain buttons work   if you touch it just the right way   most of the time i just control it with the app  but not everyone in my household is tech savvy enough to download the app and control it this way i do like the app  it is handy to be able to start it from another room  or monitor the cooking time that is left as far as the taste and easy of cleaning  i think it does these things well   i just wish i had went with an air fryer that has real buttons or dials      
403,5.0,                       love  love  love our air fryer  my spouse who is not a cook loves the fryer so much he has actually planned dinners  looked up recipes  and went grocery shopping for home cooked meals   i came home from a long trip and was treated to a delicious steak dinner  the steak was juicy and tender and just delicious  it s user friendly and affective  our food has never over cooked  were recommend you check the food half way thru to check for doneness  it has a pause button so you can check the food   clean up is easy as well  we chose this air fryer because of the size and amount of food it can hold  there will be a little noise like air circulating but it s not overwhelming and doesn t bother us at all   happy with our air fryer and would recommend as an alternative to using the oven or frying pan     
404,4.0,                       if you haven t tried air frying yet  you ll be pleasantly surprised by how versatile and easy to use these things are  this is a good sized fryer with some nice presets for commonly cooked items outside of a few things for baking  i ve avoided the oven and cooked up some great meals with this fryer  from chicken breasts to crispy hash brown patties  you can cook up quite a variety and avoid unwanted grease the unit is easy to clean there is one big negative though   the buttons on the front are horrible  you power it up by pressing the power button repeatedly in the hopes that somehow your next push is the special one that makes it come on  often you re doing it so rapidly at that point and switching fingers that you double clutch and turn it on and off again only to have to try again some of the presets work every single time  but other times you have to jam on them and i have yet to figure out how to get it to respond to manually setting the temp time with the buttons in comes the app  right   well  yeah  sort of   it works fine if you want to use your phone and the app  however one huge flaw here is that you can only have   phone connected to it  so much for sparing everyone in the house the agony of using the sketchy buttons   the minute someone else added the fryer it disconnected my device outside of those nuances  i think it is a great appliance and i ve certainly gotten my use out of it  i wish they d offer a way to improve on my button pushing game before my finger breaks off      
405,2.0,                       i ve only had this air fryer for a month and a half    already had to put two screws back in on the basket which fall out in the food  well i didn t notice that another screw came out when i made salmon for a salad and i crunched on this screw tonight          
406,5.0,                       did a lot of research prior to purchasing this air fryer and man i am happy    funny enough  my   bestest girlfriends also bought the same af too  but i got the white   which  do not let the white stray you away  it is very easy too clean   i love everything i have cooked in this   their customer service is amazing   my basket had a problem with popping out  which apparently is common   i contacted them and with proof of purchase and some photos of the af itself  they send me a new basket   i also follow a fb group for well cosorians and it is great  i definitely  without a doubt recommend this   btw  i also have their newest air fryer oven and it is awesome as well      
407,5.0,                       i especially wanted to write this review  because i got mine and it didn t seem to close well from the beginning  wasn t flush on the sides  i thought well i just have to close it firmly  the first time i preheated    minutes in  the drawer flung out  hmmm i put it back in and continued on and still had to firmly close it every time opened  by the  rd time i m using it it will not close  even firmly  i got right on amazon and asked to return for a new one  just got the new one today and even though i haven t used it yet it closes so much differently  i m excited to try it out and so very thankful to amazon for exchanging it so quickly and with no fuss or muss  the two times i did cook in this   i have another kind also  i loved it  the clean up was so much better and quite a bit more room in the basket  i highly recommend the air fryer      
408,4.0,                       my first corosi air fryer was defective  amazon replaced it and this one works perfectly  i ve been trying to reach corosi s support help  both by their phone number and also their email  both without success  they don t answer phones now  but rather give their email address  which is non deliverable  can anyone say  frustrating       
409,1.0,                       buy the cosory airfryer xl     qt on february           and today november          only   months broke at the beginning i was content with the product  but today disillusioned with this product  do not recommend it to anyone absolutely to anyone     
410,2.0,                       i ll hit preset button for say   minutes and the food is still raw   the fryer will randomly shut off   when i turn it back on it just beeps until unplug it and start it again     
411,5.0,                       we have loved this since we got it right at about a year the front panal buttons stop working  i looked us the website and got ahold of a customer service agent  he asked for info and pictures  i assumed it would go nowhere  the next day i got a email that they were sending us a new one  it s refreshing to deal with a company that stands behind there product  thank you cosori for your hospitality we will be buying more of your products      
412,5.0,                       i have returned five air fryer ovens and one air fryer  pot  and have found the perfect air fryer in this one  it toasts bread bagels beautifully and is the easiest fryer i have used  no mess to clean like i had to with the oven air fryers  easy to clean  no sticking  perfect frying  so far i have made chicken wings  stuffed mushrooms  turkey burgers  bacon  and fish  i love it    finally   this one has everything i ve been looking for in an air fryer  presets for everything i cook  a drawer that captures drips and batter  non stick surfaces that come clean in soapy water  and clean cooking space  no drips on oven doors and bottoms   i highly recommend it      
413,4.0,                       it works great so far  the only problem i have with it is i follow the instructions to the t in their book and my items are still burnt  i ve made fries  and fried chicken  at first i thought i didn t have enough fries for the amount of time i choose but than i made the fried chicken exactly how the recipe book called and it was still burnt  the inside was extremely juicy and the flavor was great just wished they looked a little better  i ll keep playing with the time and tempature  overall i am happy though      
414,5.0,                       super easy to use and cooked perfectly  i made fried chicken and french fries for the first try  i simply used the presets and let it go the chicken came out perfectly cooked and juicy with crispy golden brown crust  no turning no bloody insides and no extra oil fries were super crispy and golden while still fluffy inside took   min for chicken and    for the fries all other recipes i have tried from the included book have been equally pleasing only con is that i don t have more than one    yet  as i had to cook the chicken and fries separately because of the quantity     but man this thing makes me want to sell all my other cookware and just get a few more of these      
415,5.0,                       i am new to air friers but happily stumbled upon buying this cosori a couple of months ago   i did carry it back and forth from the pantry for a couple of weeks but when i realized the functionality       lets just say it has has earned its place on my crowded countertop  i have fallen in love with this item   to be fair  there are only two of us so it is a perfect size for our meals   but the thing i love the most is cooking and containing the mess  especially meats   bacon is great example  both sides done evenly  in half the time and     the trouble  and the mess is contained   separate the basket  pour off the grease  i save it   rinse the tray and there is no bacon grease spattered over my stove  floor  cabinets and countertop   last night i did lamburgers in it  perfect   hamburgers  steaks  chicken all turn out great and tonight i m trying my first seafood   love my cosori      
416,3.0,                       heard air fryers are great  got the one my friend recommended which is super popular  eh  after a day wish i picked a different model  was expecting more  food cooks great  its functionality that is a bit disappointing     beeping is too loud and wakes people up     there should be separate up down for time and temp     with this unit you have to make it beep to choose which you want and then it beeps loudly each button press     is it possible to disabled beeper      google alexa integration   there is no option to keep food warm after it cooks     after getting to food you have to manually reheat it  kind of disappointing for an almost cool feature      
417,5.0,                       i was skeptical also about this but ordered one because high fat greasy food gives my insides grief  we tried the bbq chicken recipe the day it arrived and were happily surprised by how fast it cooked and the taste  we tried the regular fried chicken last night and were surprised again at how good it was  crispy but not greasy at all  i ll add more spices to the flour mix next time but it was really good   anxious to try others and i m sure this appliance will be on the frequently used shelf with the electric wok update  after a few uses the fryer would shut off and had to cool before coming back on  i emailed the company and they said that if i email them my info and a video of it misbehaving they d send a new one  i did do  and sure enough they sent me a new machine and said don t worry about sending old one back  so i d recommend the customer service too      
418,1.0,                       i received my cosori air fryer xl last night and used it  it was wonderful  very easy to use  easy to clean  and food quality is great  i hand washed both the basket and the liner last night after use  i went this morning to put them both back in and it keeps popping out and wont stay in  i called the cosori customer service number  but received an automated recording that no one was available  i left a message for them to call me back  i used it one time and now cant use it all and have to deal with the hassle of returning the air fryer      
419,5.0,                       pros  quick   convenient   consistent   cooks nicely   easy clean upsince purchasing the cosori max xl     qt  air fryer   weeks ago  my family has almost stopped eating at fast food establishments     because it s so easy and convenient to cook  we use it every day   several times a day it s worked like a charm   smile just place your food in the air fryer basket     set the timer based on the food type     and wait for the beep food result  crisp on the outside     tender on the inside   on some food items  it may take a couple of times to determine how long to cook a food item based on your personal taste   liking  after that  it smooth sailing   cooking      we strongly recommend this air fryer   it has really exceeded our expectations cons  none so far      
420,5.0,                       my boyfriend got me this air fryer for my birthday last september         i ve always been curious about getting one  but also try to keep my kitchen appliances low due to space limitations  welp  he ended up getting me the huge   quart one and i was a little taken aback  but definitely excited to use it and try it out what can i say other than i ve used this thing about     of the days since i got it  so easy to use and you can quickly make your fries  veggies  and even full meals  even a full rotisserie chicken    one of my favorite things to make is egg cups  in silicone muffin holders  for breakfast  we also make wings often  which the recipe in the book for the sriracha wings comes out perfectly anyway  so i ve had my amazing times with this air fryer and decided one day to let my boyfriend use it for making some chicken for burrito bowls  he pulled the basket out  and due to his inexperience of using it  he let it sit halfway in the air fryer instead of pulling it out fully and setting it on the counter  well  my life flashed before my eyes as i saw the baskets drop to the floor  i was able to somewhat catch it  but it still hit the floor pretty hard  now i m not sure if it was due to it being hot that it warped so easily from this  but both of the inside and outside baskets warped a bit from the fall  nothing major  it was still able to go back into the air fryer and no steam escaped  it was more of an aesthetic issue  it was then that i set off on my search for replacement baskets  while seriously reconsidering my relationship  i mean  it s like he broke a piece of my heart   only the internal basket was sold separately on amazon  this led me to reach out to cosori directly  and they actually offered to replace both baskets at no charge as a one time courtesy  i definitely wasn t expecting this since it was our fault the baskets warped and nothing to do with the product itself  but what amazing customer service now i can t guarantee they would replace another person s baskets due to damage done from their own error  but it was definitely impressive they offered to do it for me and i really appreciated it  you can definitely count on their customer service when purchasing this product  which is always important when getting a kitchen appliance and now  my boyfriend is going to be monitored a bit more closely when he cooks with it        
421,5.0,                       i decided to wait a little while before writing a review so i would have a chance to get use to using my airfryer and see if i like cooking in one  well  i love my cosori airfryer   i am glad i got the larger size  i think anything smaller would have been too small for my husband and myself  i made the best thin cut bone in pork chops today  crispy on the outside   tender on the inside   the only issue i have had is the small screws that hold the basket handle became loose and one screw fell out  fortunately i found the screw and small nut  i put it back and tighten the others up  something owners may want to check on their fryers  i still give it five stars      
422,5.0,                       how did i ever live without an air fryer   this appliance has literally replaced my oven ever since i bought it  i tend to relegate my appliances to a shelf or cabinet for the    x a week i use them    not this bad boy  he stays on the countertop because i literally use it every single day  every day  you think a recipe can t be made in this  think again  anything that should go in your oven can now go in the air fryer for a fraction of the time and use way less energy  my oven takes forever to heat up  and you know it s big in there  so cooking time can take a long while  all of that goes away with an air fryer  you get that great texture on your food and reduced cooking time  this machine is also super easy to use  super easy to clean and has all the easy buttons to make cooking whatever you re in the mood for simple  cannot recommend this enough      
423,1.0,                       i actually can t believe the amount of good reviews for this product  upon arrival i was excited to test this thing out only to find out that only one of the touch screen buttons work  maybe if the one button that worked was the  start  button i would be able to use it with wifi but otherwise this air fryer is completely useless  i will be sending it back and buying another brand      
424,3.0,                       i have never used an air fryer before   i purchased this one and decided to make wings on super bowl sunday   i used the preset  wing  function  which took    minutes  if i remember correctly    honestly  they came out exactly as if i had cooked them in the oven      not really impressed and not what i expected   i thought they would be crispy as in  deep fried crispy  or something at least similar   they came out the same as in my oven   not what i wanted or expected   i ll try some other items  or maybe not use the preset function and time them myself   i don t know   but so far definitely disappointed      
425,4.0,                       update           need to give credit where credit is due   the unit itself would randomly shut down during use   it was past the amazon return period so i reached out to the company via the email address provided with the unit   despite it being a saturday they quickly responded to my email requesting some additional information which i provided   within    hours they had responded with tracking information for a new unit on the way   so far i have used it twice with no issue   very impressed with how crunchy the food is using this thing       updated to four stars as the unit is working as advertised and the customer service exceeded my expectations old review bought this april  th   it now will not even turn on   cannot even return it   it s not heavy enough to be a boat anchor      
426,1.0,                       have had this for less than a year and used a handful of times each month  it is easy to use  annoying to clean  but all air fryers are   and we ve enjoy some of the recipes   but yesterday one of the screws that is on the inside where the food is heated fell out and got mixed into our food and we almost bit into it while we were eating  this could have broken our teeth or we may have swallowed a screw  while we enjoyed using this  we will not be using it again  just doesn t feel that great to use anymore after this      
427,5.0,                       i was skeptical about using air fryers  but it turns out really great  i use less oil than cooking in a pan  and it gives food crispy texture  i tried to make crab cakes  wings and potato wedges  they all taste pretty darn close to restaurants  one thing i love about this air fryer is they do all the math for you  therefore  food is not over cooked  juicy  tender and flavorful  they also include a booklet to inspire  you to pick  i never bake dessert before and i m gonna try to make homemade brownies soon  i m really glad that i pick the white color  very classy and elegant  i would put parchment paper in there before i fry next time because it takes me quite some time when you try to fry different food  overall i m satisfied with this purchase       
428,5.0,                       i just received this product   i have checked it out and i like what i see   i had a cheap unit which lasted for about   years   i could have still gotten by with it  but i wanted to upgrade   i like the new features on this air fryer   it seams to be easy to use   i like the square design better than the round one i had   i like that it has accessories that i can order for this unit rather than guess what items fit better   i have never considered a corosi unit until now   i used my old air fryer every day for something   toast  cooking  reheat  etc   i saw several recipes in the book that came with it that i had not seen before   i think i am going to love this unit      
429,1.0,                       i bought this for my mother for mother s day back in may as she had always wanted one  it arrived the day before  but to my disbelief they sent me a dehydrator instead  i immediately returned it  and had to wait another week to get the right product  when i did receive the actual product  the front panel was unresponsive and the device could only be operated via wifi  fed up  i immediately sent it back  that was almost two months ago  and i have yet to receive my refund or any clarity on when i might get it back  purchase this product at your own peril      
430,5.0,                       we ve been wanting an air fryer for several years  based on our research and reviews we decided to go with the cosori smart wifi air fryer    qt for a christmas gift to ourselves and wow it works like a champ   so very  very impressed  easy to operate  lots of good recipes  great online experience  etc etc  we pushed the limit of the     qt capacity and cooked a   pound chicken and it came out   thumbs up  we cannot say enough good things about it      
431,5.0,                       my first air fryer  and i have to say i love it  we are a household of two and the     qt size is perfect for us  i see no need to ever put it in the dishwasher  as the cleanup of the   pieces is quick and easy  the convenience of not heating up a big oven is wonderful for us  and everything i have tried so far has been good  i cooked salmon a few nights ago  and it came out perfect  the first dish i tried was chicken tenders  just evoo and spices   and they were great  i m a happy  satisfied customer      
432,5.0,                       i ve always been very skeptical about using these things  but being on a new diet i felt like maybe this was a better way to do it  this is absolutely amazing i don t know why i held out for so long  everything i ve cooked in there taste so much better than doing it on a conventional oven  i will say it s not better than my smoker but the convenience of being able to cook lots of things in a quicker amount of time and the fact that they re juicier than doing the oven it s so much of a bonus that i ve actually started using this more than my smoker  this was definitely worth it i haven t tried the wi fi feature part of it yet but everything else i have done it gets it all finished in the first shot  warning large items that are frozen may take a second run through  but definitely worth it     
433,5.0,                       the air fryer is really what everyone says it is  cosori is a great brand and the build quality is actually pretty great considering the price  the led touch screen is super responsive and thankfully behind a layer of plastic covering  which is embedded so you can t peel it  which means you don t have to worry about the painted settings like other air fryers have  biggest bonus  the basket is a square  this means you can fit more of the foods you love without stacking them unfortunately for me  after   months of use the basket bucket wouldn t click into place and kept shifting out  the good news  i called cosori and explained the issue    min phone call  and they said they would send a replacement  huuuuuge plus to be able to have a company that responds that quickly and painlessly  customer service is a  if you ever have any issues      
434,2.0,                       this has been a long time coming   honestly i love how these things cooks  it comes with a very helpful recipe book and it looks really nice  the reason for the bad score is because of the build quality  the screws keep falling off which makes the basket fall apart  the screw comes off when i wash it and would fall in the garbage disposal  i am already missing one screw the air fryer basket is lose even after i try to tighten it  it s just irritating    it shouldn t be coming lose if the build quality was there  this is one of the more expensive air fryers so i would expect it to be built sturdy but sadly that is not the case         
435,1.0,                       this air fryer has a great front panel control  in comparing to other models it s easier to use  but it warped considerably after putting the basket in the dishwasher  the description says it s dishwasher safe   however  the worst thing about this fryer is the smell  i did the normal practice of burning off any chemicals upon first use but after using it for about    times the smell is horrible and it gets into the food  something not adding up     
436,5.0,                       i seriously love this thing  this fryer is super useful  easy to use and has allowed my family to make some of our go to fried items at a much healthier approach  it cooks up hot wings in no time that are juicy  crispy and retain flavor   we ve cooked up bacon and it came out so perfect that we no longer cook it on the stove due to splatter mess and over whelming smell  note  there is a real great youtube fryer community online that teach you how to cook up some delish food in a fryer in less tha n       mins i ve bought two as gifts and felt good knowing i gave them a legit gift that will be used and loved as much as i love mine     liter unit         
437,2.0,                       i ve had the fryer for almost a year and it cooks wonderfully but the buttons for temperature and time selection have never been reliable and generally  been non  responsive  alexa sometimes works but mostly responds with a question about alarm com  i would highly recommend air fryers  but not this one until they make the buttons more responsive  i have been using the pre set buttons and just trying to get approximate time and temps to match directions  but it is really frustrating      
438,5.0,                       i bought this for my husband  about a month ago  xmas       who likes to cook and he loves this machine  it checks all the boxes  easy to use  easy to clean and food tastes better  we have a large professional type oven range  non convection  and it is just not that practical when cooking for just two people most of the time  he has cooked a variety of foods and everything has turned out great  i would say so far  the steak has been the best  i am used to cooking on a gas grill and the steak cooked in this machine is better  he bought some of the accessories for it  the wire rack is great because it seems to allow for a better convection process  i like the fact it stores easily in a cabinet  i have a modern style home and prefer to leave the countertops uncluttered  highly recommend this product      
439,5.0,                       i wasn t sure what to expect with this it s basically a high speed convention oven which cooks very evenly  and does a very nice job of crisping  i have tried a variety of meals  and everything has come out great  fish  chicken wings  eggs  garlic bread  steak  you name it you do have to manage your expectations though  you re not going to get deep fried flavour out of this  because the food doesn t sit in the oil  it does an ok job  but it s closer to baked than fried  fries potatoes come out somewhere in between baked deepfried  there s also no tossing mechanism  so the food doesn t rotate on its own i also continually underestimate how fast it cooks food  i have routinely started it  and then started working on sides  only for it to finish far faster than whatever else i m doing  i m honestly considering getting two of the things just so i can do two things at the same time utterly simple to clean  i just throw the tray in the dishwasher overall  i m amazed at the utility of this thing  i ve used it every day since i got it      
440,5.0,                       what do i like about it    the size and shape make it convenient for cooking  those round one reduce the space inside of the unit  this one has decent size for cooking   the ease of use   the pictures for the presets make it easy to use and you have the option of increasing the temperature or time  if needed   the food comes out great in a shorter period of time   although the unit is very easy to clean the only exception is trying to clean the fan unit   you have to make sure you clean as much of the grease that can adhere to the top  there than that the clean up is great  i have a foodi grill that my children bought me but  i go to this unit first because it is much more lightweight and easier to clean   i don t leave appliances out on my counter so that is one reason it gets used more   all in all  i am very satisfied with this unit      
441,1.0,                       i loved my air fryer  it cooked things perfectly  until it didn t  i went to use it tonight and my air fryer won t come on  checked the outlets  the basket  unplugged and replugged it and nothing worked  go to look at the return policy to see if i could give it another chance and just get a replacement or get a refund but my    day return period ended yesterday  needless to say i m very disappointed because of the price of this and how little i actually got to use it  looking at what i will have to do to take advantage of the warranty doesn t even seem worth the trouble of returning it to the manufacturer  really sad that it didn t end up working like it should have and that i m now stuck with a dead appliance that i hardly got to use      
442,3.0,                       i was super excited to order this because there were so many great reviews a lot of purchases and we have a cosori electric teapot at my office which works beautifully  has a great design and a great look  i thought this would be great too  i love the little black box that sits on my counter top  it s a nice looking appliance  the noise level is average compared to that of a microwave  it s easy to use except that the buttons do not always work  i sometimes have to turn the power off and start over because the up down buttons do not register  the screws for the basket have to be tightened continually  otherwise  they fall out while youre cooking  shaking  the basket  i actually had to tighten the screws inside the tray  the part the basket sits in  when putting it back together this morning  yes  the teflon coating is starting to peel off already  its dishwasher safe but i m not happy with the way it cleans up  it still looks dirty and maybe that s just how it is  one of the biggest issues was that we had to start propping the drawer  basket  shut with out vitamix  it would continually pop open at random times while we were using it  now that i have been tightening the screws on a regular  we have not been having that issue as much  in reading a lot of the reviews and looking at photos  i m quite certain that our handle will probably break soon too  i know it has not been a year yet since our purchase  but i am already looking for a replacement  it makes good veggie tots though  my favorite thing to air fry next to beer battered fish      
443,5.0,                       we received our codori air fryer three days ago  in that time we ve used it as many times for fried squash  chicken legs  and baked potatoes   yes  baked potatoes    this thing prepares excellent baked potatoes that are fluffy inside with a wonderfully crispy skin   my wife and i love baked potatoes and trust us on this  this fryer makes the best baked potatoes ever  four hundred degrees for    minutes  put some oil on the potato  some garlic powder  and sea salt  then stick em in the fryer   the fried squash was amazing  the chicken legs succulent  there s been absolutely no mess around or under the machine  totally easy to clean  determination could be measured by the means to which you d have to go to get this machine away from us      
444,5.0,                       it is quicker than the oven and does not heat up the entire kitchen  this is welcome in california  the flavor is equal if not superior  the results are more consistent than our oven  it is easy to use and we are finding ourselves using it more and more   if you need to prepare for a large dinner party the oven is still the better choice because you can cook more of something at the same time instead of in batches   buy with confidence      
445,5.0,                       i had been looking at air fryers for about a year or so  trying to decide if i really needed another kitchen appliance taking up space in my kitchen   would i use it enough to justify buying one   i looked at quite a few air fryers in the process of trying to make up my mind   it became clear to me that if i was going to get one  it needed to be a larger one to make it worth it   i had never heard of cosori before  but it was an amazon s choice and had good reviews   i liked the look of it and that it had a more squared basket than round   it was a little more money than i had initially wanted to spend  but i went for it   so glad i did   i love this thing   it is so easy to operate and clean  and food tastes great and cooks so quickly   it s my new toy   it seems to be well made  but i got an additional year on the warranty when i registered it  just in case    i ve made chicken twice  steak  asparagus  eggplant  and broccoli twice   very pleased with the results   like my instant pot  i wish i would have bought one sooner      
446,5.0,                       i like how well this air fryer makes wings and sweet potato fries  i would recommend this for foods u would normally deep fry     
447,3.0,                       this unit does not allow for reprogramming of the preset buttons  through the control panel or the app  so you cannot customize temperature  time  or shake reminders for the preset buttons   other units allow you to reprogram the panel buttons   within the app  there is no way to add a shake reminder to custom recipes  this is a silly oversight the unit does not have a physical power switch  so the only way to turn it off is to reach behind the unit and unplug from the wall the unit has no filter on the exhaust port   as a result  i find i have to use it under the vent hood which means setting it up on the stove  and thus not being able to use the stove       
448,5.0,                       i am blind and use this air fryer  now some of you may be thinking how does one use this device if it s a touch screen and they are blind  well i control it via the vesync app on my iphone with my phones screen reader called voiceover i really like it  the basket is big enough to where i have experimented putting frozen dinners in it if they will fit  most turn out well but some frozen dinners were not made to be cooked in an air fryer  but hey that s the beauty of experimenting recommend      
449,5.0,                       it takes a little longer to cook than a traditional fryer and is a little smaller than i d like  however  i am amazed at how good it works  i have always been skeptical of air fryers so i bought this model for what seemed a fair price to try it out and see what all the hype was about  the results far exceeded my expectations and now i wish i went with a bigger device  but not knowing if i d like it or if it worked how i d hoped i didn t want to sink a lot of money into one   well worth the money  perfect for a couple or small family  but we have a family of six so it gets tricky making several batches  still super impressed at the food  it takes a little trial and error to get things just right  the auto function buttons are very helpful for desired foods  it even has an alarm to tell you when to shake the basket  clean up is amazingly simple  much easier than my deep fryer      
450,5.0,                       love not having to heat up the oven  energy cost savings   to roast a few veggies or to heat up things that you really don t want to do in a microwave  pizza  bread  etc   we use it nearly everyday  easy to use  i m constantly trying new things in it  easy to search on google for temp time settings for nearly anything you want to fry  bake or roast  for heating up frozen fried foods  you don t need to add any oil at all  i do recommend lining the basket with aluminum foil when possible for easy clean up and immediate re use without washing  note  the   screws that hold the handle onto interior exterior basket do come loose so you ll need to use a small screwdriver to tighten them up  discovered this when one fell out  suggest you check these occasionally and tighten so you won t find a loose screw   pun intended        
451,5.0,                       i paid     for it during black friday deals so i think it s a     stars  if i were to pay the original price i d probably give it   stars instead  very easy to use and i like the smart phone app option  but  the plastic smell when used really bothers me  every time i turn on the fryer a strong plastic smell comes out and it sometimes smokes my eyes  it s getting a lot better  but it s taken more than    uses to get here  i checked lots of reviews and qas here  the seller suggested running the fryer at     degrees for    minutes  or soak the plastic in vinegar for    minutes  my friend who has the same model told me she ran the machine outside a few times before she took it in  i tried all the above and overall it took me more than    times to finally feel the smell is acceptable    i think it s slowly going away  but just be ware        
452,5.0,                       everything works like a charm  food tastes great  large basket for just about anything  presets make it super easy  price is unbeatable and the best part the clean up  so easy  this is the one to get in my opinion  i know there s a lot of them to choose   i know i was determined to get one from emeril l  but when i saw this  the price  the features well   keep shopping and keep looking but i tell you the basket is a lot bigger then most brands  good luck     
453,5.0,                       are you kidding  i cannot believe there is an air fryer such as the cosori     quart  i have only used it to fry tilapia fish with fries so far and believe me  i will be using this fryer for     of my cooking  the outside dimensions are great and especially the inner bucket to hold the food  very nice styling  it looks great on the countertop  it is very solid  very well made  the touch screen features are excellant to fry foods  the cookbook that is included is tremendous      
454,4.0,                       pros    super easy to cook    large baskets    easy to use and understand    app compatible    easy to clean cons    control panel is not very responsive    gets very hot overall great entry air fryer for anyone interested  after getting this i do not use my own oven anymore  its just so much more faster cooking this way and fried food tastes better   cleaning is easy since the basket comes in two pieces  my only problem is the control panel is a little hit or miss  you need to push a lot  overall great piece for any kitchen      
455,5.0,                       this is a large piece of kitchen appliance  it was much larger than i thought it would be  it takes up a large space on the counter it works extremely well  the rectangular basket holds a surprisingly large amount of anything  it cooks things just as well as baking in the oven  but just a few minutes quicker  and also using less energy i m still trying new recipes  but so far everything i have tried to cook in it has come out absolutely delicious and  most importantly  free of the cooking oils i d need for pan frying the only real downside it the pans are so large i can only fit the pans in the dishwasher with nothing else  a small price to pay for good food      
456,5.0,                       i burned the first   or   things we cooked in here because it just cooks way faster than the instructions say  i ve found the cooking temp to be about    degrees less than the oven and cooking time to be     to     of oven  just keep in mind you can always put something back in to cook longer but you can t come back from overcooked or burnt  now that we ve adjusted we are loving how fast it cooks and that everything comes out juicer and more flavorful than deep frying  with the danger  mess  health concerns  and without heating the house up using the oven  highly recommend air fryers in general and i think we made a good choice in picking this one      
457,5.0,                       the cosori air fryer is a quality unit with many desirable features  the size is very accommodating  though it fits well and attractively on the counter  display is easy to read and it is a breeze to clean i was most impressed with the customer support which is willing  eager  and knowledgable to assist you  a rarity in today s retail economy if you are considering the purchase of an air fryer  i highly recommend this unit      
458,5.0,                       my daughter had been very positive about using an air fryer even though she had a smaller one than this model  i decided if it was going to work out well for me that i wanted a larger one to handle more meal options  i decided on this model from cosori cp    f     qt model i could not be happier with my purchase as i m using the fryer almost every day for either main courses or sides  i have yet to cook something in it that wasn t as good or better in the fryer than previous methods     usually better  having a crisp outer surface with a juicy interior makes so many foods better have done everything from fry frozen food such as french fries and egg rolls to grilled cheese sandwiches to hot dogs to fried rice to filet mignon  the cookbook that comes with the unit has a number of recipes that are now in our routine for meals such as chicken parmesan  google is your friend for finding air fryer recipes i thought fryer would mainly substitute for the microwave and provide better  heated up food   it does that and so much more  would have never thought i d be doing so many main courses in the fryer  and the fact that it cooks faster than a traditional oven is also a plus i did bump into problem with bolts loosening in the handle that others have experienced  i would encourage you to check their tightness on occasion  had tightened them once when loose  but the upper bolt in handle came out and the bolt for it is located inside handle and could not get it in position to repair  i contacted customer service  and provided the requested information  a new inner basket handle was delivered fedex at no charge just   days after reporting the problem  communication from customer service was outstanding from initial reporting to providing a tracking number for the replacement part i cannot compare  the fryer to other models or brands as this is the only one i ve used  but am very impressed with this cosori model and their customer service      
459,5.0,                       to be frank  i thought this was one of those gadgets that they sell on tv and it disappears after a while since it doesn t really do anything or solve any problem as they claim but to my surprise  this has been one of the best investments that i made in my kitchen  i bought this on a daily deal and used it after a couple of weeks of buying it being still sceptic of it s abilities when i used it first time  it blew my mind  not fried  but fried  it was like   i can t believe it s not butter  make sure that you buy the biggest version though since     was barely enough to put a whole chicken in it  so buying a smaller version is not a good idea      
460,4.0,                       i love it  frying without oil   who can not love it  capacity is a bit modest  but that s a known deficiency of this type of fryers  i bought it at        only a few weeks ago  now the price is          a whopping  about     price increase  i was going to buy one for one of my family members  but that s not going to happen at a     price increase      
461,4.0,                       what i love food comes out great  didn t think i d like from scratch fries in here but they really do get crispy with very little oil  love it for that  i use it mostly to get my kids quick meals like chicken nuggets and fries or taquitos  texas toast  frozen pizza  crisp up asparagus  it s a great size to get enough food for     people  def not a full meal but a side  tried roasting a chicken but wasn t as moist as i like it to be  perfect an oven for roasting chicken  but i absolutely love the kabob skewer it came with  my daughter loves the kabobs and made me make it for her for about   days straight the bad side the basket is super tricky to clean  time consuming  also the tray the basket sits in has a screw that constantly gets looks and causes the basket to sit funny and allow to much steam escape when getting g hot  now the screw seems to be over screwed if that makes sense and is loose all in all  i love it and i am an air fryer lover now  maybe down the road when i need a new one i ll probably try another brand but i bought this because it was inexpensive and it came with an additional gadget  but it really is great      
462,5.0,                       i am really loving this air fryer  it s the first and only one i ve tried so i can t compare it to anything else but so far i am very impressed  first of all  i love the shape of it  i ve seen other fryers that were circle  and for some reason i never liked it  so i m really happy this is square  second  it s sooo easy to clean and it s dishwasher safe which is a plus  lastly  it makes cooking soo much easier and faster  so far i have only cooked regular potatoes and sweet potatoes but i can t believe how easy it is  cut it up  drizzle some olive oil  put it in the air fryer and forget about it  the potatoes come out crispy and delicious  can t wait to try more things       
463,3.0,                       machine works perfectly   haven t even used its wifi  however if you don t deep fry foods anyway  you won t appreciate this machine   it does what my oven and broiler do  place meat on a wire grate inside my shallow roasting pan and voila   grease drips off meat into roasting pan  calories reduced i still must marinade or heavily season meat  fish and seafood or it will still taste bland if i just air fry it   i don t use salt because i help control our high blood pressure we bake fries  muffins  etc in the oven   why spend      for another counter space grabber  okay so this machine doesn t  heat up my kitchen    but that s only an issue in the summertime ehh   jury is still out re air fryers      
464,3.0,                       fryer has a large capacity and is easy to use  recipe book not fancy  but with enough to get really started  clean up is no sweat   finding other recipes that will challenge this fryer   have no doubt that it will be capable  three stars because box left by driver in front of garage and not on front porch  where items are usually left  exposed to the elements or theft  poor form      
465,2.0,                       have used this   days in a row and made   different dishes  disappointed to report that this machine is not made to be used immediately and nothing in the instruction manual advises to  condition  the machine before use  after reading all of the negative reviews i realized this machine should be turned on  as if being used but with no food inside  for about   hours  for the disgusting manufacturing plastic smell to go away  the first meal i made was bacon wrapped chicken and roasted potatoes and the smell was horrendous but the food tasted fine  the next day when reheating the food for lunch all of it tasted strong of plastic  i used the machine the next day to male pork chops again the smell too strong to bare  it even over powers the aroma of food you re making and this time the pork chops tasted like the plastic ass soon as it was ready  i m  conditioning  the machine now  i ve turned it on to     and letting it stay on at    minute intervals to see if this helps     
466,5.0,                       this is a great unit   i ve bought and returned an air fryer before and i ve borrowed my mother in laws   both units were a pain in the arse to clean even though they made great food   i decided to get this unit because it was lower price around prime day thinking i d probably have to return this too if cleanup was too much   we ve used this air fryer at least    times or more since having it over last few weeks   each time the food has been great and the cleanup has been simple this is worth the cost the cookbook has been quite helpful as well for both ideas on what to cook in it and as a guide for cooking times on stuff you normally cook in a big oven   no longer do we need to heat up the big oven to cook a few chicken tenders or heat up some other small item   you do have to be careful and write down times  for future cooking  as this device has cooked these items much faster than my big convection oven      
467,4.0,                       this is a pretty new addition to our kitchen  and it s going to take a little bit of time to get used to cooking with it  as with all new things   the few things we have tried have turned out great  but i did overcook the steaks there are two reasons it doesn t get   stars    it s noisy  the fan which circulates the air inside the cooking basket is definitively noisy    the touch panel at the front seems like cheap plastic  response to touch isn t great  and it gives if you push a little hard      
468,4.0,                       there is not much to say for this air fryer  it does its job very well and the cookbook it comes with is definitely a plus  i only have two negative things to say about it    the buttons are touch sensitive and do not always detect a button press on the first try  often times i find myself pressing the buttons multiple times to get it to sense that i m touching it  it can get annoying over time    the handle comes loose over time and needs to be tightened  it s not difficult to tighten but it is always going to be something to watch out for when using the appliance other than that it s still a good product and worth a buy      
469,5.0,                       we ordered the cosori smart wifi airfryer for my dad for christmas and we have been nothing but impressed so far  it takes a little trial and error to determine how long foods should cook to be at your preferred crispness  but once that s figured out perfect every time  we have made both frozen foods  french fries  tator tots  etc   and fresh foods  breaded chicken cutlets   both exceeding our expectations for crispy outside and warm  well done insides  we have found that some foods are just better with a little olive oil sprayed on  but it still feels so much more healthy eating these foods without putting them in the deep fryer the shake reminder is an excellent feature of this device  as you can walk about and do something else and hear when you must move the food around  my dad really enjoys being able to preheat adjust the airfrying using the amazon alexa overall  happily surprised with the quality of this product and it ended up being the best christmas present of the year      
470,1.0,                       so i loved this air fryer  loved it  had it since may of        but what sucked this week was as you can see in the picture the plastic pieces melted off   and i don t know how long the plastic was melting  possible into our food   it s all metal basket  but the piece that connects is plastic  this really could have been avoided with all metal pieces   other then that it was a good air fryer   best one i have used and i got another one for a friend back in feb  just bummed about it breaking         
471,5.0,                       i use this for everything     everything made in this air fryer taste so much better then when they are made in other wats  super super easy to use and very easy to clean   if you don t have this your missing out      
472,3.0,                       the basket is falling apart after   months of owning this cosori air fryer  i would have given it   stars if it was easily repairable but the handle would need to be taken apart to place and tighten the screw and secure it back into the washer      
473,1.0,                       i purchased this air fryer at the end of march  it recieved excellent reviews so i had high hopes for it  i think the manufacturing of the production batch for my unit was substandard  it s the only reasonable explanation for these issues  after a few uses  the touch screen buttons became unresponsive  requiring me to press the desired function up to   times before it would register  next  a screw fell out of the fryer basket  there was no way to rescrew it in manually  the other   screws needed to be tightened using a phillps head screwdriver after every use  now the prongs that hold the basket closed no longer engage to keep the basket securely in place  when the fryer works  with way too much tinkering  the food is great  i really wanted to love this fryer but it is a safety hazard  the fryer is not usable  i am requesting a replacement      
474,5.0,                       i have only used this a handful of times since purchasing it  but i m definitely impressed  it cuts down on cook time by half  if you read and follow the directions you shouldn t have any problems at all  it s very user friendly and the baskets inside are super easy to clean  i love the size   the first time i used it i fit   perch fillets in it and they cooked with no problem  also works great for just a small meal for two  the chicken quarters i made last night would have taken over an hour in my oven  they were done in    mins in the air fryer and i even forgot to preheat it  i can t wait to try a small roaster  also  the recipe book that comes with it has a nice variety of recipes  some vegetarian  desserts  appetizers  etc      
475,5.0,                       the best kitchen gadget i ve ever purchased  ever   i love cooking  and i love frying chicken  fries  tempura vegetables  even fried hispanic sweets  but i do have to eat healthier  and this replaced my old  aged frier you can cook almost anything in this  i ve cooked frozen chicken breasts and wings in this  and it leaves them juicy and crispy in       minutes  i even cook bacon in this and it leaves it just as crunchy and the oil drains into the bottom tray  so there s little clean up  i ve even made carne asada in this  grill cheese sandwiches  grilled veggies  and even chocolate cake come out incredibly great out of this  i even baked cookies in this i love it  love it  love it               
476,5.0,                       i watched a youtube video by prohomecooks and it was a fun video where this home chef cooked a variety of stuff and they all turned out great   but i bought the airfryer and couldn t get the basket to come out   so i contacted them   this company has the best support i ve ever encountered   for weeks they supported me while i struggled to make the product work   and it works great thanks to their support   sticky basket    it now works   but more than that  they immediately contacted me every time i wrote an email with a question   when was the last time this happened to you   i tend to write some scathing reviews because companies don t care once we buy the product  this company does      
477,4.0,                       this is my third air fryer   all three have had their pro s and con s   this one seems to cook very well   the basket is shallow with maybe a little larger surface area than the others   there is no need for a deep basket with these air fryers   there is one problem with this model imo   the start pause button is right next to the power on off button   on several occasions i have pushed the basket in   set the temp  set the time and then pushed power on off by accident   so this ends up being something like    button pushed all for not   this is extremely frustrating   the power on off button should be located on the upper left or right of the panel  not right in the middle   poor design   otherwise the unit works very well      
478,5.0,                       i love this air fryer  bought it on sale on cyber monday  it s large  larger than i had anticipated  although i understand the measurements are printed right there for all to see  so not for people with tiny kitchens unless you are ok getting it in and out of a storage cabinet  easy to use  big basket  and gets the job done  the only thing i don t love is the digital interface  it s not as helpful as it could be  for example  you use the     buttons to adjust temperature and time  but you don t know which one is getting adjusted until you see the numbers change   produces great quality food and it s very easy to clean      
479,1.0,                       this product is not what i expected  let me start ny saying this thing is huge  it takes up way too much counter space  it feel cheap and flimsy  the basket has a latch and then a button you have to press to separate the two pieces and it gets jammed  overall  i was not pleased with this product      
480,1.0,                       i was so excited to get this but then once it came  realized this isn t something a large family can use  i have a family of   and unless i want to feed my family in shifts then we cannot ever use this  great for   people though      
481,5.0,                       i used my previous air fryer out   this one is so pretty on my counter  works great  and cleans up easily   only suggestion is for new buyer  put it outside after opening and washing  then run it at     degrees for about    minutes  burns any of the chemical smell off   bring inside and enjoy   it makes the best veggies      
482,5.0,                       i read a lot of the recent reviews about defective units  i was pretty worried about it but my unit turned up fine  it s been fun learning new recipes to try out on the air fryer  i ve been bored cooking everyday during this pandemic and this has made the process more exciting    the air fryer came with a recipe book and it works as expected  i would recommend this to anyone looking for an air fryer      
483,4.0,                       great product and cooks everything perfectly and as described  i do have one small gripe though   if you re not using this with your phone  the ease of use is not the best  the buttons are not the easiest to press and there is a small learning curve  also  only one person can be connected at a time   when my girlfriend cooked last  and i try to use it with my phone  it will automatically hook up to the last person to use it  so you have to reset the wifi by holding the wifi button for a few seconds and reconnect with a new person  annoying  if you only plan on having one person use it  and you like smart products than this thing is fantastic  also  they provide some great recipes in the app as well  lastly  it s just a pretty appliance  i like the way it looks  guaranteed      
484,5.0,                       easy to use  easy to clean  easy to love  my first day i made honey sriracha wings  sweet potato fries  and coconut shrimp with a sweet chili sauce  hey  it was hockey night so we needed finger foods    tonight i made crispy  delicious and nutritious brussels sprouts that my family loved  it s easy to use  easy to clean  has tons of helpful presets  and looks beautiful in my kitchen  my existing kitchen appliances welcomed cosori with open arms      
485,5.0,                       amazing product   i ve been thinking about getting an air fryer for awhile  i spent a few hours researching and ultimately decided on the     cosori  based on the positive reviews  features   reasonable cost  i used it to make chicken legs tonight  they cooked perfectly in    min and were delicious  cleanup was    min   this was my first time using an air fryer   it couldn t be easier  i will use this often   no more concern that it will be one more appliance that gets tucked away in a cabinet   highly recommended      
486,5.0,                       best small appliance ever   i have owned mine for   months now and can honestly say it is worth every penny and more  i use mine almost every day  i cook for   or    so i am able to cook both proteins and veggies at the same time  very easy clean up and so versatile  as you can fry  bake  grill  roast and as a notorious grill cheese burner  i can swear to you  that you wont ever burn a sandwich again  it really is a great healthy option for cooking   i have been keto for   years and missed  crunch  in foods   but not anymore  thank you corsori   for this game changer    i can t wait to receive the new toaster oven type one that i am getting for my bfs house too  ps  corsori has thee best customer service ever  if you need them and an amazingly fun fb group to help you along the way      
487,1.0,                       i wanted to love my cosori air fryer so bad  i purchased the white one  which looked very nice and was the perfect size to cook food for a family of    i liked the recipe book  and the settings made cooking super easy  i was so disappointed however that there was a terrible plastic smell  the odor was so overwhelming that we had to open windows to get the smell out of our house   i returned it and purchased the stainless steel bagotte air fryer  the switch was worth the inconvenience   i m so much happier with my new purchase      
488,5.0,                       i wasn t really sure that spending the money on an air fryer would be worth it  after reading reviews  talking to people who have  and love  air fryers  i decided to give it a try  this fryer was one of the best i could find and the price couldn t be beat on prime day  i am so happy with this purchase  everything we have made in this fryer has come out even better than we ever thought it would  even baked potatoes are amazing cleaning couldn t be easier   pop out the cooking basket and both the basket and the bottom of the fryer are easily wiped clean it seemed overwhelming trying to figure out what could be made in an air fryer  but i m slowly coming to realize that everything can go in there  this fryer has buttons for some things  like bacon  making it even easier to use i can t say enough good things about this and highly recommend adding this to your kitchen      
489,5.0,                       i did a lot of research before buying and it came own to this and one other  i m satisfied with my decision and glad i finally got an air fryer  having fun with it   i read some reviews that condensation puddles along the bottom and i see that to be true  but it so minimal  who cares  why complain about that  i ve also seen comments that it smokes sometimes  this is true  it depends how much oil is in the air fryer  the more oil  the more smoke   i m still learning how to use it  so far  it s easy to use  i like the square basket  it s super easy to clean  no complaints other than for this price  they should have included some extras  i ve seen other cosori models with the dehydrating racks or skewers   it should have come with some  toys  instead of trying to charge us     more for those things   because at the end of the day  this product is probably not so dissimilar to a     air fryer  except that it has the square basket and it s overall footprint is small for it s capacity   the cookbook is handy only from the standpoint of giving you an idea of time temperature for things   but those are easily googleable      
490,1.0,                       while this does a great job cooking food  today when using it i flipped the chicken and noticed the non stick had come off and was sticking to my food  further inspection showed the bottom portion delaminating from the basket  who knows how long this has been flaking into my meals     i m very bothered by this and can t recommend the unit as that s a serious health hazard      
491,5.0,                       love this unit just beeps beeps beeps too loud    easy fix though  unplug and make sure it s cooled off     remove the top  it s just held down with plastic clips so a butter knife around the edges and pry up     look inside  again   make sure this is unplugged    you ll see a small round black speaker with buzr next to it  just put a little sticker or tape over the top     replace the top by just pressing it back down and that s it  a very nice low volume beep      
492,5.0,                       i purchased cosori af on          thru amazon  the reviews were outstanding  i didn t consider any other brands  i haven t used it a lot but i had a couple of issues with the performance of the unit  i joined a face book group for cosori air fryer recently which is super helpful with recipes and using the af  with my af having some issues and almost a year after purchase i thought i was just going to throw out the af  i contacted support cosori com  one day ago  sent some pictures  receipt etc and told them my issues with the af  they were outstanding  quick to respond  they are replacing my air fryer immediately  all within    hours of contacting them   i am so impressed with cosori customer service  they truly stand behind their product  i would highly recommend doing business with cosori and join the fb cosori air fryer group and you will be making wonderful meals  i see why cosori is a top rated air fryer with amazon      
493,5.0,                       my first air fryer and definitely not disappointed  this thing works great  i love having crispy fries  fish sticks  chicken nuggets  chimichangas  etc  i ve made a few the recipes in the book it came with and yum  great for cooking salmon  pork chops  and of course fried chicken  i ve adjusted a few of the recipes as the cooking time needed a little adjusting for the thickness but that was expected  try parmesan garlic asparagus in this  just need some oil  garlic salt  parmesan and of course asparagus  about   minutes later  depending on thickness  at     degrees    yum make sure you get the right spray oil for this  it can cause a sticky residue build up      
494,5.0,                       the tray is very hard to clean  even with extreme care  the teflon coating is peeling off which is not healthy at all  reached out to customer service several times but no help or action as of today  i am happy to revisit my review if i hear back and get this issue addressed  updated from   to   stars customer service provided assistance and sent us a replacement tray with no questions asked   i will chalk their response time to the pandemic that s impacting everyone      
495,5.0,                       i ve had mine for a week now and really like it  i read reviews mentioning a plastic smell and taste  so i unboxed it  wash the baskets in warm soapy water  dried them  put them in the unit  and did   preheat cycles at           and     degrees  removed baskets each time and let it cool before doing another cycle  yep  smelled like plastic  then i did a test run with frozen crinkle cut fries  they cooked up good  crispy  tender on the inside   but smelled like plastic  tossed them out  undeterred  i cooked another batch  this time with meat rub seasoning  still a little plastic aroma but not as bad  wiped it out  did a couple more     degree preheats  let it cool and then did a batch of frozen hatch chili chicken wings  that did the trick  no more plastic smell  tasted great  i ve made different things since then and the plastic smell is gone  so before you make something you put a lot into  run some preheat cycles and cheap frozen foods through it to season it  works great now      
496,1.0,                       i loved my cosori air fryer  i used it once a week and always cleaned well  after only   months it started leaking grease and smoking out black smoke  i don t know what i did wrong but it stopped working after   months      
497,2.0,                       i like the wifi option and the ability to use an app  setting it up is not the easiest  maybe i had a slight dud out the box but the front panel isn t user friendly  to scroll through the functions or even push the buttons seem to be difficult  i ve hade it since february and just now writing this review  don t get me wrong once you get it working  its a great air fryer but the controls are difficult  and at this price point which is not overly expensive  i need it to be user friendly  i just finally got tired of fighting with the controls and donated this air fryer to goodwill and got a ninja which so far works better for the same price      
498,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          first air fryer ever so i dont have much of a reference aside from a regular stove  but i do love the tine it saves me and the way it cooks my party wings  the only downside is  some buttons on the key pad are not selectable  so when you have to preheat  good luck with that     and mine won t select the bread setting  sometimes if you stand there long enough  about   minutes just pressing  it will eventually press  so ive tried to memorize the amount of pressure anf locstion of where i pressed but its never consistent  so i just press any button to preheat  other than that  i do enjoy the item      
499,1.0,                       not only do the screw pop off of the unit into your food while cooking  the drawer does not stay shut and pops open during the cook time  what a waste of money  a screw holding securing the basket to the air fryer popped off while cooking  and ended up in my food  i nearly broke all of my teeth because of this  i would not recommend that you buy this product unless you re willing to inspect your food prior to putting it in your mouth every time you use it  seems like their is a massive design flaw  screws should not end up in your food ps  i cannot not put the back because it is so burnt and corroded from the cooking process  so the unit isn t functioning as it should      
500,4.0,                       i m still learning how to use it  but i am overall happy with my purchase it cooks hot  i have found the recipe book settings to be too much  i have burned a few things  my advice   check your food several times after the half way time  whether or not the meat is room temperature may make a big difference in cooking times i like the oven fry potatoes a lot  the thinner you slice them  the crispier they get  i have cooked   large russet potatoes in there  but it might hold up to    for smaller food items likes fries  it is imperative that you toss them at the midpoint  otherwise they have zebra stripes at the end i also like chicken thighs  super easy  i like to marinate them in olive oil and teriyaki sauce  but the great thing is  you can use any marinade  barbecue sauce  chipotle sauce  tikka masala sauce  anything  my wife likes harissa sauce  the basket holds    i have found that    minutes is too long  crispy on the outside  juicy and tender on the inside negatives   the unit is noisier than i anticipated  about the sound of your stove top hood running on medium  the non stick coating seems thin  i have already scratched it  rubber tipped tongs are recommended  the basket is not easy to get totally clean a   minute warm up is recommended  but i m going to experiment with shortening that  most cooking times are going to be       minutes  so it s       minutes per batch      
501,5.0,                       we have been using this air fryer for a few weeks and we are really happy with the quality of the cooking and the convenience   i have never made my own fried chicken and was pleasantly surprised how easy it was   heating up frozen foods for my kids has been really easy and quick and the quality is there   i also had to contact customer service with an issue and they took care of me in a quick and easy manner   i am looking forward to trying new recipes and i think the air fryer is a great alternative to frying in oil      
502,1.0,                       made in china junk  just purchased one of these and it was junk out the box  touch screen wouldn t work so i called customer support  the lady laughs and says oh yes we are aware of this problem  she then tells me this is a known problem and they will send a new one out at the end of the month  end of the month  then says but i can help you get it connected to wifi so you can use it  well unless you have     which i have  g like most everyone this unit is useless  sure glad i had everything ready to cook and this piece of junk wouldn t work  if they re aware of this issue why are they still selling them  buy if you d like but i d do a hard pass      
503,5.0,                       what a great addition to my kitchen  it s big  but make some space and get to using it  i mainly use it to reheat leftovers  cook frozen foods  and make toast  it s not so great on the toast front  but frozen chicken nuggets come out crispy and great  i do find the controls a bit frustrating  when you plug it in  you have to touch the power on button  then  after you choose a setting  you have to touch another button to start it  it s a minor thing  but annoying  it s easy to clean and the basket is big enough for all i ll ever need for one person  i tried it with a rack  but that didn t work as well  i m not sure if i should have changed the settings with more food in there at one time  i should read the manual  lol  all in all  i m happy with this appliance      
504,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i purchased this because my previous air fryer died on me  since having an air fryer i have me come to love them and use it no less than  x daily  so since my old one died  i decided to purchase this more expensive one of better quality     so i thought it cook perfectly however it smokes  smoke comes out of the bottom bin an fills the entire house and leaves the fried food smell   i use the air fryer because it is suppose to be smoke free and less smell unlike frying on top of the stove i wrote to the company they said it was normal but would send me a replacement  now i m thinking i don t want a replacement if it will smoke and will just return it and purchase a different brand      really disappointed     
505,5.0,                       a year ago  i was not an air fryer fan at all  one day  i saw a youtube video of somebody cooking with an air fryer i watched out of curiosity  since i like to cook  when it finished  i got more curios about it  so i search more videos i couldn t believe all the things you can cook   i research for   or   month and finally  i ordered one  cosori was number one on all the ones i did research  i choose the     qts   my kitchen doesn t have oil splatters anymore and the basket is a cinch to clean       recommended  cleaning the stove top was not my favorite thing  nor washing all the pots and pans   only thing to clean   the basket  period      
506,5.0,                       i m in love with an air fryer  for real  this has been such an amazing addition to my kitchen and i have raved to every one of my friends and said they must get one  so easy to use and i used it to cook raw shrimp  herb rubbed chicken  anything frozen like chicken nuggets  pizza rolls  fries etc  my kids favorite is now egg rolls and spring rolls from it because they are even more crispy than if it was baked in an oven  it saves me time   i m a busy working mom and we have a crazy sports schedule and this has been such a time saver to feed my family and get out the door  it always saves my home from heating up more during the summer from oven use      
507,5.0,                       i bought this back in july    and we looooooove it  i bought the     one because i usually make enough dinner so my husband can take lunch the next day  it has been perfect  an  x  pan sits in it perfectly  which means my    week pregnant self has been making freezer meals so we can have ready made dinners once baby is here so far i ve made full racks of ribs in it  muffins  cheesecakes  bacon  eggs  grilled cheese  all kinds of meat and veggies  biscuits    you name it  i know this is one appliance that if it goes out  i will replace without hesitation   by the way  the only think that i have not liked in it was a steak  i like my steaks cooked on cast iron so they have a good sear  some may like it in the air fryer   i  personally  didn t  my gas bill has dropped because i use the cosori air fryer daily instead of my oven  yay      
508,5.0,                       ordered this cosori max xl      quart air fryer after reading and researching  it has so far exceeded my expectations  it is easy to cook and easy to clean  i made fried shrimp upon receiving it and they were delicious  i sprayed them lightly with pam cooking spray and used a cracker meal batter  today i made a   lb pork loin  cut in half to fit pan  i seasoned it with garlic salt and lawry s seasoned salt and drizzle italian dressing on it  i started it on      for    minutes and flipped it halfway through  i then dropped the temp to      for another    minutes  it came out juicy and tender and so delicious  if i could give this more than   stars  i would  my fryer arrived in    hours and the delivery man even put it under a small awning on our porch to keep it dry from the rain      
509,5.0,                       personally it has worked flawlessly  some have commented bout the keypad being a problem but i ve found that you need to use quick taps and not longer presses to get it to adjust settings  out of the box did onion rings  egg rolls and twice baked potatoes without a hitch  i can see a light bit of oil spray  pam  will improve these even further  a little practice will go a long way to making you a good cook with one of these  they are not magic boxes but a tool to save you all the hassles of deep frying things  the included cookbook is a nice starting point and has useful recipes to get you going  i did buy additional accessories because the pans   racks etc  i had on hand were jut a bit too large to fit  i would recommend at least getting some parchment liners to make cleaning as easy as possible  i haven t seen it mentioned anywhere yet  but i m betting this is going to be the best hot nacho maker ever invented      
510,2.0,                       i loved this corsair airfyer until  the temp and timer setting stopped working consistently   it has been necessary to attempt to push the setting as much as       times and still not move   i wrote several msgs and received a reply stating other owners have had no problem  however  i have read a number of neg  reviews on amazon  which  thay have  allowed to remain on the page  voicing my same complaint   the  temp timer setting is faulty   amazon did reply and  advise me to advise the  company   we re seniors and we find it disappointing to have paid for this item and it not work properly  and also referred to two postives  but failed to to mention they have received a number of complaints for the same issues  which can be found on amazon reviews  it s a good product and could be an excellent unit if the temp timer and issue could becorrected and the company stand by their corsair airyer  any one having this same problem write directly to the company   they state the company address located in in their pamphlet thank you      
511,5.0,                       this was my  st air fryer and yes i had nothing to compare it to  but my family liked it   slowly pieces started coming off  screws bolts etc the touch buttons are fickle  sometimes one touch sometimes      so annoying   and the cleaning of all those slots and crevices are a nightmare to say the least  the fryer did crisp up many things and cooked food to our liking which are definitely strong points  but  i m moving on   decided to get a different design with glass so i can see my food cook  brown  or fry  this one is headed to the trash bin      
512,1.0,                       the bottom basket falls out when i pick it up  set it down  move it too fast  or lightly hit the handle  the construction appears cheap and the basket lining doesn t even match up with the rest of the unit  separating the top and bottom set of the basket also requires special nudging movements and great force to separate causing it hard to clean      
513,3.0,                       i ordered this air fryer as a christmas gift for my son  which was given to him by his grandparents   as i was in the hospital with a broken leg   foot  i did not see the item when opened  he never mentioned the item being white  ordered the black  and saw it this past weekend at his home when visiting   it s maddening for me to order an item and it come in wrong  i wish he had said something so i could set up a return  he s used it several times and said it crisps nicely for the price you pay for this air fryer  it should ve been correct and it wasn t  hence the less stars      
514,5.0,                       update   i was moving my air fryer and the drawer   basket fell out   crashed to a brick floor   the fall s force caused pieces of plastic to break off on both pieces   i actually cried   it was usable  but seemed unsafe as the pieces no longer locked to together or stayed in place while cooking   i researched buying replacement pieces   found i could only buy the inner basket   i emailed cosori to see if i could buy the outer drawer from them   they generously replaced both pieces even though the damage was inflicted by me   not covered by the warranty  they arrived on thursday   i have used it every day since     if i hadn t been afraid of falling on the ice   snow  i would ve jumped for joy   thank you cosori for such great customer service i often fall victim to buying kitchen tools appliances that will change the way i cook   in short  they never do   until my cosori  air fryer   i absolutely love it   i use it at least weekly  and i continue to be surprised by what i can make in it   i ve made the frozen foods snacks  veggies  flank steak  ribs  bacon  many chicken dishes including tacos   chimichangas  donuts from biscuit dough  etc   i even took it on our vacation this year   we had room in the car  so why not   it is the   kitchen appliance that i do not regret buying   i tell everyone to get     i even bought a cheap version for my son to take to college   when he sets out on his own   i ll buy him the cosori      
515,5.0,                       awesome  i have had my air fryer for about   weeks and i use it everyday  i have made chicken wings  regular fries  sweet potato fries  hot dogs  roasted corn  tortilla chips  churros  bacon  this list is never ending  and everything turns out great i watched may hours o reviews on youtube and comparisons  this was my choice for the price point and size  i got the     quart  i have a family if    do you get an idea it fits   whole ears of corn at once the only thing i would suggest is to get the stainless steel model only because it has the temperature and time on different buttons it is a hassle to have to push a button to alternate between these two important settings  i wish i would have noticed that before buying this is the only thing i don t love   buy it and enjoy  you will be obsessed      
516,5.0,                       this is a sleek air fryer with excellent pre programming  it is very easy to use  i like to line the pan with parchment paper on the bottom to avoid moisture loss and for extra cleanliness  but do not have excess paper over the top  as it will singe with the heating element  it is durable and very easy to clean  the pans do fit in the bottom tray of the dish washer if you need to deep clean them  the unit does get warm but not alarmingly hot when in use  the beep function to remind you to shake the food is useful  makes tofu  fries  carrots  chicken  to perfection  used every week for a quick meal with painless cleanup  and no greasy splatter yay  i like the square shape it stacks well with other items on the counter  i like that it doesn t look too busy      
517,5.0,                       this is one of the best purchases i ve ever made   we ve made so many batches of wings in this thing  even made entire meals  it makes way better wings than my oven has ever made  and way faster  chicken  potatoes  vegetables  fries  pizza rolls  grilled cheese sandwiches    it cooks everything   anything you might want to fry will taste       better from this thing  fits lots of food  perfect for bigger families  fast  fast cook times  i can t say enough  we love this air fryer       
518,5.0,                       i have had my cosori for   months and my meals have become so easy and delicious  i had just moved in and my countertop appliances were not expected for weeks  i purchased the cosori and it is the only countertop appliance i have  all the others went into storage and will eventually get donated  for breakfast i make omelets  toast  cheese toast  toasted bagels and a delicious breakfast sandwich on an everything bagel  in a cravet i use alittle olive oil  egg and sausage patty  roast at     for    min  the bagel is sliced and goes in the basket with the egg blend for another     minutes  enjoy  i marinate my meats in single portion ziplock  i prepare a veggie medley of olive oil  dales seasoning  dry rub or seasoning to choice  salt and pepper in a large bowl with zucchini  summer squash  mushrooms  cherry tomatoes  vidalia onion  chopped fresh asparagus  and sweet peppers  i then choose between tater tots  sweet potato fries or french fries  i will add the meat  spoon my veggie medley in and my choice of fries  the cooking temperature of     at    minutes usually prepares my meals to delicious perfection  my favorite is salmon as the salmon is the best i have ever had  i have found i will not need to go out to eat after the virus quarintene is over as most restaurant food will come in a distant second  i am still experimenting with different meals and honestly have not even opened the cookbook which came with the fryer  my alexa is somewhere in storage and have not found it yet  but the display is so simple  i don t think alexa can make it any easier  i maybe wrong  but at this time i don t need it  the cosori is easy to clean  takes only a minute and ready to back into use  again  enjoy  this is a great product      
519,5.0,                       i had been shopping for an air fryer for about a year and when this showed up in my search on prime day  i decided to take a chance  there are sooo air fryers to choose from so i feel lucky that i love this purchase  it s been super hot in socal  i ve used the air fryer almost every single day to make fries  hot dogs  homemade meatballs and salmon patties  frozen dumplings  toasted bread  reheated leftovers  etc  i appreciate how quickly the preheat happens  the hot air circulated nicely to cook food evenly and quickly   i move the air fryer to the backyard when i cook so it doesn t heat up my house and i keep the cooking smells outside  the one trick i would suggest for any airfryer is to be sure to shake the basket every     minutes  shaking makes a world of difference  the basket holds more than enough food for the   of us  i will be taking this to the next level soon   like baking muffins and cake  can t wait      
520,4.0,                       this arrived with some sort of oily film on the front screen   it is impossible to remove   yes  i removed the plastic label cover with the writing on it    looks like somebody with greasy fingers wiped their hands on it   can t remove it no matter what   looked like someone had previously tried because the plastic had a lot of light scratches   just didn t look clean   i don t know if it is the type of plastic used or what  but just didn t look clean to me   once i pressed a few buttons  my fingerprints were quite obvious   i have better things to do than wipe a screen constantly  especially when it still looks greasy after i do   also  i didn t like the flimsiness of the shield button on the basket   i know there are a lot of good reviews out there  maybe i just got a reject      
521,5.0,i use it several times a week  it is simple to use and to clean  i ve had it three months  so far these are the things i have tried in it  bacon chicken wings chicken drummies chicken thighs chicken legs chicken breasts pork tenderloins pork chops swordfish hamburgers hard boiled eggs   not really boiled but cooked in the shell until hard  sausage links sausage patties asparagus cauliflower carrots onions french fries cornish hens toasted cheese sandwiches  i like everything i ve cooked in it  some more than others  for instance  carrots  i liked them but i really prefer the taste of them cooked another way  the roasted cauliflower was one of my favs   i gotta tell you  as much as we like wings  that would make it worth the purchase alone   we were down at our cabin with friends  i had taken the air fryer down there with us  one day i made wings  flats and drummies  no sauce  they ate and ate and ate  went home and ordered their own fryer   bacon is another thing  it s amazing  you pour out the grease and wash the pan and boom  you are done  no mess    it s really just a small convection oven  i don t know why but i could never achieve the same results in the large one i have in my kitchen   i m a big fan of mine so much so that i would like to buy another one so i could cook two dishes at the same time  hubby would have a fit though   all this being said  the food does not cook itself  you do have to prepare it and by that i mean oil and seasoning  you also have to experiment with cook times  and you have to check on the food when it s cooking so that you don t over cook it   i use a facebook page that was set up by cosori for tips and questions  the people on there are always very helpful  also whenever i want to cook something  i just google  air fryer             that usually brings up some nice recipes   i bought cosori because i didn t want to pay     dollars for the phillips  which is top rated  the gowise was second rated but it has horrible reviews on amazon  i opted for the cosori which got good reviews and a fair price 
522,5.0,                       i am not sure why i waited all this time to get an air fyer  so i need to make up for lost time  it s easy to cook and easy to clean  i cook a lot on a charcoal grill  but this beats it  i will share one of my favorite chicken recipes jerk chicken thighs  chicken thighs  tbs of low sodium soy sauce  tbs of olive oil  tbs of island spice jerk seasoning  from amazon toss them up in mixing bowl  let it marinate for    mins  then  put in preheated air fyer for    mins at     deg  flipping it halfway thru  check temp when done      
523,5.0,                       this was my second purchase after i returned the first for digital display malfunctions  this one has the same issue  instead of returning it to amazon i reached out to the cosori company with a request to assist  they were very apologetic and helpful with this  they said i could return it but i didn t want to  i requested a replacement so i could get them the defective one to find out what went wrong  they sent me a replacement and man so much better all buttons work and we love it  this is a great product even when it only worked sometimes  i recommend it to anyone that wants to air fry their food      
524,4.0,                       when i received my air fryer  some of the buttons did not work properly  i could still use the fryer but it was a bit of a pain without all of the buttons i contacted cosori directly despite buying from amazon  and they immediately offered to send me a new fryer at no cost to me  within   days it had arrived and this time works perfectly  great customer service  thanks cosori as to actually using the machine  it s pretty good all around  only used it a few times but so far so good      
525,5.0,                       i purchased this air fryer after the one i had fell apart   i used it but not everyday   the teflon inside had come off and the clips holding the basket fell out   i am happy to say that i received a refund since it was less than a year   with so many now on the market this one caught my eye   its color and finish is perfect   i chose the red   the inside is larger than whati had so it fits more  and the size is perfect   this is kind of square which fits on my counter much better than the round one   made a few dinners and everything came out perfect   clean up was better than my last   anything left inside slid right out   i am very happy with my purchase and will look forward to making some of the recipes that came with air fryer      
526,2.0,                       this review would be a   star if it werent for   reasons    it doesnt like alexa  i can ask alexa to preheat the air fryer and it turns it on bake french fries mode  it doesnt work as well as other alexa devices i have       do    the button panel on this thing sucks  changing the temperature and the time daunting  i have to hit the temp button     plus times to activate the temperature change mode then have to hit       wait     hit       wait the plus minus buttons on the in hopes that i dont go over what im trying to get too  the time adjustment is the exact same way the cooking  cleaning  the taste  the ease  its all there  maybe its just my machine but im not happy with it  its very frustrating      
527,5.0,                       update  i have to raise this to   stars for the simple fact that this company actually reads the reviews and will respond  i received an e mail from this company out of the blue in regards to my prior review  they promptly obtained my information and sent me another unit  this company is top notch in my opinion  i did not request a new unit as i waited beyond the time to return do to work travel  they reached out and proceeded to take care of my situation  i would highly recommend this company   prior review   not simple to use  the main touch screen control panel will not allow you to adjust the time or temp  it seems to be only for preset cooking  not all the screen options are usable  if you want to adjust the time and temp you must down load an app and connect to the fryer through wi fi to you properly control this unit  i would definitely purchase another brand if still shopping      
528,5.0,                       we live in a hot climate  all year   this eliminates heating up the house by using the oven which is a huge plus for us  the buttons are great for people who don t really cook  just preheat  using the preheat button  and choose what you re cooking  there s a chicken button  a pork button  a root vegetable button and so on  this was also a great function for someone like myself  it s that easy  the nonstick is just that  avoid using sprays like pam  as that s what will take the coating off as you may see in other reviews  just dab olive oil or get a  spray mister  that you can put your olive oil into  we don t have a lot of counter space so we store it in a cabinet and because it s lightweight   another plus for this gal  the cleaning is as simple as cleaning a nonstick cookie sheet  done  make sure to follow their facebook page for recipes or help  we ve cooked steak  chicken  pork  cauliflower and brussel sprouts so far and have yet to be disappointed      
529,2.0,                       unit look great and cooks great  when it works  two major challenges  first there are a dozen presets on the front of unit but only   actually work when you push them  in addition the temperature adjustment buttons do not work   second challenge is the fry basket pops out about   minutes into cooking  every time  and i have to hold it back in for at least    seconds to get it to stay back in and finish cooking      
530,5.0,                       i don t normally come back to post reviews  and in this case  i waited a little while so i didn t get carried away by great first impressions  well  after owning the cosori for a while  i can safely say this air fryer is                great  it s just great when you see a product with sooooooooooooooo many great reviews from verified buyers  you feel a large amount of trust in your purchase  still  anything can happen  right  this air fryer is everything i thought it would be and more  perfect in execution  large basket size  easy to clean  and it looks great on one of my kitchen counters to anyone concerned about noise  take a moment to understand how these devices work  there s a fan inside that circulates the heat coming off a heating element  there s a small exhaust area on the back of this air fryer that pushes out some warm air  this fan does  not  put out noise that should bother you at all  i think you d have to be super sensitive to the smallest noises to even care  i ve had the air fryer running about   feet away from me while i m watching tv and i don t even notice it  again   look at all the verified  great  reviews and make up your own mind i couldn t be happier with this purchase  and i look forward to medium to heavy use of this cosori air fryer in the future      
531,5.0,                       wow   this thing is amazing  u can drop in a couple frozen solid chicken breasts spray with olive oil sprinkle salt and pepper and    min later have browned tender juicy delicious chicken   i have made all kinds of simple easy tasty stuff  google how to cook anything in air fryer its always easy  cleans with a damp sponge  so easy so healthy   i just bought a second one for my dad  great product   get this big size one  u need space around the food for it to cook correctly     
532,5.0,                       i was never sure that i would like using an air fryer  saw the many adds but could never see how it would take the place of my regular oil fryer     years old and now i find that i have a new best friend  my cosori air fryer  i have found that i can make everything so much faster and easier and i am not disappointed in the results  from steaks to veggies  to my favorite grilled cheeses  the air fryer has made my life so much easier  so quick  so easy  and very easy to clean and maintain  and  no oil  my grease can  that i used to drain my pains into after every fry  is no longer here  my expensive cooking oil purchases are gone  and nothing is easier and quicker than preparing snacks for my grandkids when they visit  thank you for teaching an old dog new tricks   great buy and well worth it      
533,1.0,                       i had an incredibly disturbing experience tonight  my boyfriend literally ended up with a screw in his mouth  i cooked some potatoes in the air fryer and it appears that two screws popped off of the inside of the inner basket and into the potatoes  this is incredibly dangerous  he could have choked or broken a tooth  don t want to think about what would have happened if this had happened to a small child  i ve only had the air fryer for a month and use it just once or twice a week  so light use   see attached pictures  was very happy with the air fryer up to this point but i feel that this shows a safety concern that i can t overlook      
534,1.0,                       i liked this air fryer   it has a nice design and also offered a wi fi connection to be used with a phone app  i read some nice reviews about it but unfortunately forgot to read the bad ones   the touch display didn t work and only way to use the fryer was thru the app  which worked flawlessly btw     but even though that s an nice feature it s not ways possible or convenient to use it  after that i found a bunch reviews stating the same problem what to me shows a lack of quality control      
535,5.0,                       i had an actifry from tfal for many years and was really happy with it for some applications but was irritated that the stirring mechanism kept me from air frying larger items or fragile items  my actifry finally broke and i went in search of a replacement  i googled best air fryers and this was number one on the list i can t believe how easy it is to cook with this appliance  the buttons are all very user friendly  the basket is coated in non stick and has generous air holes but they aren t large enough that food falls through  it has been a breeze to clean  i ve had it for a week and we ve made fried chicken  schnitzel  brussels sprouts  tater tots  fries  mozzarella sticks  pot stickers and jalapeno poppers in it  everything turned out great and nothing was hard to clean up  not even the fried chicken  the bottom basket tray is also coated in non stick  i soaked it in warm water for   minutes and it wiped clean i have a family of   and we had to split the fried chicken into   batches  it comfortably fit   thighs in one batch and a breast and   legs in the next  i just kept the first batch on a plate covered to keep warm and then popped them back in for a minute after the  nd batch to heat them up      
536,4.0,                       received this for christmas  it s easy to use  easy to clean  and makes some things super crispy   good  makes amazing french fries but doesn t hold much so have to make several batches for my french fry loving family positives  easy to use  good crispiness on most foods we ve tried  even pre blanched green beans   easy to clean  lots of recipes online negative  doesn t hold much food at one time note  i ve no clue why you would want a wifi connection for your air fryer    think that s just a marketing gimmick       
537,5.0,                       let me just start by saying an amazing product i ve cooked lots of  fried chicken  french fries and other things  at first took me a little time to get use to the flavor with out all the oil but let me tell you i never got sick from my stomach again after eating fried chicken from this air fryer so worth every penny   it takes a little time to get used to cooking your food the way you want but once you do it s amazing so i truly recommend this product       
538,5.0,                       this is awesome  very healthy option and it already has featured timers temp according to which food product you would like to cook it shaves a lot of time off of some products and it comes out crispyi ve already done  chicken  bacon all the time   tater tots  fries  and even steak definitely worth the price and yes it is huge i say each portion is a good     ppli ve never tried other air fryers so i don t know where this one would fall on the comparison level  but as a beginner i can tell you this is great for a first purchase air fryer     
539,5.0,                       never had an air fryer before and did a bit of research before settling on the corsori   it is a perfect size for    people  is incredibly easy to clean  by hand or dishwasher   simple to use and good instructions  light enough to store away in cabinet  works like a charm   we use it weekly for the obvious   buffalo wings  fries  egg rolls  kale chips    believe you will be satisfied with performance      
540,1.0,                       this machine cooks well and is easy to use and clean   however  it fills the house with a burning plastic or burning metal smell which permeates the food as well   i have made several meals in this and washed it per the instructions  and the smell is not going away regardless of the food setting that is used   i am not sure if the smell is from the teflon coating  the heating element or elsewhere in the machine  but the smell is toxic and sickening  and it completely ruins the food   there are many reviews that complain about this   cosari needs to redesign this   i am returning it      
541,3.0,                       not happy with fryer at this time  there is no book telling you how to cook things  just a how long to cook  how do you make fried chicken in it  how do you make crispy fries   and it s a lot smaller than i wanted  cleaning was hard because food got stuck in the ridges  i prob would of liked it more if there was a cook book with it on how to cook with it  so it just sits in my kitchen      
542,5.0,                       our oven broke so we were debating on what to do since it s only two of us in the house  first thought was an air fryer  best idea ever  this thing works like magic  very easy to work with and is not loud at all  also for a little more   you can add their extra pans  a must for us  so far i made chicken with   sides and everything cooked throughly very well   nd was frozen pizza and pizza rolls those cooked very crispy better then oven my opinion  you can fit so much but do not pack as you want everything to cook well update  became my best friend loli ll be adding pictures as i use it      
543,1.0,                       i was so excited to try the air fryer  however it didn t turn on when plugged in   i prepared everything to cook with the air fryer  but i couldn t turn it on   my husband and i spent about an hour to try everything but still the air fryer wouldn t work   i should have tried to turn it on first before preparing the food   i ended up frying everything with oil the old way   i was so disappointed   the machine had a sticker qc passed on it   i returned it   never want to try a product from this manufacture again      
544,1.0,                       after looking into any issues with the air fryer purchased   error code  e   started coming on whenever we started the fryer  worked around it by manually setting time and temp  looked into trouble shooting and read if this error code repeatedly shows to return the product  i called the customer support and only got a person on the phone wanting to sell me a      credit for using my credit card to purchase the card for        return says i had till november   th to return  which would have been fine if the error code showed within that period of time  not sure of my options at this time and look forward to someone contacting me about this issue to further the issue  it is now february   th and we have had to put the air fryer away when it started smoking when we were attempting to cook some fries  everytime we have used it since our first review we have had to reset the temp and the time  sometimes that worked  sometimes it didn t  this was the last  straw when it started smoking and looked like it was an electrical risk  as stated before  reached out to manufacturer and have not been able to contact  i want to return the airfryer but have not way of doing so  never  never will i buy or even consider purchasing anything from this company again   one of the reasons we bought the cosori was it was highly recommended and a fav of amazon      
545,5.0,                       so i had owned a competing brand and it honestly never worked properly  the touch pad buttons never really worked the down key went out completely in the first   months so it was impossible to move time or temp down  it did do it s job and the cooking was so easy i could not bare the thought of losing it for even one day  so i made work arounds that did the trick for all the gourmia s many shortfalls  when the corsori arrived i was hopeful but not overly so because i had tried the ninja foodi first and was also disappointed in it s shortcomings  tried to do too much and did nothing well   so i took out the basket ah ha  square  not circular or semi squarish with a kind of tapering basket but actually square  the basket also seemed noticeably larger even though it was only half a quart bigger  the button functionality is awesome many  many presets and it easy to adjust to whatever time or temp you need  the one con i would say is that you have to empty the fryer basket every time you use it  there is no space because of the size of the basket  other than that awesome machine      
546,5.0,                       i  think i must be the happiest customer ever   lol  i never cooked well in my life and i was pretty much buying food from delis  restaurants  grocery stores for my family  and this can be very costly and not always the healthiest  so i decided to give it a try after all my friends told me about the magical air fryer  i was looking literally for a magical device where i could press a button and ta da  food would be ready  and i found it   it s the cosori air fryer  family is super happy and all meals have been delicious  now my kids think i am a great chef  hahaha prosit s easy to cook and to clean comes with a little recipe book  and i also bought some extra gadgets to cook other plates  has great customer support conswish i had known about it earlier lol      totally recommend it  be like nike and just do it      
547,5.0,                       i had looked for awhile for an air fryer  final found this one   i wanted a tray that would hold more food  this is square with rounded edges so you can fit chicken legs  fish  etc because of the size   other fryers are round and have lower quality  but not cosori   great quality   i love the extended warranty  recipe book and you can see recipes on their facebook profile   this is awesome and have recommended it to friends   love it  though it was a gift to myself and my husband uses it all the time     stars if they rated it to         
548,5.0,                       this fryer does exactly what it s supposed to do   meats are cooked to perfection and they are not dried out   this appliance saves me so much time   i can season and throw wings in the fryer and they re done in    minutes   i also have air fried steak  lamb and chicken breasts in the fryer   i love this machine   my husband  who is very picky about his meals  loves the way the meat tastes   i strongly recommend      
549,5.0,                       i ve been hearing about these air fryers but didn t purchase because i recently purchased a  qt multi cooker  i wanted something versatile but easy to use  i must say i ve used this air fryer   times and have not used my multi cooker at all  what sets the corosi apart is how easy it is to use  the one push cook buttons make everything so easy  the first time i used it  i made potato wedges  had a nice crisp to them   i should ve taken a picture  next  i cooked   ny strip steaks  listen  those steaks were so tender  cooked to perfection   i would like more of a sear on them next time so i may try something different  finally  the chicken wings    baby never in my life have i had chicken wings so light but crispy and flavorful without the grease  i m never cooking friend chicken in a pan again  i m going to try salmon  sweet potato fries  pizza and veggies next  i love the shake function and it s easy to clean  the recipe book is nice but i haven t used it yet definitely worth the money and there is no need to buy a more expensive one  i can t imagine another item in my kitchen that s worth      i am seriously considering returning my multi cooker because of this savior  buy it  you won t regret it      
550,4.0,                       the size of this air fryer is great  you can fit    wings in here  chicken  bigger items without doing several different cooks  performs great  i like the separate basket and bottom which makes cleaning and juggling it easier  it is bulky because of its size  but the material is a little cheap i ve had this for several months and still good  my only complaints are it s a little cheap material and the digital screen can be finicky  the drawer has smoke that comes out so it s not completely shut  and the smell of it isn t amazing  but it cooks fantastically      
551,1.0,                       don t know why my friend chose to purchase this from me  my friends oven broke and i brought this one over  i un boxed it at her house  upon unboxing  product felt okay  we cooked the fryer part is tiny  the features are pretty  but the handle is jacked up and made very cheaply  it also cooked very fast  you can definitely cut your cooking time in half  it even cooks faster than the ninja  the original air fryer  i have a ninja and love that  anyway  she called me to tell me she wanted to keep it  was going to pay me  she is so sorry but the handle broke when she was opening it  i told her no way  i will return it but she insisted to keep it      
552,5.0,                       we ve owned  but rarely used  a much smaller air fryer of a different brand   after deciding to increase our air frying and reduce grease fat frying we purchased this cosori       it s wonderful   lots of room in the squarish basket   the times and temps in the recipe book are spot on   we ve cooked chicken  meats  and lots of vegetables with amazing success   meats and chicken came out with a crunch to the outside but nice and juicy and tender inside   and   this is an important point   with the air fryer there are no meat spatters on the stove top so less cleaning   the basket washes up easily  even after doing pork chops and chicken thighs   we are totally enjoying our new  more spacious fryer and have great plans for future meals      
553,5.0,                       i was doubtful about an air fryer  but this one won me over  with the presets  it is so simple to use  it holds a lot  i often put about two pounds of veggies in it  we use it several times a week from fish to veggies  i bought an oil sprayer and keep melted coconut oil in it to spray on the food  then i add my favorite seasonings  preheat  add food   press preset  and turn on  at first  i forgot to turn it on after choosing the pre set  but i soon got in the habit i highly recommend this air fryer      
554,5.0,                       simple  looks modern  not too bulky  bpa free  fast and easy to clean  placing it into out off is a little tricky    the plastic slider is flimsy  can t use paper as it can lead to a fire    can t overcook anything because of the carcinogen  burnt parts     learning curve with the types of foods      loud but tolerable     beeps when u need to shake      can use your phone to preheat thats convenient    still there are plenty on offerup    bought for baked potatoes   fried tofu and cooking veggies instead of the oven      
555,2.0,                       so the tray that slides into the air fryer is poorly designed    you have to slide this button for the tray to slide in  over time this is going to break or wear away and not work anymore   you have to unscrew the main grill from the tray to clean this  even if you had a dishwasher it would be very hard to clean those two reasons are enough for me to return and realize that im going tohate this thing down the road and realize i wasted my money  its like a bad relationship you know its going to end up bad and migth as well get out now      
556,5.0,                       so far my family and i are loving this air fryer  only have had it for a few days   user friendly  great tasting  perfectly crispy    i did not start out with high expectations either   i had bought an oven type previously it was terrible  fried chicken etc awful   took it back   i ll do another review in the near future on it but can t see it ll change are minds maybe just more food suggestions    hamburgers  corn dogs  pizza rolls  chicken nuggets  fried chicken  blackened salmon fillets  and french fries all have been excellent     will highly recommend this         
557,5.0,                       i think air fryer is a misnomer  this is really a compact convection oven  it has a heater and a fan  it is an intense convection oven  it produces a wide variety of foods with unique characteristics  in addition to mimicking oil frying pretty well  i find it works especially well for breaded chicken and catfish  frozen french fries  frozen breaded shrimp and fish  sauteed vegetables like mushrooms and zucchini  and drummies  i am using my cosori almost every day and it is adding a new creative element to my cooking  i am using my regular oven quite a bit less      
558,5.0,                       i use this everyday for everything we had purchased another   star highly rated air fryer  we sent it back  uneven  unstable etc  this device is the one for us  i use it to heat leftovers  crisp baked potatoes  and for  grilled  cheese sandwiches  my mouth is watering writing this review recommended      
559,5.0,                       love my cosori air fryer  i had a different one that was very messy to clean but this cosori amazingly doesn t get near as greasy as my old powerxl  i wonder if it s the shape or something  i like that it s more square inside  also  it is truly non stick  very easy to clean  it doesn t seem to have a coating on the basket or inside like my old one  so there is no peeling  i like that it has the preheat function which it says is crucial for proper frying  i get good results  but the best thing is how easy it is to clean  food doesn t stick  it is not a chore to clean it like my old one was  i would definitely get this same one again if something happened to it  ive had it several months now  so i know what i m talking about   lol     
560,4.0,                       this is great for making french fries  corn dogs  tater tots  frozen chicken wings  mostly frozen stuff unhealthy stuff  ha   tried a few recipes out of the book when it first arrived  but they came out so dry  it took some trial and error but i ve finally got the hang of it  it does have a mind of its own every once in awhile it won t shut off or pause  but i m overall pleased  paid it s worth just in making the kids fries      
561,5.0,                       we have been using our air fryer now for about   months pretty regularly   roasted veggies  chicken wings  fries  and all sorts of stuff   we love it cosori is also a great brand that stands behind their product   our basket had the   screws that hold the handle start loosening   they have lock washers  but my guess is the frequent heat cycling between cooking and then cleaning allowed it to loosen up   easy enough to tighten up   but i emailed support  and they sent us a new basket free of charge   we can now alternate and the screws don t seem to back off now   very happy with the product  and happier with the support      
562,3.0,                       mom was happy using the wifi app and the internet went out  there was no warning  cable didn t go out  and the food burned  have to unplug the fryer to stop the cooking  if you don t know you need to watch the time and depend on the app  it s a bad situation  plus  you cannot use the machine without internet  you can stop by unplugging but you need the app to start the food      
563,5.0,                       basket size is square and large enough to prepare food for   people  or more    very easy to clean  even in the dishwasher   we were somewhat doubtful that this type of appliance was something we needed  but after a day or two it became a regular in our kitchen  chicken wings  vegetables  pork roasts etc  cook much more quickly than in the oven and it doesn t heat up the kitchen   comes with easy directions and a nice selection of recipes   strongly recommended updated review  we continue to use this appliance more and more over time  it has continued to amaze me with the range of cooking it can do  whole chickens  sausage patties  hamburgers  whole sweet potatoes and more come out perfectly   pork chops in this air fryer are the best we have ever eaten   even better than using the souse vide method   much quicker and easier as well although we have used this air fryer multiple times a week for almost a year  it has absolutely no signs of wear  other products i have read reviews on often speak about the finish flaking off and other defects    but not so with this product  truly a great product that i continue to recommend in the strongest terms         
564,4.0,                       i really love this air fryer   i use it almost daily   it has replaced our old fryer completely   it is easy to use and cooks my food perfectly   after using it constantly for a few months  mine started to have some issues with the door popping open by itself while cooking   i reached out to the seller and they were very responsive  and replaced it for me right away   the new one works great  and i haven t had any issues with it   i appreciate the healthier cooking option for my family  as we can enjoy many of our favorite fried foods without the unhealthy oils      
565,2.0,                       don t buy  impossible to remove tray and basket easily  costs a lot of money to be so difficult to use  pieces are plastic and break easily  it s big  bulky  has no  stop to shake  option for chicken  but mainly it s so difficult to use  if it cooked well  it doesn t   it burns easily  you would be willing to put up with everything but it s not and you should buy something else      
566,5.0,                       only had it for   days  i got it monday it came fast  only took   days to receive it  i got the red one and love it  it goes great in my kitchen  the     quart is perfect for my teenage son and i  no smell  easy to use  easy to clean   dishwasher safe too   non stick and food comes out great  so far i have made chicken wings  chicken legs and salmon in it and everything has been delicious   sooo many things you can cook in it  even cakes and other desserts and toast bread  oh can t forget making bacon too  it came with a recipe book as well over     recipes  so far it s a great product and no issues  happy with my purchase      
567,5.0,                       i was apprehensive about trying an air fryer but had heard a lot about them  totally impressed   not only is the styling excellent for sitting on a counter  but it is easy to use and very easy to clean up   where we live  we can t bbq and this was the unexpected answer to our problem  we cannot believe how wonderful it cooks meat    juicy and brown  i recently roasted vegetables in it to make soup and it was just delcious and so easy  i have a lot to learn but have a list of recipes to try  i actually did   nice sized pork chops and they turned out perfect  we may get a second one and forego the stove   i highly recommend      
568,5.0,                       i was in the market for a deep fryer  i assumed an air fryer to be a silly idea and could never touch the flavor or crispiness of a deep fryer   after having this for a few months and using it practically every other day  the wife was right   i wouldn t say it s absolutely equal  but i no longer want a deep fryer   reliable  easy to use  easy to clean  everything comes out great and it s so very low maintenance      
569,5.0,                       bought this brand because it has been proven tried and true by a friend   love cooking meats in it  haven t had the oven on since getting it   it especially cooks salmon fillets perfectly   still trying to figure out how to make potatoes crispy like fries  but we rarely eat them anyway   am still experimenting with settings that i will enjoy most for the types of foods i cook  since i eat a keto diet  this is perfect   love it       
570,1.0,                       i really love the basket size  the color  the ease of use   and the recipe book is really wonderful  but the burning plastic smell is overwhelming  it was so bad we moved it outside   hoping it would go away after a few uses  my kids were coughing it was so bad   but after   uses  including bacon and peppers  the smell was still intense  so much so you could not smell the food   very disappointed  i had my heart set on this one so so many reasons      
571,5.0,                       i normally don t write review but with this company s outstanding customer service i am writing thus review since covid   in march  most of the restaurants in our state and areas are closed and we have to cook everyday   thanks to this air fryer  it makes our life easier   we used it almost everyday experiencing with all types of meats and vegetables   with so much use and knocking around the external basket was a little dented   i wrote to the company since this external basket was not in the market   the customer service was very helpful and they send me the external basket for free even after the warranty period was over and now i am a very happy customer   we still use the air fryer everyday everything comes out very flavourful and even the skin of chicken is crispy and the meat is still moist   perfect keep up the good work cosori   will buy again once my air fryer run its course      
572,5.0,                       update  since we purchased this  we use it fairly regularly   it gets used  washed  and set out to dry  lately  we have not been as diligent with cleaning and i ve noticed a few things  the screws need to be tightened regularly  more importantly  the sides take a little longer to clean   today  i decided to put it in the dishwasher for the first time because it says  the nonstick basket is removable and dishwasher safe  made with pfoa free and bpa free basket materials    this is grossly misstated  i took it out of the dishwasher and it looks terrible  much of the coating has come off and there are spots all over it  btw  the dishwasher is about a year and a half old  such a disappointment that  i now have to get a replacement basket  those     quart baskets are not easy to come by  anyway  buyer beware i absolutely love this thing  i am just starting to use the app more frequently for different recipes  food comes out as expected  i bought an oil sprayer from amazon as well  helps to really keep fries crispy rather than using a tablespoon of oil like some recipes call for  been trying to convince my wife we need another because lets face it  if you make burgers in it  the fries would not be immediately ready when the burgers finish  same with veggies etc      
573,5.0,                       we have made so many different foods in the air fryer   it s a learning process on  temperature and timing  but nothing we ve made has come out badly  fries are fast food delicious  chicken wings and fingers are just like out of the deep fryer with none of the mess  the basket holds     servings and is very easy to clean either by hand or in the dish washer  i would recommend this air fryer to anyone looking to cook food faster and without a lot of added oil   and just google whatever you re looking to make       there are lots of recipes out there      
574,2.0,                       it smokes like a freight train   i had read some of the reviews saying it emits white smoke but i figured maybe it wasn t bad and i could live with it since it had some other options i wanted     however it pours white smoke and fills the whole house with smoke   i tried putting water in the pan as one person suggested but it didn t help   also the smoke causes condensation all over the air fryer and drips all onto the counter top   i ve had three other brand air fryers and none of them smoked   i don t think this is a defective fryer i think it s just something the cosori does   not acceptable to me  i will be returning and trying a different brand     
575,5.0,                       i never had an air fryer before until now   this is an amazing device and it s so easy to make food that is healthier than frying it in straight oil   there is a nifty recipe book and you can find a lot of air fryer recipes on pinterest   the only issue i had was that some foods don t come out like i would like them  like bacon  i need it crispy  but it was not a deal breaker   i have only had this for about     weeks and i love it      
576,3.0,                       buttons on the display are basically useless   not sure if mine is defective or common   works fine from the app  but don t always want to use my phone to cook  edit         i ended up calling the company and rhey sent me a replacement one free of charge    this one is a little better  but the button issue still exists         
577,4.0,                       update to my initial   star review   cosori contacted me after reading my initial review and replaced the defected fryer with a new one   the replacement works great   i ve increased my review to   stars since they replaced it for me   they still should have taken care of this when i first called about the issue   i would also like them to improve their app initial   star review   cooks great  but the control panel is junk   i called customer service when i first got this and they offered no return on this and instead just said i m not pushing the buttons correctly   not sure what else i can do   i m pushing the buttons and nothing happens   i can sometimes get a few of them to work for awhile after turning it off and then back on but it s short lived   we ve gone to using the app  but that s not always a great solution either   after my wife uses it  i have to connect to the fryer again   this happens every time and is very annoying   if the manufacturer reads this review  you should replace my fryer with a new one      
578,4.0,                       this is the real thing  love it  really  had doubts a few years ago about an air fryer but this thing works  steaks  potatoes  chops corn   on and on edit update still good  whole chicken good  boiled eggs bad  pork roast carnitas good  cod good  pizza good    everything needs experimenting on time and temp and use your eyes  i don t mind the noise  love that is does not heat up my kitchen  and for my wife and me it is great  i use it everyday this is not a miracle product and it has limitations  small basket even on the large unit   however  it does work  no hiccups yet with the electronics   some foods are just better in the big oven or in a gallon of oil still working on boiled eggs  though     
579,4.0,                       i had never used an air fryer before   i have been pleased with the way meat cooks in the air fryer   i haven t used it many times but it does seem to work really well   i fixed a dessert with it tonight that tasted good   i am still getting used to pulling the drawer out and releasing the basket   it seems a little awkward but i am getting more used to it i like the square shape of the cooking basket   i think it can cook more than a round basket would be able to  overall  i do like this air fryer      
580,5.0,                       i love this air fryer  i have cooked foods from meats  fresh   frozen french fries  potato skins  to chicken tenders all perfectly  i like that it keeps the meats crispy on the outside  but tender  it is so quick and easy to use  also i find it easy to clean the baskets and i can easily wipe it down inside   i have actually bought my son one for christmas  i am sure they will love theirs too      
581,3.0,                       pros  this air fryer performs wonderfully  cooks food to perfection  settings are great  basket is a nice  big size  we use it almost daily and recommend it to everyone cons  we have owned this for six months and the basket is rusting  we don t wash it every time we use it  as many things don t create much grease at all  and when we do we hand wash and dry upside down on the counter  i m concerned that it s going to get worse and not sure i want to pay      twice a year to keep using something even as great as this      
582,5.0,                       i ve pretty much cooked everything in here  from all types of meats  veggies  frozen foods  even deserts  everything comes out perfectly cooked  this has been one of my best investments  i highly recommend it  just make sure to sign up for the extended warranty  i purchased this air fryer back in december       after   year and  ish months it malfunctioned  it began to smoke up and release a burning order  i used it at least     times a week  i contacted cosori via email  and got a response within minutes  their customer service was excellent  a new replacement unit was sent to me  and i m back to using the air fryer      
583,2.0,                       not impressed with this new unit compared to my older non wifi unitthe new unit doesn t seem to cook as well as my older non wifi unit   it doesn t seem to push as much air and thus doesn t get as crisp the buttons also don t work nearly as well   i have a hard time getting it to respond   the wifi app does help with this  but when i m standing in front of the unit  id rather push a button instead of getting out the phone or yelling at alexa to make the changes overall i wish i d kept my old     unit instead of getting this new wifi unit   it just doesn t seem to cook as good     
584,2.0,                       this product has a flush face with no physical buttons to press for your selections   you are supposed to depress the area for your selection and the selection is supposed to light up   you can press all you want and certain buttons may or may not work       most cases they do not work   for this reason  i would not recommend this product   save your money    look for something else   this is a design flaw      
585,5.0,                       this is very needed item to have at home  it cooks fast and the food is super delicious  i ve cooked salmon from costco in it  and it wasn t dry finally but juice and flavorful  the chicken legs we cooked had crispy skin and soft truly cooked inside  very delicious  and i m glad to think that the food we cook in it is a little bit more healthy as cooked with no grease and oil      
586,5.0,                       this thing is awesome    i put off buying  one for a long time thinking  it would be something  else that takes up room and another kitchen appliance  that never actually gets used   i have used it like every other day since it came  cleaning is quick and painless  settings are easy to use and the food it yummy with no oil    wish i d bought it  sooner  whole family  approved     
587,1.0,                       i loved  note past tense  my corsori air fryer  pros  easy to use energy efficient versatile compact affordablecons   a bit loud a bit small lasted only one year  yes  one year  and i had a voltage protector on it  as i do with any appliance that has a circuit board and computer  i even unplugged it after every use  i d used it about     times a week  which is what i consider moderate usage  anyway  about a month ago it turned off while it was running  then on again  it was an anomaly so i just hoped it would not happen again  yesterday i was cooking some chicken breasts in it on a        minute cycle  near the end of the cycle it stopped and started two times  so i unplugged it and tried another outlet just in case that was the problem  i plugged it in  it started again for about   and that was it  air fryer dead        
588,5.0,                       love this air fryer  did a ton of reviews and this was highly recommended  go ahead and get this one if you are looking   works excellent and just sorry didn t buy one sooner  from my experience so far it cooks faster than the time required   fries will burn if you aren t careful   it takes some learning to figure out the exact times but once you do it s so simple to cook with   pork chops and even ribs did very well in it      
589,5.0,                       after this air fryer was delivered today i unpacked it and couldn t wait to test it out so me   my dad made some tilapia fish in it and they came out juicy and delicious    this thing is definitely a keeper  tomorrow we are going to make the french toast sticks recipe from the recipe book  i can t wait to try them out  this is also one of the best orders i ve made on amazon  if you re still looking around for an air fryer on amazon  buy this one  you won t be disappointed       
590,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i love it     i was very scared since i m a lousy cook   i usually cook for a dozen and we are only two  i made this video for my mom and is in spanish but i guess is self explanatory       
591,5.0,                       i read a bunch of reviews before buying this  i have used it for a few months now  almost every day  and love it  it seems sturdy and makes things in a jiffy  if your on the fence  just go ahead and get it because it will probably the the best thing you ever do for yourself now i don t make big huge things in it  though i m sure i could because it s very large  i use it for every day food and breakfast sandwiches  i use it for things i never even thought i would when i first got it i used to eat a lot of fast food but now it is much faster to just make it myself      
592,5.0,                       love this product  i just did a video review on youtube between this model and the paula deen     quart model   there is no comparison between the    i am returning the paula deen model   the only issue i have with the cosori is that it is not big enough  other than that this model is excellent  with the paula deen model it left certain things soggy on the bottom even after flipping halfway through cooking  this model does not even need flipping with pre fried foods such as fish sticks  i do shake in between but do not have to flip  digital is also the way to go   i highly recommend this brand and i use it at least   days a week and sometimes multiple times a day  i can also say you are able to cook a   or   pound young chicken in this    you do have to push it down a little bit in the pan to make sure it doesn t hit the heating element but i have been able to do that with no problem  highly recommend      
593,5.0,                       i m really glad i bought this  i do note though  that cooking temperatures and time that automatically show up may be a bit high and long  experiment a bit  i don t like my foods to come out really dark or nearly black  so maybe it s just me  but i find that lowering the temp by    degrees and the cooking time by a few minutes  depending on the food  cooks the food to my liking and the food is safely cooked  buy a food thermometer if you have doubts      
594,5.0,                       if you are looking for a great product in air fryers look no more  i originally owned a smaller air fryer made by a different company  i was very impressed with this air fryer easy to clean cooks in very little time and food taste but way too small   i went in search of a bigger air fryer with the square basket and came across the cosori  wi fi air fryer this is another item to add for a smart home  you may ask why do you need an air fryer with wi fi  i said the same but i find that i use it very often  this app also provides cooking menus of all sorts and you can join a group via facebook to also enhance your cooking experience originally there was an issue when i first purchased product  but i image like anything else when you have mass production there are sometimes flaws  i contact customer service they respond within    hours and resolve my problem to my satisfaction  i love this product i would definitely recommend      
595,5.0,                       i love this thing  most of the air dryers have pretty bad reviews  what i like about this one is how interactive the company appears to be on reviews  so that was the deciding factor in why i chose this  i went with the wifi version  but to be honest probably could have foregone that feature  i have yet to use anything via wifi  this thing works great and i have made so many yummy things in it  it is easily my most used kitchen cooking gadget since i got it  everything from bacon  chicken nuggets  chicken parmesan  empanadas  and broccoli  we are going to do some churros this weekend  easy to clean and it s sized perfectly to make enough food for a family of five  usually in one or two batches  but things cook quickly       
596,5.0,                       i decided to dive into air fryers  i have   instant pots    for home    for work  one for holidays    quart  bought my mom one too  i purchased the corsori air fryer before spending more on an instant fryer    quart  one plate of fries    plates of crispy chicken and one of half potatoes and i was hooked  so i bought the instant fryer the cosori is better than the instant fryer  easier to clean  crispier food  mind you  the rotating roaster and chicken roaster and light on the instant fryer is awesome to see thru the glass door   that you have to clean  as well as the sides of the fryer  and the rotisserie or basket  do get an instant pot  but for air frying  cosori    just bought one for mom for christmas  and i have one at work  and one at home      
597,1.0,                       i bought this product in march of this year i use it almost daily and today i noticed that the teflon is starting to peel off  i have contacted the manufacturer i will add more stars if i get appropriate feedback  there is supposed to be a one year warrantyedit  heard back from manufacturer and they recommended i purchase a replacement basket from amazon when available  not doing that because that would be teflon coated too  some warranty   i am going to try the ninja airfryer b c it is a ceramic nonstick coating      
598,5.0,                       i m in love with this thing  i put some leg quarters to air fry and let me tell you omg  the chicken was so juicy and crispy the way i like it  i d like to add that i am the worst chicken making in oven person  i will dry out my chicken and my bf and i will eat it in disgust lol   we both ate   pieces of chicken   i also threw in some brussels sprouts and asparagus which also came out delicious  this air fryer is the best choice i ve made hands dwn      
599,5.0,                       after hearing my daughter rave about how much she likes the fryer her sister gave her for christmas i bought one as well  i got the newer digital  without wifi  and find that suits me well  the cosori air fryer is so easy to clean as compared to using an oil fryer the flavor and appearance of the food is great and beautiful  so much so my husband now feels he doesn t need to replace our gas grill  it is so easy to use i just need to get him to learn how to use it  our teenage grandkids use their fryer to do tots and roasted veggies  something they wouldn t have done with an oil fryer      
600,4.0,                       so far so good  i have only had the fryer for a few days  i have cooked frozen french fries  trial and error on time   pork chops and chicken wings  chicken wings did great  pork chop a little tough but flavorful and chicken wings were the best   very juicy and tender  my only complaint is i would like a chart  and even on some of the recipes  that showed the weight of the meat used   you can buy pork chops that are paper thin to over   inch thick  cooking times are not equal and not all fryers are equal  i downloaded a chart off the internet that is a start  so i guess trial and error will be the norm until i can get used to the cooker  but overall i think it s an excellent device especially for the wife and i  now no need to turn on the oven or cook top just for the two of us      
601,5.0,                       i really like the cosori over the insta pot  i tried to make pizza in my insta pot and it came out horrid  lol  lack of circulated heat under food an i put very little food in it as i am cooking for a   year old  so there is plenty of space to expect a nice crisp  but didn t get it  now   this cosori    does very well  i don t even really need to flip it but i just do it for good practice and when i did oh boy i some sizzle when i flipped a chick patty as  if  it was a dedicate heat source from the bottom  that how well the heat circulation is  the buttons could use some reconfiguration but i just i fix the temp and time myself  i rather that than not be able to get my crisp no matter what i do  happy purchase thus far      
602,5.0,                       had two other brands and this one is definitely the best  the flavor is incredible  so easy to use with the digital program settings    super easy clean up too      
603,5.0,                       i just got my cosori     wifi enabled air fryer  so far  i love it   i can literally preheat it from anywhere in the house  it is amazing  i made turkey bacon and cookies so far  they came out perfect  i joke with my husband about it being my new baby   adult wins  also  it comes with a   year warranty  however if you register your cosori  it adds an extra year  so you get a   year warranty for free      
604,5.0,                       the reviews are right  i m amazed and totally hooked  i couldn t be happier with cosori air fryer max xl  i was debating what size of an air fryer to get and thought the cosori max xl would be too big and wide for my needs and my countertop   however  with a family of    it s perfect  i can make all sorts of dishes in a shorter amount of time  it s easy to clean and a healthier option to the fried foods my family loves  the only downside is the air fryer is a tad heavier than i would have liked but as long as i don t move it too often  it should be fine      
605,5.0,                       if you don t have one of these  you re missing out  we live in nyc and have lived on delivery for as long as i can remember  what is cooking  well the cosori air fryer showed us  this arrived right before covid    lockdowns happened  and we ve been cooking with it every day  the recipe book was a great starting point and we tried a ton  now we ve gotten a little more confident and are trying out our own recipes  looks great on the counter  and i hate keeping appliances out  everything has been delicious  cleaning is a breeze  and me and the lady are much more excited about making great food at home  revolutionary      
606,5.0,                       first want to say that i originally had the ninja foodi air fry oven  it absolutely sucked so i decided to return it after a few months of use  i exhausted myself reading reviews of legit air fryers  with baskets  and came across the corsori  i have only used it about     times mainly for frozen foods and it has been nothing short of amazing  quick cooking time and crisp food every time  super easy to clean and is truly non stick in every aspect  i don t know how long the machine will hold up for but it s been great for us thus far  try it out you won t be disappointed     
607,5.0,                       i bought the air fryer with zero expectation  besides  it was on sale on prime day  well   it has exceeded my expectation  i ve made chicken  pork  veggies  fries  and even roasted almonds and walnuts  it s basically a handy little oven on my kitchen counter  although it took a bit of experimenting to get the right  crispness  level  since sometimes things can come out a bit more charred than i prefer  the cleanup isn t difficult  the baskets are dishwasher safe  and i wipe down the interior with a moist paper towel after it has cooled  i wish i had bought the smaller size though      quart is a bit large for two people  and takes up quite a bit of counter space  overall  i m very happy with this appliance      
608,5.0,                       this is my third air fryer all different brands  this was the least expensive but works the best  the second fryer stopped working after the first use  i ve had the first fryer over a year and love it but sometimes i like to air fry side dishes with the main  i also cook for   of us  tonight  i cooked the chicken in this fryer  the chicken came out moist with a crispy coating  it was perfect  so easy to use  didn t even need the directions  it s super quiet compared to the others  it s a keeper      
609,5.0,                       this is my first air fryer and it has become one of my   must have small kitchen appliances   texture and flavor of foods is far better than any instant pot  microwave  crockpot  etc   food is cooked quickly and clean up is a dream   i do line the bottom with tin foil and use  the pre cut parchment paper liners if the item has a sauce or marinade on it     but that is because i m lazy and want the shortest clean up time effort possible   love that it has a square  not circular cooking space to fit more in   best of all it doesn t heat up my kitchen  like using the oven does  summer   no ac       
610,5.0,                       i m in love with this fryer  wow   it cooks quickly  things are crisp and flavorful and cleanup a breeze      
611,5.0,                       updated  it miraculously fixed itself   no auto reject now   back to   stars this was a great product until it developed an auto eject feature   while cooking  the tray pops out   i d like to give it   stars  but we ll see how their customer service performs   i feel i should not have to pay shipping charges if they want the broken unit back   best scenario is that i send them a copy of my invoice and a video showing the tray ejecting by itself   cooking of course stops when it ejects as should be  so the safety feature does work      
612,5.0,                       i use the air fryer several times a week   especially like using it for chicken breasts  fries both white and sweet potatoes  of course veggies are good in it also have had it for several months now and really like it bought a second one for my daughter in law for christmas and they seem to like it also with both orders they came on time with everything intact the only con is to be sure not to use anything harsh to clean the pans   i did use a scrubber on something that had stuck a bit and it did take the coating off on a very small spot   so now i just soak it a bit than only use the dish cloth to clean it      
613,5.0,                       i have had this just a few days but loving it so far   veggies were yummy  chicken good  but pre set time was too long so a little overdone   but i ll learn  i like the oil less factor and the push and forget until done seems well made  not too loud  attractive  and holds a good amount   i bought a  used  version to save a few bucks   but it was brand new  only new sealing tape added  i m pleased and pleased i purchased      
614,1.0,                       we used the air fryer to bake our typical frozen mini corn dogs  but it was a fail  it doesn t look like it cooked evenly  it had a very strong teflon smell when in use so it s very unappetizing to eat any food made with the air fryer  the area where the nails are used to hold the handle is hard to clean  there s tiny crevices there with high chance of food debris and grease oil can hide  however  i did like the smart feature of being able to control it from my phone  it s just not worth it if the food isn t cooked evenly      
615,1.0,                       so i was actually getting good results cooking with this air fryer  it just takes a little bit of experimenting honestly i got this as a christmas gift from a family member  i took really good care of it and cleaned it like instructed  one morning i was cooking bacon like i always do every morning  then i started to smell smoke and what smelt like something electrical coming from the kitchen  big billows of smoke were coming from the air fryer and smelled like something was catching fire  i run over turn it off  and unplug the air fryer freaking out  after giving it some time to cool down i unplug it  i m freaking out thing the food must have caught fire even though i used the same settings i always do and never had issues  i open the fryer and the bacon is fine and still slightly undercooked that being said it could have caught my place on fire if i hadn t gotten up quickly enough and i m very disappointed that this product didn t last  i would not even consider a replacement at this point seeing as it s not very safe in the first place do yourself a favor and just research other brands      
616,5.0,                       even though i just got this air fryer yesterday  i wanted to come on and let everyone know that this is an easy air fryer to use  it will take some time for my family and i to adjust the times to what we like  i tried the original settings for french fries they were over done  but i think that s because i used frozen french fries on the french fries setting which is intended for fresh cut from potatoes french fries  my son s pizza rolls were perfect crisp wise but he didn t like them as he s use to the oven where when its heated up the pepperoni in the rolls melts the grease and it brings out more of the flavor and it didn t do that with the air fryer  but we will keep trying  its easy to clean and very easy to use  we are happy and are now looking for even more recipes to try  great product  i will tell everyone i meet who is wanting an air fryer how happy we are with this one  it was the one with the best reviews  best pricing and all around best options      
617,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i have used this a couple of times so far  just got it aug     i do like the pre heat an then select what youare cooking  the main thing i like is being square and not round like an egg is sitting on my cabinet i have a video attached to this showing what may be a problem and it may be normal for this fryer the baskets inner and outer connection have a lot of slack as shown in video  this may become a problem in the futurewith use  i have had other air fryers  egg shaped  that had very little or no slack at all  so i hope the mfg  cantell me if this is normal for this unit  i would have given   stars if it didn t have so much slack in baskets for itis a good cooking unit      
618,2.0,                       cons  i bought this air fryer in september  it is now december  it still has a strong plastic smell when food is cooking  i was hoping the smell would go away but it hasn t  the front plastic face plate on the basket has started to melt and is now coming off  the basket isnt staying closed it pops out and stops cooking pros  it cooks good  but the food has a slight off taste i think it is from the strong plastic smell  it is easy to use and easy to clean  i was mine by hand      
619,5.0,                       i ll admit the idea of air fryers sounded silly to me until my daughter convinced me to give it a try  so glad i did  first of all  my corsori is beautiful and looks great on my counter  it has lots of pre set buttons that make it easy to get started  glad i opted for the larger     square basket  it fits   steaks perfectly and the extra room allows for better air flow  i ve  used it every day since it arrived    i love it  my husband considers himself a wings connoisseur  and he says these are the best he s tasted   so far i ve made several variations of wings  fish  meat loaf  steak  mozzarella sticks  and brussels sprouts  everything was crispy  juicy and delicious  quick and easy   seriously    what took me so long      
620,5.0,                       i was very skeptical when i purchased this because i wasn t familiar with the brand  but the number of reviews convinced me to take a chance  and our oven died and needed some way to cook food   i also thought that the whole air fryer thing was a fad  i d had a cusinart air fryer and the instant pot lid  which i didn t like at all  however i am so glad i got this first  i love this because it really is a small convection oven and so it is so much more versatile that just crispy french fries   today i made cookies for my child and i and since our oven is on the fritz  i tried them in the air fryer and in   minutes we had something delicious it is super easy to clean and i am thinking about getting a second one so that i can make multiple things  i love this air fryer      
621,5.0,                       we have the smaller size cosori air fryer and like it so much we had to upgrade to the cosori    qt  air fryer the first    qt arrived with a defective non stick coating inside the basket which is bubbled and flakes off received a replacement and there are no defects in the non stick coating   excellent we re excited to be able to cook more larger portions with the    qt unit and very pleased with this purchase      
622,5.0,                       the first one i ordered had a defective keypad  they immediately sent me a replacement and scheduled me a free ups pick up for the defective unit  ups picked up the defective one and delivered the new replacement the next day this was also the most well packaged item i ve ever gotten  it looks and works great  easy cleanup too  i ve used it a dozen times already and it works great      
623,5.0,                       i love how easy it is to use my airfryer  i have used it now to cook salmon  steak  and chicken and the food comes out great  its super quick  i have dinner ready in    minutes  i dont have a mess to clean up after and best of all my house doesn t get warmed up with the cooking which is a reason i was avoiding to cook during the heat wave in california  now i can have my fast home cooked meals every day again  i would recommend it to anyone struggling with eating healthy and cooking at home      
624,5.0,                       great air fryer  i have literally used this everyday since i received it  easy to clean and super easy to run  there are   issues i do have with it though     the screws that connect the handle to the inner basket keep coming loose     there is a minimal amount of steam leaking through the bottom left front of the basket  both do not affect the usability but a little annoying  all around it s a freakin  cookin  machine      
625,5.0,                       i ve owned or gifted six air fryers  three nu waves and three phillips  i ve also purchased an air fryer xl and immediately returned it because of poor cooking  one nu wave broke one month after purchase  they all cooked ok  we cook completely oil free  the cosori is easily the top choice  my standard is oil less crimper cut russet potatoes which i snack on daily as part of my whole food plant based diet  the cosori does easily the best job with the potatoes as well as beyond mest burgers  broccoli and anything the grandkids want  you can t go wrong  we own two      
626,5.0,                       i did a lot of research on air fryers  please allow me to tell you  you will not be disappointed  we have been using the cosori almost every day  the recipes in the book cooks perfectly  we did the vegetables  all the meats with exception of lamb and they all cook just as instructed in the book  i love the fact when cooking chicken you do not have to flip it midway  we actually roasted a small turkey breast without the bone  and it was so moist and tender  it does not take much oil at all  less than a tablespoon   i had purchase the ninja airfryer and although it work sufficient  it could not come close to the cosori  we love this product   and to clean the basket is awesome  you do not need parchment paper for any reason  it cleans very well  the design of the product is well made  very easy to operate  it is very easy to operate  give it a shot      
627,5.0,                       we are bonafide air fryer converts    we bought our    qt  cosori in december  ever since then   gospel truth   we cook      of our proteins in our indispensable air fryer  ready  we cook key west pink shrimp  filet mignon  pork tenderloin   chicken breasts  steelhead  ocean  trout  healthier tastier salmon esque   snapper varieties of all kinds  grouper  why     fast   significantly reduced odors   healthy  most we do is a very very very light extra virgin olive oil coating to adhere spices    super easy clean up we have learned to cook every single protein at     and we almost always use the pre heat  meats take     minutes then flip then     minutes then rest     minutes  steaks turn out phenomenal   even have a slight crust pork goes   flip   because we eat a   oz tenderloin cut we cook fish at     also and     to     pounds generally takes   minutes  we usually go for   minutes  the standard porto setting is     degrees and   minutes    check the fish and then go another   minutes a pound of kw pinks takes   minutes  would be ok at      the flavors and juices are perfect every time  single best appliance we ve ever bought      
628,4.0,                       i have been leary of the whole air frying craze of late   after several friends encouraged me  i purchased this one   it works great   i m single and cook smaller portions of course  but since i got this thing  i haven t used my stove or microwave at all   i ve cooked many different things and it has not disappointed me at all  time will tell if it holds up but for now     it s awesome   i would recommend the accessory kit if you cook for a larger group      
629,5.0,                       i ve had this for about   months now and i will say this thing saved me from slaving over a stove lol  it s just me and my son so i dont have to cook too much so for what we eat this is the perfect size  the instructions are clear on how to use  it even comes with a recipe book which was helpful when i cook  i add a little bit of cooking spray to the bottom and use a air fryer liner so it s not as messy  so far  it s very easy to clean  nothing sticks to it but i haven t tried it through the dishwasher yet so i dont know how it is after being ran through one      
630,1.0,                       like so many others we ordered our airfryer during covid to help diversify our meals  unfortunately  since the first use we ve experienced a smell that has always transferred to our food  we initially thought it was the newness of the fryer  but the smell and taste is still here  i wish i could say it is easy to clean  but we have the hardest time removing the basket to clean  my sister has the same one with no issues  maybe i have a deffective one      
631,5.0,                       the only negative thing i will say is the basket kind of has a cheap feel   so you you feel the need to be very careful with it when handling and pushing it in   other than that it is amazing   i made the best chicken wings i have ever made  and i have tried many methods   better than most restaurants   i have also tried fish  chicken breast  and fries   all with great results   if this thing holds up it will be an amazing part of the kitchen   i like results of things i ve tried much better than instant pot   though there are things that will still be great in the instant pot and can not be cooked in this      
632,5.0,                       always remember you have to heat it first  with nothing in it  they don t seem to tell you that   we have had problem with it burning french fries  it could be caused by putting just a few in the fryer  don t know  also cooking pork chops  it does not tell you how  we used the stake cooking  that seem to work  the taste of the pork chop was good  i believe once we get use to use it and how to cook with it i believe we will love it more  the cook book seem to have been written by a computer not a cook      
633,4.0,                       so the air fryer certainly lives up to its reputation and does cook items as if you fried them in oil  french fries  bacon  shrimp  fried chicken  and even grilled cheese  yes i m sure that sounds strange  are just a few of the things off the top of my head that were cooked to perfection this particular model comes with an easy to understand recipe book that is about     accurate  the missing     is that you may need to play around with the listed temps but once you find the right temp  it cooks perfectly  you can even get away with using some oil as well which many air fryers don t support i docked a star off my rating because despite how awesome and convenient this model is  it has a few minor faults  the screws that keep the tray intact as well as the drip pan intact do loosen up  likely from the heat of the fryer  you will need to periodically tighten them  the plastic front cover of the sauce pan is also beginning to detach  again likely from the heat of repeated use  i have attached pictures showcasing the above statements ultimately  this air fryer has quickly become my favorite cooking tool and despite its minor faults  would definitely recommend it      
634,1.0,                       this product is a big risk  i d advise into looking into a more stable and thorough product the safety hazard is the basket of the air fryer opening randomly  it can be    minutes into cooking    minutes preheating whichever  i ve made precautions and made sure it is securely closed but the problem still persists the last incident it happened  the basket popped out and fell off the counter  the basket was in separate pieces and i burned my hand trying to pick it up  on top of that i lost the food i was preparing and had to prepare some more      
635,1.0,                       i have to say i love how this works and makes meal preparation really easy  however  the coating that the pan comes with had started chipping and bubbling  i fear l may even have eaten some of it  i have used this machine less then    times  i would avoid      
636,1.0,                       only lasted   months updated review  i loved this air fryer and used it daily  sadly the handle that attached to the basket came apart after   months i love it  my meat is always nice  tender  and juicy  it s so easy and cuts my cooking time in half  all you do is season the food and put it in the basket and time it  it has made my life so much easier     
637,5.0,                       my friend finally convinced me to buy an air fryer after a year later  i chose this one because i got to use it at his house for a couple of days  i m so glad i bought it   no more wasting oil when deep frying  also  using the air fryer is much healthier  however  i do feel like i have to play around with the temperature and time when cooking certain foods  definitely had to check on my food from time to time to make sure it wasn t burnt  fyi  i did over cook and burned some fries  also  i don t get the same exact texture of the crispiness as if i were to use oil  of course because it s an air fryer   other than that  i think it s a great product      
638,4.0,                       very easy to use small convection oven  food browns and bakes nicely  i was concerned about some of the reviews mentioning the plastic smell when used   i washed it as instructed and took it outside  and primed it by using the preheat cycle   times  letting it cool down in between each time  i am hooked on this air fryer  i feel like i hit paydirt with the first purchase the only very bad thing was it did not come with the shake feature as described  i did not get what i paid for  i received an inferior model   if i hadn t performed the priming and baked in it  i would have returned it  bait and switch      
639,5.0,                       after i purchased a cosori air fryer  i was so pleased with its ease of use and how delicious the food was when prepared  i purchased one for my son  being single and working    hour days  using a conventional oven is not always an option for him  there is a reminder to alert you to turn the item over for even browning  whether it is a grilled sandwich  steak or fries  the food is moist  tasty and easy to prepare  a receipe book is included      
640,5.0,                       i was very skeptical because of false advertisements and everything that comes with shopping on line  i thought  ok  this wont be that efficient for me  but lets try it   i bought this air fryer as a gift  we tried the chicken parmesan recipe in the book that comes with it and wow it was delicious  i even used gluten free bread crumbs and they came out crispy and the chicken was moist  it was super easy to use  the book walked you through step by step and the clean up was easy      
641,5.0,                       i am so glad i decided to jump on the air fryer band wagon   its been the best cooking experience ever   i really do enjoy my cosori air fryer   i liked it so much that i bought one for my mother for christmas   unfortunately  i went with a different brand since it came with other features   i regret it and feel bad for my mother   the  other brand  is not nearly as user friendly as the cosori   cooking with the cosori is as easy as       and so is  cleaning it    i haven t gotten super crazy with it  but it makes the best steaks and burgers   i plan to return my mother s air fryer and replace it with a cosori      
642,5.0,                       i only had it for one day so far     but  we cooked three meals breakfast  lunch and dinner in it and it was amazing  easy to use  easy to get going and easy to clean  fun as well  it also came with so many different ways and things to cook  if it keeps on like this i might buy a second one just to cook more things at once  the spot where you place the food is deep in size and can fit a good amount but  if you want to cook for a lot of people you may need two or a bigger one  great for a family of   or        
643,5.0,                       cheaper than the top reviewed phillips air fryers by so much i couldn t resist trying this brand and model  having used it and cleaned it a few times i fail to see how it could get much better  works well and unless it wears out   times faster than phillips brand ones it was a great deal  make room on your counters for one more thing  cause this is going to be hard to put away  oven flavor will a few more minutes than the microwave  pretty good stuff      
644,5.0,                       this is literally the best thing every  everyone makes fun of girls who love their air fryer but it s so true  my boyfriend is jealous of how much i love it  it makes breakfast on the go easy with alexa aspect  a quick   min preheat and a   min cook for a jimmy dean english muffin and it s perfect to grab and go to work  anything frozen and fried  perfect  half the time and twice the crunch of an oven   i tell everyone to get an air fryer  i should get a sponsorship honestly     
645,3.0,                       the only reason i m giving it only   stars is because the basket drawer warped over time  we purchased the end of january  we have only had it for a little more than   months and have only hand washed the drawer and basket  but it will no longer lock into the fryer and is visibly warped prior to this  food came out just right when using the air fryer  i really love using it  but the warped drawer is now making it difficult to use since it will not stay latched while cooking      
646,5.0,                       i don t normally post reviews  but i have to commend cosori for their exceptional customer service   no one likes to deal with an appliance that quits working   the fan quit working on my air fryer after about   months   i contacted customer service to find out the process for dealing with the warranty   it couldn t have been easier   i provided a video of the issue and proof of purchase   my air fryer quit working one week ago today and this morning my replacement was delivered   i couldn t have asked for better customer support   i love my air fryer and use it almost daily   i use it to cook chicken wings  steak  and for reheating   i love it and would definitely purchase from cosori again      
647,4.0,                       this is the best air fryer i have ever had  and i ve gone through a few  this cosori wifi air fryer works miracles of food  i have baked  fried  and reheated using this unit  baked things like single serve pizza slices  potatoes  chicken  etc  made fries  onion rings  chicken nuggets  and much more the issue i have with the unit  however  is a similar issue reported by another reviewer  wherein the front panel buttons are not entirely responsive  we can sometimes get them to respond  using the full pad of your finger  rather than a finger tip  it s annoying sometimes to get things to start due to this  and at times  just resort to using the app to start the food cooking  all in all though  the issues are minor compared to the great benefit of not having to heat oil  and also wait for the oil to cool after  and the added health benefit of not having to ingest so much oily food is a plus  highly recommend this product  hopefully the company releases a v  unit with more responsive buttons  or a fix for this one      
648,1.0,                       the entire fryer is in the trash  literally    the wifi feature doesn t connect  from the moment i bought it the wifi feature didn t work    also  the buttons to actually operate the machine  they are not physical buttons but digital ones   stopped working even after very hard presses   i do not recommend you buy this item   i ve spent thousands on amazon and this is the first item i ve ever given a one star rating to   please buy a different brand      
649,3.0,                       i loved this air fryer   it cooked a little hot but i learned to adjust the time and the food came out great   i bought this for my cottage and used it maybe    times in the month i was there   returned for another two week period and when i tried to use it the front panel will not light   you can blindly push the buttons and they will respond   i have turned it off and on  unplugged it and nothing has changed   i guess i will return this unit   delivered on july   th so just over my return to amazon date   warranty says return in the original packaging which no longer exists      
650,5.0,                       dear cosori thank you so much for this glorious creation    my wife  only since receiving this air fryer  has figured out with her magical powers  how to make the best damn ranch chicken i ve ever had    it s so easy to make she s even willing to make it several times a week   she never complains about making dinner when the air fryer is being used   i need you and everyone else know how great this is   here s a short list easy to cleancooks food fasteasy to usequietit s the best      stars if i could      
651,1.0,                       i purchased this air fryer on april          hoping it would be useful for increased cooking at home due to covid restrictions  i used it twice within the first two months with no problems  but i did not use it often  when i went to use for the  th time  it did not work and hasn t worked since  while it powers up properly  it does not get hot or cooks anything  i immediately reached out to the seller  but go not response  next stop  the manufacturer  which is a huge annoyance since the item is brand new and barely used  do no by this item and stay clear of this seller  an expensive air fryer that doesn t work is nothing but counter trash that no one needs  disappointed customer      
652,5.0,                       wheni first bought this in      it s been working and cooking great  it was also super easy to clean which changed after  a year or so  the basket is pretty much no longer nonstick  it s a great appliance to have and can make healthier cooking easier  but cleaning the basket each time now is what makes me not want to use it anymore  also the build up inside the air fryer around the coils  it s like after every use i have to deep clean the whole thing which is my least favorite part about using this air fryer now update cosori was kind enough to send me another air fryer  now i can make all my favorite foods again without dreading having to clean the basket  it s so easy to clean now that it s new  easy to operate  faster than the oven   healthier than traditional frying  get this air fryer it s worth it      
653,4.0,                       i use this air frying about   times a week  food comes out perfect  i have done a roast  steak  fish chicken wings  mozzarella sticks  all sorts of potatoes   left over french fries are so tasty and heated up pizza  i have made food from the cosori cookbook  food comes out perfect   i love the bluetooth wi fi function  i can be in another room and it notifies my phone when its done preheating or done cooking or when i need to stir the food   i love the basket  its the prefect size for a roast  fish or steak  its super easy to clean  i have had no issues of the coating on the basket peeling  i have put it in the dishwasher and hand washed it  i have not had any issues with smoke coming from the unit  but do i clean after every use what i don t like hate  the push screen buttons are hard to operate  sometimes they work  sometimes i have to repeatedly push a program button touching it lightly or putting some pressure on any buttons just to get it to work  that is very frustrating      
654,5.0,                       mom tries to make as many things in the air fryer now because oily foods like bacon don t splatter all over the range  the drawer comes out for easy cleaning  but i haven t seen what the  ceiling  of the drawer looks like yet      
655,5.0,                       i researched and asked friends who owned air fryers many questions before finally deciding to buy one  i am so happy that i did  i also wasn t sure if i wanted a smaller one  but i am happy i did not go that route  although it s just me i am cooking for most of the time  this is a great size because i like to food prep and it doesn t matter if you are cooking a little or a lot  i have boiled eggs  made various styles of chicken breast and wings  and various vegetables so far  everything has turned out great and the process is much healthier than how i used to cook  big bonus  the unit is very easy to use and easy to clean      
656,1.0,                       takes up a lot of space  very quiet  food isn t any better than oven stove  not really useful  not a bad product just not for me  food was really dry  cooking times temp is off      
657,5.0,                       i have always wanted an air fryer  kept putting it off   now after the first use i am kicking myself for not getting it sooner   super easy to use   very easy to clean   looks sleek and nice in the kitchen   first thing we tried were buffalo chicken wings   now we are spoiled  we will never get them outside of the home again because they were pure perfection   crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the outside   french fries perfectly crips on the outside  tender inside   now we plan meals around the air fryer   sorry oven  you have been demoted      
658,4.0,                       bought this in june       loved this air fryer for the past   months  then after   months the basket handle just broke  looks like the plastic handle disintegrated where it attach to the basket  since posting this  they have sent me a replacement  basket  i did file a claim through their website  i hope they remedy this problem with the handle  i don t want to buy  a new basket every   to   months      
659,5.0,                       on amazon  there are so many products to choose from  from all types of unknown brands   so purchasing this was really a shot in the dark  however  i m glad we went with this cosori product because it has been incredible  it works wonderfully  is easy to clean  and can hold plenty of food  for anyone looking for an all purpose  heavy duty air fryer  this fits the bill  i m glad i went with this one instead of the less expensive options with limited functionality      
660,2.0,                       main complaint is that before   months of ownership the fan rattle s violently causing a terrible noise  too loud to continue to use  product is useful if it doesn t break down  the food has been delicious  looking for a replacement        
661,5.0,                       its so big  that s what she said   my only gripe currently is so minimal that i debated even putting it in this review   but   the  buttons  just don t feel worth the     that i purchased this for on prime day  overall as a mother this is making things easier when it comes to getting meals together  it s a little weird to get used to at first and it actually makes a lot of noise  but so far what we have cooked has been really tasty  its nice not having to bust out the cast iron and turn on the oven to make chicken for the kids  soooo   the million dollar question     is it worth it  is it going to step my kitchen game up  i bought it because it was on sale and my mom budget brain wouldn t let me pay full price when i do have a perfectly good stove for cooking  i d say if you don t mind spending the money or you buy it on sale like me      it s a good investment  so far that is   it s saved me time in the kitchen which helps when it comes to nighttime routines  so for me  it s worth it      
662,3.0,                       i am writing about the cosori smart wifi air fryer    qt right out of the box  i could not power it on   the power button is lit but does not power the machine   i gave up after several attempts and left the machine plugged in    min later  it suddenly comes on by itself  the keypad lit   after cooking chicken  well cooked by the way    i turned it off but then could not turn it back on   it took another    minutes and it came alive when i pressed the power button update  i wrote the paragraph above over several months ago but forgot to submit my review well  now the air fryer won t even turn on  even after i left it on for almost an hour   maybe  i got the one lemon in the whole manufacturing process and i am quite disappointed i don t understand a power button that does not power a machine on   any ideas  anyone      
663,1.0,                       smells like straight up plastic  ive cleaned it twice with soap and water and preheated it four times to get the smell out and it didn t work  my house smells like plastic now      
664,5.0,                       this thing has changed my life  i love love love the cosori air fryer  it s easy to use  hold a lot of food  and cooks everything i ve put in to perfection   i stayed away from cooking fried foods because i m lazy  this completely takes the time and mess out of frying   amazing one little piece of advice though  don t add any oil to the food unless you re going to stand by and babysit the cooking process   i discovered early on that extra oil isn t necessary  and it will overcook your food very quickly      
665,5.0,                       i bought this for my husband  we used to have a small round one that was starting to tarnish from overuse  he used his little one everyday so i knew it would be a good investment to shell out more money for a quality one  hubby is so happy with this  it cooks faster and gets hotter than the other one  because it has more space being square shaped instead of round  his food comes out crispier and better  the old one was smaller so sometimes things came out a little soggy where food touched  overlapped   but not with this one  we can use it for everything and it cooks so quick  no need for oil  he likes that it s digitized   the old one just had a timer dial  the only bummer is that i got the black one  they were out of the white ones and our kitchen is white  when i went back for the white one  it cost a lot more than the black  husband said that it s not worth that much money to get a different color  i m just nit picking at this point though  everything else was positive      
666,3.0,                       love the capacity  cooks quickly   clean up is not easy when washing the basket especially the sides   the buttons to change the temp doesn t work and when i tried calling customer service  several times  i never reached anyone   now the warranty has expired   i still use it using a preset with the right temperature but have to keep pushing a preset button to get the time needed since i can t change the temp manually   would i purchase again   probably not because of the design of the basket  the sides  very hard to clean and the buttons to change time and temp never worked   lastly customer service need to answer the phone      
667,5.0,                       i had a gowise air fryer before this one and it met an untimely demise from a wife spilling her horribly over sugared creamed coffee on the electronics so  i got this one wowowowow i ve been missing out on the size performance of this one vs the gowise the nonstick basket is way better too      
668,5.0,                       i am very happy that i decided to purchase the cosori air fryer  the reviews are not exaggerated  this air fryer is amazing  i have used it daily since purchasing it  the cosori    qt is sleek and pleasing to look at  the basket is large enough to prepare a whole chicken  there are    presets available to help with accurate cooking times  i can t say enough about this product  i look forward to preparing more meals and snacks in it      
669,5.0,                       i purchased the cosori air fryer max xl     quart  because of the recommendation on a cooking site   i am delighted with it   even though i live alone  i chose to purchase the larger     qt because i frequently cook extra servings   either for leftovers or to freeze and have later   i decided better to be extra large than to be too small   i ve not been sorry   i love that it bakes biscuits  fries bacon and will still make french fries and does not heat up my kitchen   that s especially important in the summer      
670,5.0,                       so far   used to  fry  shrimp  french fries  chicken wings  bacon and veggie mix   everything turned out great  clean up is very easy   my challenge is training other family members how to use it   warm up temp  timing  turning and to keep their fingers off the release button the air fryer is quicker  doesn t use a lot of oil  big savings on olive oil   doesn t heat up the house  reduced energy use   easy clean up and time saving      
671,5.0,                       easily the best purchase i ve made this year  i heard all the hype about air fryers and was hesitant that it would be similar to the instapot hype  which i found to be disappointing   but this exceeded the expectations and the hype works amazingly for reheating leftovers or for quick lunches for kids   frozen nuggets  pizza rolls  etc for dinners from scratch at home  i ve used it for eggplant parmesan  milanesa  general tso s chicken  and sweet potato fries  all have come out great      
672,5.0,                       we absolutely love this air fryer  it has helped so much especially in the summer months when we don t want to heat the whole house with the oven  about   months in the handle on the basket broke off and when i contacted customer service they provided us a replacement and were very prompt in all of their responses to us  very pleased  from our experience  it would definitely be wise to always be checking the screws on the basket handle as they do tend to loosen  but considering how much we use it a broken handle and loose screws are minor problems  would definitely buy again      
673,5.0,                       i m new to air frying and have a lot to learn i m sure  that said  i was very pleased at how my first   attempts turned out  fish  potatoes  and roasted veggies   i ve also discovered that this machine is fantastic for heating up left overs   much better texture than microwaved and not that much longer   the basket is huge and rectangular so it can easily make enough for a small family  it s a large device to leave on the counter   not too heavy which is good but not flimsy either  i m pleased that i went ahead and got one  had been thinking about for awhile      
674,5.0,                       the cosori smart wifi air fryer is the bomb dot com  it is super easy to use and the recipe book that comes with it is awesome  i love that i can control it with a free app on my phone  it s really convenient  the food is cooked perfectly and is delicious  i would recommend running it through the procedure to get rid of a plastic smell  but after using is a few times it was completely gone  i m cooking all the time now and making really healthy food  i purchased a separate accessory kit with a mini pizza pan  cake pan  muffin mold  kabob skewers  toast holder  etc  which makes it even more useful  don t hesitate to buy this  you will not be disappointed      
675,5.0,                       the only thing wrong is that i didn t own this sooner  man i wish i had one when my kids were smaller  i love this thing   it cooks almost anything without heating a huge oven and even cooks it better than an oven  i have cooked almost everything  bacon  biscuits  burgers  fries  wings  muffins  great also for reheating things like leftovers from a restaurant or whatever  my teens like it too because it s easy  it s fun and i hate to cook  i think it s because it s easy and so far everything has been so good in it  my only regret is that i didn t by two  lol  i seriously love this      
676,5.0,                       i had a phllips xl air fryer for   to   years now and it seemed like it was on it s  last leg  so i decied to see what amazon had  seeing this is the best rated air fryer decided to give it a shot with all the positive reviews  this air fryer does not disappoint  way easier to clean my phillips basket had a metal mesh and food would always get stuck in it  this one being non stick cermaic address this problem  and this air fryer is way mor consistent heating the food  night and day difference      
677,5.0,                       this air fryer is money well spent for both your health and wallet  for       this air fryer is amazing and your waist will thank you  with air fryer foods  you can have a similar texture of fried foods without all the oil  most recipes i ve made in this air fryer  i haven t used more than     tbps of oil  tops  usually i don t even use oil  just some cooking spray i ve made fries  obviously  both fresh and frozen  panko fish for fish tacos  wings  bacon  fried chicken and even roasted a full chicken  everything comes out amazing  crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside  i was skeptical to buy one of these things  but after a lot of research i finally caved and i m so glad i finally purchased one  don t think you can only make food in the air fryer that are normally fried  you can pretty much use this air fryer for anything you d put in your oven this is the second air fryer i purchased  the first one was cheaper and after i tried it out  i liked it so much i invested some more and got this cosori  it s bigger and had some nice extra features the cheaper one didn t  it also comes with an awesome recipe book  i m so glad i finally bought one  i ve convinced my coworkers to do the same after showing them some of these pics in my review  don t hesitate and buy this air fryer  you won t regret it      
678,3.0,                       so far i ve only made one thing in the air fryer  i was super excited to get one after falling in love with my boyfriend s  i m not sure was brand but was very basic    no touch screen   i was excited this one had a lot of features and had a nice sized basket  during set up i really didn t want to connect the device to my phone but i had to download an app  make an account  sync fryer to app    and finally i could start cooking  i started with turkey bacon and   minutes into it cooking it smelt like burning plastic     so i m hoping that will go away but i made sure to remove all the packaging and i washed the basket before cooking  i also feel like i had to force the basket in an out of the fryer  was just hoping for something a little easier to use      
679,5.0,                       i know  yet another kitchen appliance gadget  but this is definitely worth the space it takes up  when not in use it tucks under the cabinet  when in us it needs to have nothing above or behind or around it  it is extremely easy to use and clean dishwasher safe   we have cooked all sorts of dishes in it  would highly recommend this appliance     
680,5.0,                       we gifted my single brother a small version last year that he used many times   this year he asked for a larger one so he could cook more bigger items at the same time   he absolutely loves this model   the settings are easy to use and the cookbook has given him new dinner ideas   cleanup is also fast and easy   just what he needs  now i m waiting for our older  different brand  to die so i can get this upgraded model for us      
681,1.0,                       i unboxed the air fryer  plugged it in  pre heated it  and got to use it once  now  the air is not working at all  cannot utilize functions  very upset   also   when i first edited unboxed the air fryer  there wasn t a manual and or recipe book inside like i was lead to believe when i purchased it  the company said they would send one  never received it  they said it was available on the internet  but that is another issue  not a great experience to say the least     
682,2.0,                       update  never received the replacement basket  still don t know where it is after    emails back and forth  yesterday i noticed that now the nonstick coating is peeling off of the inside of the bottom basket  it s been used maybe    times  i have requested a refund and that has been approved  which will take at least   weeks  if they stay on schedule  it has been a frustrating experience dealing with the inferior quality of the device as well as poor service  at this point i can only conclude that the device is meant to be a throwaway  use it a couple of years  then toss it and buy a new one  definitely not for me and not what i was looking for  i will update if there are any issues with the refund  by the way  your refund is a gift card  not reimbursement it cooks great tasting food but i have a significant issue with the screws that hold the handle onto the inner basket coming loose after each use  i suspect the expansion and contraction of the metal is causing it but surely there s a better way to secure the handle since this fail point could cause injury to the user  people that love this machine are going to say so what  just tighten the screws  but that shouldn t be good enough for anybody  from what i have read  this seems to be fairly common and my daughter s machine has the same issue  i don t have high hopes that the replacement basket i requested will perform any better but i will update if it does      
683,1.0,                       we have used this air fryer about twice per week since our purchase in early april  i wash it on the top shelf of the dishwasher  per instructions   this week i was taking it out of the dishwasher  and found both rusting  there was nothing wrong when they went in  but unusable now  the manufacturer better take care of this problem      
684,2.0,                       i ve had this almost a year now and felt i should finally drop in a review  it does a pretty good job  if not for the fact about a third of the buttons are very difficult to activate it would be a really good product  it claims to be a digital interface but from my experience it is not  it doesn t act nor feel digital and is probably the reason a lot of its buttons take many many touches taps to get any response from  the product finally started to throw an e error and at this point doesn t seem as if it is going to last much longer  the non stick coat is failing and overall i will say it has been a lukewarm experience overall      
685,5.0,                       easy to use and clean  make sure you have space around it to keep the heat away from the wall plus room to pull out basket to turn food  i sat it on a wood cutting board to prevent darkening of my formica countertop  a friend said to watch out for that  with enough room to pull out the basket and set it on the wood while working on the food   made keto fried chicken which was crisp and juicy      
686,2.0,                       the fryer is outstanding for cooking if you can get the touchpad to do what you want   several keys on the touchpad either do not work or it takes multiple touches to get it to set   i have given up and just cook things at the temperature and time that it has on it when it is turned on   i would give it a five if the touchpad worked   however  i can t recommend this to anyone else based on my machine      
687,5.0,                       we ordered our cosori in july and it had the strangest odor  we aired it out thinking that would solve the issue  but the odor persisted and permeated the food   luckily  despite being past the amazon return window  cosori had us supply them with proof of purchase and batch number and immediately sent a new one   the new one has no odor we assume something was wrong with the batch of our original air fryer   we are psyched to use it       
688,5.0,                       i love this product sooooo much before i purchase this  i shouldve got the smaller version because it s really big and it s taking up a lot of space in my kitchen but  i cooked a steak in this air fryer once and it tasted so good i love how cooking my food in this air fryer saved me a lot of time  when i used to cook my steak on the stove  it ll take me about      mins  depending on how cooked i want it  but it literally took me      mins to cook the steak be aware that it does make a lot of sound when you use it  but it s not to the point where it bothers you also  stay away from the air fryer when it s being used      
689,1.0,                       do not buy     i purchased this product and it worked for maybe a month  which was the exact amount of time they give to return   so therefore i basically threw away      into the trash   product is trash  i buy a lot of things on amazon and they ve always been great with returns  but this company would not even exchange the product  i called and wrote emails  they basically said too bad       
690,5.0,                       i love this air fryer i will start by saying  i don t ever leave reviews for products unless i absolutely love them  i m a person who does thorough research before i buy a product  and rely heavily on reviews  i saw this on amazon day and got a great deal  so i figured i d give it a shot  after hours of contemplation   figuring at the very least i just had a regular run of the mill air fryer that may or may not impress me  fortunately i was not disappointed  as long as you re willing to play around with settings and try to make things a few times without expecting perfection off the bat  you will be happy  read what works for others online  pinterest is great  i use this to cook an assortment of foods  but also enjoy using it to reheat almost anything i can my boyfriends only discrepancy is that he expected it to be a quicker way to heat everything up  he s an instapot guy     so don t expect everything to cook instantly  but it is a much healthier way of cooking  i will also say that many foods i make have a very short cook time i will also say that i am so obsessed with this product that i bring it with me to a lot of locations  and find myself wishing i had it when it s not with me lol would buy again      
691,5.0,                       buying this was such a great purchase  completely changed my view in cooking  i m still getting used to it and how it works but i m in love  i did realize that it makes a really big difference to preheat the air fryer  it takes   minutes  but it is definitely worth it  i love reheating pizza i can t even taste the difference from when i bought it  the noise is low and at times gets a little higher but it goes back to being low  nothing to loud  it s so very easy to clean the basket however the inside always needs a little bit of work but be careful what you clean it with because you don t want to damage the coating inside  and be very careful with the basket when it s hot i have burned myself a few times when i get distracted well taking the food out      
692,2.0,                       this is outstanding in every way except how you use it it cooks great  it s even  consistent and fantastic unfortunately  it is paired with the worst control pad known to man  it s a quasi touch interface and it barely works at all  thus rendering the product useless skip this one until they give you actual buttons      
693,5.0,                       changed my life  if you don t have an air fryer  get one  this cosori is fantastic because it is larger than the round ones  i have another air fryer  which was a gift and i loved it  but smaller  just needed a second one for our  nd home  and i wanted bigger  the ease of use  faster cooking times  better flavors and healthier cooking makes me happy every time i use  no hot kitchen from using your stove oven in the summer  baked potatoes  any potatoes  come out fantastic  meats  chicken  pork chops  steaks  are delicious and moist juicy  i haven t baked anything in it  but plan on doing  once you start using  you won t ever want to turn your oven on  can t say enough about air frying  and this model is fantastic      
694,5.0,                       the cosori was my first af so i was a bit intimidated  not really knowing much about them  i can honestly say it s my fav kitchen appliance now  was very happy about tossing out the old grungy deep fryer  between cookbook owner s manual that came with it an awesome fb cosori group i mastered it in no time  i love that it has a square basket as opposed to the normal oval basket  another thing to consider is the excellent customer service and   year warranty      
695,1.0,                       the food comes out amazing in this fryer   but within the first week we noticed the basket would esaily dislodge itself  popping open  and the fryer would turn off   sometime it would just pop an inch or two   and sometimes it would straight up eject out and fall on the floor   we even tested on ways we could push the basket in  adding pressure up  down  or side to side   anyone who lived through the infamous blinking nintendo screen will know what i m talking about   then we d hold our breath to see if it was going to pop itself out   sometimes it worked     sometimes not over the past couple of months we kept saying  should we return this thing   the food is great but it keeps popping out    well today it finally killed itself   despite being at the back of the counter with about     feet of clearance in front of it  it ejected onto the floor   this time  in addition to ruining my food all over the floor  some plastic snapped off and the cage got bent and no longer fits into the housing      
696,5.0,                       this is basically a small convection oven   as such it is much more efficient than my large oven when making small meals for one or two people   it also replaces the frying pan and eliminates the grease splatter on the stove cook top   the french fries are great and it does well in cooking things like chicken leg quarters   i wondered if this would just be another semi useless kitchen gadget  but it has proven very useful   i use it almost every day      
697,5.0,                       i like this product sooooooooooooo much  it s so convenient and healthy  i don t need any oil with this cooking  still taste so good any kind of meat and vegetables match so perfect  also  i can make dessert or cake with this  besides  there s no smoke and food will be done in very short time  the most valuable product for kitchen      
698,5.0,                       we purchased the cosori after doing our research at  youtube university  where we watched a comparison between a cosori and the new air fryer from the instant pot folks  what cinched the deal   cleanup   we also were shopping for an air fryer that would best replace the simple recipes we would bring out our deep fryer such as fries  tots  fish and chicken  we are glad we followed the kiss principle and are delighted with the value our new     qt cosori brings our kitchen  table and diet      
699,5.0,                       honestly  we reseached and shopped a ton before buying this and now that we have had it for a month i m saving you the time  just buy this one you will love it   for our family of   we use it minimum once or twice per day and the food turns out perfect and kids love the flavor without having to fry in oil      
700,4.0,                       i loved the way this air fryer worked   easy to use  makes great food  but the buttons stopped working after three months   the basket is hard to clean  and if you don t clean it thoroughly every time  it gets gunked up   the square basket size is definitely better than the round ones  you can fit more into it   the shape and size also is a very efficient use of space seller reached out after my review of the buttons failing and replaced my unit  so its all working now   thanks cosori      
701,1.0,                       i had high hopes for this air fryer   especially after all the great reviews  unfortunately  the touch screen doesn t work i even got a replacement unit  and the second machine had the same issue  some buttons would not work at all and others would only work if you were lucky enough to push them the right way after trying   or   times  others have had this same issue  so i think there must be a certain batch of these that are just defective cross your fingers if you decide to order  and maybe your machine won t have this problem  i ended up buying the instapot   quart air fryer instead      
702,5.0,                       i had a small af which i found basically useless  after watching prohomecook on youtube and researching  i ventured into the af game with the cosori primarily cause it cleans up so well based on the reviews air circulation is great  super easy to use pre existing programs or set your own and best reason   easy to clean  microwave   air fryer makes food  especially trader joe s chicken pot pie and sheperd s pie  taste so much better without the       minute wait for a stove to heat up and bake the food  i have baked lasagna  ziti  chicken  fish  steak  appetizers  eggs and burgers   so far  i prefer steak on the outdoor grill but i was able to get a very good medium rare steak straight from the fridge about cosori support   i received as a gift the wrong size cooking accessories  for the   qt unit  for xmas and cosori support stepped up and arranged a replacement  long story but the seller  ahem  walmart marketplace  would not replace refund   they were fast and efficient  what you want in customer support highly recommend     
703,5.0,                       cosori stand behind its product  i had a concern with my airfryer and their customer service team did not disappoint me  they are very responsive to my concern  the product is really good  the food that i cooked from it is very tasty and crunchy  like it was deep fried  i had this thing called  enoki mushroom test   i have another airfryer  nuwave xl airfryer  and i couldn t get a crunchy enoki mushroom from it  it is precisely for that reason that i bought this and give this a try  i did not go for the very expensive philips airfryer  why would you pay more if you can get the desired output for less  so anyway  i managed to get a crispy enoki mushroom here   and surely it passed my enoki mushroom test     i rarely post reviews and i feel i need to post a review for this product because it deserves it  go buy this  you won t regret it      
704,4.0,                    quise esperar un tiempo para opinar luego de usar la olla estuve enamorada al principio porque primero si asa las alitas   papitas y las deja realmente sin grasa y doradas   luego las costillas de cerdo son muy buenas porque todo queda sin grasa  tengo que llevar comida para mi trabajo y la comida permanecia suave  ademas la limpieza es super facil y no hay que restregar casi nada   pongo a cocinar y solo espero el momento de revisarlo y luego al final lo saco y listo los contra  no todo queda bien en ella  no asi un bistek de res  queda fatal  o un pescado   hay cosas que quedan mejor en la sarten o el horno convencional   si quieren una mejor idea  visito a unos amigos que se compraron un hornito electrico y es mucho mas funcional que esta olla definitivamente         
705,5.0,                       i love this air fryer   very easy to use  cooks super fast and needs no oil  not any more noisy than your microwave and the coking drawer is non stick  really easy to clean  fully digital  and comes with a recipe book and instruction book  it is just amazing and i wish i had bought it sooner         
706,5.0,                       i highly recommend this airfryer  no hot spots  has a pre heat setting  cooks evening and easily   not a lot to say about it  but easy to clean and does it s job quite well  fits in plenty of food  looks quite nice on my counter top as well  saves a hell of a lot of time cleaning the kitchen too  i cook sausage  hot dogs  hamburgers  scallops  chicken wings  potatoes  french fries  fish   love this thing      
707,1.0,                       i ve just returned this fryer   the smell of plastic was terrible   i tried everything suggested to get rid of the smell  running it empty for long periods of time  scrubbing it  running it with lemon and vinegar  with no success   the corner where i had it still smells  also  the latch broke easy   also  it is quite loud   find something else  preferably metal      
708,5.0,                       large enough to cook    short kebobs  with a small insertable rack i made  or    large meatballs  or a serving of fries for   freedom fries loving americans  everything comes out awesome  my microwave broke and i haven t replaced it in months  i put a little pyrex bowl in the air fryer to heat up leftovers in the same amount of time  but better quality reheat  i even lined it with tinfoil  put bits of graham cracker down  layered mini marshmellows and chocolate shavings and made toasted smores nachos in   mins on the steak setting  endless goodness and no radiation like with microwaves      
709,4.0,                       i would have given this   stars  but     the recipe book states to flip the chicken wings half way trough the cooking time limit  the pre set for chicken is    min at      there is no warning to stop ad flip said chicken  the pre set for fries is also    min at      guess what  it automatically pause at    min  and tells you to  shake the fries   so  when i cooked wings on the pre set fries setting       perfect  i would have given this   stars   had it the  flip  warning at    minutes for chicken  no smoke  very little odor when cooking chicken  very good product  i also cooked quiche  again        perfect  amazon had this on sale for       a day after our current fryer took a dirt np  and this one is pretty amazing  last one        pretty bad  buy this  period  i also recommend buying the kit for the cooking peripherals  well worth it      
710,1.0,                       item came with a large crack on one side about    wide  i was willing to keep it anyway but i made some french fries and it only crisp the top and bottom and in the middle it was still a bit raw     
711,5.0,                       perhaps i hadn t thoroughly researched air fryers before buying this one  and therefore did not understand that you absolutely have to clean the heating unit between uses or there will be a wall of smoke pouring from it while cooking   with that understood  i now clean it between every use and i still love this thing   it s amazing   my bacon comes out absolutely delicious and all my wing ding recipes have been better than anything i ve made on the stove or in the oven   i m sorry i waited so long to buy an air fryer but i m really happy that i bought the cosori      
712,5.0,                       everything comes out so perfectly   frozen oreida tater tots took   minutes and were cooked perfectly then i used the sourdough i made earlier in the day yay covid hobbies  and buttered one side of each slice  sprinkled with some shredded cheese and cooked on the bread preset for   minutes this thing made a better grilled cheese than the panini press or stovetop i cooked breakfast sausage links this morning      degrees for   minutes and done  omg good i love this air fryer so much  i wish i had bought it sooner the app paired effortlessly  and i ve had no issues with the wifi literally my only complaint is that the beep is so loud and i wish there was a way to turn it down off      
713,5.0,                       love my air fryer   i am glad i got the big one too  the tray and cooking area is a bit small to me  and this is one of the larger ones   you can fit maybe     chicken thighs in the cooking tray   super easy to use and the food looks great after cooking  it would have been nice to have a stack able tray so you could cook two trays of wings at the same time  however  not sure if that would cook evenly with the air circulation  either way its a thumbs up      
714,5.0,                       i m an overthinker   i watched way too many videos and read way too many reviews before deciding on my cosori   i purchased an air fryer with the thought that circulating air is going to dry out meat and taking the fat out of fried foods is going to make them like cardboard   wrong   i was most concerned with vegetables which it does amazing on   crispy kale chips  awesome roasted broccoli and cauliflower  brussell sprouts etc   i finally tried meats and have not been disappointed   so far i have only tried tilapia and chicken breast and both were wonderful   looking forward to trying more the cosori is easy to use  very self explanatory but comes with a nice directions booklet as well as a good time chart for cooking the basics and a recipe book   it s super easy to clean at this point but i ve only had it a couple of weeks   the only problem i have at all is the plastic latch that moves to allow you to pull the basket out  on mine it takes some manipulation to push it forward   i think i probably have a faulty one but i ve learned to deal with it in spite of the plastic latch this air fryer is a great purchase   i wish i had gotten one a long time ago      
715,5.0,                       i purchased this as my first air fryer and cannot compare it to any other brand   my family uses this almost daily and could not be happier   i love that we can just take any frozen food and put it directly into the fryer and within a few min the food comes out almost perfect   french fries and onion rings come out so crispy with no oil   chicken  steaks  and pork chops all come out better than i had made on the stove or in the oven this machine has paid for itself many times over   if you are looking for an air fryer  then i highly recommend that you give this a try      
716,4.0,                       its been almost a couple months since i purchased this  i use it     times a week for cooking dinner or lunch  i use it to cook breaded okra  potato slices  papad  fryums  spicy raw banana andhra style etc  cleaning both the trays with soft brush and dish soap is not enough  it has the air vents which are hard to clean  presets are easy to work and straightforward to work  only thing missing is an option to place properly metal or wooden skewers or skew sticks so that we can air fry veggies or kebobs  a little pricey but i am hoping it lasts for many days with proper maintenance      
717,5.0,                       i have been researching air fryers for   months and ended up buying this one  from unpacking  through setup  cooking instructions and cosori recipes  this air fryer has exceeded my expectations  the product is intuitive to use  the fryer is very well put together  the basket and cooking surface cleans up easily  the user manual is very well written  the recipe book even better  the cosori website has recipes and other useful information  i have become a cosori fan  if this is the end to end experience they build into their products  wonderfully surprised      
718,5.0,                       we re using this thing at least five or six times a week  it is fantastic and is also good for reheating pizza slices if you re into that type of unhealthy food we do not use the smart feature so i don t know how useful it would be btw  i love pizza      
719,5.0,                       i love airfryers  this is my second one  i gave my first one away as it was too small and i had to cook per person  i bought a bigger one so i could cook in one step  temp and times recommended are spot on so far  fish and meats comes out perfect as do roasted veggies and baked potatoes  so handy cooking appetizers when company comes  it s quiet and easy to use  i use foil or parchment paper liners to save on cleanup but the dishwasher does a great job     
720,5.0,                       having an air fryer has been a life savor  i love this air fryer and it has made my life much easier  it was so convenient and easy to make meals while pregnant with this and now postpartum with a newborn  i love the different buttons you can push that have specific settings times for each thing  it also comes with a book full of recipes that i haven t used yet  but i m looking forward to making some of them soon      
721,5.0,                       amazing air fryer  this has completely transformed my life and i am obsessed with it  i use it all the time and it really crisps up different foods and makes amazing food overall  comes with a super cool cookbook and i think everyone needs an air fryer in their kitchen  very simple and easy to use and set up and fits a good amount of food     
722,1.0,                       this thing is garbage the door won t stay closed so i can never cook in it  with the virus coming around i never got it sent back but trust me it s a piece of crap don t waste your money on it     
723,5.0,                       this is our second air fryer  the first is a bit easier to set the timer and temperature on  but this one has a larger interior and much easier to clean  was able to cook about   lbs of boneless turkey breast for thanksgiving in an hour  which was perfectly crisp on the outside and deliciously juicy on the inside we typically use it for tater and veggie tots  but we ve also made some delicious mini fruit pies and pot pies in this as well  it s also fairly quite compared to the our first air fryer  and doesn t leave such a strong lingering cooked oil smell      
724,5.0,                       this product is fantastic kitchen appliance that i have already recommended to many people   you won t be disappointed cosori s customer service deserves a sixth star   i needed to contact them about a struggle i was having with one of the buttons   long story short  i was quickly fedex a replacement after they verified the problem great product and great shopping experience update  i can t emphasize enough how great their customer service is   they are a very customer friendly company and exercise good judgment in resolving problems      
725,5.0,                       i am    years old and still cook from scratch  most of the time  never do frozen foods  fast food  and restaurant food once in a while  i bought this on a whim and am so happy that i did  i use it several times a week  i ve done chops  burgers  a beef roast and several vegetable dishes  i have never been  a person who baked despite my mom being a wonderful baker  i have now baked a variety of tarts and hand pies  despite ready made crusts or biscuits and canned pie filling  everything is delicious and quick  i did prepare my own blueberry filling with fresh blueberries  my next project will be pretzels i would recommend this to anyone of any age  i think this xl size is good even if you cook for one or two  this is a large machine and i thought it would be too heavy for my arthritic hands but it is light  the only problem would be storage space because it is large if you don t have the counter or cupboard space      
726,5.0,                       i am    years old and still cook from scratch  most of the time  never do frozen foods  fast food  and restaurant food once in a while  i bought this on a whim and am so happy that i did  i use it several times a week  i ve done chops  burgers  a beef roast and several vegetable dishes  i have never been  a person who baked despite my mom being a wonderful baker  i have now baked a variety of tarts and hand pies  despite ready made crusts or biscuits and canned pie filling  everything is delicious and quick  i did prepare my own blueberry filling with fresh blueberries  my next project will be pretzels i would recommend this to anyone of any age  i think this xl size is good even if you cook for one or two  this is a large machine and i thought it would be too heavy for my arthritic hands but it is light  the only problem would be storage space because it is large if you don t have the counter or cupboard space      
727,5.0,                       alright so i didn t really know too much about air fryers until recently  picked this up around christmas time and it s really a fantastic appliance to get low fat fried foods  we ve done home style fries  sweet potato fries  chicken wings  you name it  it all came out great and very tasty  it s nice not having to use oil and we know it s healthier  did a lot of research and this is the model you ll want for just sheer capacity alone  a lot of the other air fryers just don t have enough room in them  this one does  highly recommend      
728,5.0,                       i don t normally write reviews but this one was review  worthy  this is a must buy  i have probably made chicken wings in this   times a week since i got it and they are the best wings ever  hands down  so far i have made  chicken wings  bacon  asparagus  salmon  chicken  grilled cheese and they all have turned out perfect every time  there is no learning curve and it comes with easy to follow directionsthe best part is it comes out of the box ready to use      
729,5.0,                       love this machine especially for fries the cook book that comes with it is the best way for making the fries  i m still learning to adjust the times on different sizes and cuts of meats because the cook book is a little off on the times of how long to cook and i don t like rare meat but i m still experimenting  it s terribly easy to use and it is a whiz to clean up  i love it  it makes good grill cheese sandwiches too     
730,5.0,                       let me say in a nutshell  without writing a lengthy  review it is simply the best i had used so far the price i paid for the cheap brand why i say cheap brand the teflon coating started peeling off within three months of usage   the residuefrom cooking chicken drumsticks etc was hard to remove by simple washing  in contrast this one is a breeze to clean  apart from this it evenly cooks the food of course  you have to turn it one time that is it  the timer for each variety of food is on the dot  previous one i had to increase the temperature and the minutes for the food to be cooked evenly  thank you cosori for the wonderfull product      
731,5.0,                       this appliance has changed my life because i no longer have to clean the stovetop  convection traditional oven  or microwave convection oven  this does not fry  it is a convection oven  it is so easy to clean by hand but is also dishwasher safe   it is large enough for a family of four  it is easy to convert recipes by reducing the temperature and time  but the recipe book is terrific  it looks good on the countertop  i will never fry again  did i mention it is easy to clean        
732,5.0,                       this was the first meal i made   cajun salmon and prosciutto wrapped asparagus  i really hate fish but my husband got this huge lake salmon and i thought it would be a good thing to try with the new air fryer   the asparagus was in the cookbook that came with it and the salmon recipe i found on allrecipes  cooked the asparagus first  which was a little fussy but it turned out perfect  i ve never cooked fish that wasn t breaded  deep fried and frozen  so the salmon was a challenge   i didn t know big fish have scales   lots of them  but i followed the simple recipe and had to cook it a little longer than it said  but after    minutes plus a   minute rest these very thick fillets were perfect  tender and juicy and didn t taste fishy  i made a sauce with homemade mayo and brava sauce  we just had to dig in  which is why i forgot to take any before eating photos  the meal was nearly done when i remembered to snap a quick pix my only complaint would be that the paper bound cookbook that came with it disintegrated the very first time i used it  pages    to    just fell out when i opened it      
733,2.0,                       i ordered this back in march and it says it has wifi capabilities  i couldn t figure out how to use it from the vesync app but recently revisited it and realized that my air fryer doesn t even have the wifi icon to get wifi  i feel ripped off  i wish i realized it sooner      
734,2.0,                       i only hand washed this never put it in the dishwasher   i used it regularly but not harshly   the photo looks like what would happen if someone were to slam it on the counter or something   i never did that of course   the handle suddenly fell off  the plastic broke  screw came off  etc     all i did was pick it up and the basket dropped off from the handle   thankfully it wasn t hot at the time and it didn t fall into anything else i will attempt to contact customer service and update this review depending on how they respond      
735,4.0,                       the biggest problem that i have with this and maybe i am doing something wrong  is     i have trouble with the latch  the clear plastic thing a majig is difficult to push open with my thumb  it takes too long to open the drawer   anybody have this same trouble  everything else is good  still disappointed though that i couldn t get the white one  which was more expensive for some unknown reason i don t feel that i got a satisfactory answer on the pricing from the sellers no idea about the rating where it says  flavor   i don t know what that even means thanks angela     
736,5.0,                       this was a most wonderul purchase  i got this on prime day and couldn t be happier  i like to cook and i already had an insta pot but was interested in an air fryer  this    air fryer is perfect  it is so simple to use and is a true sit and forget appliance that is super convenient for the cook  i have found the presets to be right on target but if i don t i can adjust  the food comes out tender  well done and flavorful    i look forward to many years of use        
737,5.0,                       this thing is the bomb every i ve made gas turned out great  porkchops come out      cooked and not   second overcooked  whole chicken  no problem  if you get the spices right you can make a whole chicken juicier  tastier  and bigger than whatever rottiserie chicken at the grocery stores  cornish hens are the bomb and you don t even need to know how to bake  you just have to follow recipes the recipe book that comes with is a nice starter and you should try it  lots of good stuff there  however  you can find lots of easy recipes online too don t cheap out and get the smaller one  get the bigger one  even if you are only cooking for one  why  because if you want to make  say  more than one batch of steaks or a whole chicken the bigger one is going to be the best one super easy to clean  easy to use don t forget to preheat  all those reviews saying this doesn t work are due to not preheating if you are a single guy who struggles in the kitchen and want good home made meals that taste like you know what you are doing this is it  as long as you can read and follow instructions you ll be fine highly recommended      
738,5.0,                       i love  love this machine  once sister got three of us sisters to get it based on how much she used it and loved it  when i want restaurant quality onion rings or french fries i make them in my air fryer  the quality is amazing  i love air frying beets  zucchini  cauliflower  broccoli  anything   this machine has gotten me loving vegetables ever so much more  one sister said anything from the freezer should be cooked with the snowflake preset  i have never had an issue when i ve used that  from all my fried appetizers to pierogis  egg rolls  dumplings  potato skins  i tell all my friends to buy this one now  highly recommend      
739,5.0,                       our air fryer basket had broke so i figured it was time to get a new one  the one we had was great but an eye sore on the counter so i was constantly taking it out of the cabinet  while looking i decided why not get one that matches my kitchen so i could leave it out  this is beautiful  it s sleek has tons of options and i like that the basket doesn t lay flush on the bottom  i immediately tried it out and i was pleased with the cooking and the buttons were easy to use  dont hesitate to get this      
740,5.0,                       love this air fryer  so easy to use and this is coming from a single dad with limited cooking experience  there are numerous pre sets for all types of food  i have cooked sweet potato fries  regular fries  bacon  hamburgers  fried chicken  chicken wings and roasted vegetables  all tasted amazing this system is self contained and really easy to clean  the only negative would be the size of the unit  it does take up quite a bit of space on the kitchen counter  it is worth it to me      
741,3.0,                       purchased this product          it was great  easy to use  cooked evenly   i thought i hit the jackpot   i used it about     times a week  but then in december       the buttons were getting temperamental specifically the temp time button which is a big deal   i couldn t adjust the temperature or length of cook time   i had emailed cosori since the customer service was unavailable due to the pandemic   i did not receive a response   i called their customer service   finally got to talk to someone   since i m within the warranty timeframe  the issue is covered   i had to send pics of my order details  a video of it not working   the sticker on the bottom of the unit with the batch number   i m not sure if they ll send me a replacement  but i ll update my review with the outcome      
742,5.0,                       i originally received a damaged product  but it was replaced within a week  i have had it less than a month  and am very happy with the results   i ve cooked wings  steaks  chicken  burgers  fries  veggies  salmon  etc  it is not too loud  but does make noise from the fan  i have not had any issues with excessive steam  as some other users experienced  the only thing i have noticed  is the cooking times are more of a suggestion  especially for things that may very greatly in size  a thick cut bone in steak is going to take at least double the time for the preset      
743,5.0,                       this would be great if it wasn t poorly put together i have had it for about a month or so and the entire basket and drawer came apart  i am pending the seller to send a replacement lets see if they try to make it right they made it right  i guess the first basket was a fluke because this second one was very strong  great for the price and amazed by wonderful customer service       
744,5.0,                       i was so reluctant about this purchase and i couldn t have been more mistaken  turned out to be one of the best purchases i ve made on here  now granted it s only been a week  but i haven t used my stove or oven since  it s so easy  and the food quality and flavor are better  i have much more options now  i ve made anything i couldn t trust myself to cook before lol  rack of lamb  lobster  salmon  even fried oreos  in absolutely no time  i love that i can operate it from my phone  and the shake the the reminder is awesome  the     qt is a perfect size  not too big  not too small   not to mention affordable      
745,1.0,                       the fryer is easy to look at but the positives end there  couldn t get it to power on but after using different methods  tapping  pushing  holding  etc  using my thumb was the only way it turned on  took    minutes to set time and temp to boil a couple of eggs  however  fryer turned off after five minutes  needless to say i didn t get beyond the eggs  cannot understand how this cosori received such high ratings  maybe i got a dud but i m not willing to give it a second try  it was boxed up and sent back      
746,5.0,                       i m a bit of a kitchen snob  i hate gadgets  i don t need an egginator or a peel o matic       i m happy with my knives  my skillet  my crock pot  my kitchenaid and a few basic things  the only reason i ordered this thing is because my adult son wanted one  and because it s one more thing i can add to my nerdy smart home that being sad  this thing is awesome      i had no idea how easy this could make life in the kitchen  we ve had it for two days and already we ve managed to air fry side dishes  veggies  snacks  wings  cherry pies  and the list goes on on and on  it s easy to use  very spacious  easy to clean  and everything we ve made has been fast and delicious from a smart home perspective  we re finding the app is more useful than the alexa connectivity  there may be more to it than i realize  but there s very little guidance as to what it will actually do with alexa  where the app is simple  clean  and easy i can t recommend this unit enough  if you re in the market for an air fryer  this is the one      
747,5.0,                       i didn t open the box of the cosari air fryer for a few weeks because i was dreading trying to figure out how to use a new appliance  big regret  this air fryer is so easy to use   super easy to clean  i ve baked potatoes  cooked bacon and french fries  roasted turkey   everything has come out beyond my expectations  the other great aspect is that there is no hot oven air   i will be using this air fryer all summer long  i chose cosari because of the reviews about how easy it was to clean  also  it has a larger basket capacity  great price too      
748,1.0,                       this air fryer gives off a bad plastic or electrical smell when used    two days after use  i am still trying to rid the house of this odor   i returned it for a refund because i did not want to take a chance trying another one      
749,5.0,                       i love this air fryer  i mostly use it to make veggies or reheat leftovers  it s makes reheated pizza perfect  better than fresh actually  but for an xl it still doesn t hold a ton of stuff  that s just how air fryers are  best for     people  also a little annoying to hand wash and dry  but it s negligible  it s still my favorite fun kitchen gadget      
750,5.0,                       virtually everything about this fryer is perfect  everything i have cooked in it has come out great  french fries  chicken tenders  bacon  toast  pizza  reheated pizza   was just like fresh cooked  baked red potatoes  etc  clean up is always a breeze  nothing is ever stuck to it  the only oil i use is spray olive oil from a pump pressure spray and usually very little the one and only thing that i was not impressed with is the recipe book  when i first opened the book the backing split and all the pages fell out  good thing i can get all the corsori recipes online      
751,5.0,                       i can t believe i didn t know about air fryers and have one sooner   i love this machine   i have done pork chops  steak  bacon  breakfast sausage  frozen egg rolls  green beans  brussel sprouts and more   all turn our excellent   was really surprised with the steak  it was awesome and the pork chops come out tender  juicy and better than any i have ever had   use this almost every day   cleans up super easy and cooks things in less than half the time of a traditional convection oven   if you don t have this  you need it      
752,5.0,                       we cook so many things in this air fryer  frozen foods and leftovers are a breeze to heat up  we barely even use our stovetop anymore except for stews and boiling water  i really like the fact that the timer pauses when you take food out to shake and resumes when you put the tray back in  really easy to clean as well  our go to this week is air fried hot dogs    minutes at     without the bun  then an extra minute at     with the bun  yum      
753,1.0,                       this would have been been prefect if it lasted longer than   months  my unit randomly cuts off in the middle of usage      
754,5.0,                       i became a pescatarian this year and i ve really missed fried chicken  so i needed a fish alternative  i m so happy i invested in this    i can fry a whole catfish no problem  and would you believe it tastes better than regular fried fish in oil  you can really taste the flavors of fish and shrimp in this thing  i highly recommend it i got the biggest size to accommodate a whole fish i lay it diagonal in the tray  cook it on one side for about       minutes then flip it over on the other same time on the default degree setting for fish      
755,5.0,                       little pricey but with the stamp of approval of being an amazon best seller  it delivers easy to use  sort of a pain to clean  depending upon what you put in the basket   but efficient   from veggies and roast chicken  smallish  to fish and wings  this air fryer cooks evenly and quickly  ive mastered making crispy chicken wings  psst  arrow root flour after patting wings dry before seasoning  in this air fryer and it has become a staple for every football sunday  there is literally no end to what you can put in this air fryer    if youve been waffling for a while about whether or not to purchase one  take the plunge and you wont regret it  i love this thing   i mean  i m actually taking the time to scribble a review of it      
756,1.0,                       super excited to get product   it was delivered monday but due to hectic week opened today  the shipping box was in perfect shape but the product box appeared to have been taped back   once opened there was a   inch crack on the left side of the cooking element section   that section completely came off appliance   it had several pieces broken inside as well   i returned and hope that i get my refund      
757,2.0,                       purchase and replacement failed after at most    uses each   no heating  i m guessing either the thermostat or heating element company was willing to send another replacement but too much of trouble  kudos to the seller the product itself is great  the very big basked is very easy to clean  connecting to wifi was simple  the app was simple to use too  doesn t come with any accessories      
758,5.0,                       best air fryer i have owned   easy to clean and operate   the best feature is the wifi bluetooth option to cook  alert and control from phone   it s a convenient  way to keep track while it cooks no issues  easy to set up   makes the best wings period   i bought this because of a wing video on youtube they looked as good as i make me  didn t regret it one bit    wife says it s the best too      
759,5.0,                       i am so happy i chose the cosori air fryer  i had been comparing air fryers and reading reviews on the different brands for a few weeks and cosori always came up with great reviews  it s a solid well built air fryer compared to some of the brands i looked at in stores  all of the food i have cooked in it has turned out perfect  i recommend this air fryer for anyone trying to decide which brand to buy      
760,5.0,                       please excuse my inattentive video un boxing haha   i couldn t wait to recieve the air fryer  after taking it out of the box i wiped down all components with a dry paper towel downloading the app was easy  aside from controlling the air fryer with my phone   i was able to connect it to alexa as well   which is a plus the steak i placed into the air fryer came out beautifully  i was a bit concerned about the steam that was escaping on the bottom right hand corner pictured   but this is my first air fryer   so i m not the expert on what to expect overall i feel like it s done an amazing job   i can t wait to try all of the recipes      
761,2.0,                       from the first minute i plugged this machine in only half the buttons worked  the app works so i cook using that  but a waste of half the money considering the entire product needs to work not half of it i already recycled the box before i tested the product out  which is why i don t feel like dealing with the pain of returning this machine my opinion is to buy a different product  don t buy this one  it s really crappy that only half of it works      
762,2.0,                       i really want to be positive because i love and use this air fryer often but the basket is on the verge of being unable due to rust around the vents  it s always hand washed and properly dried but no luck beating the odds  i also have noticed that a burnt smell is starting to emerge when i use it      
763,5.0,                       we love our air fryer so much we cook just about every dinner in it    we bought it at the beginning of quarantine and have used it daily since  when you cook your meat it is so juicy and crispy   quick   bacon crispy in   minutes    what     no splash no mess   it even impresses my very hard to please husband  he has even learned how to use it when he know my kitchen is closed  lol   the only issue we had is the screws started to come out of the basket and base area  we just kept screwing it back in until that no longer worked  the machine was still useable   so i called customer service and they were very helpful    they called me back in a timely manner and then we started to email back and forth and within a couple emails they quickly resolved our issues    they have us a full refund  you know what i m gonna do    buy the same air fryer    that way i can cook meat in one and side dishes in the other  side note my sister bought an air fryer different brand  and it is nothing like this cosori    hers smells like burnt plastic when she uses it and it was the same cost as this wonderful machine   go with cosori   they are the best   so is their customer service team        
764,5.0,                       one of my best purchase  i use this all of the time  works very well and cooks good and fast  wifi comes in handy if you re away from home or not near the air fryer  cleans fairly easy and even comes with a recipe or instructions book  the only bad thing i can say about it  is that is very loud when it goes off or when you press the buttons  definitely would recommend      
765,5.0,                       i gifted myself the     in red  for christmas   i am very pleased so far   still figuring out a few things along the way   it does provide a very easy way to prepare meals  and the results are some very tasty dinners with hardly any clean up   i can see this being a healthier way to eat  as there is little need to add oils to prep   example  chicken cutlets  eggplant parmigiana  without having to cook on the stove top with splattering oil       
766,3.0,                         stars it s an easy and basic air fryer  i use it all the time and it works great  the only thing i would have done differently is probably not choose it because of the wi fi  the wi fi can only be used on a  g network which nowadays everything s  g or  g  the only option it tells you is to call your network provider to use  g which i don t understand why anyone would do that  overall no complaints just can t use my wi fi with it      
767,5.0,                       what a game changer  perfect size bin  easy to clean  and very easy to use  i love the touch screen and presets but having the option to set my own time and tempature  i love that it pauses when you remove the basket to shake  only downfall is you can only set the timer by    s and not   s  so you can t do       if you can i haven t figured out how to do that yet  it s a bit loud when cooking and buttons are loud when pressed  but not a huge deal  the sleek design is really nice too      
768,5.0,                       we have cooked chicken  steaks  pork chops  french fries  and probally ten other things   the quality of the finished products is fabulous and the taste is unmatched  it makes the food taste like a chef cooked it  in addition to what i  mentioned  the customer service is outstanding  the handle broke on it  when the basket popped out we had it to close to the edge of the counter  and it fell on the floor we contacted customer service and had a new basket shipped out at no cost to us  i am extremely pleased with the outstanding customer service of this company highly recommended  and again i am just mind boggled by how well the food comes out       
769,4.0,                       i had an air fryer before that made food taste very peculiar and not appetizing at times  this one does not have any weird smells or anything of the sort so i automatically loved it no complaints at all i love it altogether and i pretty much only cook using this now  if i could complain about one thing is that it doesn t go higher than     degrees  but it s not really a complaint that bothers me too much it cooks food very quick and leaves it crispy when you want it  i ve been looking for an air fryer for a while and this one was exactly what i wanted     
770,5.0,                       excellent although not as quiet as i had expected  i love it though and hopefully the nonstick surface doesn t peel off like my other one if a different brand  opening and closing also seems different or not smooth but maybe i m not doing it right  the food cooks exactly like the photo in the recipe book that it comes with and it s very tasty  the mongolian chicken wings are delicious  i highly recommend this airfryer      
771,1.0,                       the unit was working really well until the part that holds the handle on the tray melted off  not sure why this piece was made from something that can melt  i am very disappointed and would advise that you order a more reliable product and manufacturer      
772,5.0,                       i wasn t sure i d use this much  but after having it for a few weeks i m not sure how i managed to cook without it  i don t like to spend a lot of time cooking  so this has been a huge help  i ve made chicken wings and buffalo wings  fish  roasted brussels sprouts  homemade potato wedges and fries  even the kids admit that store bought fries and nuggets taste better when i make them in the air fryer  extremely time saving when i m hungry and don t want to spend a lot of time cooking   and cleanup is almost as simple as rinsing it out  light scrubbing and the nonstick surfaces are easily cleaned   i also prep a few days worth of meals  between this and my instant pot  my meal prep time has been drastically reduced      
773,5.0,                       our first air fryer ever  this machine is extremely easy to use and understand  recipe book included has loads of really nice recipes  made my fried chicken today  pan fried some  just in case we did not like the way it cooked in the air fryer  we did not use their recipe  just mine  it was better than the pan fried  and used only   a teaspoon of oil     i reheated the leftovers for dinner in the air fryer  the chicken came out hot and just as crisp as if it were just made  we have also made salmon in it  perfection    excited  to keep trying new things with this wonderful machine      
774,5.0,                       wow  what a difference from our last  big name  brand which conked out after    months i highly recommend using parchment squares which makes cleanup a breeze  what you re going to love is how quiet it is  the difference is significant the presets are helpful especially the preheat  don t put food into a cold air fryer  just as you wouldn t out food into a cold pan all in all i am thrilled with this air fryer      
775,5.0,                       i ve only had it for a couple days so i ll update my review if i change my mind but so far my family loves it  i ve made pork chops  chicken wing  kids chicken nuggets  fries and quesadillas   they have all turned out great and i can t believe how crisp the outside of the food gets  it s so nice not to have to turn on the oven for small items like a  quesadilla      
776,5.0,                       i normally do not buy countertop cooking tools  i m really glad i bought this one  i live alone and use it more than frequently  i use it to cook my proteins and i also use it to warm them up  i put leftover meats in and turn the cooker on to preheat  my leftovers come out hot and crispy unlike a microwave where they come out hot and gooshy  iot cleans easily  the only thing i don t like is that it is large and must stay on the countertop  even though i measured it was larger in life than i thought      
777,5.0,                       i have an airfryer at home and i love it so much i decided to get one for work  i wanted something big enough that i could also make my colleagues or my students something and this one is the perfect size to do that  i can make myself a healthy  freshly cooked lunch right in my classroom and clean up is super easy  the only issue i ve experienced is that the basket can seem like it s all the way in when it actually isn t and it can then pop open during cooking and stop the process  just have to make sure it s truly clicked into place      
778,1.0,                       arrived broken   the box was crushed and taped up but the machine was cracked on the side and the inside the metal was crushed and the drawer won t go in   very very upset i m trying to return it but it s big and hard for me to find a box and take it somewhere or have ups pick it up   ahhhhh but the machine itself looks really nice i just wish i could use it     
779,5.0,                       i was a little hesitant to buy this style of air fryer  as i had a larger one previously that i loved  but i didn t have as much counter space at this new house  so wanted to try to find one that could still fit a decent amount of food in it  but that didn t need to be on the counter permanently and didn t take up as much room   well  this is perfect   we are really happy with it  it has a ton of pre set features for veggies  fish  meat  etc   and is super easy to clean   the recipe book that comes with it has some really good recipes and with just the two of us  the portions are ideal   i like the square basket shape and the size of the area for placing the food is great      
780,1.0,                       although this worked fine with no problem  i could not keep the outside smudge free  it is a fingerprint magnet  when the light hits it   we have a bright kitchen  the fingerprints were so visible  we even had company comment on it  we tried everything  it did not look good  when i called the company for help they told me to use  goo gone  on it  iam not comfortable using that on a food appliance  i returned it  we bought a go wise and did not have this problem  the go wise sits nice and shiny on our counter and problem solved      
781,5.0,                       my family absolutely love the cosori air fryer  we have used and owned various toaster ovens and convection ovens for years  but this cosori air fryer by far is our favorite  it is very easy to use  my    year old cambodian mom can use it with ease  we cook various things including chicken wings  nuggets  fish  ribs  frozen fries  fresh fries  tater tots  chicken thighs  roasted vegetables  toast  etc  we toss it in and that s it  the cleaning is also very easy except the side grills require a little more attention  highly recommend this      
782,5.0,                       i have been trying so many things in this so here we go    thick hickory bacon  push bacon icon twice  no flipping crispy yummy    lemon pepper chicken  boneless  skinless thighs   push chicken icon  flipping once crispy juicy flavorful brown  fyi no oil     fries and chicken strips  hit icon fries  flip once cooked through crispy  juicy  brown yummy  fyi no oil i ve tried many more items and loving it  i bought the nuwave and wasn t to impressed this one is so much better if you want videos on what i make and cook let me know  i m trying to get away from processed everything and healthy but yummy  getto fab       
783,5.0,                       i have put off buying an air fryer until now   but my daughters convinced me to try one   i picked this one from amazon   it is easy to use for a beginner and is very easy to clean because the baskets have a coating   i am going to bake some beer battered cod tonight      
784,2.0,                       i bought this unit about a month ago and have used it   times   i have washed it before and after each use because all of the food i cook in it has a taste very similar to the smell that you get when you take something out of the box from the factory for the first time   it ruins the cooking experience when you can taste that in your food   no amount of seasoning can hide it   the times work well  and the size is nice   i would probably love this fryer if only my food could come out without unintended flavoring from the factory      
785,3.0,                       we bought this for the house  and also holidays   as we have   kids and thought easy to get them onto fresh french fries  we have a french fry maker  vs the frozen  and fresh chicken nuggets  versus processed   etc the screws that hold the handle to the basket have come out   times   my husband is a gc and has screwed it back in properly versus me manually doing it s also very difficult to clean other than that   happy we tried it  but on our next purchase i m going to move to a better more professional brand this seems like a good idea for maybe a single person or a couple   not for a family with   stay at home kids due to schools closed with covid   it s not meant to handle a lot of use      
786,5.0,                       have had the air fryer for about   weeks and very impressed with the product   our family has used the appliance about    times and the meals snacks we cooked have been delicious   i  like others who have commented  was reluctant to purchase an air fryer  but i am pleasantly surprised with the ease of use and the taste of the food we ve cooked   for those looking for an air fryer  i would recommend this product due to the simplicity of the controls  the ease of use  and the simmpleness of cleanup      
787,5.0,                       amazing product i ve been wanting an air fryer for a couple months now  and since going vegetarian this is the best kitchen gadget i have invested in  there are so many different things that i can use it for  so far i ve made tortilla chips  fries  sweet potato fries  roasted potatoes  and bread  i m obsessed  pros  super easy to clean bc of the nonstick surface  doesn t heat up the entire kitchen like an oven  amazing safety features   high tech  for only       looks nice on the counter  variety of uses  great recipe book included  awesome shake feature  fast cooking  pretty big basket cons  temperature doesn t go lower than     f  have to be more cautious as to not burn food  the smell from past foods sometimes remains in the fryer even after cleaning but it s not a bad smell  more like that grease smell that s always around fast food fryers  pretty loud button sounds and beeps  cant cook at midnight without waking the whole house up overall this is the best purchase i ve made for my kitchen and when shopping for new kitchen gadgets i will definitely come back to the brand first      
788,5.0,                       so i have a microwave convection oven that i use everyday  but  some foods do not really crisp like i would like i got the cosori     qt  as a good size to use  french sweet potatoe fries do extremely well  i tried several type of chicken recipes and this unit was superb  roast vegetables are great  larger recipes i still use my convection oven  but using them together gets the job done that much faster      
789,5.0,                       i got this machine because it has a timer and the it stops when done  i take care of an elderly parent and she walks away from our stove and forgets to turn things off  this air fryer solves the problem and we are now safer   we ve had many successful meals from the air fryer  last might we had kababs  really good  we ve had mixed veggies and pizza  the absolute best items have been the potato fries and zuccini fries  we love and recommend this machine      
790,5.0,                       i was convinced based upon reviews that i had to have a philips xxl   did some more research and found the cosori was comparable   after watching some you tube videos  decided to purchase this machine   it is excellent and does a great job   we have  air fried  several things and they have all been great   i would recommend this product and the price is much more  friendly  than the other brand      
791,3.0,                       great air fryer  gorgeous  large capacity  food crisps very well  but warning  i wish i was warned  the seemingly innocent beeps it makes drives my     lb dog crazy  he runs out of the room like a scared little kitten  it s bizarre  so i don t use as much as i would like cause it s torture for my doggy  any help would be appreciated         
792,5.0,                       we had this for almost    months now and we love it especially chicken french fries and soft pretzels there was an issue with the power cord getting damaged and i contacted the company they got back to me very fast  after sending them the proof of purchase date and then pictures of the device and the damaged cord they are sending a new one under the warranty  outstanding customer service other companies could learn from them      
793,5.0,                       this is my first time to write comment in amazon com after receiving this air fryer days ago  i use it every day   this leads totally many changes   it takes me much less cooking time in kitchen with good flavour  and it s really easy to clean   i have tried salmon  vege  french fryer  pork rib and so on after cooking lamb rib with   minutes  i feel i will never use my oven any more  and maybe much less grill  this is really convenient other details   no odd smell since beginning   the noisy is acceptable   i m figuring out how to use it via alexa   till now   turn on my fryer  is for pre heat by default  but if i say  turn on my fryer in   minutes   alexa cannot understand it  i just bought alexa weeks ago  and not very familiar with how to integrate both   customer service is surprisingly quick and responsible   star       
794,5.0,                       i like it because  it  easy and convient   tried on homemade  egg rolls  they cooked up crispy and brown  golden color  just spray with cooking spray  before cooking      
795,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          it is slightly bigger than i thought and slightly noisy but this is much better than turning on the vent and standing in front of a stove  i just put in my food and walk away to work in my living room and everything is done   no more sizzling sounds  no more grease splattering  no more scraping pans no more standing in front of a stove  i can now eat healthy and save tons of time and energy to do things i want to be doing      
796,5.0,                       easy to use  like the preheat button  first use of fryer was making teriyaki boneless skinless chicken thighs   top was a little crispy from sauce but bottom was moist from sauce and inside juicy  family devoured the chicken  the first day we tried shrimp   fries and vegetables and all were delicious  we are so impressed by the ease of use and taste of food  we will be purchasing a second one to use when preparing food for more than family of   adults  a plus was the baskets were so easy to clean in sink  takes up a little more space than a regular coffee maker looking forward to trying more recipes with our air fryer      
797,1.0,                       if this machine was  a  made better and  b  could hold more  it would be perfect   unfortunately  the coating in the basket quickly wore off and began to rust   the plastic handle that secured the basket began to crack and eventually disintegrated   don t be fooled by the advertised wifi feature  the fryer isn t able to maintain a wifi link to allow you to start  monitor or stop cooking via your phone      
798,5.0,                       i have made so many things in it   i have made hamburgers  meatloaf  toasted cheese  hard boiled eggs  chicken  pork  banana bread  cinnamon rolls  pizza   i love to make different things everyday   my oven has become a place to store things for my air fryer   i put a magnet over start so i remember if i do use it   i think you will love it   if anything changes i will post an update      
799,2.0,                       there is a strong plastic smell that is still there after three weeks of usage  it makes the food taste the same  i was hoping after constant use it would go away but it never did  when ever i use it it makes my small apartment smell like burning plastic  also the fan is starting to rattle   going to return     
800,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this air fryer is amazing  oh my gosh i love it and use it all the time  i ve done hash browns  o brien potatoes  chicken fried steak  chicken parmesan  fried pickles  bread sticks  cookies  steak  french toast sticks  egg rolls  i have done so much and love it  reheats food much better than a microwave also  great buy and very easy to clean  the cookbook that came with it has many good recipes  have not made anything i didn t like out of the little cookbook      
801,5.0,                       i m seriously so in love with this thing   it took me a while to finally try it but once i did  i was hooked  it s so easy to use and very convenient  and the food comes out amazing  i ve joined some air fryer groups on fb for more recipes but it also comes with a little recipe book as well  also super nice to be able to connect it to your phone  it s pretty easy to clean except for the slits on the sides but it s worth it        recommend      
802,2.0,                       have had for a about a year and a half  great size and easy to use  food taste great while being super easy  unfortunately last week the handle melted  the screws holding handle on would loosen after every   or so uses  always having to tighten them  used a soft sponge to clean and steal the coating wears off  for the price and length of usage it was great  trying to get warranty to replace parts  if all goes well i ll update review      
803,5.0,                       we was really looking forward to our new air fryer  however the buzzer beeper on this item is the same noise and loudness as our smoke detectors which tend to send my german shepherd into major panic causing stress and detection to us and the house   discovered that you can remove the top by gently prying up around all the sides to gain access to the circuit card   the buzzer is labeled on the circuit card buz  in the attached picture   just disconnect the power cord and use needle nose plyers and twist it off the circuit card and it will come off   put the top back on and plug into the outlet and off she goes  air fryer without a buzzer or beeper    back in business  pictures attached with top  circuit card  and peizo removed   enjoy quietly without german shepherd attack      
804,1.0,                       i really wanted to like this air fryer  but unfortunately the buttons on the fryer didn t work     of the time every once and a while i would finally get a button to work  i thought maybe it was a one off issue and tried it two more times but all three of the units i received had the same issue and only one of them was able to get connected to the app which allowed for it to be used but without the main buttons on the unit working i couldn t keep it     
805,1.0,                       i got this brand new and i can t turn it on after trying everything   the touch panel is non responsive   returning at once      
806,4.0,                       i have found that it take some time to learn to trust the preset   i have had to adjust my cooking time for some item still trying to get thick cut bacon  right  preset for chicken  is about right i had to adjust the temperature up to      for the preset time   only other problem i have is the basket will pop out sometime   cosori has offer to re place this unit   love it so far  still learning  how to cook without peeping  my wife love the way is cook chicken wings and fish      
807,5.0,                       we love our new air fryer   it s got a large basket and  is easy to use and clean   it came with a handy little cookbook and the instructions for use are clear   it is pretty large and takes up a bit of counter space   you would need a good size cabinet to store it   i don t have anything to compare it to but it seems like a good air fryer for the money   definitely recommend      
808,5.0,                       wasn t sure what to expect  had held off on buying an air fryer  because i didn t really understand them well  a friend s wife kept telling me that she uses it all the time and how great hers was  actually saw her use hers one weekend and thought time to do this  bought the cosori and love it  i thought what the heck  i ll make buffalo chicken wings  verdict  tastes just like the restaurant  again  i didn t understand how an air fyer worked  so i thought there was hot oil at bottom and air would circulate throughout  nope  not how it works  no oil  but i will tell you this  those wings tasted every bit like they were  fried   they were delicious  highly recommend      
809,5.0,                       all i can say is   if you re a foodie  you need to have this in your kitchen    it s quick to learn the device  presets are built in   so press a button and your selected meat or other foods are done    and it is easy to clean  the tray basket pops out and any drippings are a breeze to remove from the nonstick surface   lastly  the cooking speed is fast and thorough  because the heat circulates around the food   the only thing you have to be ready for is the operating asdound of the device   it can be loud  but what do you expect from a unit having a strong fan to move that heat around   look  its versatile and sturdy   a rare thing in today s market of kitchen appliances  make the investment   you will not be sorry       
810,5.0,                       i have to admit  when my husband ordered the air fryer i gave him a hard time about having another kitchen appliance on the counter   but we have enjoyed this air fryer immensely   we cook something in it almost every day  whether it s meat  fish  veggies  cheese curds   everything comes out delish and cooked perfectly   i would say my favorite are the roasted veggies   easy to use and clean up   just soak it in the sink for a while with some soap and warm water and it cleans right up      
811,5.0,                       this new air fryer is a great addition to our kitchen s cooking tools   large capacity  very user friendly  beautiful red color  no finger prints  light weight  delicious results and not noticeable heat add to the cooking areas  amazing selection of presets to make it so easy to use with great results   after we got ours we bought another for a gift to our daughter s family   they rave about how everyone in the fast paced family gets fast hot cooked food home rather than eating fast junk food away from home      
812,3.0,                       this air fryer cooks well and has a lot of space   on average i m putting    wings and that without piling on type   also made a nice salmon   only con is the touch buttons mostly do not work   bluetooth is your second way to control it   if your wifi dies on you  you can t use the fryer   make sure to use the preheat setting as recommended by the instructions  otherwise you cooking twice the time recommended for your choice of meat   also customer service is nice   they sent me a replacement quickly   i haven t had time to see if those buttons work   might update this later      
813,5.0,                       best way to cook chicken nuggets  if you have little people who eat protein only in the form of chicken nuggets  this air fryer is for you  also works for reheating meatballs  french fries  taquitos  and pizza  makes great bagel pizzas too  this was quite possibly the best kitchen purchase i ve made when it comes to feeding small humans  side note  the design of the basket is superb  much better than the cheesy flimsy trays i ve seen in other brands of air fryers      
814,5.0,                       i waited so long to buy an air fryer because so many people would tell me oh i dont like it or they said so much was wrong  well i decided i loved the look of this one and i finally wanted to try it for myself  i am so glad that i did   i use my cosori everyday  i have made wings  cheese sticks  chicken breast  pork chops and so much more in it already and i have only had it maybe   weeks  the meat comes out so juicy  i cuts my cooking time in half almost with a family of   i am able to set down and enjoy dinner without having a huge clean up after as well  best choice i have made  oh and i tested my cosori with someones nuwave  just to see the difference  lets just say my cosori won      
815,4.0,                       a year ago  i purchased the newest modal of cosori air fryer  without the wi fi feature  and immediately enjoyed using it   i am almost totally blind and so had bump buttons placed on the different settings on the front panel and thus made it easy to use   its larger square size basket is roomy and a good shape to hold a whole chicken or for laying out a row of veggies   its simplicity and quick cooking have made it more convenient and fun   i also should mention the company s excellent customer service   recently  the cosori air fryer stopped working   i contacted the company and was offered a refund but i wanted a replacement and they obliged   so  i got a replacement within a couple of days and happily am using it every day once more   they asked for the old one to be returned to inspect and that tells me that the company is a conscientious one      
816,5.0,                       easy to operate  some recipes needed to be cooked few minutes longer than suggested by the recipe book  same goes for preprogrammed dishes  not a problem  though  once you experiment few times  lemon garlic chicken was  actually  better than i ever tasted  cooking times  for most dishes are pretty fast  so far could not get a good steak from it  could have been problem with the meat itself  i gave this unit as birthday present to friend of ours  and he was praising the steak he cooked in it      
817,5.0,                       we cooked our first meal in the air fryer and it was absolutely delicious  tempura asparagus  tempura avocado  tofu and sweet potato  the resulting flavor was amazing  everyone should have an air fryer in their house  very easy to clean as well              
818,5.0,                       very nice product  worth the money i love the color  it is red and beautiful  i should have gotten more red cookware  it looks so pretty  also  it makes my frying process way way way easier  i don t need much oil  and it can taste just like tea fried recipes  also  the size is very good too  i use it for one to three people  and it portion is just perfect  love it      
819,5.0,                       needed to update my previous one which was not bad  different brand and after several years was starting to act up  this is much better  i ve cooked steaks  fries  hash browns   italian sausage etc  you name it including small whole chickens  everything comes perfect  easy to clean  easy set ups  there s not one negative thing  i can say about it  get it  you won t regret it      
820,5.0,                       have had the af for about   weeks and love it   the design is attractive which is important since it will live on my countertop   the inside is easy to clean non stick   operation is intuitive   also appreciate the   year warranty offered to amazon customers   contacted cosori customer service with a question and received an email back within   hours   can t beat that   if i didn t already own an instant pot  i would buy the cosori pressure cooker based on their service alone      
821,2.0,                       i am very disappointed in the quality and build of this airfryer  i ve had this product since christmas     months  and within that time  the plastic handle on the basket has cracked  with plastic breaking off in chunks and slivers along the back side of the handle  in addition  the basket often pops out during the cooking process  creating the need to put a heavy object in front of the door to keep it closed  based on reviews i have read  others have also experienced this issue  the cosori brand unfortunately seems to have some quality controls issues with the build of their pieces  once you figure out the best settings to use based on the food you are cooking  this airfryer makes tasty and juicy food  however the quality issues with the product overshadow the positives  based on the price point of this model in comparison to other airfryers on the market with good reviews  this product should quality should be higher and these issues should not be occurring      
822,5.0,                       our first air fryer was another brand   the basket was round   it finally gave out   we decided on this one   we like the square basket  it s bigger than our first one    we like the digital temps   time   we have had it for about   months   usually use it several times a day   it really gets used   it s still just as good as day one   we also like the recipe book that came with it   have made some of the recipes   we would highly recommend this brand      
823,5.0,                       we bought this in november      and have used it regularly    months later  it still looks brand new  the basket is extremely easy to clean  i looked at reviews of all air fryers before choosing this one  based on other s feedback on ease of cleaning and they re all right  this is the best of the best when it comes to easy cleaning  we especially love boneless chicken strips floured with ranch dressing mix  super tasty and healthy      
824,4.0,                       i have really enjoyed this air fryer since i purchased it in june of      and used it regularly  i had given it   stars  but i may have to adjust this  recently when using it  part of the heater coil burned off and fell on top of my food  i have contacted the company to see what protocols or guarantees they offer  will provide an update if and when i hear back from them update           cosori was great in standing behind their product  communication was timely  and they provided me with the means to replace  my air fryer which i have done already      
825,5.0,                       so i ve only had this for a few weeks but literally everything i ve made has come out perfect   i ve made creole sausage hash  brussel sprouts  wings  fries  tofu    amazing   it doesn t take as long to cook as some of the recipes i ve been looking at on pinterest  so i watch it very carefully  ex  recipe says to cook tofu for    minutes at     degrees but it only took     it is also super easy to clean      
826,2.0,                       when i originally bought this i was very excited until i got it and started having issues with it   the touch buttons were not working properly  i had to use the app to turn it on   i contact amazon about it and they sent me a new one   the new one was working fine until a new firmware was done and now it won t even preheat   for something that is supposed to make my life easier it has caused me quite a few stress   also  as smart as it is  you can t tell alexa to preheat  which is strange since all the recipes requires you to preheat before cooking      
827,5.0,                       the cosori     is an amazing air fryer  works great   very quiet and the pre set cooking programs work perfectly  seen many recipes online with various cooking times temps for whatever i m cooking  i ve found the presets on the cosori are the way to go whenever you can use them   just yields better result in my opinion  cleans easily too  i d buy again in a heartbeat      
828,5.0,                       my air fryer literally arrived    minutes ago via usps  mail carrier arrives around the same time daily so i had my shrimp ready and seasoned  the air fryer arrived  i did not even clean the trays  the heat will destroy the germs hopefully  i pre heated the unit by pressing the pre heat icon  which goes on for   minutes  then pressed the shrimp icon  and   minutes later i had delicious shrimp all i did to season was dump the defrosted shrimp in a bowl  spray them with olive oil  dumped garlic powder  onion powder  salt  and pepper on them  that s it the tray is a bit small as is  you can likely only fit a few adult sized cutlets in there  so hopefully i can find a rack for the tray  there s a lot of  dead space  at the top of the tray  you d likely be better off making chicken stripes  instead of cutlets  and going that route anyhow  this air fryer is amazing  i never leave amazon reviews off to buy some accessories      
829,1.0,                       hoping for a replacement        
830,1.0,                       be careful buying from this account   describes as new this item was clearly open box as the top was re taped and i side the item was poorly repackaged  i wondered at first if it really mattered to me as it seemed in ok shape and why waste a product  however upon plugging in the device it would not turn on  the touch buttons were faulty   probably why the last person returned it    complete waste of time and shady to sell something described as new when it s not      
831,5.0,                       i have been using it for like a week and i completely love it  it made cooking so easy and quick that i feel like a chef experimenting with different things lol  everything gets cooked evenly and crispy and not counting that its way healthier than cooking with oil  most of the bad reviews i saw were from people that clearly did something they were not supposed to do with it and now they are complaining when it got damaged     
832,5.0,                       this is a terrific product  my husband may just quit the bbq grill and microwave  he likes crispy wings and they came out great  steaks  veggies and ribs too  two cornish hens came out perfect  customer support response to a small issue was unbelievable i wish they had square accessories  a raised rack would allow twice as many wings and veggies      
833,1.0,                       no matter how much oil   tb or  tb  i put in the fryer all my french fries come out baked instead of crispy fried like in a oil bath  easy making french fries is the only reason we bought this air fryer and now it sits useless on the counter waiting to be trashed  very disappointed      
834,5.0,                       i ve had this air fryer for over a year now and it s literally a life saver  cooks your meats and veggies in half the time and i love how crispy everything comes out  the chicken tastes almost as if it was hot off the grill on a beautiful summer day  i absolutely would recommend this to anyone  compared to other air fryers this one certainly comes with a lot of room in the basket which is great because it allows me to cook everything at once      
835,5.0,                       it looks very sleek with its minimalistic design outer material feels like matte  brushed aluminum even if it s actually plastic easy to clean  easy to use package came slightly torn but everything inside was fine  quite heavy as a whole  but it s proportionate to it s capacity  overall  it appears to be the most good looking   efficient air fryer out there         
836,5.0,                       oh my  i was a skeptic about an  air fryer   but my view has taken a sharp turn  not only is this a nice looking air fryer  but the features  recipes  and ease of use are phenomenal  one of the coolest features is accessed through wi fi and your phone  i ll look up a recipe  prepare my meal  and place my food in the basket and hit start cooking on my phone  the cosori air fryer will set the time and temperature based on the recipe i have selected  i always have the ability to tweak the time and temperature to my liking  the buttons on the front will set the time and temperature based on the food type  although they are not to any certain recipe i have a friend that has a different brand air fryer  and the bottom of it got so hot that it cracked her countertop  just to be safe  i always plays mine on the stove top  however  i have placed my hands beneath this air fryer while it has been cooking and have confirmed that it barely even gets warm the only slightly negative thing i would have to say about this model is that sometimes the buttons take a moment to recognize that they are being pressed  still  i would give this an a       
837,5.0,                       sooo simple to use  and food is delicious my    year old granddaughter  gets up everyday just to try a new recipe from the recipe book that comes with product  it s a blessing during this time of isolation and stay at home  i very much enjoy this cooler      
838,2.0,                       i bought this thinking it would be a safer   more healthy  easier option than trying in oil  not so much my kids are all teenagers and honor roll students   the machine does not preheat and cook as outlined in the guide  the food is also not tasty  we tried the suggestion of using  a little oil or spray oil to help but it did not make the food taste good  it was very dry  i would rather pan get with oil than use this machine      
839,5.0,                       yes  air fryers are bulky and tend to take a lot of counter space  but i have a hoosier cupboard that it sits on perfectly and i end up using it almost everyday  it is great for throwing a frozen chicken patty in and in no time at all i have a chicken sandwich for lunch  the food comes out crispy and delicious  i was hesitant to spent the money at first but once it got here  i have got my money back in the ease and convenience      
840,5.0,                       this appliance is the best money spent  purchsed it on a prime day  it cooks in less time  press a button for anything you want to cook  cooks onion rings  tater tots  and fries in less than    minutes  preheat devise in   minutes  then press fries button no heating up oven and entire kitchen  onion rings are cooked to perfection in    minutes  anything of appetizers cooks in    or less  i recommend this           
841,1.0,                       i decided to wait a year to see how well the fryer would hold up over time  unfortunately the fryer stopped working after   months  i now have to contact customer service  but i will say  loved the air fryer  loved the food  loved the flavor  hopefully whatever it is can be easily fixed      
842,5.0,                       i purchased my air fryer in october      mainly because i eat only meat and wanted a way to easily and quickly cook bacon  chicken  steaks  etc   this air fryer did not disappoint   i used it at least once a day  sometimes twice a day   it performs beautifully and cleans up easily   unfortunately  it stopped working in march and i contacted customer service as it was still under the one year warranty   i was not expecting to have an easy replacement   boy  was i disappointed   brandon  a cosori representative  was very responsive and after determining that i had indeed  fried my fryer   my words  not his    he notified me that my replacement is in the mail   i have not encountered such an easy and friendly customer service experience in quite a while   you can purchase this product knowing it performs perfectly and if needed  customer service is right there to help you      
843,5.0,                       i ve been pleasantly surprised with my cosori air fryer   i now find myself cooking at least some part of most of my meals in it   bacon  steak  frozen fries  chicken   you name it   incredibly easy to use and cooks most items quickly   i find myself experimenting with various recipes   one of my favorites was brussel sprouts   i cut them in half  tossed some salt  pepper  and balsamic vinegar on them and then cooked them in the air fryer for about    minutes at       good stuff      
844,4.0,                       i use this air fryer almost daily and it works great  it has one problem though  there are three phillip s head screws holding the fry basket to the handle  these come loose due to getting hot then cold over and over  is my guess  the first time the basket fell to the floor it ended breaking part of the plastic handle when i tried to save my meal   i suggest  tightening the three screws each week to avoid this happening to anyone else  other than that  nice fryer  adding to this review  i contacted customer support and in less than a week they sent me a replacement basket at no charge  they have a great customer service team      
845,1.0,                       i have had this product less than   months and have used it maybe    times   the basket no longer stays shut and will spontaneously slide out   twice its fallen onto the floor which poses as a burn risk not only from the basket itself but also the food and grease   i have used this product as directed so this is a design product flaw   the machine will not run unless the drawer is propped shut   i am very disappointed   a very big waste of money for what is niw pretty much a useless item   go with a different product      
846,2.0,                       i ve bought two of these  one for myself and one for my parents  mine is fantastic but the one i bought my parents seems to be defective for two reasons      the control panel intermittently doesn t respond and i have to press really hard on the buttons     the screws in the tray are stripped which causes them to frequently fall out  this means the handle is now only connected to the tray via a single screw because the other screws do not stay attached  since we cannot use the tray the whole air fryer is practically unusable  my parents have only had their air fryer for   months      
847,1.0,                       i was really enjoying the functionality of this fryer  i liked the reminder to shake and the fact it just starts up again when you put the basket back in  we made roasted veg  pizza  wedges  sausages  fries  egg bites and cake  unfortunately now it make a loud metal rattling noise when we use it and the basket doesn t clip into place as easily  very disappointed  i only bought it    days ago    i do not recommend     
848,5.0,                       i love  love  love my new cosori air fryer  since i got it  i ve used it almost every day  i love how its compact and neat and can fit on any counter surface or corner  i enjoy the ease of using it with the digital display and its really easy to use and understand  the food comes out juicy and flavorful  i like it too because im finally eating healthy    no oil and grease  no other problems noted thus far  i ll definitely recommend this air fryer to anyone who wants and needs one      
849,5.0,                       love this air fryer  very good size for a family       qt   easy to use  easy to clean  and fries came out perfectly done  not too big which is important in a kitchen with pressure cookers  especially like the large square basket which holds much more than round baskets price is very reasonable as well  can program it with your smartphone to use in room in your house      
850,5.0,                       i was skeptical about buying this  i kind of procrastinated on it and read reviews and talked to people who owned one    but i never pulled the trigger  now i wish i had sooner  this thing is great   easy to use  food is awesome  i even made a steak in it that i d say was     as good as a grilled one  indoor   with no real prep work   in    minutes  chicken comes out juicy inside  crispy outside  kids love it and use it often as well  and a favorite thing for me is reheating cold pizza  left overs  it does a much better job than a microwave of reheating but not over drying  it s pretty awesome  if you re reading this and have been debating it  get it      
851,5.0,                       we use this air fryer for far more than we ever thought we would   it has changed how we cook things   for example  we used to cook scrapple in a frying pan and it would take about    minutes   now  we cook it in our cosori air fryer and it takes    minutes and tastes better and looks better than it ever did when cooked in a frying pan   we cook fish  meats  vegetables  and so much more   it is a most efficient little oven   oh  and we love that it is square instead of round   we can fit more in the square shape and it is awesome      
852,5.0,                       this air fryer is beyond amazing   do you want perfect wings  super crispy   well this is what you need   i never knew everything you could make in this   if you want to make a salmon patty  here you go   this cooks it perfectly inside while giving it the brown crisp you need on the outside while at the same time not making it dry   veggies  whole chickens  fish it does it all   the thing i think i like most about it  is reheating fried foods    your chicken  fries or whatever is brought back to life   we get to go fries  refrigerate  and use the air fryer to bring it back to life   they taste better then they did when they were first bought   i kid u not   you have to see and taste it to believe it   i love  love  love this product      
853,5.0,                       my   teenagers will eat their weight in fries  this machine holds enough for them to gorge themselves on  holds a frozen bag of fries or tots well   lbs   scotch eggs   mini corn dogs      pounds of hot wingscleans easily  so much better than bubbling oil less mess  less grease  less garbage  it s a big item  i put it in the counter for cooking and put it away after it cools and gets cleaned  we have an olive oil spray bottle to add crispiness      
854,5.0,                       this air fryer is my new love  i have had it for   days and i have made mozzarella sticks in   minutes that were amazing  chicken nuggets that were so tender and wings that were wonderful  clean up is a breeze due to the nonstick finish  this machine has made my life easier and has given me so much more time to do other things instead of being in the kitchen  i can t say enough great things about this fryer and i will be purchasing another one so i can cook a variety of things at one time  i am one happy momma      
855,5.0,                       i bought one of these on a whim thinking i would give it a try  i have another brand that i was never happy with but i wanted an air fryer  i received this item and i have made three meals in it so far and it is absolutely amazing  i would highly recommend this air fryer to anyone wanting to make the investment  it is well worth every cent      
856,4.0,                       this is probably one of the best air fryers i have ever used  as long as you pre heat it your food take no time to cook  the only thing is it is easy to over cook food because the settings are off  so it s more of a trial and error type deal  over all it get the job done        
857,5.0,                       i m new to the air fryer cooking world  and this is great product   i bought the     qt size and it fits well on my small counter   i cooked chicken thighs in    minutes that were so tender and juicy but crispy   i can t wait to try other foods   this will be especially helpful in the summer  because my gas oven  which i use ofte  makes my kitchen almost too hot to bear   i highly recommend this air fryer      
858,5.0,                       i have mostly cooked chicken in this   it always turns out well and makes dinner simple   i just sprinkle some seasoning on the chicken and put it in using the preset button   it has always been well cooked and not over done   i like that i don t have to keep an eye on it   just put it in and hit the chicken button   this leaves me time to do other things   it is easy to clean although i do use the parchment paper liners   the nonstick coating seems to work well      
859,5.0,                       if you are a single person  this is the best  oven  for you    why heat up a full size oven if you are making food just for yourself  made meat loaf  cookies  ribs  hamburgs  steak  fries  baked potato  summer squash  banana bread  pork chops  biscuits etc  in less time than an oven  once the pan is cooled down  put in hot water and soap and use it as a dish pan the only problem is the learning curve      it needs to come with  regular food cook book  not fancy meals        
860,1.0,                       bought this to make a recipe for book club  used it twice  first time i put the stink down to my inexperience with the device  i thought perhaps i had not followed the directions of what or how to put ingredients in  second time was not the charm  i double checked the process and did everything according to the recipe and appliance instructions  but the food still stank and it took multiple days of vinegar application to get the stink out of the kitchen      
861,5.0,                       i purchased another brand and i loved how it cooked but it eas touch to clean  this one is easier to set on preset larger and it is really no stick the basked is just made out of great material  the price was great since it is such high quality  i highly recommend to anyone does not know which one to buy  you will be pleased with this air fryer especially if you a  st time buyer  great cookbook even has a telephone number if you have questions  i love the preheat future and reminder when to shake your fries if you make the      
862,1.0,                       love the concept but bad design  the screws constantly need tightening  and now after   month of use the inside handle has burned up and the screws are not being held in and has to be thrown away   no repair is going to work   easy to use  but the craftsmanship is pretty faulty  but it is only     ish     
863,2.0,                       was using it for almost   month    times a week approximately  so we used it     times in total benefits  it s indeed cook nice and delicious meat  fish and veggies drawbacks     scratches on the surface of the rack  while we were cleaning with standard sponge    panel is very hard to navigate and change the temperature  non responsive and you have to press button several times    preset recipes for cooking were never right  that  minor one      
864,3.0,                       i absolutely loved this thing up until a couple months ago that it started to short out or shut off for some reason and you would have to remove dinner and wait for it to cool completely before it would work again  well now i bought this in august  abd it is now may  th  i do not feel spending this amount of money i should be having technical issues this soon  great little air fryer when it works  but sadly i m going to need to find a new one      
865,5.0,                       happy i went with this model as it has a large basket  it is also very easy to clean i have had to make adjustments to suggested cooking temps and times in the included cookbook because there are some variables to portion size  etc downside is that the flavor is still not equivalent to actual fried foods  and even after several uses there is a certain  aftertaste  unless the food is heavily seasoned      
866,5.0,                       i am very pleased with this air fryer  the cookbook has lots of pictures and recipes that i am eager to try  the quick start guide makes it so you can pull the air fryer out of the box and use immediately  the touch screen is so easy to use and the baskets are easy to clean especially because they separate  we are a family of   and the     quart is a great size for us  i have had it a week and we have made  homemade fries  buffalo chicken  cooked carrots and mozzarella sticks  my children and husband have enjoyed it all  i have also already received an email from customer support asking for feedback and an offer to answer any questions i might have      
867,5.0,                       i m in love with this air fryer  my husband bought it for me for my birthday  today was our first day using it and we made personal pizzas and jalape o poppers  everything was delicious  the bacon on the jalape o poppers was perfectly crisp  the product is very user friendly with clear instructions  clean up was simple  we will definitely recommend this product to others  can t wait to try new recipes in our cosori air fryer      
868,5.0,                       i chose the cosori air fryer because it looks sturdy  i like that it is not made of plastic and doesnt look cheap  i also purchased the assessory pack to go with it  the recipe book looks easy to follow and i can not wait to try it  i recommend getting the cosori because it is sturdy  easy to use  easy to clean and makes consistenly good food  so far i only cooked a few batches of ribs  but they came out really good      
869,5.0,                       this is the best thing i have ever purchased  between this and my toaster oven i rarely ever cut the oven on anymore  it has exploded my love for baked potatoes  i have used it to make make flavorful juicy chicken breast  most importantly  it has given me the power to make buffalo wings at home  ive never made wings at home before because i am extremely picky about wing texture and flavor but this air fryer allowed me to produce slightly crispy on the outside while remaining flavorful and not dry on the inside wings in my own home and it was the best thing ever      
870,4.0,                       i really like this air fryer  it has a good size capacity for food  the shape of the basket is more rectangle so it fits more food  it works well and cooks food pretty well the reason i gave it a   star is because the basket does make a clunky noise when removing or putting it back in  like you have to jolt it slightly  out  i did read that in others  reviews  but it doesn t bother me too much      
871,5.0,                       this air fryer is superb   i got this for a really great price along with purchasing all the added excessories   when it came in i cleaned as instructed and used it the very next day to air fry chicken  the fryer worked exceptionally well   i had to extend the cooking time because my chicken pieces were quite large   it is easy to use and understand and i am so happy that i purchased it   i will again use it this friday to prepare blackened salmon   no guilt    i would receommend purchasing this over all other air fryers      
872,5.0,                       we are trying to eat healthier and this air fryer is helping  i like the size       and i like that the food basket is square  i think it makes it easier to fit food in  it s easy to use and the buttons make sense mostly  they take a little getting used to   basket fits in the dishwasher easily and it comes clean nicely  we ve been making  sauteed  mushrooms and they come out amazing  well worth the price      
873,1.0,                       so i ordered this air fryer on february          when it arrived the buttons did not work and it could only be used via the wifi connection  i recieved a rebate for it and i try to use it when ever i get the chance which inst often  tonight i decided to air fry   chicken wing sections   wing dings   i updated my vesync cosori app and i put them in set for   minutes and continued to watch tv with my son  not even    minutes later i hear a crash  i check in my kitchen and my airfryer tray and chicken is all over the floor   the airfryer pressure was able to push the tray out because the locking mechanism is no longer working to latch it tightly closed  vesync tracks my use and after    uses this thing is completely trash  i am so disappointed  would not recommend      
874,5.0,                       while i haven t had an air fryer before so i can t say how it stacks up to other brands  i can say that this product has delivered exactly what i was expecting when looking for an air fryer   fries come out okay and wings cook awesome   it s pretty convenient too   i make chicken strips all the time in it right before i go to work   been fun experimenting with putting different foods in it  like flaky biscuits and cookies   those didn t come out so great but it was still entertaining   the basket is easy to clean  it comes apart and is machine wash safe  holds a good amount of food too  cooking has been consistent and it hasn t shown any sign of breakage yet  used it almost constantly for a whole day making appetizers on new year s and it kept up just fine  i ve been more than happy with my purchase  especially for the price  would reccomend      
875,1.0,                       failed halfway through first use  display flickered twice then shut down  reset after    minutes  seems to be a recurring problem with over temperature sensing      
876,4.0,                       i purchased this product because many of my friends had been singing the praises of using an air fryer for healthier food  and i am so glad i did  not only am i able to cook many of our favorites in a healthier manner  but i have been able to teach my    y o grandson to use the fryer to prepare food  he is so proud of himself and i don t have to worry and hover over him while he s playing chef  after a year     weeks over  of use  we did lose   of the screws from the basket  but when i contacted customer service to see if i could purchase replacements  they went above and beyond to make sure my little chef could continue cooking  i cannot say enough about how wonderful they were          
877,5.0,                       i am amazed at how well it cooks food  either fresh or frozen  i have done chicken  burgers  veggies  fries and pizza  reheating pizza that is in the fridge is amazing  better than when first brought home  this is an amazing machine  if you are thinking about it and aren t sure  let me tell  just do it      
878,3.0,                       i have had this for a while now and although i believe it cooks ok  there are some design flaws   worst being if you try to pull the draw out slightly to turn food around  be prepared for the draw to fully slide out onto the floor   there is nothing that holds the draw in place when not fully locked in  so if you open it partially  be prepared for it to fall off the counter and onto the floor   second is washing it   i don t have a dishwasher so i have to clean it the old fashioned way which is rather difficult because of the vented sides  but my revert back to main main complaint that the draw falls out and my has become so bent from falling that i have to use a screwdriver to release the basked from the main tray     
879,5.0,                       did my research and this was one of the top rated brands for air fryers  it was on sale so i nabbed it at     usd it s such a breeze to use  the buttons have a slight delay i think  but also i m very impatient  haha there is a slight smell in the beginning like plastic  but it s not a big deal  it heats up fast  does its job and it looks sleek too  i love it      
880,4.0,                       i love this air fryer it has been a huge beneficial item to have in the kitchen  it is very large and holds a very large quality of food  it is great for cooking chicken wings steaks fries pretty much anything  the only thing that i do not like about this air fryer is the pre heat button is different from the turn on button  sometimes when you hit one button over the other he turns off the air fryer  so you must be careful to make sure that you are hitting the start button rather than the off button  they cleaned really well and is very low maintenance      
881,5.0,                       i am a newbie when it comes to air fryers but i was blown away by this one  no big manuals to read  just put food in and set temperature  or tap on the picture for the pre set cooking times temp   chicken wings  delicious  chicken breasts tasted like they came straight off of the grill and no fuss clean up  no greasy smell in my house  hands down great air fryer      
882,2.0,                       the instructions state to shake basket when cooking  making sure not to press the release button   we tried several times to make sure we weren t doing something wrong but when the basket is hot it releases when shaking causing a seriously dangerous situation  the basket does not release when it is not hot  i would not recommend this air fryer  everything else was good though  bummer         
883,5.0,                       this was in my wish list for awhile and i finally decided to get it  totally love it  fish and other food tastes great even without oil for frying  i thought the taste would suffer but i have been happy with it and the food isn t weighed down by grease  and i had some questions for cosori customer service   they were the best  decent customer service seems difficult to find these days but not with them  i will definitely buy from this brand again      
884,5.0,                       no bull  this is an excellent air fryer it is super easy to use and has changed my kitchen completely  i mostly use it for heating frozen garlic toast  tater tots and frozen fries for the fam  so quick  and it has a huge capacity for the price  great quality of construction  durable but without even utilizing the full potential of its features  it is an amazing machine for the price  full stop      
885,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i bought this one december       it s been six month by now  i don t use it everyday  but as you can see on the video it s already giving me problems  the operation pad sucks so much that it doesn t work when you press on it      
886,5.0,                       this is my first air fryer and it works great     simple presets and easy adjustments for recipes you find online  comes with a one year warranty but if you register it within two weeks of purchase you get a two year warranty  the     quart capacity is nice and i wouldn t want anything smaller  it has       watts of cooking power  cleans easily  sleek look and well made  i highly recommend this product and merchant      
887,1.0,                       this fryer lasted a mere   months before it became garbage  cooked food well however  the screws would constantly becomes loose on the basket  easy to tighten so wasn t a huge bother  but now the basket won t click in anymore  in the last month we ve had to really give it a good shove to click in  tonight the basket literally shot out of the air fryer onto my floor  i can t believe i spent this much money on something that didn t even last a year      
888,5.0,                       i d wanted an air fryer for a long time  but was nervous i wouldn t actually like it and would regret spending the money  but i have not regretted this for one second  i love this thing  it is amazing all the things you can cook and here and they re so delicious  plus it s super easy to clean up  which had been another concern of mine  i absolutely recommend this     
889,5.0,                       so far  i ve only made chicken wings with this machine   best chicken wings i ve had in a very long time   absolutely amazing tasting and simple to make   cleanup is super simple too as the basket is dishwasher safe   i can fit about   wings in there and cook them in    min   i tried to make    wings at once  but they took nearly an hour and they weren t quite as good   so it is possible in a pinch  but i recommend making fewer at a time      
890,1.0,                       i used this product many times over a period of   months  the very first time i used it to cook three batches of food  total time    minutes  the handle melted off      
891,1.0,                       after reading several comments about the unresponsive buttons of this machine  as one of the unfortunate owners  i have to give this air fryer an honest review   i do not recommend this product  unresponsive control pane  thin metal  poor coating and stains hardly come off no matter how long you have soaked the tray in warm soapy water or regardless how long you have tried to wipe away the oils with a sponge thankful that i have got a refund but still  the tax has not been refunded      
892,5.0,                       this is the best appliance in the world  you can cook everything with it get it today  don t wait you can replace your oven  toaster oven  toaster  amazing      
893,5.0,                       this is the easiest best appliance we have ever purchased  in the first week we made catfish  egg rolls  hamburgers  shrimp  onion rings  and even grilled cheese sammies  how did we live without it   my husband asks to make supper as it always turns out great  we did shop around for different models  but this particular one was  amazon s best choice   you can t go wrong with that  we are extremely satisfied with this machine  looks great  too      
894,5.0,                       ok  so i m the type of person who has to research for weeks and read a thousand reviews before i buy a producr  after driving my self crazy  having the price going up along the way and trying to decide which model to buy when i decided on a brand   phillips  way to many models  very confusing  i switched gears and bought the     quart cosori  because of the size and price   more than      less  and i m very happy i did  first off i m not an oven person  i grill and anything i oven  fries  egg rolls  and any frozen products just tastes blah  but when i use this air fryer its awesome and it s so easy  preheat  through in stuff  press the frozen button  flip or shake when it tells you another beep  done      better than an oven and way faster  it s easy to clean and it s just great  i love it      
895,2.0,                       the buttons don t work  the buttons don t work  one maybe two pre sets are available if you crush you fingers to get them going it s great   so handy  if you want to do actual times cooking that has to be to a temp and not just warmed up  maybe try another brand     
896,5.0,                       saw plenty similar for much higher price  glad i chose this one and saved money  so far everything i have tried cooking with it has come out great  all the texture   taste or deep fried without all the grease  chicken fingers  fries  tots   hash brown patties all cooked up golden brown   crispy with great taste  easy enough to clean up  the cooking area all comes out and can be placed in a dishwasher  invest in a couple of cans of spray on cooking oil and you can keep your grandkids happy without feeding them fast food crap      
897,5.0,                       we bought this for christmas for friends  they don t use the wifi feature but they love it   they love it so much that we bought the cosori without wifi and use it daily  in fact we have taken ours to their house so we could run them both because we prefer it to using the oven  definitely among the best kitchen purchases we ve made  i absolutely love how well vegetables come out and how quickly  we have only had it for a month and have enjoyed several meals we have not tried before  i have read a lot of reviews on facebook about the handle  no complaints here but i can see how easily it would break over time  the cosori facebook page is worth logging into while your getting used to using an air fryer      
898,5.0,                       yes yes yes  i have also been cast under the magical air fryer spell  this thing is sooooo convenient and quick for making food  i work long hours and don t feel like a labor intensive meal prep at night and this machine has changed my diet  all features are preset and easy and bc it turns off when it s done  it s safe  highly recommend      
899,5.0,                       i love this  bought this during quarantine because i wanted to eat wings and fries for some sense of normalcy  great product and would recommend  food is tasty and does not dry out  only food i had trouble with was porkchops  they cooked nice but seemed a bit dry  just wish the fryer was bigger however its a nice fit on the counter and doesn t take much space  food cooks quickly so don t leave it too long lol  made some teriyaki wings that were bomb   now i m not afraid to cook for the bf to impress him lol     
900,1.0,                       we bought this cosori jan   and yesterday it quit while in the middle of cooking hamburgers    before it quit working  i would have given this product a   star on all accounts   it was easy to clean  cooked food evenly  big enough for family of   and was awesome    now   i am without an air fryer and a little upset that it only lasted   months burnt to a crisp               
901,5.0,                       this is the second air fryer i purchased  the first one was from another company and no where near as nice as this one  it s big enough for anything i want to make and clean up is a breeze      
902,4.0,                       there s definitely a learning curve but i have found that my food gets really crispy even without the cooking spray addition the user manual recommends  which i love  the parts that get dirty are dishwasher safe which is great because it would be a nightmare to hand wash after every use  it is quite a bit larger than i anticipated so it s been hard to find a storage area in my kitchen and it takes up a fair amount of counter space  i have been enjoying trying different foods in it and getting great crispy results  last night i made crispy  carrot bacon   it s a cool kitchen addition if you re a crispy food lover      
903,1.0,                       do not get this   buy something else  i brought this after researching different types of fryers  this was up there  the first time i used it went ok and took    minutes to fry some chicken tenders  next we tried frozen fries and we ended up using our oven  this past sunday we thought we could do some wings  the  st batch of    went ok but took   hour and i still ended up baking them  the  nd batch after   hour was completely raw we had to fry them in a pan and it was only    so no over crowding  i ve used this a total of   times and each time it has failed  my daughter is going to get me a new one  one that was better rated than this thing  now i m not sure what to do with this  but don t buy this what so ever      
904,5.0,                       this was supposed to make me thinner but my wife uses it so much i think i m actually fatter now lolmy wife loved this gift and uses it all the time  even my kids use this thing  i don t use it because i don t cook indoors much but i still give it   stars due to the results i ve consumed out of it      
905,2.0,                       i got the wifi model but didn t use the wifi  we first tried the french fries using fresh potatoes  followed their recipe and instruction  the fries seemed like steamed after    minutes  then we cooked for another    minutes  still they were limp and soft  i tried frozen fries too but they were the same  then we tried to cook a brussels sprout following their recipe that calls for   minutes of preheating and      minutes of air frying  the brussels sprout were uncooked so i gave another    minutes  they seemed cooked but not crispy at all so we put them in oven to get a bit crispy  the whole process took about    minutes  it s lot easier to just roast them if you want to use it  don t expect to get crispy foods and figure out how to use it in combination with other means of cooking to get the flavor and taste you want      
906,1.0,                       i bought this product in may to replace a cheaper air fryer that had given up on me  i searched and thought the corsi had some nice features and good reviews  so i took a chance on it  it worked great for a month or so then its buttons lost functionality  as of right now  i cook everything at     degrees celcius in    minute or less intervals  i do this because the touch screen does not work no matter how hard or gentle i press the buttons  i can t change the temperature  time  or scale  i saw that a number of customers had this same issue  i really like having an air fryer  i work a lot and it s good to be able to whip up dinner for myself and my child without much effort  i will not purcahse another one of these  i think i will just go to target and see what they have to offer  cheers to the people with functioning corsi air fryers but if you re still in the market ther there are other options      
907,5.0,                       i have many kitchen gadgets   i buy them for my wife  but they re really for me  jk    we have twin   year olds   aka  lots of chicken nuggets   they cook so quickly and taste great   i eat a ton more vegetables now  because you can literally wash them and put them in whole   peppers  onions  squash  okra  the best    i made chicken wings  they were awesome   love this thing      
908,5.0,                       space effective  works as advertised  results range from ok to great  setting time and temperature is more effort than it should be  it apparently can t store settings for commonly used recipes and there is no numerical keypad so you have to press the up and down key a million times      
909,5.0,                       this is very easy to use and clean   we have a family of   so someone is using it every day   it is now easy to have a vegetable  or french fries   with every meal   kids use it to heat pizza rolls   have cooked breaded chicken breasts and also wings   bread and cook pork or diced chicken for chinese dishes   wifi works but i am not sure i will ever use my phone to turn it on across the kitchen      
910,5.0,                       this is the best kitchen purchase i have made  i have tried many things on the menu and every dish came out perfect  ribs  chicken nuggets  chicken wings  crispy tofu      everyone loves the meals  the best part is that i don t have to be at the stove anymore  all i do is to marinate the food and drop them into the basket  finally an easy way to cook healthy and delicious meals for the family  what s not to love      
911,5.0,                       first experience with an air fryer  did some experimenting with small portions over the past four weeks  so far  easy clean up  and very good food flavor  for example  potatoes cook up crispy  golden  but meaty inside   very good  a little big for the counter yet easy clean up versus cleaning up after a frying pan  good purchase and recommended      
912,5.0,                       i love everything about this air fryer  i can enjoy healthy eating and have some of the things i miss  baking just wasn t making me happy  i have been on keto for a couple of months and had some garlic parmesan chicken wings today  they were crispy on the outside and juicy inside   so delicious  it is so simple to use and cleanup is easy  so far i love everything about it  the preset buttons are wonderful and it looks so nice on my counter  i wish i had purchased this months ago  very happy with my purchase        
913,5.0,                       all the little buttons for default items you cook make it so easy to use   i ve used it for searing potatoes and reheating food   but see so many other uses that i want to try   great for melting cheese on broccoli   it does come with a cook book with a lot of ideas and a nice note on the box cover when you open the box saying  happy cooking       
914,2.0,                       i loved the price of this air fryer   our food has cooked nicely   however  the basket and handle is not easy to use   i had another air fryer that i replaced with this cosori as the old one s coating began peeling  it was much more functional   the worst part is that on several occasions  water puddles under the front   this is not ok   it should not be venting so that it is coming out of the bottom  i did not take pictures the first two times but it continues to pool water  i would not recommend this air fryer even for the price   i will be returning it as defective      
915,5.0,                       i had a cheaper smaller unit of a different make that the non stick surface easily chipped off   this unit is fantastic   i have used it nearly every day with no signs of wear   the keypad is easy to use and the pre heat setting is a must   get the larger unit   i cook pork chops and steaks with it although i do recommend using a digital thermometer for best internal temps   this made french fries perfectly   i make roasted veggies  corn  potatoes in it   much easier clean up than pan frying and less energy than an oven   always spray the interior with canola cooking spray and clean up is quick   i particularly like the square interior      
916,5.0,                       we love our air fryer  first meal was chicken thighs and they were just as good as the cast iron skillet chicken cooked in butter that we usually have  made chicken parmesan last night and perfectly crispy  using the air fryer is so much easier than firing up the oven  very easy to clean and easy to use  set up on the app and connection to alexa devices was very simple  highly recommend      
917,5.0,                       i got this for my mom as an early christmas gift  i couldn t wait until christmas to give it to her because she had cash in hand ready to buy one  lol  so far she loves it  the touchscreen display and easy to understand buttons makes the entire experience easy from the most tech savvy in my family to those who aren t too into technology  we haven t tried to put the  lb chicken in there to cook like it says you can but knowing her we ll be testing it out      
918,1.0,                       i asked my husband for an air fryer for christmas and he bought me this one  i hate it    and wish it could be returned but i missed the return window by   freakin  days ugh  it either under cooks the meat or burn everything else  buyer beware  why this had good reviews is beyond me      
919,5.0,                       this has become my favorite kitchen cooking appliance and these are the reasons why   this cooks fresh meat  fresh vegetables and  many frozen food items you can buy in your local grocery store   i have used several of the recipes with great success and have even cooked some of my own favorites   this cooks food faster and cleaner  no splatter  than more traditional frying and oven baking methods   breakfast  lunch and dinners this does it all      
920,4.0,                       it s pretty good   the only annoying things i notice are that the tray pops out while cooking sometimes and you have to put it back in so the machine keeps cooking   changing the cook time takes a few more button presses than it should   otherwise  it cooks well and works fine   i d probably get a different one next time that had a better latching system though      
921,5.0,                       i love my cosori air fryer  i mostly use my air fryer to make my french fries right now  but i have made bacon and even a burrito one time  a fantastic air fryer that cooks food evenly with minimal clean up  especially for fries  it just as easy as running it under some hot water  when i cooked bacon it did release a lot of grease  so clean up was a little more involved and required me to use hot water and a wash cloth to clean it up  all in all  i love this product and think you will too      
922,3.0,                       i had heard about air fryers for a while and picked this large sized well regarded one alhough the brand name meant nothing to me  i works fine  the biggest negative is the pre set times by food type are way off  it overcooked the chicken badly  it way undercooked the fish  i suggest you experiment with these pre sets then determine for your own use based on experienced what times work best for you   cleaning is easy  the functions are also easy to use      
923,5.0,                       love the air fryer   the size is a bit bigger than we need but it holds a lot and is easy to use and clean   touch screen is great and takes the guess work out of many foods   pre heating is suggested   takes   minutes   and i highly recommend to do that as your food can burn easier if you don t   just like preheating an oven     frozen french fries came out really crisp and browned without the grease   frozen wontons too   haven t cooked meat in it yet but it comes with a recipe book so will try some of them      
924,5.0,                       i was really really skeptical about purchasing this  you know how appliance fads go  but i have to say  i use it all the time  this will not just wind up hidden away in a cabinet  i keep it on the counter next to my stove  we ll see when the electric bill comes in but i do believe it will be lower  it cooks the exact same as my oven but only faster  you can adjust the temperature and time even if you use the preset modes  the preset modes are like a starting point for what you are cooking  yup  this purchase is not one that i will be regretting      
925,4.0,                       although i still have to navigate my way around adjusting temp cook time  as not all packages contain air fryer instructions  it s pretty easy to use   flavors have been great and honestly  you wouldn t even know it was air fried   the sound it makes when on  is one of the more quiet ones  i ve heard   would definitely recommend   my only issue so far has been trying to register this product for the bonus    month warrenty being offered through cosori   when i go through wesite  provided with product    it goes directly to      forbbidden    when i try to register it through amazon order history  the website has an error pop up that says  the system is under maintance  please try again later       
926,1.0,                       opened up and tried to use  half the buttons on the touch screen don t work  the touchscreen is generally very flimsy  cheaply constructed and if it did work  it would not likely last long  i did considerable research before ordering  very disappointed in this machine quality  questioning the legitimacy of the review s     
927,5.0,                       i absolutely love this thing   best kitchen gadget i ve ever bought  i ve made cornbread  hard boiled eggs  muffins  hamburgers  chicken wings and thighs  hotdogs  pizza  and of course french fries  tater tots among other goodies  everything comes out great and i ve only scratched the surface     i have become an airfrying addict       
928,1.0,                       this is a very cheaply made product  after   months all the screws were falling out and i kept having had to screw back in  last sunday was the final straw  i was making chicken wings  and carefully pulled the basket out and the handle came completely off and i not have grease burns on my right foot  total piece of junk i notified the company and demanded a full replacement of the air fryer  i will never buy anything from them again  don t waste your money   didn t even last   months  garbage product     
929,5.0,                       i got a toaster oven style af for xmas  i hated it  took it back  bought another toaster oven style  hated it  took it back  and bought this one i use this all the time  it has an extended warranty if you register it within    days  making it   years cleans easy  cooks everything like it s fried with little oil      
930,3.0,                       i think the problem with an  air fryer  is that you aren t literally frying  and so the illusion that you are eating delicious  healthier stuff is true in terms of healthier  but not nearly as delicious as frying something   so my crockpot and oven and smoker will get a lot more duty than this thing   fad      
931,5.0,                       we ve enjoyed using the cosori air fryer  i wish it were larger but it is what it is  we ll just have to deal with that   the first thing we tried was the pigs in blanket  which turned out like pieces of charcoal   i think the instructions said to cook at     degrees for    minutes  either the temp is too high or too long   i tried     for   minutes which was perfect  so experiment   over all very happy      
932,5.0,                          qts too small   qt takes up too much counter space and puts off too much heat in your kitchen  the cosori is well made and sturdy  the square pan is so much better than a round pan  detachable basket is a must  and i really love the additional pan liners they give you  highly recommend      
933,5.0,                       i use this for chicken  fish  meat   shrimp  and all of it came out fantastic  what s great about this is everything was cooked perfectly and so easy to clean  i spray all my items that i want to air fry  i just make them as i always do   with breading and an egg mix and then i spray them and press the appropriate button for cooking that item      
934,5.0,                       i think this air fryer is great  i have cooked salmon  shrimp  grill cheese and a whole chicken all came out delicious juicy  crispy  my husband and i love it and have not used the stove all week  it s easy for my    year old to us for something quick before going to work  really please  i think i will get the accessory kit to make cakes       
935,5.0,                       absolutely loved the chicken wings  no oil  just salt  pepper  and garlic     and mushrooms  lemon juice  garlic  salt   pepper     french fries need a little work on timing not to get dried out    i appreciate the  shake  feature to remind you to turn items midway through cooking  as well as the preheat function  clean up of the basket and it s catch bin is very easy  and the basket cools very quickly can t wait to try many of the recipes in the included recipe book      
936,5.0,                       i don t know why i waited so long to get kne of these  it made my life so much easier  i m a mother of   plus my husband and it is a god send  it s everything you would want for a kitchen aid  easy to use  easy to use  easy to use  makes amazing food quickly  i never thought you could make some of the thinks i ve made with it  if you re on the fence it s time to hop over  this thing is for everyone  came with a cookbook too  it truly will be one of the best purchases of your life      
937,5.0,                       i purchased this one the first week of january and could not be more happy with the cooker and the food from it    i m very disappointed in the fact i was going to buy a second one and in about     days the price had raised by         i like to keep all the products the same so once you know the controls each cooker works the same    at the new price point i m not interested but would have likes a second cooker of the same brand    gl     
938,5.0,                       i just received this item earlier this week  fast shipping which was great   i ve cooked two food items so far in this air fryer  fried chicken wings and pork chops  they came out pretty good  still learning  so   know i can do better once i use the fryer over time   cleanup was a breeze  which is why i bought this air fryer  after reading owner s reviews on how easy clean ng this air fry was  i ll be trying hamburgers  steaks  and ribs next  as well as some veggies   very happy with this purchase      
939,5.0,                       there are so many air fryers on the market  i was overwhelmed looking for one to buy  i pulled the trigger on the cosori  and i m so glad i did  the air fryer is perfect  i had a small issue with the product  and customer service was prompt  helpful  and exceeded all expectations if you re on the fence or trying to pick which air fryer to purchase  you won t regret going with this one      
940,5.0,                       this air fryer is the best i ve had so far  the takeaways are its a bit difficult to clean and you cant cook food according to the times provided in the book  i cooked chicken drumsticks at the temperature and time suggested by the manufacturer and the first batch was slightly burnt and the meat was a little dry  so for the next batch i took the chicken out   minutes earlier and it was very crispy  juicy and was thoroughly cooked      
941,4.0,                       i love this air fryer  the only thing is the material seems cheap  in may i purchased it multiple times i had to tighten the handle and the handle came off and melted a piece of it  i purchased the extended warranty since it s digital it wouldn t work anymore  the manufacturer is aware of this issue or something similar but they was out of handles and offered my a     amazon credit  after talking to them i contacted amazon and they were amazing  they offered a refund or a new air fryer  i took the air fryer and send it the next day  i love the build in alexia since i work from home i have her to preheat it before actually going on lunch  i m thinking about buying a second one for backup  make sure you purchased the extended warranty you will need it      
942,5.0,                       we love fried foods  but don t like the mess or clean up or the health risks  this air fryer has made it quick and easy to cook a wide variety of foods with minimum fuss  clean up  or grease  it does a better job than a microwave at heating up many left overs as it does not seriously alter the texture and taste  its very easy to use and comes with a very helpful book of recipes and instructions      
943,5.0,                       so far so good  i love my new smart air fryer  the app and the device is super user friendly  connecting to my home wifi was super easy  i have only cooked a few items and i am honestly impressed  the food isn t dry  it cooks all the way through  and controlling it with my alexa is awesome        
944,5.0,                       we love this air fryer and use it daily  especially love the shape as we can get   burgers or salmon patties in at a time without stacking them so they re well cooked all sides  this has become our go to appliance update  we just bought another one  giving the first which still works great  to our daughter  this new one connects with alexa so easily  now we just say  alexa  turn on fryer  that s what we call it  to     degrees for   minutes   very happy with both of these machines for cooking and when it comes time to clean up      
945,2.0,                       this device would be relatively easy to use   if the touch display worked  within a few minutes of setting it up  i found the touch control panel to be unusable and downloaded the  primitive  app the app does the bare minimum  it does not offer noteworthy customization or complex custom presets   it would not be difficult  from a software engineering perspective  to allow multiple temperature settings in one preset  so this is disappointing at best  the screws on the basket handle required frequent tightening starting after the first month of using this  the product isn t complete garbage  but it wasn t worth the money clean up is actually very easy with the device  and the cooking method works as advertised  but i would still rather have gone with a more reputable brand  like i usually do these days   it s most unfortunate because this would have been my favorite kitchen appliance  had they finished the job  another great idea ruined by shoddy craftsmanship and uninspired software development      
946,5.0,                       received this air fryer for christmas and we are enjoying it  we ve only used it a few times so far  to reheat something and to make chicken wings  will attempt more recipes as time goes on  it works well  like any new appliance  it takes some getting used to  i m in a group on facebook with others who use this device and it s been helpful  very happy i have this product      
947,5.0,                       there is not enough to say about the world of air frying  i have used this gem at least once a week  whereas most other cooking appliances are used once every couple of months  crockpot  pressure cooker  etc    that has earned a prime spot on my kitchen counter the recipe book that comes with this one is great  for those who like salmon  there is an excellent recipe for you as far as features  this fryer has all of the features that most others have on the market  the only annoying thing i ve noticed is i m still getting used to the button settings  if you do the wrong sequence  or press the power button like i do  then it will reset and you have to start over  for some reason my brain is trained to hit power instead of the play pause button all in all such a great investment for everyone s kitchen      
948,5.0,                       this air fryer has inspired my    year old daughter to cook   what more can i ask for  aside from the fact that this air fryer cuts down cooking time tremendously  what i love most about the product is the cookbook  the recipes use ingredients that everyone should have in the pantry and they take little to no time to prepare  we have worked through half the book and most all of the recipes have been flavorful  we are in love with the air fryer  the cookbook  the clean up time is awesome and it has allowed for my family to bond more in the kitchen  its like the new toy that everyone wants to play with  it s totally awesome      
949,3.0,                       would have loved to keep this product but the mat red finish color should have been a glossy red finish color instead   the product appears to be glossy red in one of their advertised products video   willing to try the more updated black with app function   however  i did purchase the cosori air fry toaster grill oven   and i already live it   i can t wait to try it out   it is similar to the breville toaster grill oven and will place an update soon      
950,5.0,                       getting ready to use it for the first time    power on  timer set  temp set  hit start  then the display goes blank  no power tried to call support but they re not available over the weekend  will update review later edit  received replacement  and i ve used it a few times  so far  completely satisfied with product      
951,5.0,                       i use this for everything from frozen eggrolls to brats and more    it literally replaced using my oven to cook for two people because it uses less energy overall    easy to clean  and i can even pre heat it by voice command using my alexa     my instapot is on the shelf but my air fryer stays on the counter i use it that much      
952,4.0,                       ditch the microwave and get yourself one of these  this is an excellent machine  there isn t anything it doesn t do  i made chicken wings within   hrs of unboxing it and they came out perfectly  even garlic toast was crooked to perfection  shaking and turning is a must for even browning when making certain items and the preset buttons alert you when it s time  even my   yo said he wants one of his own when he moves out   lol  my only reason for giving four stars is that the basket is hard to pull out because of how it snaps into place  other than that  my kitchen will never be without one again      
953,5.0,                       i bought for my girlfriend because i got felt sorry for her  seeing her have to slam the tub in on the crappy power air  fryer she go tv off qvc with this machine you an close it as smoothly as shutting the door on a mercedes  really  as with all these things the markings on it sucks  no words  only mysterious symbols    i m going to remedy this screwup by  having my signmaker buddy print a custom  worded  legend on white vinyl and put it on the front of the fryer but compared to the  power air fryer  this thing is a cadillac      
954,5.0,                       last christmas we bought an air fryer and it was a disaster  we had given up on the whole hype of the air fryer  throughout the year  everyone raved over their different air fryers  so we decided to search the market and try again  saw this one on amazon and the glowing reviews and decided to give it a try this thing is awesome  i ve used it everyday since purchase  i ve even put frozen dinner rolls in there  ready in   minutes  definitely recommend  also downloaded the app and it s easy to set up use  haven t quite figured out why i need the app though  so save a few dollars and get the one without the app  overall  love my new air fryer  definitely worth it      
955,5.0,                       my husband said this was the best purchase of a kitchen appliance i ever made  and i agree  we cook almost everything in it  makes the absolute best fried chicken   needs no flour   best steaks  bacon  hotdogs  sausage  ribs  porkchops  etc  you name it  i love it  saves so much time in the kitchen  easy  easy cleanup  really worth the money      
956,5.0,                       i bought this for my fiance as a christmas present to use at his house   i borrowed it for a week to try it at my house and wouldn t let him take it back to his place because i loved it so much  i ended up ordering him a new one for his house  best tater tots  great for warming tortilla chips  chicken nuggets to die for  veggies     chicken is moist and delicious   the list goes on and on  so easy to use and not too large to leave out on counter    stars for sure      
957,5.0,                       i love this air fryer  understand this is pretty much like a small super efficient oven  the things that would take me like an hour to cook in oven  it only takes like    minutes in the air fryer  try beef meatballs and spray them with olive oil pam  they turn out amazing  super easy to clean and it s very practical for making meals  probably not suitable for larger families since you won t be able to fit a lot of food in there  but it works great for my husband and me  i make dinner and get enough food left for lunch the next day for myself and hubby      
958,2.0,                       loveeeee it  i finally got rid of my toaster oven and use this thing every day  highly recommend     update a year later  i bought this           first six months  amazing  now  almost a year old this thing still works  but is very frustrating  the buttons don t recognize touch anymore  and the biggest complaint is that after about   minutes the drawer dislodges and stops frying until pushed back in i feel like this was great to begin with  but ultimately disappointed      
959,4.0,                       we love this air fryer and anyone with kids or want to save time needs one   but the touch screen does not work well   some buttons are better than others but it is so frustrating when i want to adjust the temp or time   i end up having it to do in the app   my sister got this same one a few months after i got mine and hers is worse   after a few tries  i can get some of the buttons to work but she is often not even to get it to do anything   touch screen design sucks but the fryer itself works well      
960,3.0,                       i love this air fryer but it did not last long  i bought this on june           it started acting up like keep turning on and off before june of this year but i did not call cosori regarding the issue till yesterday           i was told that the warranty expired year of purchased  for anyone who purchased or planning of buying an air fryer make sure you register your product for a   year extended warranty update   as mentioned earlier my warranty expired from the vendor fortunately i used amazon credit card and i have an automatic   year extended warranty  thank you amazon  for an amazing customer service support  i just received my brand new replacement cosori      
961,1.0,                       i was so excited to get my air fryer and was so disappointed when i plugged it in and it wouldn t turn on  the power button lit up  i went to push it and nothing  after messing with it for a bit  i finally got it to turn on but then half of the buttons wouldn t even work  my sister was over and she tried and nothing  what a disappointment  i bought this specifically because of all the raving reviews and my friend has it and loves it  guess i got a lemon  i returned it the next day and don t plan on buying another      
962,5.0,                       this was my first time using this air fryer and my first experience  i cooked   bone in wings using the chicken setting  there was still room for   more wings single layered      degrees for    minutes didnt seem like enough but my first time i trusted the setting  i faced them all skin up    drummies    wings  and sprayed them with olive oil cooking spray  these came out with the skin brown and crispy just like deep fried  they werent as juicy but not at all dry  this will be my wing maker this football season  i ll try to update how durable it is      
963,5.0,                       this has replaced our microwave  convection oven  toaster  and more  costs less to operate and does a great job cooking food evenly  we use ours several times a day     
964,5.0,                       we use this all the time   ribs  chicken  pork chops  salmon  homemade french fries  and all different kinds of fresh veggies come out perfect and delicious   time in the kitchen is greatly reduced due to fast cooking times and super simple clean up   i m not usually a kitchen gadget person and will typically buy something  use it when i first get it and never touch it again   this item however  is used over and over again and makes an appearance  almost nightly at dinner      
965,5.0,                       my first attempt to make the blueberry scone from their book recipe   came out nice but i d add way more sugar next time  i added   more minutes in top of the     asked on the recipe  in general it takes a little longer to get the desir  results in wings or ribs but i think this is very personal  the     is big enough  for a family of   and im planing in recipes that is airfryer base and doesn t require stove at all   can t wait to try my own recipes  higher recommended      
966,3.0,                       not an indictment on this particular model   brand  but air fryers just dont do as well as they advertise   stuff tastes fine  but looks bad   very hard to get anything to come out evenly cooked or looking appetizing   as far as brands go  this one is fine  works well   just takes up a lot of room for whats looking like very little use      
967,4.0,                       first week i ve had it  and i ve had little complaints  easy to use start with the user guide  the basket is not the easiest to clean   but that s nit picking  a robust recipe book comes with it  i ve made fried fish  chicken parm  perfect   baked egg  bacon  perfect for draining grease   great finish   and french fries  sadly a little burnt using their suggested time       
968,4.0,                       new to airfryer but so far it s great  clean up is easy  using machine is pretty self explanatory  although the manual has helpful hints  we haven t experienced too much with recipes yet but everything that we would normally put in microwave for our toddler  chicken nuggets  pizza rolls  etc  we ve been air frying instead and it comes out crispy  we also used it to eat up leftovers  fries  eggrolls  etc  which is nice because it s not soggy      
969,2.0,                       i ve had this product since april        since then it has lost some screws holding the basket together  it s now a safety issue  it also has began to leak smoke as it cooks after my review cosori tried to make it right   so good customer service   they offered new machine fix but it wasn t worth the time   this is an entry level air fryer   you get what you pay for with air fryers      
970,5.0,                       smaller meals are fast and consistent  i kept notes on everything i cooked with suggestions for improving it next time  this thing is really consistent and versatile  every few uses  i recommend letting it cool down  lay it on it s back and wipe down the burner and interior with damp paper towels  be conscientious about not scratching the nonstick basket and pan  they clean so easily with a soft brush or sponge  just being fairly thin sheet metal  i often have time to wash them before the food is cool enough to eat  if this air fryer only lasts a year  i ll buy another one  yeah  i like it and use it that much      
971,5.0,                       before i bought my first air fryer i did my research  and this one is one of the best one and i did choose right its wow amazing i love it its easy use and your dinner is ready quick i m so happy with my purchase and its a good price as well everywhere i would go it was         and amazon has a great deal    and its the best air fryer      
972,3.0,                       this item smokes a lot when cooking or reheating things   i was reheating some chicken fingers and all of a sudden my house is smokey   why do it do that     
973,3.0,                       i was hoping that this airfryer would stand the test of time when i ordered it  the  touchscreen  is a plasticy film that is really just confusing to use  they offer an app mainly centered at using the preheat feature  with the preheat feature on the app  you will have to click to confirm on the actual airfryer unit before it starts  therefore  the app is really just useless  there are many modes you can click on the fryer which do no different than just manually setting the temperature and time  the fryer cooks food just fine  like any regular one overall  this product seemed cheaply made for a high price  they tried to overcomplicate things on the interface which causes a clutter of useless buttons      
974,1.0,                       the coating in the basket started peeling out withing   months of use i have contacted the support let s see how they handle this honestly i wasn t expecting for air fryer this expensive      
975,1.0,                       i used this   times   both times it was miserable to clean   after both cleanings there were white dots everywhere   after the second cleaning both the basket and tray would not come clean and the coating was coming off       
976,5.0,                       i like that it takes less time to cook my food without all the grease   although the tray is small  it forces you to not to be able to cook all your food at once   in the end  the cook time ends up the same but less fat than fried food   that was important to me   my    year old uses is every day to cook her lunch vs  me having to make it for her   bonus  i will now eat more of a variety of food with this   so far  i really like it   i ve read reviews that it s hard to clean but i think it has been very easy   that includes cheese sticks   spraying with olive oil beforehand is helpful   i recommend this item      
977,5.0,                       my husband fell in love with air fryers because of an airbnb we recently stayed at   he makes pretty much everything in it   bacon  chicken  thighs  breast  nuggets  legs   french fries  if there s not a recipe in the little book that comes with it  he will find on   the kids are almost as devoted as he is   it s easy to clean and easy to program       
978,5.0,                       i purchased the cosori air fryer on amazon prime day since i thought the price was great    little did i know that my wife and i were going to use it on a daily basis  if i would have know earlier i would have purchased it at the regular price  i love fish  but we did not like to prepare it because of the house smell in the regular stove  however with our cosori air fryer  we just take it out to our patio and cook the fish outside  for the rest of the foods  the come out much healthier since you don t have to use to much of the oils    we actually just spray a little avocado oil and follow some of the recipes in the book that is included with the product  ideal for   people      bon appetit       
979,4.0,                       what took so long to get this product   can t wait to try everything in it   we have done fries  mozzarella sticks  the best  and corn dogs   everything is crispy on the outside  moist on the inside  perfect like they are supposed to be   clean up is amazing   dump crumbs  wipe out   done   i gave   stars because the basket drawer is a little hard to get in and out   seems to stick a little with a little extra tug   but still well worth it      
980,5.0,                       this has made my life so much easier  really  food cooks quickly   no mess  easy clean up   i have made an entire dinner using this air fryer   i have even tested cooking frozen foods in there   i have no regrets purchasing this   the basket is large so it is easy to fit   boneless chicken breast in there at the same time      
981,4.0,                       i have had three air fryers since this past xmas  the first one was cook s  the one they advertised on tv  it had a    day warranty  it lasted   months  the second one i bought was a smaller one called go wise  so far so good  i love the black finish  it was much better than the gray finish the cook s had  i decided to buy another but i wanted a bigger one to cook a whole chicken with  this air fryer is terrific to clean up  comes off so easy and it has a black finish  so  i tried today to cook the whole chicken but i shouldn t of rubbed it with olive oil  it smoked up my kitchen from the oil  next time i am going to just put spices on it  the chicken tasted great even though i smoked up the whole house  i love the warranty and the customer service i got when i called  they are happy to help you out  i would of given   starts but     because the fan is quite noisy  my husband has to raise the voice on the tv to hear it  sounds like an airplane  i have cooked many item in it so far and i highly recommend buying it even with the noise  you get used to it  i would buy this again if it broke  just love how the food comes out fast   crispy  the cook book is real nice too      
982,5.0,                       i absolutely love this  i was hesitant to jump on the air fryer wagon but boy am i glad i did   st of all  i ordered it and received it in the same day  i mean that was amazing  anyway  back to the review  it is so easy to use and clean  it came with a very easy to read instruction booklet an a cookbook  i love it and highly recommend purchasing it  you won t  be disappointed      
983,5.0,                       this is my second air fryer and a real upgrade   love the programmed buttons  good instructions and easy to learn   impressed with the cookbook that comes with it   i like that you can separate the basket before you take your food out  and only the food comes out  not the drippings   by all means join the corsori cooks community on facebook   lots of useful recipes and tips from other users and the cosori chefs   my new favorite toy      
984,5.0,                       i purchased another air fryer before this one and returned it to walmart  this is the one to own  easy to use easy to clean and make the best chicken wings and thighs  french fries and tater tots are super crisp  highly recommend after   months still rate   stars       
985,5.0,                       so many things to love about the corsori  first of all  very quiet  love the digital controls  which have lots of options yet are not complicated  materials seem high quality  shell of unit does not get overly hot capacity of the     is great and the square shape makes it able to fit more than a rounded shape  it takes a while to learn how to cook various items and on how fast your particular air fryer cooks various items  love this air fryer      
986,5.0,                       great  easy to use air fryer   i m amazed at how good food turns out using this appliance had a problem with the handle after only two months of use  one screw came loose and the other two fell out  causing one screw to be lost  i contacted cosoris  they were very responsive and sent me a whole new basket i only asked for a few screws  which they couldn t send to me for some reason    excellent customer service and product support      
987,5.0,                       if you like the idea of roasting a whole chicken with crispy skin on the top and bottom  this is the machine for you  i use this for almost everything frozen like eggrolls  burritos  chicken nuggets  and french fries  it s so easy and convenient to use  i have almost retired my microwave  the removable basket and basin are really easy to clean having a teflon coating  there is a learning curve though  i first sprayed my whole thawed chicken with olive oil in order for the seasoning to stick  i soon learned you could fill a kitchen with smoke pretty easy if you don t take some precautions  putting a little water in the basin and using an oil with a higher smoke point fixed the problem for me   everything else goes straight from the freezer to the basket and out hot and crispy  i struggled with which air fryer to buy  so i m glad a read the reviews on this item first  i have never written a review on a product until now  and i hope this helps      
988,4.0,                       i really like how the food turns out  it does exactly what it says  we are vegetarians   eat a good bit of freezer meat alternatives  as well as egg rolls   things of that nature   i can fit    burger  patties in the basket at once what i don t like is how loud it is  the fan is louder than my exhaust fan  also  my oven is split style with a toaster feature on top that produces a very similar result with a much larger capacity      
989,5.0,                       very nice unit      liter basket is good size  perfect frozen breaded fish  very good roast vegetables  good french fries  but getting the right amount of oil on the raw fries is necessary to learn with experience  controls are simple and accurate  one can change timing and temperature in the middle of cooking  but the ease of cleaning is very  very nice      
990,5.0,                       first time air fryer purchase and i wanted white to match my kitchen appliances  so glad i purchased this it works great frozen food is crispy in    minutes  i love that there s no long preheat like an oven makes it super fast  food gets crispy just like a fryer would with less greasiness  haven t had any troubles with it and use it daily  good size for a family of        
991,5.0,                       i was so excited to get this delivered the other day  i ve been wanting an air fry for a while now and whenever i would start looking for one this is the one i kept coming back to  i finally decided to bight the bullet and just do it  we have such a crazy schedule in my house with my husbands crazy work schedule and a five year old picky eater  my son like most five year old loves chicken nuggets and french fries or tater tots  i really hate having to heat up my oven for   nuggets and a handful of fries so i was thinking this would be perfect and i was totally right  i ve only made a few things in it but i can already tell i m gonna love it  i made my son chicken and fries in about    minutes and i made some baked chicken cutlets in about    minutes  i loved that i didn t have to heat up my whole kitchen by turning on my oven and i m hoping it will help with my electric bill  everything in my house is electric  and the clean up was a breeze  just some warm soapy water and a few swipes with a sponge and it was good to go  i did invest in the liners to put in the bottom of the basket just to be on the safe side     
992,5.0,                       we have cooked in this from the very first day it arrived  it s great for everything  we cook chicken and fish easily  fresh vegetables roast in here nicely  of course frozen foods like fries  fish sticks  nuggets are so much better than cooking in the regular oven  and clean up is very easy  love the digital icons makes it very user friendly  big drawer in here  cooks a lot  but when cooking chicken and side dishes it s hard to cook everything and finish together so we are thinking of buying a second  one  this way we can cook meats that take longer and veggies and other thingsat the same time      
993,5.0,                       i had heard for a while how great air fryers were but never knew what i was missing out on  after looking at all the options available and reading ratings we decided to give this one a try and omg we are in love  this is seriously a game changer for cooking   we bought it with the expectation that it would get put away in between uses because it s a little big   well  we use it so much it has a permanent home on our counter now  not only can you fry food in here but you can cook vegetables  roast   meats  reheat food and so much more and without any oil   we have made fried chicken  fried pork chops  whole roasted chicken  roasted broccoli  cauliflower  etc  and so much more and everything turns out perfect each time   so happy we finally purchased this       
994,5.0,                       i never thought i would purchase a air fryer   after reviewing many air fryers i decided to purchased the cosori with wifi   love the size and style   it matches my contemporary decor   works like a dream   can you say  easy clean up  heck yes   throw the baskets in the dishwasher and call it good   the best part no grease to clean up from the stove  my new favorite is thick boneless pork chops cook at     f for   minutes  yummy        
995,5.0,                       if i ever sold a product  this would be it  i love this  i make everything in it  it s super easy to use  and even easier to clean up  everyone needs one of these     
996,5.0,                       i have used this for all kinds of foods    from french fries  to onions rings to fish and pork chops  all have come out amazing and in a short amount of time  love this air fryer   especially during hot weather  when i don t want to turn my oven on  good tip given to me  put tin foil in the bottom tray for easy cleanup   it saves so much time and energy  and it is so true      
997,5.0,                    corre a comprarlo  es lo mejor que puedes tener en tu cocina solo es tomar el truco con el tiempo y la temperatura para que la comida no se seque demasiado o se queme  una ves aprendes no lo dejaras de usar todos los d as          
998,5.0,                       made the best chicken wings i ve ever had  cooked everything from cornish game hens to fish sticks and brownies  also use it to reheat every thing  i ve had it   weeks  and haven t used the oven once in that time  it cooks so much faster as well  made sirloin steaks also  they weren t the best i ve ever had  but they were  the best i ve cooked  inside  the house   compared to frying or broiling  no complaints about the air fryer at all  works great      
999,4.0,                       the only drawback is the size  i have a family of    i don t like having to cook in batches like this  but the flavor and fact that i don t have to add oil or butter to most things is huge  it makes for healthier eating  i skipped the butter the cookbook suggested on some things and the food still came out great  i have made pork chops  chicken wings  chicken thighs  sweet potato fries  fries  all came out delicious      
1000,5.0,                       this was a great purchase  we were skeptical it would live up to the hype about it s ease and versatility  but it did not disappoint  after considerable research  i found this was probably the best value  cooking healthy food for two has never been easier  the recipe book that comes with it was helpful also      
1001,5.0,                       we purchased the air fryer in may of this year and immediately began using it to cook everything from brussel sprouts to steak  last week the something happened and the unit shut off and would not come back on  this had happened once or twice before but the unit restarted in a few minutes  this time it didn t  i called cosori customer support  they were great  i explained what was happening  they said they would replace the unit  within minutes i received an email with the request asking for a copy of the original amazon order and with the address where the replacement unit should be shipped  i did that was on august   th  they acknowledged getting the information and i received the replacement unit august   nd  just fantastic customer service  thank you the new unit is great      
1002,5.0,                       i will have to agree with other posts that there is a bad smell when first using this  so after some google searches i found if you run it several times empty at     degrees for    minutes with a    minute cool down between each that it took care of the smell yay  i am now using it regularly and love it  very user friendly and super easy to clean      
1003,3.0,                       shame on you floor such a ridiculously short cord need and extension cord to properly vent when cooking    beware people check cord lengths when buying air fryers  also difficult to navigate    i m not a fan but i m hoping to figure it out       
1004,5.0,                       this is the second cosori air fryer i ve purchased from amazon  this one was purchased as a gift for my father in law because i loved mine so much  the basket is huge  you can literally cook an entire chicken in it  i really like the cookbook that comes with it  filled with lots of great recipes  most kitchen appliances  in my experience  are cool for a while then get put in a cabinet and forgotten about  i use my air fryer all  the  time makes great hot wings  french fries  eggplant parmesean    really you can put anything in it  great for doing a ketogenic diet  too      
1005,5.0,                       i am so so so thankful i ignored all of the bad reviews and listened to many good ones  when you look at the reviews of any of the air fryers  they all say  do not buy  so i was like   ok then which one do i buy   i cleaned it and ran a few cycles before cooking food as recommended in the manual  read the manual   and haven t had any issue with my food  tasting like plastic   it takes some getting used to  to learn how long to cook different foods  but my food has been coming out nice and crispy  this is everything i hoped it would be      
1006,5.0,                       this is my first air fryer and it is so easy to use and clean up   it makes frozen food like fries and fish bites very crispy but so far my favorite is a lean burger  it is juicy on the inside and brown on the outside and usually lean burgers     fat  just dry up when made in a skillet   i bought some accessories and made some small muffins in it   also fresh cauliflower came out crispy and juicy   i look forward to making salmon in it and different veggies      
1007,4.0,                       this does a good job of making things crispy without burning them  i use this for frozen foods like chicken nuggets  french fries  beer battered cod  and batter covered chicken from tv dinners  the only thing i don t like about it is that you have to have the cooking basket in the machine for preheating  the one i had before this that i ended up returning because it was too small didn t force you to do that  it would heat up without the basket in it  the size of this one is about ideal for me      
1008,3.0,                       i love this cooker  but there is a problem with it  the food drawer has a weak latch and a meal that i was cooking flew out onto the floor  with the food in it  i will keep this and continue to use it  but my solution was to turn the entire unit sideways to the kitchen counter so that if it pops out  will just land on the counter  i had to glue a plastic piece back on and unbend the drawer      
1009,1.0,                       i purchased this air fryer after wanting to get one for a while  i did a lot of research and felt confident purchasing the cosori air fryer because of its high ratings  being a     best seller   and mostly positive reviews  before buying my air fryer  i read several reviews that mentioned the air fryer would stop working halfway through the cooking  this issue has now started happening to me  i will be making food  and it turns off and on several times and then stops altogether  i ve tried using different outlets in my kitchen to see if it is an electrical issue  that does not seem to be the problem before my air fryer stopped working  i liked using it a lot  it was easy to use and easy to clean  i made fries  mozzarella sticks  roasted veggies  and reheated pizza to get a crispy crust  it worked well in a lot of those instances  i am not sure if this is an issue isolated to a few air fryers  but it is frustrating now having a non working air fryer just taking up space in my kitchen after spending more than       i can not recommend this air fryer after my experience      
1010,5.0,                       ease of use  safe for the counter top  i see where some people say it leaves puddles  mine does not  but i do not place the vented side close to a wall either   i feel the presets are set alittle shy of getting food done  and i can not compare it  to any other   i will still give   stars because the machine is a great addition to my place  and the food ither than a cake has turned out great   i dont think you will be disappointed in your purchase     
1011,2.0,                       looked good  packed well  nice recipe book  easy setup   but it just failed the taste test  i tried   recipes  sweet potato fries  regular french fries and onion rings   one was ok   one was below average   one was bad  i can do much better in my oven in less time  not worth the time and effort   pretty disappointed actually      
1012,3.0,                       it is indeed a great product for a healthy meal however even though we use the spray oil  the end result is very dry which my kids aren t enjoying   they don t get the flavour and and finds difficulty in swallowing then     
1013,3.0,                       i would ve given a   star rating but in   month the plastic plate that is on the front of the basket   the screws fell out and the face plate fell off  luckily i was cleaning it and not cooking  the face plate hold the   baskets together if i had been cooking i could ve been seriously burned the performance of the air fryer is great would i buy again  no not unless the face plate to baskets were made more safe      
1014,1.0,                       even though the machine was easy to clean and use  the unit broke and would not operate after only   to   uses  it was a waste of hard earned money and time  i would not buy this again      
1015,5.0,                       i have heard people talking about how much they love their air fryer so i thought i would give it a try and i m glad i did   so far i have cooked chicken  artichokes  bacon and steak in it and they have all turned out great   it s simple to use and the clean up is extremely easy   i purchased this brand   model solely based on the reviews and i m glad it did      
1016,5.0,                       large capacity for big steaks and chops   mostly use in place of broiling in the oven or pan frying protein items   works excellently with fish and chicken thighs   learning more and more each time i use the air fryer   presets easy to use and built in shake feature for some items is a great reminder      
1017,5.0,                       this is my first air fryer and i love it  the presets are accurate  i haven t experienced any puddling or anything yet  the crispy factor is on point  flavor is on point  so easy to use  simple cleaning especially if you put foil in the bottom like i do  the recipe book is great  i love that i can cook for just me in this thing and make healthy food quick and easy      
1018,5.0,                       this is our first attempt at an air fryer  this one is a good place to start  controls are easy to understand  easy to set up and use  the only issue we have is trying to modify recipes and or instructions for different food items  but that being said  we use it several times a week  best outcome so far      chicken wings      
1019,5.0,                       i ve never used an air fryer before   i picked this up to give me more variety   wow   i made turkey burgers in here instead of grilling them and they were killer   crispy brown outside and moist in the center without the shrinkage i usually get on the grill   i ve also roasted butternut squash and chickpeas   my only gripe is wishing it could hold more      
1020,5.0,                       we ve had the air fryer for a few weeks and seem to be using it all of the time  we ve cooked wings  salmon  steaks  calamari  chops   all come our great and i clean the pan under the faucet with hot water only  nothing sticks  i wipe it all off with a paper towel and put it away  i can cook   full wings at a time  i wish it were twice as big  but i m super happy with it  btw   none of the burning plastic smell that i read on other reviews for other fryers      
1021,5.0,                       works great  have made so many delicious meals in it  the nice thing is that you can cook food from frozen in no time at all  comes with a handy recipe book as well  a little hard to clean as the grease tends to stick in some of the crevices  even after soaking  but overall  highly recommend      
1022,4.0,                       pros works as expectedfast preheatingmetal basket is easy to get in and outeasy to operategreat alternative way to cook most dishes that would otherwise require a pan or broilinggreat for crispy kale snackscons uneven heat distribution leads to some corners being more cooked than othersthe metal basket bottom bent a little after a few usesprobably not specific to this item  but not good for cooking patties   potato cakes  crab cakes  burgers and such      
1023,5.0,                       i was skeptical first about it s capabilities  the first day it came  i just dropped in a bunch of wings and set it  woohoo  in    minutes i was eating chicken wings at par with the ones i get at our local bars since then  i tried many things  carrots  veggies  potatoes  asparagus  fish  calamari  nests  etc  all turned out very tasty most of the times  i have to put no oil in meat  for veggies  a thin stay of oil suffices  this makes all the meals much healthier without losing the  required oiliness  of the food cleaning is also easy  the rack comes out  gets separated into the base pot and inner sieve and is dishwasher safe now  i just stick up things and don t have to plan elaborately  just come home  decide what i want to eat  out it in the fryer and    mins later  ready to eat      
1024,5.0,                       i ordered this during amazon prime deals and have used it almost daily  it s life changing if you cook a lot  i know that a lot of people experience problems with the basket but i m very careful not to hold it by the handle alone and so far mine has been great     months old  good value air fryer      
1025,1.0,                       after a very short period of owning this air fryer around two months all of the touchpad became on responsive  i emailed the company to get help and they were not helpful at all and i am stuck with a non functional air fryer but i spent      on  my opinion is not to buy this fryer especially since the customer service was horrible     
1026,1.0,                       we initially loved this airfryer  easy to use and clean  however the handle holding the basket has broken off and renders the airfryer completely useless  i have reached out to cosori to see if they will stand behind their product and replace the basket handle and will update this post accordingly      
1027,4.0,                       see heres the weird thing about this air fryer  to begin using it you have to hook it up to wifi and your phone  i have a basic easy air fryer that i just plug in and use  i gave this one to my boyfriend for a christmas present and took him a while to set it up  the cool things about this air fryer though is it has a recipe book and an app for your phone to keep track of meals and recipes      
1028,5.0,                       i bought this for my husband for christmas  he is usually the type to do research before buying anything but i never do so he was skeptical at first  it was a cyber monday deal that i could t resist   he loves it and can t wait to use it every night  i love it too  we have used the cookbook that came with it and everything we have tried is so delicious  chicken tastes better in it than any time i ve ever cooked chicken  the sweet potato fries were unbelievably good  i m addicted to using it  easy to clean too      
1029,5.0,                       for the longest time i resisted buying an air fryer   i didn t want another appliance taking up space in my already too small kitchen  but after seeing some great reviews  i did a bunch of research and settled on this model  i m very pleased with it   it s easy to use  easy to clean and it cooks wonderfully  i use it for things i d previously not considered air fryable and everything comes out great  even rolls and bagels  i use this a ton and am so glad i bought it      
1030,4.0,                       the air fryer works well but the button volume is obnoxious    easy fix    pop off the top   locate the soundbox   cover with tape or stuff with foam like i did    snipped from a foam painbrush      
1031,5.0,                       i did my research and i m very pleased with the results i have had it for at least   months works perfect every time makes cooking easier specially with bacon and sausage without the greasy mess on your counter top      
1032,5.0,                       the cosori air fryer meets my needs  the digital control panel is easy to understand and program  the oven is reasonably quiet  the cook chamber is roomy and square to provide maximum cooking capacity  it is also easy to insert and withdraw the basket  cleanup is up not a problem with the non stick coating and the absence of protrusions into the cook chamber i have used the cosori at least once a day since i purchased it last month  hopefully the air fryer will continue to provide this good service for a long while      
1033,5.0,                       like many  my schedule is stupidly busy and it s a challenge cooking healthy meals quickly   i did a lot of research and recently purchased this model and i absolutely love it  everything i have tried has come out great   steaks  chicken  fritattas  veggies   all cook and taste so good and it takes hardly any time at all   i bought accessories to go with it and i use those to cook an entire meal at once or to reheat items instead of placing them in the microwave   i don t cook any  french fried  foods so i cannot comment on how it does with those types of foods but it is exactly what i wanted   a versatile and easy to use cooking tool for quick healthy meals   simply add water and dishsoap after cooking  let it soak for a bit and it cleans right up    no scrubbing   highly recommend      
1034,5.0,                       this air fryer amazing   i seriously use it at least     times a week   i work long hours and it is nice to come home and be able to cook a nice meal quickly   i air fry a whole chicken every week   i have made steak tips several times and they taste grilled   hotdogs and  steak fajitas are amazing   my daughter got this one for christmas  then i got one  and i have told many people at work and they have bought one      
1035,5.0,                       pleasseeeeee get yourselves this air fryer  this has got to be one of the best inventions of all time  hahahhaha  i absolutely love my air fryer  at first i did not know which brand to get  until i visit my sister in laws house and she had this one  when her husband made his chicken wings and i saw how crispy they came out  i just knew i had to get my hands on this product  here are some pictures  i even made some burgers on it  super good      
1036,5.0,                       i am just writing to say i have had this air fryer for over a year now and started having issues where the keypad would not respond to touch  i saw that some others have had this issue so i emailed cosori customer support after sending a quick video of the issue cosori authorized a replacement to be sent to me with no further questions  in this day it is hard to find a company that stands behind there products like this and even though i had the issue with the air fryer i would not hesitate to purchase any of there products do to there outstanding customer service also before this issue the air fryer worked flawlessly was  easy to clean and overall a great addition to the kitchen      
1037,5.0,                       i am nothing but pleased  i was on the fence for so long about buying an air fryer  i now wish that i wouldn t have waited  i did the research and this was very highly recommended  the reviews were not wrong  it does everything advertised and then some  this is the best purchase i have made in very long time  i have absolutely nothing bad to say about my corsori air fryer max          
1038,3.0,                       i bought this for mainly cooking small chickens  steak and some roasting  and of course ff  but the last chicken splattered the heating element and caused a terrible burnt smell  now i cant get rid of the odor and cleaning is impossible if you plan on cooking whole chickens  beware otherwise it has not disappointed      
1039,1.0,                       had the air fryer for one day and only used it once and now it turns on but will not heat up food  called cosori customer service and they advised to return it because it appeared that the heating element is damaged after only one use  i am getting a replacement sent to me hopefully it last more than one day or i will be switching to a different brand      
1040,5.0,                       never heard of an air fryer before until my neighbor mentioned it and how she uses it to cook french fries  being a ff addict myself i had to try it  we got the air fryer and well instead of making french fries i made chicken thighs with the skin on  making a recipe from the book that came with the fryer   it was amazing  juicy on the inside crispy on the outside   so fast and quick and easy to clean we made pork tenderloin in this thing and i can t even tell you how juicy and tender it is   cutting it with a fork  again  easy to clean we finally made french fries and well  that was actually disappointing  lol the reason i bought it  french fries  and well i like them better baked in the oven i use this air fryer at least   times a week  i love it      
1041,2.0,                       i really liked this air fryer  but when i cleaned it today i noticed this wear mark between the basket and the basket holder  now i m freaked out and afraid to use it due to the carcinogenic properties of non stick coatings  so i guess in the trash it goes due to being    days or so outside the    day return policy  i used it about    times        
1042,5.0,                       what i like about this is that it makes the cooking a lot easier  it basically helped us during the stay at home quarantine time of march and april       it offsets us from using cooking oils on our food  hence lesser consumption of oily substances      
1043,5.0,                       you cannot do better cooking than in our new cosori air fryer  so quick  very easy  easy cleaning  we have cooked meat  potatoes  vegetables  everything came out perfect   so much more tasty  we bought the red    quart size so it will feed our children  when they come over  love  love this air fryer  perfect in every way      
1044,5.0,                       i ve only had it a few days and i ve used it every day  this air fryer is definitely my favorite kitchen appliance right now  i needed a large basket for meal prep and this is the largest i could find for the price i wanted to pay  prime days deal   the programmed options are easy to follow  it has a safety button on the basket and it is very easy to clean  dishwasher safe       
1045,5.0,                       my friend got this and showed me hers and told me all about it   i had to have it   i m so happy with this purchase   it s easy to use  and everything that i have made in it has turned out perfectly and delicious   i ve made shrimp  salmon  chicken  apple pies  asparagus  chick peas  and more   one tip that has been helpful to me is to put aluminum foil under the basket to make cleaning easier   you just have to clean the basket  and not the little tray thing that it goes in   i would highly recommend this air fryer   it s a real time saver      
1046,5.0,                       i ve owned this air fryer a couple of months and just love it    i ve made chicken wings  french fries  cookies  bagels  brownies  muffins  egg rolls   mini pies  bacon      what haven t i made    everything comes out beautifully browned and crispy   it cooks faster than most recommended times so i m still experimenting with that  it cleans so up so effortless  it s easy to use and it has a decent sized basket  it seems to be well made  isn t too big to sit on my counter and not too loud do yourself a favor  get yourself a good air fryer cookbook and you will be able to use it for everything  it s not just a chicken wing and french fry maker       
1047,5.0,                       this air fryer is absolutely incredible  it makes everything taste amazing  it cooks things perfectly every time and is so incredibly easy to clean  i have a small kitchen without much counter space and this does not take much space and tucks away perfectly in a corner until it s ready to be used again  it s a great time saver and makes vegetables taste great and cooks them in half the time      
1048,5.0,                       great purchase  mine is fromamazon wear house  no cosmetic issues that i can see  works perfectly  i paid about         less than brand new  i m thrilled with it  i have a toaster oven i m in love with  so i was skeptical of air fryers i waited long time to get on the air fryer train  i m glad this is my first air fryer  i m sold  it cooks my food super quick and it nice a crispy in     min      
1049,5.0,                       this works really well  and it s a good size for my hungry family of three with plenty of room to spare  the presets are super helpful and mostly very accurate too  i will say that the one thing i learned with an air fryer is to use cooking spray  spray the basket and the food and everything comes out crispy  super easy to clean      
1050,3.0,                       easy to use and decent results  so much so that i often use this once or twice a week to help speed up dinner prep that being said  it clearly won t last the test of time  i ve never dropped this thing but the handle is already falling apart  the container itself doesn t slide in  flush  any more either i expect more bits and pieces of it to fail as i use it more      
1051,5.0,                       this air fryer is as good as the hype  incredible taste and so easy to use  i did a lot of research and i am very happy with this air fryer      
1052,5.0,                       it took me a while to convince my husband for us to get an air fryer  but after doing research and seeing all the great reviews  he gave me the ok  after  he was so happy with this air fryer  he said we could get rid of the oven  not that i was going to do that  but most of our meals are cooked in the air fryer now  and  the cooking time is cut in half or more  chicken legs cook in    mins  a personal pizza that took    minutes in the oven  takes   minutes in the air fryer  would definitely recommend      
1053,3.0,                       the first one came  plugged it in and it didn t work   the second one works have used it   times  basically its a small oven   beware because when it is heating and in use the portion of the cord that goes into the socket heats up to an unsafe temp     
1054,5.0,                       air fryer came on time and packed well   haven t done a whole lot yet but corn dogs and tator tots so far everything comes out nice and crisp and grease free which is great because my husband has health issues i know i ll be doing many more things   ps   liked it so well we got one for our grand daughter for a weddingpresent      
1055,5.0,                       makes cooking fun and easy to do  my son keep asking me to buy a air fryer because apparently it s supposed to be more healthy  so fast i love it  easy to clean      which that was my number one priority   delivery time      package      instructions      value      taste      recommend it         
1056,3.0,                       pros it works great the functions are easy to understand it connects to wifi it cleans really well easily doesnt take up too much kitchen space cons it stopped heating up after over   months of use   not sure if it is the fuse that is causing the heat to not turn on  but all that circulates is cold air  kind of disappointing but it was good while it lasted  not sure if it was worth the       when it breaks so easily tho      
1057,5.0,                       i bought this because i recently had bariatric weight loss surgery  this machine is amazing i was able to make shrimp  salmon  chicken in just a few minutes and everything was well cooked  i was also able to bake potatoes and vegetables without any issues  i am now only using this thing to make food every day cleaning is very easy i highly recommend this specific model to everyone      
1058,5.0,                       life changing legitimately here   this is the best thing i have ever put in my kitchen  cooks so easily  lots of quick easy meals fast you need this and give it an everyday conveted counter space spot   tons of great recipes on youtube  this is the preferred brand by all youtubers too      
1059,5.0,                       i bought this for my son and went by the reviews when ordering one   he got it in mail and loves it   so very happy he does   shipped quickly too   thank you     
1060,1.0,                       cosori box had a massive dent on the side  when opening the cardboard box  noticed the actual cosori box was bent inwards as well  my cosori air fryer arrived cracked  and does not power on  very poor quality  it s a real shame since i was really looking forward to this      
1061,5.0,                       i was given an airfryer for christmas last year and i wasn t really  a fan of it  however  i kept hearing how great they are so i figured maybe i should invest a little more money and buy one that can produce real results  i was blown away with this airfryer  my last airfryer wouldn t cook meat evenly and this one does  i made a ribeye steak for my boyfriend and it came out so tender and yummy  i just love my airfryer  it cooks almost anything so fast and helps with cutting fat  i would very much recommend this product      
1062,4.0,                       only gave this   stars because i ve only used it once   i just recently got this and have only made french fries   both my husband and i were pleased with the taste of the fries   it was extremely easy to clean   i look forward to using it often and will probably update my review then      
1063,5.0,                       i purchased this air fryer during the prime day deals and read all the reviews about it and was i satisfied with the description and direction what kid if air fryer this is we have used this air fryer at lease twice a week since we purchased it  we have made fries  steak  fish  veggies string beans and brussel sprouts   chicken wings  chicken tenders etc the directions are simple whether following the food products directions of temp and time or the controls on the fryer overall great fryer if anything changes i will update this review     
1064,5.0,                       day one   excellent frozen fries  my guinea pig  er father loved them  i ended up adjusting the time down to    minutes total from     preset for fries  after the shaker timer  so cool  went off at the    minute mark and revealed crispy yet tender fries  totally stoked to try some of the recipes in the book and some of my signature recipes to see how they come out  i expect nothing but greatness  will update soon      
1065,5.0,                       this fryer is absolutely the best   makes an entire crispy chicken  the best crunchies fries potatoes  and what i call  egg cupcakes    i bought one for my vacation home and one for each of my sons   only negative is you can t make the chicken and potatoes at the same time   the recipe book is quite nice  although my first copy had the pages fall out   i would not buy the accessory kit   you are better off buying silicone baking cups      
1066,5.0,                       bought this for my mom and dad   they have said nothing but good things about it   the air fryer is a pretty good size so make size you have some counter space      
1067,5.0,                       have a smaller one cosori but i couldn t cook enough food because the basket was too small that s why i got a bigger cosori in white   now i can cook veg in the smaller one and meat in my big cosori   love them both         
1068,5.0,                       well  truth is i have no idea  it s a new product and concept for me to use an air fryer but  as i do for everything else  i research before buying anything  the reviews were great and this product was rated in top   by amazon  i love fried foods    this one product will allow me to eat what i like and reduce greatly the fats used  i m a happy camper  it will also cut the time i spend in the kitchen and give me more time for hobbies that i enjoy  what s not to like      
1069,5.0,                       cosori s customer service went above and beyond with my concerns and issues with my new fryer  i contacted them directly through phone and emails  i always received a response back from them within hours  well their product did not meet my expectations  they were apologetic and offered me a full refund  i loved the style and white color   i am leaving a   star review because i feel if someone does have any issues with their products cosori will make it right to keep their consumers happy      
1070,2.0,                       upset about our purchase  we bought this unit on march    and the coating in the basket is already wearing off  who knows what we are ingesting  the basket is also now a bit warped due to the heat  so the door pops open  was awesome for three weeks  the  support  page listed in amazon goes to a     error page  not impressed  hoping someone reads this and offers some assistance      
1071,5.0,                       i absolutely loved this air fryer until it just quit today  nothing   just quit  i even bought one for my sister because i liked it so much  has anyone else had this problem  it s just   months old  i would have given it   plus stars until it quit  i am so disappointed update  i contacted cosori and they sent me a new machine  i received it in   days    what great customer service  now i am back to using my air fryer daily because i love it      
1072,4.0,                       this air fryer is a good product  easy to use  however it is impossible to mute it s beeps and they are super loud lots of annoying beeps and reminders all the time     
1073,4.0,                       the basket and tray lock together  the tray falls off the basket a lot  be careful  don t let your animals or children be under your feet when you pull it out  it is hot and fairly heavy      
1074,5.0,                       the air fryer has been a life changer for me  we use it at least   times a week either for preparing the main dish or a side dish  veggies come out wonderfully roasted  chicken is moist and tender  and  it makes the best salmon filet i ve ever tasted  we plan dinners around how we can use the air fryer now  clean up is a breeze  easy to operate  too  i m so glad i finally purchased it  worth every dollar spent      
1075,4.0,                       i really like many features of this air fryer  it has the shake reminder  preheat  and digital face  sometimes the buttons are difficult to push to adjust the time and the temperature  i ve also never been able to get the app to actually connect with my phone which is kind of disappointing and was a big selling feature for me      
1076,5.0,                       this is the best appliance that i ever bought      really crisps the wings without oil   you don t need the wax paper   it is very easy to clean and dishwasher proof         i will buy it again   i will love to give this as a present to everyone i know     i am on diet  i lost    pounds and    still to go   it s amazing how i eat fried chicken without frying it         
1077,5.0,                       i waited a bit to write this review  because i wanted to try out a bunch of different things  now that i have  i m in love  we have done fresh sweet potato fries  carrots  green beans  broccoli  kale  frozen pot stickers  and fresh chicken wings  everything came out crispy and delicious by either following the directions from the included recipe book or by finding a general air fry recipe online and figuring out the time and temperature for the item  some take some minor tweaking  but overall it has been amazing  my husband is obsessed with the quality of the chicken wings      
1078,4.0,                       this is a great product  easy clean up and cooks well  i would advise you skip the bluetooth model and get the normal model  the bluetooth just isnt worth it      
1079,4.0,                       i love it i hardly use my stove now  it s perfect for working parents  you just need to make sure there is always  chicken  nuggets  burger patties  fries  vegetables  potatoes and puff pastry in the house and your kids can cook for themselves especially when you have to work late or go to work  it beeps to let u know it still on or needs to turn  youtube has lots of recipes to help you  i would recommend to anyone     
1080,4.0,                       this was our first air fryer  i bought it with low expectations because of the price  but was not disappointed  it s light  has alot of presets  heats up pretty fast  has a nice design  and it s fairly easy to clean  though a bit annoying to clean as well  it comes with a massive recipe booklet that has all kinds of foods in it  though you can probably find some better recipes online  but the book can still give you amazing ideas  i would give it a    if it was larger  it can comfortably fit about   or   chicken thighs  to give an idea of the basket size  overall a great fryer  especially for the price      
1081,4.0,                       the air fryer is well constructive has a good design instructions are real well written and easy to follow which helps and getting up and going quickly are use frozen chicken wings in the cooker and the rash was perfect the front programs are easy to cycle through and you can change the setting byam to fit your preferences as well as setting the time and temperature that works for you  i highly recommend this product  i will tomorrow     
1082,5.0,                       for the  st    days of use  it appears to meet all expectations   one added benefit was the recipe booklet that came with the air fryer   food taste great and cooks quickly   wondering about the energy efficiency and whether using the air fryer is more or less efficient than an electrical oven   broiler        
1083,4.0,                       i really like this air fryer  the digital display is really nice  and you ve got the option to choose your temperature and cook time manually  or with the preset buttons  there s a bacon button  which cooked my bacon perfectly   my only gripe is that sometimes it seems as though the drawer has to be inserted removed a few times before it actually shuts  but it might just need some breaking in since it s new  i also noticed that some condensation has dripped out under the basket lip in the front  but not a huge deal   just a little messy  overall  i m happy with this      
1084,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          does it looks normal i m not happy with that      
1085,5.0,                       definitely easy to clean and easy to use  it s a great value  it is a game changer i have made so many foods and can free get about greasy high calorie foods  cooks everything amazing there s some great recipes out there too  it s big enough to fit entire meals in can cook more than one thing at a time on it      
1086,5.0,                       i use this a lot for frozen foods  fish sticks  chicken nuggets  popcorn shrimp  and it makes them come out crispy on the outside  tender inside  and evenly cooked as opposed to the microwave  i feel it is very easy to clean and easy to understand how to use      
1087,5.0,                       i love this product    it s easy to use and it comes with recipe book   no additional book needed   it s all the recipes you will ever need   it s big and i am shocked that it s didn t cost that much   there s a     off on it also  i am like      this can be possible  wingstop would charge a hand and   for this wings i just made   the buttons on it of   u want to make   three year old can use it       
1088,2.0,                       i  have to say i was underwhelmed   yes  it cooked the chicken nuggets  tater tots  chicken wings to be crispy faster than my oven does    the bad thing was that all the food had a slight metallic taste to the food   maybe it was the non stick coating  maybe over time that wouldn t happen    i don t want to find out      
1089,3.0,                       the product does its job  the only thing is that it is extremely difficult to clean  i left it soaking overnight  the next day i washed it and the grease wouldn t come off  left it soaking a bit more  finally i decided to scrub  the inside paint came off        very disappointed with that  haven t used it since      
1090,5.0,                       i purchased my air fryer almost a year ago and love it  i use it almost daily  i did have an issue recently where the sliding button guard somehow became cracked  i haven t dropped it  and am not sure how it happened  but the cosori customer support was awesome  i took a picture of the button guard  sent in a support email  and within    hours had a complete replacement basket shipped  i love cooking with my air fryer  and have cooked everything from simple snacks to complete meals in it  and again  the customer support for this product is just amazing  if you are looking for an air fryer  cosori is definitely the way to go  simple to use  and the food is amazing      
1091,5.0,                       i was so worried about my teenage son moving out this year  and him not being able to cook and fend for himself    not anymore  i gifted him this for christmas  and it was such a smart move  he cooks everything now  vegetables  french fries  pizza  meat  and even skewers  he s cooked steaks  chicken legs  chicken thighs  drumsticks  chicken tenders  shrimp  salmon filets  and beef skewers  never did i think he would be able to cook all those things for himself   he gets on his phone  finds a simple recipe  seasons the meat  and forgets about it  he doesn t mind being in the kitchen  he prefers the taste to many things i ve done over the stove with oil  and he loves the healthier food  it s so easy to clean up      
1092,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          used once to test  didn t even finish cooking my fries  cause it stopped working halfway when i took out the basket to shake my fries  put back in but didnt resume the cooking  turned off and waited til it got cold cause mybe it just overheated  but still wouldn t turn the air fryer back on    will be returning the product   see the video     
1093,1.0,                       the few times i used it thought it dried up the food i cooked  i tried french fries  chicken and pork fries were okay  not my first air fryer  i really like the cooks air fryer     not available on amazon  that i purchased for my son  i wanted a little bigger on for me  i also tried the gowise usa gw      after using it two times the plastic clip on the fryer basket broke very poorly made     
1094,5.0,                       i was very surprised at how much i would actually like an air fryer  but i love it  everything that i have made so far has been great  fries  pork chops  steak  chicken    you name it  it s amazing  clean up is easy  i would highly recommend trying it  it s very easy and it comes with a recipe book as well  just for registering with the company online you an extra year warranty      
1095,5.0,                       poor quality  research and buy one that last longer i received my order in november of        love this machine and used it about   times a week however  january        less than   months after receiving it  the button on the display that allows you to change the temperature and time no longer functions if this happened so soon then i assume within one year the unit will be useless      
1096,1.0,                       i purchased and received this unit in early march        the bottom half of the buttons on the touchscreen did not work at all   if you sort reviews by  most recent   you ll see that there are a number of other reviewers who have experienced the same problem recently   i m guessing they had a bad batch of these produced and they somehow slipped through qa at the factory  assuming that they check each unit  of course    until you start seeing a pattern of positive reviews after march       i would be hesitant to order this air fryer unless you re willing to run the risk of having to return it      
1097,5.0,                       i am so happy with this purchase   no more heating up a large oven for a baked potato   no more going outside in the winter to grill a steak   i am beyond pleased with this air fryer   i like the app for saving times and temperatures for recipes i fine tune   other than that i don t really use the app      
1098,5.0,                       this is the best air fryer i have had  i had one before this that cost         my girlfriend bought this fryer and it made my fryer look like i was cooking with an easy bake oven  this fryer heats up faster  cooks in     the time the other fryer did  and what ever i cook  especially poultry  burgers  etc are so much better  nice crispiness to the top of the meats i had a question on the product and their customer service is top notch  great product      
1099,5.0,                       i ve had this air fryer for around   years and enjoy using it   it is easy to clean  i ve just been putting it in the dishwasher and it is ready to use again   there has been no chipping of the non stick basket  there is a nice recipe booklet that comes with the fryer and the recipes are easy to use  chicken wings  fish  french fries  hot dogs  hamburgers all come out tasting great  chicken parm is our favorite   the only disappointment is when we cook steak  the steak cooks fine  tastes good  but has a gray coloring to it when done   just doesn t look very appetizing   it might be the way we are cooking it  but other than that  it s a great fryer      
1100,4.0,                       i ve had this air fryer for over six months and it s only ok  it crisps up veggies and potatoes nicely  not salmon though  it s very loud and feels extremely cheap for the price  i already noticed a screw is coming out that holds the basket to the handle  i did a lot of research before buying this and i m slightly disappointed  i based my purchase off reviews  i was trying to upgrade    i had a phillips air fryer before this that cost less and did just as good of a job      
1101,5.0,                       i absolutely love this air fryer  i can put a whole bag of french fries into this and it cooks them all and they are very crispy  i ve cooked all types of stuff in this  the only thing i m not crazy about is cooking fresh meat in it  my opinion it dries it out  but things like fries  onion rings  pizza bites  anything frozen it cooks amazing  i ve made my own wraps in this with biscuits  flatten out biscuits and add meat  vegis  cheese pop it in cooker  amazing     
1102,4.0,                       this is a very large air fryer that i enjoy using a lot but clean up isn t easy because as a right handed  the design of it inside is good left handed people  i don t have a dishwasher  i do everything by hand and that s my only complaint  other than that it gets the job done      
1103,5.0,                       every now and then you make a purchase and  looking back  you say that was a really good purchase  this is one of those items  we ve made home made fries  sweet potato fries  chicken parm  pizzas  tons of veggies  shrimp  bacon  without the mess   the list goes on  people that don t know how to cook are suddenly being praised at parties for their food  those that normally don t cook at all re now making dinner for the family  i just honestly can t say enough good things about this  every household should have one  period      
1104,2.0,                       the machine in general is great  the tray is horrible  i have officially owned my air fryer about a month now as i write this review  however  within this month  i have one huge problem  the pan will not stay closed  it pops out for no reason and whatever i am making ends up on the floor  this happens often  one month and this dysfunction it s disheartening  i love all of the other features  i never thought i d need or use wifi but it turns out to be handy and the recipes in the app or great however  buyer beware  unless you re willing to manually hold the tray in  your meal may end up on the floor       
1105,5.0,                       i needed to find a way to cook my favorite foods in a healthier process  i decided to go for it and ordered the cosori based on reviews i had read i love it  my first attempt was  fried  chicken  it was the best i have ever had  the skin came out crispy and the meat was amazingly juicy   the next best part was clean up  no oil to dump  nothing sticking to the pan  the unit is lightweight so putting it in the pantry is easy my grandkids love what i ve made them    egg roll pizza roll ups   chicken fingers  i should also mention that i will be purchasing another one for my daughter so i don t have to take mine with me to her house i don t put it in the dishwasher and i only use a misto sprayer before putting food in the tray  no chipping in or peeling      
1106,3.0,                       firstly i love this air fryer and use it multiple times a week  i bought it in september as my first air fryer  i would give it   stars however  i m extremely disappointed because it has already broken  the screws came out while i was air frying my dinner and they won t stay in anymore so the basket and handle are broken  has anyone else had this problem and were able to fix it  i truly love this product and want to keep using it but won t be able to  i bought it in september and it s december now and it s already broken  i wonder if i should have spent more money for a better product now  it s a great air fryer but just didn t last      
1107,5.0,                       i never thought cooking could be so easy   i made chicken wings in my new air fryer today  seasoned with garlic powder  black pepper and pink himalayan salt  turn out great and crispy   i shook then at the halfway point but didn t flip  for my first time using an air fryer  this has been a great experience  i did extensive research before deciding to purchase the cosori     qt and this is perfect size for     people  i like to make plenty of food so this is perfect for that      
1108,5.0,                       i m glad i got it  it s very easy to use  i read through the recipes  i have even gone looking for recipes  i made apple chips  they were okay  not great like in the oven  i ve used it at least three times for tater tots  that seems to be the best thing with this machine  i cooked omaha steaks chicken stuffed and i put the time in   minutes too long  they were overdone  but done  sometimes wish i had tried a smaller machine  i would recommend this machine  it s not for large amounts  i think it s good for two people or one person      
1109,5.0,                       i like that is very good at cooking steaks  fries  eggplant  anything  it has a booklet with recipes  then you have those recipes also in the app and from there can send  with one touch  the recipe to the cosori and food will be ready  just simple  easy  clever  is very easy to clean  only   baskets   is big enough for a large meal  is not loud  just normal  is fast with the internet and signals from the app my whole family loves the food that i prepare in the fryer  the price is totally worthy i have a question and the customer service was   star  i highly recommend this product      
1110,5.0,                       wings  fries  roasted veggies  and pastries are good  air fried food taste different but in a good way  light and crispy  fried food generally sucks when delivered but this fits the gap nicely  it generally cooks way faster than you think so keep an eye on your food at the halfway mark  cleanup is super easy  keeps the heat and smell in your kitchen down      
1111,4.0,                       the reason i get this  four stars is because when you pull the tray in and out it slides all the way out there s nothing for it to rest on it has already hit the floor once the tray is not level with the counter poor design  but i love my air fryer and all the different settings it does a wonderful job cooking just a design flaw   you have to take the tray all the way out  and set it on the counter   you cannot rest  the tray  it in the  air fryer while you take food out with tong it will slide all the way out        
1112,5.0,                       our first air fryer  we love it and use it often  it cleans easily except for where the heating element is  very easy to use clear instructions  preheat function works well and quickly  have done hamburger frozen and fresh  hot dogs  pork tenderloins  potato wedges and frozen french fries so far we love it and use it a lot  reheating pizza was an experience  nice and very like when it was delivered      
1113,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          am at my wit s end i can t even return this even if i want to because i am at high risk for covid so i can t have contact with people agh the basket does not separate from the outer layer  it will not work and my thumbs hurt i really invested a lot to buy this air fryer and it doesn t even work  it s faulty  usability is terrible  maybe i received a faulty product i don t know but during this pandemic not having quality checked their products really just take advantage of people like me that can t afford to go out or have others living with me go out      
1114,5.0,                       i have one of these  i ordered one for my sister  o boy  she never had an appliance as slick as this  just two of them well she has never tasted cooked food from an air fryer  all she said was wow so easy to clean get one  if not this brand  one that fits you  mine is  qt  just me  perfect      
1115,5.0,                       this air dryer is my new best friend   i use it all the time  the design is leap years better than the leading brand i replaced  and  it is pretty next to the red mixer     play around with timing and you will never use your oven for smaller things  no added fat  really easy to clean because both the top and the place where things drip come out  many air fryers have only the one piece removable    buy this      
1116,3.0,                       i ve had the fryer for quite a while now and it s very satisfied with the way it cooks food  the trouble is that the led display is failing and the handle fell off of the basket  just the plastic part of the handle fell off but it looks like crap now  slightly better workmanship would have brought this to five stars easily because i like everything else about it     
1117,1.0,                       buttons do not work to touch after      touches  alignment of button and keypad possibly off because eventually  if i soft touch not exactly on the button power button  it finally powers on waiting on company to contact me to fix this and make it right delivery was extremely delayed  i want a replacement but do not want to give mine up until receiving the replacement  so as to not be left without an air fryer at all for a long period of time cosori or amazon please contact me   sorayachaveleh gmail com will update my review upon company correcting the issues     
1118,5.0,                       it s pretty hard to learn to cook appropriately at the beginning  once you learn you can master the art of cooking with this  the meats used to get either burnt or lose flavor when i first tried it  but as i continued to use i was finally able to cook meat perfectly while keeping it s flavor and spices  the key is flipping the meat once or twice at the right time during your entire duration  i once served chicken legs at a party  all of my guests really liked the way chicken was fried      
1119,5.0,                       absolutely a must have in any kitchen  this cooks frozen food like a boss without having to pre heat an oven and go through all that time consumption best of all no more greasy fryer to mess with or splatter all over my kitchen  absolutely recommend this product      
1120,5.0,                       i love this air fryer  i cook almost everything in it  i have made great bacon i will never go back to frying or cooking in oven  i ve cooked steaks  pork chops  that have come out nice and brown and so juicy  best bacon wrapped cheese stuffed jalape os  great homemade french fries  i could go on  best little machine  when dirty just put in dishwasher  so easy  love it      
1121,5.0,                       i bought a different product originally and the knobs were hard to use and the tray didn t slide in easily  i returned it and bought this air fryer instead  i love this one  the tray is sturdy and goes in and out easily  i love the digital touchscreen as well  there is no guessing in temp or time and the presets are easy to use  i highly recommend this cosori      
1122,5.0,                       i got the unit for christmas and used it for the first time last night   i made thick chicken strips two ways  one with a breading and one with a dry rub   the whole family asked me to always make them in the air fryer because they were so tasty and moist   they cooked lickety split      degrees for   minutes for   of them    i made   batches for dinner and they were done in no time   wow   my son had them for lunch today straight from the fridge and said they were still moist   yum   the basket is big and easy to clean   using the unit is super easy   the recipe booklet has many delicious looking recipes   i will use this unit often in place of my oven and stove      
1123,5.0,                       i wish i had not waited so long to buy this  what an incredible machine and it serves my family of   really well  we love making mozz sticks  pork chops  chicken thighs  chicken breasts  onion rings  chicken wings  apple   sweet potato medley  and the list goes on  it cooks them quickly  perfectly  and they taste delicious      
1124,5.0,                       look no further  this is literally the best impulse buy yet  you will not be disappointed  i have literally been cooking everything in this and it s a great size  cooks everything to perfection  no complaints over here      
1125,1.0,                       admittedly i have a very sensitive nose  but after cleaning the basket several times  everything i cook in this tastes and smells like plastic  it s bad enough now where i m going to give it away and buy one of the more expensive ones made with better quality materials  most likely breville or cuisinart   keep all the packaging and box for at least a week before throwing it a away  wish i would have  do not recommend this product at all  plastic tasting food cannot possibly be safe      
1126,5.0,                       love love love this   i need to trim some pounds and this was my reason for the purchase    i cook almost everything in it and have dropped    pounds in six weeks  today made cornish  hens  all the grease drained into the bottom pan  i could go on and on  we like grilled steaks but this air fryer takes a cheap piece of sirloin and cooks it melt in your mouth and juicy   we usually only buy ribeye but rethinking  i have found that it doesn t a take nearly as long as every website suggests to cook all the food i have tried  so pleased that three  family members each bough this one just like it and love theirs also      
1127,5.0,                       got this in the mail today i was worried i seen the good reviews and i never checked the bad until yesterday i seen people saying about a plastic smell make sure all the plastic is out before preheating not a over powering smell nothing more then a new pair of shoes smell  doesn t make much noise the size isn t bad not much bigger then a  ltr sprite bottle   my only problem the wifi won t stay on long enough for my app for it to sync  for me to use my phone i tried for over an hour i wrote customer support they said i should have a reply within   hour so we should see   but i am very happy so far for having it for less then    hours      
1128,5.0,                       i thought this would be a fun gadget to add to the kitchen   just something to do special things with  primarily make wings  i did not expect that it would become the most versatile  frequently used appliance appliance in my kitchen  it s so quick  easy to use  easy to clean and works on practically everything  i use it almost every day now  frozen foods  bacon  wings  fried chicken  the texture it gives everything is amazing  highly recommend      
1129,2.0,                       this product was good for about the first couple weeks  easy to use and clean  i loved it  after a month screws came coming out  i would screw them back in if i found them  slowly but surely now all the screws are out and i can t use it  your better off buying one at costco so you can return it      
1130,5.0,                       i have wanted an air fryer for some time now  i looked at a couple different ones and thought this one sounded the best  i was right  amazing  we used it for the first time to make jalape o poppers and they were amazing as always  super quick  never even had to turn them  delicious and easy to clean up after      
1131,3.0,                       the cosori air fryer is perfect in so many ways  however  there has been multiple times where the basket literally pops out while cooking  yes i make sure it is completely closed  the air fryer sits on my counter top and the basket pops out so hard  it flies over a foot from the counter and lands on the floor and spills the food  it almost landed on top if my little maltese dog       
1132,2.0,                       i like the functions of the air fryer so that s why i didn t down vote it terribly  the food however was awful  there was a weird metallic taste to all the food i put into it after cooking it and decided it was not worth my time to keep it      
1133,5.0,                       f in love this thing  have had it for about two weeks and it is so versatile  chicken tenders  bacon  frozen sweet potato fries  crab cake  filet mignon  and an beyond burger all came out perfect  we did try a chicken parmesan that was just okay  bc you can t really flip it  we got the     qt and it fits well beneath our counter  if you are entertaining or cooking for a family  i d say get the      i can easily get     strips of bacon at once  it s pretty easy to use  especially with the presets  and cleaning is easy  as the grease is between two non stick baskets that decouple      
1134,5.0,                       i bought in july mainly to cook french fries in the hot weather instead of heating up the oven  well i use it for everything and use it at least once a day or more  this device has become my life line so needless to say when it quit working i was devastated  cosori s customer service was wonderful   i spoke to rep peter at     pm followed instructions that were emailed to me and by     pm i had a reply back and by saturday i had a replacement  thanks cosori      
1135,5.0,                       exactly what i wanted  works great  i previously jumped on the instapot bandwagon and used it   times  just to hard for me to figure out how to use  this on the other hand is very easy to use and haven t had any issues  food is quick and delicious  clean up is quick  we use it in the camper all the time      
1136,1.0,                       after a few weeks of use it decided to literally explode on me  i heard a loud buzzing after starting it  i pulled the basket out hoping to stop it  but the buzzing continued  so i pulled the plug out of the wall and then there was a loud pop  a burst of light from somewhere under or behind it  and then smoke rising from the back  it was completely dead after that what a piece of junk      
1137,5.0,                       i got this for my dad for christmas and he loves it  it s easy to use and makes very good food  the best thing we have made with it is potato chips and french fries  very crisp note  it seems to make a noise that humans cant hear but my dog absolutely despises this thing and cries whenever we use it      
1138,5.0,                       i truly love my af    it s fast and easy to use    i love the fact you can use it with alexa plus you can download app and program it from there if you re not in the same room  the only thing is that the baskets are a little hard to separate when trying to clean them  but overall  i love it         
1139,5.0,                       gave as a gift and they are thrilled with it  this was for my sister who isn t one to want to make elaborate meals and dirty up the kitchen  she loves the ease and speed of preparing her food and no messy stove or oven  she can put a few different foods in at once too      
1140,5.0,                       works great  just have to cook with it an learn the cook temps an times  i tried to defrost some chicken other day an it kinda started cooking the thin edges so that didn t work very well  an it s not very loud  i can turn it on an watch a tv show an before you know it i don t even hear it anymore  if standing next to it just sounds like a floor fan  not nearly as loud as hairdryer     
1141,5.0,                       we were a little skeptical about air fryers  wondering how much would we really use it we did a lot of research and found the cosori     had better reviews than the others we looked at we are thrilled we made the purchase  we use it at least     times a week  cooks chicken beautifullya big positive for us was the     quart basket  the size is perfect for my husband and i      
1142,5.0,                       after reading so many reviews about different air fryers  i decided to choose this one  by far one of the best investments i ve made  i work full time and have   little ones always on the go and hardly have time to cook now  if you re trying to meal prep  buy this  if you get lazy and want something quick by this  it s so easy to use and super easy to clean  i have used it probably   times now  nothing has broken off  you do need to be careful on that clear little plastic thing that you push to slide out the basket though  if you re not careful it looks like it can break  so don t get frustrated trying to open it  to sum it up i cooked chicken and asparagus in   mins  lol     
1143,5.0,                       i looked up a lot before purchasing my first air fryer  i wasn t initially convinced this was worthwhile purchase  but going through the reviews decided to go with this air fryer  this is a perfect size for family of      made fried chicken as the first experiment  it was delicious  it was perfectly crispy  juicy  not dry  this has preset buttons for meats  and the temperature and duration were perfect  definitely recommend this      
1144,5.0,                       love this product  im glad i spent the extra money for this  i ve had friends comment that the quality is much better than the cheaper more affordable ones on amazon  i like that to fry basket is square and large  the settings are easy and convinient to use  only down side is it is hard to clean off any stuck on food oil  but i think that will be a challenge for any air fryer  strongly recommend if you need a break from using the oven  makes any frozen food      better than the microwave and is faster than the oven     
1145,5.0,                       this thing saved my life  i mean literally because i really needed the help to maintain a more healthy diet  i was surprised by the size at first but it was      worth it  i ended up needing that size and loved how quick and easy to roast veggies and cook nearly anything and make experimenting more fun in the kitchen     
1146,3.0,                       my unit is slightly defective  steam would release from the lower right corner causing water to drip causing a puddle to accumulate  other drawback is that you must flip rotate food in order to have even cooking  washing is a bit difficult because the upper try has too many ridges to properly clean  overall is a decent purchase      
1147,5.0,                       i have to say  i will never cook with my oven again  this air fryer was so easy to use  cleaning it is a breeze  the recipes are fun and very tasty  it has a loud alarm to let you know when food is done or needs a flip  the user manual was extremely easy to follow for first time users  i spent less time in the kitchen cooking my meals now because i use this bad boy  also it s pretty big  definitely had to clear some counter space for it  i do recommend it to all my family and friends      
1148,2.0,                       i usually have to  press the  on  button    times before it turns on  then i just cook the food on whatever button happens to work that day  it does cook well  i make the best salmon using the  steak  setting and just run it twice  the  steak  setting seems to work the most  lol   i wouldn t buy  this one again      
1149,5.0,                       this probably unfair  but in order to say do multiple foods  say brussel sprouts and salmon for dinner     need a second unit   otherwise  we are continuing to use the air frier learning what works really well  such as vegetables  fish  french fries  etc   and what doesn t    baked potato we find that we are adding more variety to our diets since we purchased the cosori     a couple of our adult children have asked for the link to purchase one      
1150,5.0,                       i had a problem with the touch panel on my corsori air fryer relating to the wifi app connectivity   i reached out to corsori via email   they responded within a day  asked me to send them a few items like picture of unit  short video of me trying to reset via power button  and original receipt order information from amazon   they responded immediately and are mailing me a new unit   easy   very happy with the result   i love the food that this air fryer makes  absolutely recommend    love it  love the company     thank you corsori for your customer service and for standing by your product      
1151,1.0,                       unsafe product  this product has many problems and i ve seen several that have fallen apart and or were defective  i m going to give mine away  it s not worth losing your home over due to a fire or a trip to the er because you got burned from the handle falling  also  issues with the basket closing and staying shut      
1152,5.0,                       the best air fryer on the market  if you already have a pressure cooker  and a slow cooker  just buy an air fryer  it is very fast  it never heats up my kitchen  food is cooked in half the time  it is excellent for anything that you normally fry  bake  broil and grill      
1153,3.0,                       i used once a day since i bought this about two weeks ago and the screws fall out all over  i lost one when i washed it and now the pan is wobbly  too many little screws and they become loose and fall out when you wash the pan and basket it is a good airfryer  i love the way it cooks but those darn screws are awful     
1154,5.0,                       i love my cosori air fryer  the     quart basket is big enough for my family of    it s easy to use  the directions are simple and the machine itself is practically fool proof it comes with a cookbook  which has proved to be very handy       and i recommend this to all my friends who don t have an air fryer      
1155,5.0,                       this was an impulse purchase that has proved to be one of my better impulses   i love this air fryer  i use it on a daily basis and can t praise it highly enough   i use it for fresh food  never frozen  and i have to say  every day i look forward to preparing something new for dinner      
1156,5.0,                       everything we had hoped  obviously not as delicious as deep fat fryer food but holy crap is it better than using the oven  the difference is amazing and the ease of cleaning it was better than expected  and your house doesn t smell for days afterwards like a deep fryer   my only opinion is the wifi one that can connect to alexa is cool but completely unnecessary and pointless unless your using it almost everyday and need to preheat it on your way home from work  but honestly come on lol  who needs that  it preheats in minutes  the only reason for buying the wifi one would be just to flex on your friends      
1157,5.0,                       absolutely love being able to use the app to control my air fryer  i can use the buttons on the air fryer as well  but there are way more options on the app   it s easy to clean  best thing to make is bacon  super crispy and yummy as well it takes away the need to get spattered by grease  cooks way faster than using the oven so it makes veggies a breeze      
1158,4.0,                       it is a great air fryer but     the screws are always falling out  i have never had this happen with any other air fryer i ve owned so it gets to be a bit annoying to have tighten the screws before every use  we use it about twice a week  i m not sure why this happens but it is definitely a design flaw  aside from that  it cooks great      
1159,5.0,                       i purposely waited until i ve had the product past the return date and have given it good use    i purchased this in march  it s now june and one of my favorite gadgets in my kitchen  i use it approximately   days out of   and hardly ever turn my oven on because of this thing  since this was my first air fryer i shopped around and read tons of reviews prior to making this purchase  clean up is super easy and preheating literally only takes     minutes   extremely user friendly with endless recipe options  the perfect addition to any home space  apartment or college dorm you ve definitely hit the jackpot with this purchase  enjoy      
1160,5.0,                       so far so good  haven t tried to get too fancy with it yet  but all meats i ve prepared i e  chicken wings  breasts   thick  pork chops have come out perfect   moist  french fries came out a bit overcooked  but that could be my fault as i may have cut them too thin  still learning  but so far i really like it      
1161,4.0,                       i personally really love this product  i ve never used an air fryer until now and it s great  it s super easy to use and has a ton of presets  chicken  fish  steak  vegetables  etc   the air fryer also comes with a cookbook with a ton of recipes ranging from appetizers to desserts  the only negative thing i have to say about this air fryer is the weird smell it gives off during the first couple of uses  but otherwise  this thing works great  you can also spend the extra money to get the version that is compatible with the app  but i don t think that s necessary      
1162,4.0,                       very happy with this unit after a couple months  it does make a fair amount of fan noise  but it s not overly annoying dredged whitefish has been great  tater tots with just one very small shot of grapeseed oil on the basket has been phenomenal  calamari we need to tweak our time temp  but still very good i d suggest a very soft cloth and a very small shot of a cleaner like  greased lightning  or similar to cut the small film you might get on the touchpad front overall  very content with this purchase      
1163,4.0,                       love my cosori air fryer  very easy to use  clean and food comes out great   i only wish the color red burgundy was actually color shown   there is no red to it  more like burgundy or cinnamon color  my kitchen appliances are red and purchased this thinking would match  way off color  all in all besides color it is nice      
1164,5.0,                       this product is amazing   it is easy to use   you select what you are cooking and the temperature time are automatically set  but easy to adjust if needed    i hate the smell and mess associated with frying foods traditionally and this fryer has eliminated those issues   my family is happy because they still get to enjoy their favorite fried foods and i am happy because it is easy to clean and much healthier      
1165,5.0,                       this product is great  it works beautifully and is so easy to clean  i ve made fries the skinny cut is best  i reduce the time to    minutes for best results   i use the fry setting a lot to cook every thing from sandwiches to fingers and veggies  i am gluten free so i dust gf flour on meats and veggies  delicious      
1166,5.0,                       love  love  love this air fryer    it works exactly as described  easy to use   the recipes are really good  i ve had to make very slight adjustments to temps   time for some fish   smaller cuts of meat but have finally perfected the adjustments so everything turns out great  and buffalo wings      what can i say    nice   perfectly crisp   i could go on   on   love this air fryer          
1167,2.0,                       worked great for cooking if you have some experience using an airfryer  cook book has great ideas for meals but monitor the temp of the food the fryer does cook faster than most directions would indicate  my fryer unfortunate malfunctioned and does not work will be contacting customer service  i have had it a little over a month and used it     times a week depending on what we had planned for food      
1168,5.0,                       if you are on the fence about getting this don t be   it s great and and my husband wanted it   i really didn t want one  i use it almost every day from  vegetables  steak  burgers  homemade fries sweet potato and white potatoes  i have even done frozen oysters and they came better than frying them in a pan  much healthier and the easiest thing to clean   this is very unusual for me to want to write a review but i had to say how great this cosori is      
1169,3.0,                       i have very limited counter and kitchen storage space so i generally avoid extra appliances that do tasks that my basic kitchen appliances can do  but  i d heard great things about air fryers from so many people that i had to try one   well  this wasn t worth it   first  the thing is loud   both operating the touchpad and when it is cooking your food   the food coming out of it is    nothing special    my oven can do the same and i can monitor the food while it is cooking in the oven  even with the xl size  i have to do multiple  loads  of food to feed my whole family   my oven can handle all the food i need   so  yeah  i d like my      and counter space back        
1170,5.0,                       man  this has to be one of the most used items i ever purchased from amazon  i make almost everything in this air fryer if it fits  i barely use my oven anymore  this thing also reheats food like a boss  the price was great and it is really easy to use and clean  i do wish the temperature went up     instead of       example is if you want temp at     you have to choose between     and      amazing that is my only complaint lol     
1171,5.0,                       this mf right here is the mvp of air fryers  you need bacon put all your bacon in this bish  you need those french fries from mcdonald s refreshed bang bang shes gotchu  the wifi thing is kinda silly but you bet your ass i hooked this bad boy up and we cooking through wifi now baby     out of         
1172,2.0,                       when i can actually get the buttons to respond  i love how this product cooks things  unfortunately the buttons on the machine fail to respond to the point that i cannot adjust the time or temperature and have to choose the closest preset that i can get to work  this has been a problem since i bought the machine   months ago  but has gotten steadily worse to the point that even the on off button takes several minutes of pushing to get a response   i would not recommend this particular air fryer      
1173,1.0,                       product overall good for its price and does the job good  spacious also  the problem is basket some times pops out automatically and fall down  this is very dangerous when kids are around  i though this is only the problem with my unit but looks like there are many number of reviews reported this issue  not sure why this was not recalled and fixed with some solid locking mechanism      
1174,5.0,                       i got my cosori beginning of july  i used it quite a few times but there was a smell which i did not think was right  i had posted on facebook asking others if they had this problem to my surprise i was contacted by the cosori support and they sent me a new replacement and shipping label to send mine back  they emailed me when replacement was sent and after i received it to be sure everything was okay  i was pleasantly surprised with the service  i have used my new one only a couple times but very pleased with the results  think now i will really enjoy my cosori and happy with my purchase      
1175,5.0,                       convenient and healthy  i m trying to be more healthy as i get older  no more deep frying lumpia or chicken wings and easy baking salmon  the presets are also very convenient  although i would love for it to have come with rack so i can put more food in it to cook  a baking paper or foil on the bottom helps with grease and cleaning      
1176,2.0,                       some buttons don t work   not sure what to do  i can t increase the time or temp cuz the plus doesn t work  the fish or some other buttons don t work  or works after   th try  very frustrating     
1177,5.0,                       in one word   it s fantastic  it has brought a revolution in our kitchen  all fries   let it be sweet potato fingers  chicken pork chops or it s marinated small cut cube versions  reviving cold pizza slices   you name it  all done so nicely   i never thought possible without deep oil fry      
1178,1.0,                       as far as cooking goes  it s a great air fryer as far as manufacturing goes  it s not a great product  in fact it s dangerous after a few uses and being washed in the dishwasher  part the handle melted and broke off  this isn t necessarily a safety issue  but rather just terrible construction and irritating to have on the counter  today the handle became loose and i found a screw and washer in the food area  this is dangerous and negligent manufacturing  i managed to shake the bolt that accompanies the screw out also  there seems to be no way to fix them back in due to the design of the handle      
1179,1.0,                       i bought this on september           and it stop working in less than a month  when press on preheat button  it instantly beeps   times and showed  ready    but basket and the unit still cold  the fan is blowing but there is no heat emitted  i call the customer support and it said no phone support at this time it makes me have kinds of doubt that the ratings is real  i think it was some kinds of robots rating      
1180,5.0,                       it is the best thing ever  we use it for everything  reheating pastries  making french fries  heating chips  making baked weggies  etc  and everything is restaurant quality we don t use the microwave anymore we got   more for our college kids too      
1181,5.0,                       have had   philips air fryers  qvc air fryer  power oven air fryer and this     cosoriblows them all away   size  easy clean  square shape and cooking results are the best customer service is one of the best i ve ever experienced  first cosori worked greatbut would intermittently make a loud metal fan noise that could be eliminated witha gentle shake  on notifying cosori they immediately sent me a new unit that worksflawlessly  if you ve never purchased an air fryer or in the market for a replacementfor your current unit  i could not give a higher recommendation than this cosori xl  e  joseph villeneuve  florence  sc  ejvcrna me com     
1182,3.0,                       what i liked great air fryer for air frying lots of food at once  it does a good job crisping  food if you have some experience with the process  for example  to best crisp wings and not have any burning  its important to first cook them in the oven and finishing to crisp them in the air fryer what i don t like we ve had the cosori air fryer since mid june     months  and the fryer basket that pulls out broke in end of october  it looks like the basket just cracked due to head damage  now i m trying to figure out how to reach amazon to get a replacement basket  assuming they will make this process easy for me   i m not sure if anyone else has had this issue but we are regular users of our air fryer  since we bought it  we have probably used it twice a week  sometimes more   most of the uses are of serious preparations such as wings  brussels sprout etc      
1183,3.0,                       love how it makes fried food taste like fried foodi lost two screws in the dishwasher and two others i m constantly having to tighten   not sure whythe buttons are hard to press and can be frustratingthe online app is amazing and my favorite feature   would by a different brand with wifi if i could do it again      
1184,5.0,                       this product was purchased as an accessory to the kitchen and had become an item used to prepare many types of items   my wife is the cook in our household and for her to be excited about a kitchen item  it has to be a big deal  it has turned out to be the best kitchen addition we have ever made  we no longer eat fried food and this product has been a real winner  it has a large removable basket to ease of cleaning we can t more highly recommend the cosori air fryer  i also must add that when we had questions about the product the cosori customer service response was equally responsive and satisfying you will love this air fryer      
1185,5.0,                       wow  just wow  cooked vhicken breasts in    minutes  used recipe book  super crispy  i was expecting soggy   nope  surprised me i had to a double take  make entire house smell like subway  not super quiet  sounded like it was powering up to take off  but it is amazing  id buy again in heartbeat  ive only used twice so hopefully it lasts a long time  perfect for   people  i even just ordered the inner attachments as i love it so much      
1186,4.0,                       love this fryer  great size for a family of     basket is easy to clean  but now that i ve been using it for   months i ve learned it s important to clean the area of the fryer unit that s left open when you remove the basket   i never read any of that in the maintenance facts   so  be sure to clean that area of your fryer   i m working to get off some build up today only reason i didn t give a full   star rating is because sometimes the touch screen on the unit does not respond to my touch   when that happens  i just get on my phone and use the wifi feature to get my unit going   love the wifi feature  it even lets me know when my family is using the unit  when i m away from home      
1187,2.0,                       it s a shame  i read the review of people having problems with the buttons responding on the front and thought they just got bad ones  not the case     this thing cooks great if you can get the buttons to work           would be       if it actually worked like it s supposed to     
1188,5.0,                       i got this fryer on special around the holidays   i wasn t sure we would use it  but took a chance   it s been great   my wife and daughter use it daily for things like sweet potato fries  which are hard to crisp in the oven but come out much firmer in the fryer  and many other things   i recommend this device      
1189,5.0,                       it s a nice size  not too big but holds a lot  i ve made burgers quite a few times and they re great  onion rings  bacon  fries  all good   my favorite thing is heating up leftovers    kfc was delicious and crispy  the best was a leftover reuben sandwich  it tasted better heated in the air fryer the next day      
1190,5.0,                       for the price range  this has been the best buy during the black friday sale  for someone who is too lazy to cook  this has been a perfect equipment to ease that stress of cooking everyday  i love how easy it is to use with its multiple cooking presets for a variety of foods  and with the recipe book of a hundred food recipes  you will be set for quite some time  it is very easy to clean as well  only need to careful not to use any metal so as not to ruin the non stick coating  the size is large and the price is very reasonable as well  it has already booked a permanent spot on my counter top      
1191,1.0,                       heavy   difficult to use  took me several minutes to understand how to use cheap plastic button to remove basket  it s loud   big  after using my friends ninja air fryer  small  compact  easy to use  i was disappointed with lemon i purchased  instructions are confusing      
1192,5.0,                       i  bought this for my daughter for a gift   she loves it   so does her family   she uses it all the time   she likes how it saves time   and her and her husband are trying to lose weight so she can make healthy recipes in this without all the oil  she has made meat   veggies  sweet potato fries and more  it also is good for warming stuff up too because it doesn t dry food outi think im going to order one for myself now     
1193,2.0,                       just unboxed this   i still see gaps in the basket   it is not flushed with the body of the unit   this will let steam or heat escape if it isn t flushed  outer basket teflon already peeling   this was the replacement unit from amazon   fist one was defective too   sending this one back too      
1194,5.0,                       we read lots of reviews before committing to this air fryer   we really only wanted it for fresh chicken wings and it was worth every penny   a costco pack of wings needs to be cooked in   batches         minutes each  but worth every minute   i would recommend this to anyone in the market   it s really easy to use and clean  plus is lightweight for storage      
1195,4.0,                       omg loved this so much and now the basket is chipped and the screws are loose   come on i loved it and recommended it to several friends and family and the buttons work when they want     i called a number today sent me to the site cosori com that took me to a answer question site that took my info  blocked my card had to go to the bank get a new card cancel all my direct pays and all i want is a replacement fryer  why is it so hard for someone to answer and replace a product that should not fall apart in two months  i loved   love it but got a defected one and my account hacked  the phone number won t work  please send me a new one received a new one after all this and new one the basket flys out  this is the worst expensive waste ugh       
1196,5.0,                       we have owned this for   months now and we love it   this is our first one and we bought this model because it has a large capacity and a square basket so you can fit more food in easily   until a week or so ago i thought of it as a fryer  it is called and air fryer  right   well no it does so much more   i found a recipe online while looking for a different recipe   it was for yorkshire pudding   think of this as a small  versatile cook almost anything you can fit in it      
1197,5.0,                       this is our first time of using air fryer and till now it worked well we tried with the all basic stuff and few complicated too all were cooked very fast according to the time manual was explained well and was understandable to assemble the product and also few recipes which we found good  ps  very less vegetarian recipes  there was some foul smell for few days  but as using it that smell has lightened overall  we love the product and has improved as using  good to invest in this product i would like to recommend this product to everyone who wants to eat healthy and mainly who wants to save time      
1198,5.0,                       bought this after my air fryer xl dies after a few months and i discovered it had only a    day warranty  so far it has been a good product and cooks good foodthe only thing negative is could say is  i hate having to double press one button to swap between time and temperature selections   however overall i would buy again     
1199,5.0,                       my brother had one and strongly recommended it    i was hopeful  but didn t expect it to be as good as it is    my wife thought i bought another failure  until she tasted my first batch of fries    she still doubted  but then made the juiciest lemon pepper chicken     now she uses it more than me      
1200,5.0,                       i m really impressed with this product  i purchased it as a replacement for the  other  brand after it started having issues  the cosori is a fantastic little machine  its super quiet  easy to clean  and cooks wonderfully  our food comes out perfectly and its surprisingly quiet  you won t be disappointed with this at all      
1201,4.0,                       i love the fact that i can control it using my phone  i found it is easier than pressing the buttons from the air fryer because they don t respond as quickly as i wish to  and the cooking is great the fries are delicious and it s easy to clean  i don t like the screen because of the buttons and if i clean it i see some weird lines on the screen not sure why  but overall it s great     
1202,5.0,                       absolutely love this item  easy to operate and clean  programs are cool features and wifi makes it easy to program  loving it throughout this heat wave we re having here now  i can prepare meals easily without standing over hot stove or oven  i can cook  roast  and bake in this air fryer  way to go cosari   i bought one for my two sons and their families as well as one for my college age daughter living in the dorm yay me  lol     
1203,4.0,                       i ve had the air fryer for about a month now and with one exception have been very happy with the purchase  it s a nice improvement over the t fal air fryer i had been using  the feature that i like most over the t fal is the   piece square basket design over the t fal s single piece round basket  ironically the basket is also my single disappointment with the product  i cooked up some frozen chicken the other day and was surprised when i found a screw and washer in with my food  on examining the basket i found that one of the screws that hold the handle in place was missing and the other two were very loose  a simple fix to tighten them back up again but a bit disappointing all the same      
1204,1.0,                       i wouldn t know how this works because the whole thing is defective  after trying to connect it via wifi and finding out the app is garbage and that won t work i tried to use it manually and come to find out the display is defective and most of the buttons don t work  waste of time and money and now i have to make a stop at the ups store to return      
1205,5.0,                       wow   this thing has been amazing  my first air fryer and i love it  easy to use buttons on the front and big enough basket to hold half bag of fries at a time  get an    round baking pan it helps with easy omelets in   mins  also great for heating certain foods which taste so much better than using a microwave      
1206,1.0,                       doesnt work straight out of the box  touch screen completely unresponsive  customer support had me on hold for    minutes  told me two people were ahead of me  eventually told me i was next  then said noone was available to help me and to leave a message      
1207,5.0,                       it was a gift for my brother  which he loves   i have one of my own  they work well  this is my second one   the first one quit working about a year after purchase  i contacted customer service and sent me a new one  you can t beat that  that was the main reason for my purchase for my brother  good customer service and they stood behind there product  that s all most unheard of these days      
1208,4.0,                       works pretty good  you will need to adjust times  so check on food while cooking  does a great job on bacon  and baking biscuits  best grilled cheese ever  but  it s large  wish i had bought the one that folds up out of the way  but my kitchen space is lacking  so if you have room  get it     
1209,5.0,                       this was a christmas gift and it is so easy to use and so easy to clean  the times to cook are off on the recipes but the seasonings are great when used as if you were going to cook in the oven or fryer   foods are crispy outside and juice inside   love mine      
1210,5.0,                       nice fryer  only had it for a week  works great so far  good recipes included in a booklet i fix the best pre buttered english muffins cut into half and butter before cooking   use only the warm up option at     degrees for   minutes  they end up perfect and lightly crisp      
1211,3.0,                       i really enjoy an air fryer and feel like i m more creative with my meals because of it  however i m very disappointed that i spent so much on a product and the manual controls don t work well  it works well with app but not well without it  i will be contacting manufacturer      
1212,2.0,                       this is our first  air fryer   initially it seemed good  the release button made me weary from my he second i touched it  it s the very hard  clear plastic piece  which is supposed to slide and be pushed in  the overall cooking and cooking selections are good  however  we ve owned it for about   months  using it a few times a week and the screws and washers holding the cooking surface and drainage area have came apart  i found most of the pieces and put it back together   conclusion  it s cheaply made  looks great but falls apart after    or so uses        
1213,1.0,                       wow  what a bummer  the buttons only worked intermittently before going out completely after the very first use   we just got this and were able to cook one thing in it  which cooked great  but the touch screen buttons were barely working  it was a miracle we got it to cook that one and only time   so so disappointed  going to return     
1214,5.0,                       we absolutely love this air fryer   it is everything that was promised in the features   we would definitely recommend this to any one   love the way the food is crisp on the outside and tender on the inside  and so glad that we don t have to deep fat fry anymore      
1215,5.0,                       i ordered the smaller version first and quickly found how so many foods are cooked perfectly in the air fryer  so i ended up ordering this larger version for my kitchen  so useful  i use it daily  easy to clean  easy to learn to use  quiet motor and makes frying foods healthier with no mess  i love it      
1216,5.0,                       i love my cosori air fryer  it is easy to use and clean and the taste of the food comes out delicious  i was able to enjoy my cosori  air fryer twice before something happened where i could not get the inner pan to lock in place  i could not figure out why because  everything looked exactly the same  i contacted cosori customer service  and a representative assisted and looked into the issue for me  he was very nice and gave me superb customer service  i sent him photos  to better explain the issue  cosori  cares about their customers and goes above and beyond to help them on top of their amazing product  thank you cosori      
1217,5.0,                       this is my first cosori product purchase  i am very happy with my decision  recipe book thay comes with it is amazing too  have tried a few recipes from it already  bakery items come out really well  fried items become a little dry with a little resting time  but i guess this probably is because of little to no oil usage overall i am really happy with my cosori     qt  air fryer     
1218,5.0,                       i received my cosori air fryer tuesday and was going to save it for christmas but just couldn t wait to try it  it not only came with easy to follow instructions on how to use the air fryer  it also came with an awesome cookbook with several different delicious recipes  i decided to try making chicken legs in my fryer  they were simple to make and i was really surprised how nice and crunchy the outside was and still moist and tender on the inside   the clean up was also a breeze  cleans up real easy with soap and water   i hope it lasts a long time    i ll have to update you on the longevity of this particular fryer i strongly recommend this product      
1219,1.0,                       do not buy this unless you like cleaning  we exchanged first one because something was loose inside rattling noise  the replacement was worse  although it didn t rattle  the basket does not properly fit  a few times it shot out of the air fryer throwing food everywhere  lol  not kidding  it leaks out the bottom  also the basket doesn t clip correctly to the bottom part  so when you remove it from the airfryer it falls apart  spills everywhere  our return window has closed  so we are going to throw it away  ps  the heating part works great     lol     
1220,5.0,                       i can t begin to say enough about this air fryer i need and upgrade and i got this one not only cause it i love this brand cosori has some of the best kitchen  appliances i ve ever gotten in this air fryer is by far the best not only does it cook faster but cleaning it is a breeze not like your other ones the you have to soak it and it s never really fully clean doesn t take a lot of counter space it s not loud about the same noise as having a  air conditioner onmy only complaint would be is that when you put the  drawer back in you have to push it to make sure it in there it doesn t bother me as much but just a not it s not broken it s just amazing     
1221,5.0,                       love the square basket  it holds a lot of food  glad i got the larger size  works great  very easy to use and clean  would definitely buy again   bought the red color and its a darker matte red  looks really nice  have made so many delicious meals in it      
1222,5.0,                       i absolutely love this air fryer    i decided to pull the trigger and purchase this after seeing it in deal of the day and i am so happy i did  it s super easy to use  the food comes out so moist and delicious   i use it almost everyday  definitely worth every penny  i cook almost everything in it my favorite is chicken and veggies  dont wait any longer and buy this machine  you will not regret it      
1223,1.0,                       it worked great  but the plastic handle broke off after    months   it is designed to only start with the handle in place so we have to buy another   they all look like they have plastic handles   will now stir contents and not shake as is suggested by manufacturer      
1224,5.0,                       very impressed with this air fryer  i owned a few and even though the others had a larger capacity with horizontal cooking grates  this uses a basket which is removable and allowes you to separate from the plastic housing for cleaning  but also for draining extra fluids that have accumulated  frozen foods  etc  easy startup guide was actually easy  and the touch screen is responsive  didnt have to double tap anything   so far i have cooked wings in it and it does a great job  i used some spray cooking oil for a little crisp and it did exactly that  i gave it   stars for everything because it really does perform  very happy with the purchase      
1225,5.0,                       this air fryer is awesome  works so well and is a great size  all of the features it has are awesome and the recipe book it comes with is great  biggest perk is that you can put the parts in the dishwasher  well worth the price  we had a phillips before this one that was more expensive and not as good quality      
1226,5.0,                       because there are only two of us at home  i purchased the smaller     quart cosori air fryer   i thought it would be easier to store   it is very easy to use and cleans up beautifully   we took it to our vacation home  and used it there   then decided we needed to buy the     quart one for home  and leave the     quart on at our vacation home   we cooked a whole chicken in the big one and decided it was better than any cooked chicken you buy at the store   we are glad we got the     quart one for home  even for the just two of us   and it is just as easy to store  and clean      
1227,5.0,                       i was in the market for months trying to find the best one  i ve used a couple of friends and had something specific in mind  wanted it big enough i didn t have to make multiple batches  went for the     quart and i m impressed  if i can t cook in it i really don t cook turkey burgers  chicken setting for    min  flip once  so nice didn t have to sit and wait at the hot stove and have juices splatter everywhere chicken breast  chicken setting for    min  flip once  so juicy and soft i cook a lot of my frozen veggies in here reheated a cheesesteak and it was soooo crunchy on the outside tbh better than when i first bought it my roommate made skinny taste bagels in here so perfectly  clean up is super easy just   things to clean really  i couldn t be happier  def recommend      
1228,5.0,                       this air fryer works great   anything i ve cooked in it has come out outstanding   any type of chicken i ve cooked has been amazing   chicken breasts are very tender and there s no need to cut into thin slices   thighs and drumsticks are better than a restaurant and the best part   no deep frying in oil   just a little dab of olive oil spray and that s all it takes for a great crunch   my salmon has come out delicious   it may take less time than it calls for in the cook book   i pretty much set my own temperatures and time limit   the only thing i can say that i disliked about it was it smelled a little like plastic for the first couple of uses but went away thereafter   i like the fact that it is pfoa free   bpa free and the size is perfect for my counter space   i ve seen some of the comments with a less rating but i have not had any issues with it   it has worked pretty good for me   i would recommend this product      
1229,3.0,                       bought this as a gift for my daughter  it was nice  but the basket kept popping out while she was using it  the company itself did send her a new one  but it does the same thing  she would love it if this didn t happen periodically with the basket  company even told her to keep the older one      
1230,5.0,                       i love my air fryer  it s so sleek and looks good on my counter  my food comes out perfect with the settings for the most part  sometimes i have to do some adjusting but once i tweak it to the right temperature and time  so yummmmmy  and it s such a healthier option than frying  i use about a tsp tbsp of oil  depending on what i m cooking  one of my best buy s to date      
1231,5.0,                       update  after the first review and me contacting them  they have sent me a new airfryer and omg it works so easy and it is great  love it  the main issue i have with this product is my buttons have never worked correctly  when i push the buttons they may work or may not  most of the time i just have to use the preset buttons because i can not get the temp button to change the temperature or even the time button to change the time      
1232,2.0,                       this is very bad that the touch panel is not working well  we are waitting for about     weeks and finally get our air fryer delivered  but the touch panel is totally not working excepted on off button  we just tired about waiting for another   weeks to get an replacement so better return it and get one from local store      
1233,5.0,                       this product has been amazing and a great addition to my kitchen  extremely easy to use and so nice to not to have to stand over a skillet while cooking   i just pop the food in there and do something else until it s done  clean up and easy and it comes with a recipe book  the customer service was amazing after i somehow lost the screws that attach the inside basket        recommend      
1234,5.0,                       i purchased this item because i lost my spouse and did not want to spend a lot of time preparing meals and cleaning up afterwards  the ease of use and time to prepare meals is easy and the clean up afterwards is great  i used to eat a lot of grilled foods on a vented cook top so the flavor is not quite the same  however the health benefits are great as i have lost weight from eliminating the fats  and butters  i am still experimenting with new items and times with good results  start at a known temp for an item and play with times  i start with short times and work up from there until i determine my desired level of being done  works great for frozen meats in case you forgot to take them out of the freezer      
1235,5.0,                       this air fryer is amazing  you don t even need oil to make something really crunchy  i love using this for making quesadillas   tip  if you make a quesadilla sandwich make sure you stick the top tortilla to the cheese and inside toppings  or else the tortilla will be sucked up to the top of the air fryer and it will burn      
1236,1.0,                       first   would not have purchased this product had i known more about it   seems to overcook items such as chicken wings and vegetables if you go by the presets or recommended settings  second  there isn t a feasible way to determine if raw items such as chicken or fish will be actually cooked through   in an oven  you can bake a chicken for       hours and you know it will be cooked through   also we tried to call  cosori company well into their posted hours and were advised the company was closed   we left a message and it took them a week to respond  also  the digital touch screen is very temperamental   touching directly  didn t really turn it on   i had to almost wave my finger gently across the blue light for it to respond   it took several attempts to turn the unit on      
1237,5.0,                       why did i wait so long to purchase an air fryer   don t hesitate a minute to purchase this   it is very easy to use and takes up only a small portion of my countertop   it has a large basket and can hold a large amount of food   i have used this to make fajitas  wings  sausage and peppers  pork chops  etc   it is great to use in the summer   it doesn t heat up the house like my oven does  it is very easy to clean as well   well worth the price      
1238,1.0,                       followed all he directions and took care of it very well     used about   x over   months     just stopped working     no product support     
1239,5.0,                       i can t really give an honest opinion as i do not cook  however  my husband  who makes a meal every single night with a rare occasion of takeout once every two months  seems thrilled  he uses it about once a week and everything tastes delicious  also the little cookbook meal suggestion ideas that came included has been a great guide  i may not know my way around the kitchen but i know what to buy for a husband that does        
1240,5.0,                       i was hesitant to purchase an air fryer because i love to cook and i just couldn t imagine food being that good  that fast   i was wrong   my first time using it  i put chicken drumsticks in it  with fresh lemon juice  himalayan sea salt  cracked black pepper  garlic powder and herbs de provence  and a little olive oil   the chicken was not only crunchy on the outside but juicy on the inside   i love this cooker   this morning i threw in some fresh broccoli and roasted it   it was so good   i just love it  i will be using this a lot      
1241,5.0,                       delivery and receipt of products are very punctual   after several weeks of continuous use  the product performs well   it feels so easy to use   i didn t know how to cook  but now i can make a lot of delicious dishes with this air fryer   and easy to clean   easy to use   highly recommended         
1242,5.0,                       great company customer service  the fryer i ordered was defective  steam would condense inside the led panel after one use and the buttons would not work until it dried out   i contacted the company and they were excellent about sending me a new fryer  the new one works fine and produces awesome wings   the basket is large and cleanup is exceptionally easy      
1243,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          we purchased this item and did not keep the box  the drawer portion of the air fryer pops out on it s own randomly and smoke seeps out from the cracks  it turns off on its own as well and the product is clearly defective  very frustrated because i cannot return it because i don t have the original packaging      
1244,5.0,                       update to previous review   my fryer did not quit working  i had a breaker issue   still love my fryer and would recommend it   would buy again      
1245,5.0,                       did some research and cosori came out on top in large part because of capacity      qt   square shaped basket  ease of clean up  only two pieces involved go straight into dishwasher   and there were a lot of youtube reviews  two year warranty  company really stands behind its product  amazon had the best price  sometimes they have coupons you can attach to it  if you buy the older model  that knocks a few more dollars off it  i ve been using it for a couple of weeks  i love using it and the family loves the food coming out of it      
1246,5.0,                       soooo easy to use   i haven t eaten at a fast food restaurant since i bought this          really great with meats  i still cook vegetables on the stove and a few other things my favorite is going from a frozen burger to a hamburger in   minutes      
1247,5.0,                       i ve cooked turkey bacon  regular bacon  battered fish and a few other things in this so far and so far its great  i tried to make pizza using tortilla wraps instead of dough and that s where i had problems  i think the air lifted the tortilla up to the burner and caused it to burn  so don t cook anything too light in it lol      
1248,1.0,                       the lower portion of this device appears prone to breaking  the first unit arrived in pieces and the bottom never made it out of the box  the second one  has a crack about    long on the bottom and seems like there is a serious lack of quality control   design flaw that makes it prone to breaking  buy something else  don t waste your time here      
1249,5.0,                       i can t say enough good about getting an air fryer  i just wish i had gotten one a long time ago  the food is fantastic  cleanup is easy  the fat calories are lower  what more can you ask for we decided to cook marinated salmon fillets and now we ve had them   sundays in a row because they are so dang good  a little trick is to use parchment paper and then clean up is a breeze      
1250,5.0,                       it takes a little time to convert over recipes and getting familiar with new cooking times  but the variety of foods to make are endless  i have a convection large oven so i can combine it with the air fryer for combinations of foods  i love my cosori  you tube is a good resource john d     
1251,5.0,                       i seen this product used on youtube  couldn t believe how perfect the food came out   i had to rush to purchase on off her link in description box   i finally used it today and i m amazed how simple it was to use  the crispness of the wings       
1252,5.0,                       i bought this one as a replacement to one i had for   years and used militiamen s times a week i love the size for my family  easy to clean and easy to use  today was my first time using this one and the baked potato cake out perfect  soft and fluffy inside with a crispy skin      
1253,5.0,                       the fryer is simple to use and the cookbook provided excellent guidance and recipes  the wifi connected feature is nice too      
1254,4.0,                       i find that this fryer is very easy to clean and with care will remain so  it does just what it is designed to do  i think i had unrealistic exceptions for an air fryer  they are not going to be as versatile as a deep fat fryer so be realistic about that  that said  i believe this cosori fryer is as good and any of the air fryers out there      
1255,5.0,                       ok absolutely love my air fryer   one small thing it s hard to get the baskets and attached from one another it s sort of sticks but it seems to be loosening up a bit   this is after you cook and you want to clean it makes the bomb pork chops the best roasted potatoes chopped up rosemary potatoes  a baked potato is delicious   the best chicken wings you ve ever eaten   i also made crab cakes in it it is sort of large i keep mine on the floor out of the way and i just put it on the counter and it cooks up everything super easy and ready to go and you can find a lot of air fryer recipes on pinterest      
1256,1.0,                       ran the air fryer for   minutes and had to turn it off because of an awful chemical smell  i can t believe this item is listed in the amazon s choice  how disappointing      
1257,4.0,                       i have owned multiple air fryers  this one is really easy to clean  gets hot quickly and is durable   i would recommend to a friend   the preset settings are a little off but you can just as easily turn it to whatever temp time you need   would prefer if the buttons were a little easier to use      
1258,5.0,                       very impressed with this air fryer  works very well  cooks fast  the buttons for ea item are accurate preset buttons work well and cook things perfectly  large basket holds plenty of food  shake reminder tells you when to move food around  i was hesitant to buy another gimmicky sm appliance  already have several unused things in the cabinet we use this alot  cooks anything      
1259,5.0,                       my air fryer has been the answer to my prayers  i m not the best cook  and out of our family of    i am the only female  boys eat a ton  and they can eat stuff that if i even smell  i gain weight  ugh  i am also still trying to get in shape after our last baby  he s a year    this makes cooking healthy so easy  i have our   year old happily eating kale chips   like whose kid is this    the sweet potato fries are insanely good  it s amazing  buy one  buy this one  the fryer basket is big enough to fit an entire chicken in and it is so easy to clean  you ll thank me later      
1260,5.0,                       very pleased with this unit  my daughter purchased one   recommended  so we tried it and were very pleased   pork chops  chicken  tuna patties  french fries and breaded mushrooms are a few items we ve had good results with   my thought is the unit is cleaner  healthier  faster and produces better tasting food than the old stovetop method      
1261,1.0,                       purchased for family used   times and no longer turns on   the touch screen seems to be a big problem   either too sensitive or not sensitive enough i guess   was extremely disappointed was unable to use after only   uses   will explore other brands not touchscreen   never connected to my wifi either  just kept sayin connection failed and i have the highest speed internet and a wifi booster      
1262,2.0,                       we like the actual cooking process of this air fryer  it does a great job there and the recipe book is helpful   however the touch controls do a very poor job   if you do not mind it taking several frustrating tries  repeatedly pressing the controls to set up the cooking program  then it does a good job once the program starts   in an age where touch controls are on practically everything  this air fryer really disappointed us   i would not recommend this brand for this reason      
1263,3.0,                       i really bought this thinking that i would get something beyond what my oven can do  especially with fries  i love to make fries  and i read that this could get me closer to crispiness that i had been missing with my oven  that turned out to be false  that said  it is a good oven  it is efficient as an oven  but it is just an oven  it should be sold as an oven because that is how it works  do not expect to get something more than that  if you are looking for a counter top oven because you do not want a microwave  then get this      
1264,5.0,                       finally purchased my cosori air fryer on prime day and i m very pleased first thing made was grilled cheese sandwich   came out perfect and crispy never knew i could have a grill cheese that good   it s light weight and does not take up much kitchen space   recipe book comes with     recipes and looks good and easy to fix   i m looking forward to making many more great dishes with this air fryer      
1265,5.0,                       i cooked ribs and cornish hens in my air fryer  i love that i researched air fryers and purchased this brand  it has a high temperature of      degrees  the basket it large enough fry a meal for a small family and cleaning after each use is easy it cooks everything  i adjust the longer cook time to my taste  everything has tasted excellent i don t like the push button release for the basket  my thumb nail is long      
1266,5.0,                       this makes frying food so much easier  i keep recommending this to others  we don t really use the oven much in my household and we are using this as a replacement for microwave and oven  my store bought takoyaki  and other premade fried food  finally taste crispy on the outside and mushy on the inside       
1267,1.0,                       not sure if it was only me but from day one it s just turns off  within minutes of using it   sometimes it goes for    mins without a problem  i would not buy this again      
1268,4.0,                       i love my air fryer and it is now used significantly more than my toaster oven   it is my go to appliance in the kitchen from tortilla chips to veges   i gave it four stars because the screw in the basket fell out after a couple months   this happened to the fryer purchased for my son  too   with that said  cosori customer support is exceptionally good   it was very easy to communicate with customer service at cosori  they were more than happy to make things right  and i will buy from them again   i highly recommend them      
1269,3.0,                       so far    so good   we probably did not need the multiple buttons with programmed cooking times   after using it several times  we can program it ourselves   basket and tray are easy to clean   basket size is large enough to accommodate almost all dishes      
1270,5.0,                       got this on a recent run of the treasure truck near my location  a very good price  there is a learning curve as you try different foods but so far  love the many features  tater tots and fries finally come out the way we love them with just the right amount of crunch and no grease   quick preheat which is great and very easy to clean      
1271,5.0,                       perfect air fryer for my needs  made great steak and fried steak today  first use   and the ability to control it from my phone  vie vesync app  is even better  for the price point  and the capability  this is a great deal  i just need to learn how to better prepare  with recipes made for air frying  items and utilize the benefits of less  if any  oil       
1272,5.0,                       bought this as a gift for my friends birthday and she absolutely love it  we experimented with ribs and they were delicious  can t wait to test out more recipes update  rotisserie chicken in the air fryer  we made ranch wings the day before yesterday  but i forgot to take pictures      
1273,4.0,                       i love rhe size of the basket  the food comes out great  sometimes i add   more min on     to really crisp  frozen fries better then homemade in this  only con is cleaning the basket  the air vents are very hard to clean  i need to buy a small brush or something to get in those vents  vinegar added to soapy water works best  i use it every day for something  great buy      
1274,5.0,                       i m glad i didn t base my decision off of the reviews  because i would have missed out on those fabulous air fryer  i would definitely recommend this to anyone  oh  i also got the echo dot and contacting it to the air fryer was very easy    setting it up via bluetooth was very easy  once i installed the app it was smooth sailing   i used my tablet to select my menus and always used the preheat    my meal came out perfect  the roasted eggplant wasn t over done nor did it over cook my salmon    clean up was very easy since i purchased the liners  which minimize contact with the basket       
1275,5.0,                       it s very easy to use  and the oil used to cook is much less than the traditional fried food  the cooking time is also reduced a lot  food flavor is good too  we tried chicken  fish and tofu  love it  forgot to mention one thing  it won t generate the deep fried food s heavy smell      
1276,5.0,                       this thing is much larger  and heavier  than i anticipated  it  is  freaking  beautiful  i ve  had to change my diet as of late and this air fryer is my godsend  i think i m going to get on for my mom and sisters  they definitely need one of these      
1277,5.0,                       i ve been thinking about purchasing an air fryer for quite some time now  but was hesitant because i thought it might be something i wouldn t use much  finally made the purchase and happy that i did  foods come out crispy and good tasting and it s a very easy clean up      
1278,5.0,                       this is a great addition for the kitchen   the only negative is that with a family of    i sometimes have to do multiple batches while keeping cooked food warm   this is perfect for a family of     people   my favorite part is i can get my frozen french fries crispy without the oil and quicker than in the oven or fryer   it does take some trial and error on cooking times and temp   until you know for sure  it is best to stay close and keep opening and checking and depending on what you are cooking  shaking   highly recommend this product      
1279,2.0,                       i am a personal trainer got this on         and use it regularly to cook nutritious meals   i loved it initially and today the handle fell right off   it looks like the heat melted away the plastic   i was raving about it to everyone   told of my clients to buy one   today however  as i was actually showing and demonstrating to clients how i use it to cook healthy options and it literally fell apart as i picked it up to show them how easy it was to clean it   it was kind of comical though   i am wondering if it was possibly a defect that made the handle melt off      
1280,1.0,                       keeps popping open     
1281,5.0,                       i ve had this air fryer for a while now as it was a christmas gift  after a lot of use the handle became brittle and broke off due to i m guessing heat  i reached out to customer service and they are sending a new basket with handle to me      
1282,5.0,                       this is my first air fryer   once you get one you won t go back   cuts cooking time by     to     compared to oven  grill  or stove and cooks very consistently   to give you an idea on what you can do  i cooked five frozen biscuits in less than    minutes with no preheat to a perfect golden brown  straight out of the freezer   my convection over can t even do as well   this fryer is working spectacularly   definitely a recommend   just keep in mind  you will need to drop your temperatures on almost everything you cook because this provides a very concentrated heat   it takes a bit but it s easy to figure out temps and times in order to achieve perfection      
1283,5.0,                       this machine eliminates multiple pans and fryers  i went for a large air fryer and i am very happy with the amount of wings it can cook  so far our favorite food out of this is cumin tumeric cauliflower  amazing one thing i would watch  the time to cook items is overstated  found times off by about   minutes or more  so pause and check until you get it      
1284,5.0,                       when i bought  another appliance to take up space   my husband s words  not mine   i thought i would use it a couple of times a month   see the pics of the food i ve made     yeah  i use this bad boy every day   sometimes multiple times a day   my husband has been converted and has dubbed my cosori  the magic box    when he hears it preheating  he comes running to see what i m cooking   buy this   you will not regret it   i mean  seriously  look at the pics of my delicious food   salmon    best salmon i ve ever had made eaten   nuggets   those bad boys are coated in pork panko to make them keto   omg  to die for   jalapeno poppers   oh yeah   steak   in an air fryer   yessssir   do not hesitate   buy it   then come back here and thank me      
1285,5.0,                       didn t take long to become comfortable with the air frying times  i use it weekly and am happy with the taste  consistency and quickness of preparation  my daughter liked it too  so i bought her one for christmas  just too bad they don t make it with a bigger basket so i could cook a larger quantity rather than having to do it in multiple steps      
1286,3.0,                       loving the convenience  easy to use  cooks evenly  watch for rust  only had this a month and the basket is already rusting at the seam  rust stains weeping from the seam       
1287,1.0,                       i liked this  but after a year and a half  the handle broke off as i lifted the hot basket out and the basket and food fell onto the floor  dangerous  and also expensive if it doesn t last longer  i m going to look for a different one      
1288,5.0,                       i did a lot of research on these fryers  my previous one lasted   year  it had a whopping    day warranty  this cosori comes with  a   year warranty  but they will add an additional year if you register your fryer with them online  easy process  it is also made in the usa in anaheim california  my wife loves it      
1289,4.0,                       have used many times bacon  chicken  fries  steak and many other things  had problem with basket popping out on finishing cooking  it flew completely out once but by being more forceful on putting back in   seems to be working so far  looking forward to more cooking adventures in the future      
1290,5.0,                       i must say cosori is a great company   i had a cosori     qt  fryer that after   months will shut off by itself and would not turn on until it got cool   i call them and they replace it with a new one immediately   they back up there products and warranty   i am very happy   i will always buy cosori products   thank you very much for your excellent customer service      
1291,5.0,                       beginner cookers  healthy eaters  easiest and cleanest way to cook  the food making process was fast  easy to clean  little noise  no smell extra cooking book was helpful for the food choice and the preparing  i bought the white one  it looks timeless it was a great gift for my college kid      
1292,3.0,                       we love to cook food in the air fryer   our favorite treat is donuts made out of grands biscuit dough   our only complaint is that the basket keeps coming apart   we have put the screws back in several times  but it still keeps coming apart      
1293,1.0,                       neaver buy this i send to my sister as gift and it blast and fire with smoke inside when plugin so terrible             i send gift to my sister after   year for first time and it was worst my heart really broke down   amazon refund me but it i am so sameful infront of my sister     
1294,5.0,                       i m never using my oven again     air fryer is the way to go    cooking has never been so easy      less dishes  less stress makes this girl very happy     highly recommend for kids  college students  single people  elderly   mom s on the go    i have two boys         they make their own fair food with the air fryer      corn dogs  french fries  chicken strips  waffle fries  poppers  tornados  mozzarella sticks  etc     this is probably my best amazon purchase yet and i buy daily    i also never write reviews soooo        buy the air fryer  you will love it  i promise         
1295,5.0,                       i love this air fryer  i have tried pork chops  chicken  brats  burger and baked potatoes  everything turned out delicious  i have the mid size  which is great for two people      
1296,5.0,                       so convenient to use  i find myself using this air fryer everyday  you really can cook anything in it  makes great salmon and bakes sweet potatoes just like the oven  i bought a small set of pans to use and also use them everyday  clean up is a breeze  a little soap and water or the dishwasher      
1297,3.0,                       the flavor doesn t taste as great as cooking it in the oven or stovetop  it has a weird after taste  i can t describe the taste but it s there after every meal  total yuck       
1298,5.0,                       item arrived well packed and protected easy set up   followed initial cleaning and test run instructions and no issue with any unusual odors while cooking first test dinner was a siracha cauliflower nuggets   reheated   a good test as it can often come out somewhat soggy out of the oven   they browned up nicely in the air fryer and had lovely crisp edges a great start   looking forward to trying out more recipes      
1299,5.0,                       i wish i had bought this sooner   it s great  my granddaughter loves chicken nuggets  i have always put them in the microwave  they come out gummy  i made them in the af and they were crispy and juicy    i also made grilled cheese sandwich and it was also great       
1300,2.0,                       the manual buttons never worked when it arrived and still don t work almost a year later  we have hardly used it  glad i just looked through my manual as i just realized i can have it replaced under a one year warranty that i didn t know i had  i still do not recommend  i will most likely sell the new one that i receive      
1301,5.0,                       it is so easy to use and it is amazing we love it fries and especially tator tots come out amazing even better than oven and baked potatoes are to die for and i cant say enough about this product chicken comes out moist inside and crisp outside    pork chops are delicious cant wait to try more stuff yea     
1302,5.0,                       i love the convenience of this air fryer   i preferred the digital version because it is easy to wipe down   it is so easy to use and very little clean up   my first experience was making my own sweet potato fries  just a light spray of olive oil and they turned out perfect   i have done chicken breasts  and frozen steak fries too      
1303,5.0,                       i wanted an air fryer for the longest   then i saw that this works with amazon alexa and google     man oh man    i have a fully automated smart house and this fit right in    love the alexa integration    easy to use    and i love the recipes it comes with     yummy     
1304,5.0,                       the first time i was so nervous because i would be failed lol  i was surprised that it was a super easier and simple  i did try to put my salmon  omg it was a champion tasting  i was glad i did the right choice this product  i already have recommended my sister that she should get this one for her  she did taste my salmon and she was surprised  she would definitely purchase it soon      
1305,5.0,                       love it  we bought this air fryer because we don t have an oven in our studio  the first thing we made was a cake and it came out amazing  the second thing we tried was chicken nuggets and french fries    they came out great   i was very skeptical at first but so far so good  i recommend looking over the instructions on how to prepare certain foods and trying that first  if not cooked fully or not at the desired  crunch   add some more time or crank up the temp a bit  overall very happy with my buy      
1306,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this is now my second air fryer in a week  from cosori that the buttons just doesn t work  if you press hard or soft some of them just don t wanna do anything  do they at least test them before shipping  doubt it  it probably sits in inventory for weeks and months without being tested  i m going to try one more time just one more and if this one don t work i ll have to buy from someone else  sending back again update  seems like the air fryer was made during a bad batch number  if your buttons don t work consult with cosori themselves to get a working air fryer      
1307,2.0,                       we love the concept of this air fryer and it works well but   here s the big but   this machine continues to smell horrible  it has a very plasticky smell and even the food taste like plastic  we have washed it and used it several times and it is not dissipating with time july      i told my husband tonight i won t eat another thing cooked in this thing  everything we ve cooked in it has a plastic taste  he says he s okay with it  i m not  the who e upstairs of our house reeks when it s on      
1308,5.0,                       i have not turned on my oven since i ve bought this air fryer  it s so easy and keeps things healthy  i have been air frying apple slices with a little cinnamon every night for dessert  i ve made pizza  seafood  fries  mozzarella sticks  chicken  even fried some oreos  it s amazing      
1309,5.0,                       it s absolutely amazing  the basket has so much room and there s no awkward trying to puzzle piece everything in there  super easy interface  my only complaint is the inner basket gets a greasy build up between the angled slats and it s super hard to get rid of  the rest of the basket in easy to clean      
1310,1.0,                       purchased almost close to      early this year and its base material inside is rotten not easy to clean   put in dishwasher buyers beware       
1311,5.0,                       this provides more even and crispier cooking than the phillips at a much higher price  it is very quiet when running  cleaning is a complete snap  the outside stays cool and even the exhaust isn t all that warm  temperatures seem accurate  the slight rubbery smell went completely away after we ran it empty a few times at      adjusting time and temperature are easy once you get used to the order of pushing the buttons  one thing we don t mind but worth mentioning is that the three screws that hold the handle onto the basket loosen and need tightening about once a month  if they get too loose the drawer gets difficult to insert  if yours gets difficult to latch  check this as the likely cause  other than that  reliability is great   we ve used it most days for going on six months  no problems      
1312,2.0,                       cleaning it is a bit hard   but the main problem i have with it is the screws keep coming loose and then i have to put it back together  in this picture you can see one of the screws is missing  fell down the drain while washing   wish it was a bit more sturdy  food turns out great every time      
1313,5.0,                       this thing is amazing   it arrived today and i made the hamburger patties from the enclosed cookbook   i figured it would be just ok but boy was i wrong  it was delicious      the air fryer is easy to use  instructions are simple and it s very easy to clean   i ve never used an air fryer before so i wasn t sure what to expect  it was much easier than i thought  and the food was delish   i m sure i will be using this a lot  especially this summer since it doesn t heat up the house      
1314,5.0,                       had ordered and received the consori air fryer   weeks before using it  surprised to find that upon plugging it in  it would not turn on  things happen so wasn t overly concerned just frustrated  the main issue for me in these situations is what will the company do to rectify the issue  after calling their customer service department and proving the purchase  i was shipped via fedex a no charge replacement which works perfectly  great product support and the company representative was very polite and easy to work with      
1315,1.0,                       extremely faulty product  only lasted   months      
1316,5.0,                       this is hands down the best purchase i have made    there were so many air fryer options on the market and it was a little overwhelming to decide but so glad we chose this one  the basket is large enough to cook a whole meal for my family of   without cooking multiple batches  it s super easy to operate and the clean up is a breeze our favorite thing to make in the air fryer so far is chicken wings  they are perfect every time  super crispy and flavorful  i am completely happy with this product      
1317,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          hi we just got out new cosori air fryer  but it seems that the control panel isn t working correctly  most of the buttons in the middle area won t work  no matter how hard we push  including the   and   symbols it is very dissappointing  we were eager to use it we would like to return it      
1318,5.0,                       i had been hearing about airfryers for a while and wasn t sure what the hype was until i made this purchase   i use this machine multiple times a week   it s not just for wings but let me tell you it makes the best wings ever   all the food i make is perfecting cooked  crispy and brown  the machine is so easy to use instead of heating up my large oven   the basket is so easy to clean and nothing sticks   i highly recommend this product      
1319,5.0,                       works great   we love it   great tasting food love the preheat setting   this one also remembers the time left after you pause it to turn food or shake it   a lot of other machines don t have these features i make chicken thighs and wings with the garlic parmesan wings coating recipe and my husband says it s the best fried chicken he s ever ate  this coming from man who really didn t like fried chicken very much before all i can say is cosori makes high end products for a lot less money i also have their blender which is replica of a vitamix  for a lot less money   great products   highly recommend       
1320,5.0,                       i have had this for about a month and oh boy what a ride has it been  my girlfriend and i cant stop using this infact it made our george foreman grill and our oven almost unnecessary  everything you cook like sandwhiches  meat  chicken breasts  the best tasting juicy   veggies   etc all come out tasting amazing without having to add oil or anything  this doesnt dry out your food like the microwave or the foreman grill or make it come out  soggy  from baking it in the oven  dont think about it and just buy it you will not be sorry      
1321,5.0,                       bought this for my husband for his bday this month  he absolutely loves it  comes with a cook book  and can t go in the kitchen without looking at it  we cooked bacon so far and it was perfect  he is the cook  so i know this will turn into our new oven  best money i ever spent      
1322,1.0,                       i purchased this air fryer in april      and almost immediately started experiencing a  flying basket  during cooking   i continue to deal with it until now after only   months after purchase  the basket won t even latch shut completely   this is unacceptable on a      appliance   now the return window is closed on amazon   i am currently reaching out to the manufacturer to see if they will accept a return   i will be looking for another brand air fryer      
1323,5.0,                       you name it  i ve cooked it in this thing  from squirrel to melting cheese this thing can do it all  sometimes i will go into a store and buy a random food item just to test how well it will cook in this air fryer and let me tell you  it s never let me down      
1324,5.0,                       loves this things i have used it almost ever day since we got it  i make so many different things in here   chickens wings so many different ways   fish sticks pizza tater tots french fries  and my kids favorite pig in a blanket and corn dogs  if you haven t brought one of these you need to life changing no oil needs or if so just a little sprits if cooking spray      
1325,5.0,                       super quick and easy   don t know what i d do without it in the kitchen   like the microwave   part of everyday use now      
1326,5.0,                       easy to clean  adds a lot of variety to my meals  cooks almost everything  a game changer for me     
1327,4.0,                       i love everything about the fryer   food turn out good as descripted   but the keypad buttons start to break down as sometime you couldn t press it  the only nightmare is taking out the inner basket to clean it   after pressing the button on the holder   it s act just depend on your luck to test how many times you need to press before it can be removed  sometime i just get so tired and leave it the next day to see if o have better luck       i m not sure if every buyer experience this or is this particular fryer i received that has this problems          
1328,4.0,                       works as advertised  included cookbook is medioker  good for crisping up leftover fried  foods  ihe internet has much better recipes for this air fryer  way too many buttons and symbols  needs an english labeling for all those buttons  i don t like time temperature button  just give one more button instead  with all those other buttons one more won t make much difference      
1329,1.0,                       i bought this very excited to use  but in   months it stopped working  i would cook with it for    minutes then it would shut off half way through the cooking process  i m never buying anything by this company again  this air fryer is not worth the price      
1330,5.0,                       best purchase from amazon ever   easy cleanup easy to use easy to cook with fabulous recipesi should ve bought one sooner but after reviewing other ones and listening to other peoples complaints this one was by far the best purchase     
1331,5.0,                       initially  i was skeptical about air fries   i watched  so many review videos on youtube and ended up buying cosori xl   it is consistent  quick and never failed so far  whole family can easily use it in daily life   we now use it more than regular oven  it is very easy to clean  it is a very good size for family of   in terms of design only thing i wish it is a little bit quieter      
1332,5.0,                    genial para hacer todo lo que se te ocurra y quede con un toque crujiente  especial para hacer empanadas jaja        
1333,1.0,                       i ordered two of these  one as an original order and the second as the replacement   both were broken when received   the touch pad did not work on either unit   these are a complete piece of junk   unless you only want to use your smart phone to work these  do not buy them  because if you want to use these with the manual buttons  they do not work   i will be getting a refund and will never buy a cosori product again   this has been a complete waste of my time      
1334,5.0,                       this is my  rd air fryer       watts is way better than       i like the removable basket and it is easy to clean  digital panel prevents numbers from being worn off from touch  pictures show how clean it is after months of use  i use this to crisp up waffles  and fries from restaurants and it does frozen chicken wings beautifully  i roast vegetables and cook just about anything that can be baked or broiled in this only down side is storing cuz i like my counters clear so i have a little shelving unit with a towel on it and i just slide it in and out of there     
1335,1.0,                       this product was defective right out of the box  as soon as the unit was powered up and connected to wifi  a firmware upgrade occurred  when i went to use the unit for the first time  some of the preset buttons would not work and the time temp button was non functional  i was able to use the vesync app to control the unit but every time the unit completed cooking and shut off  the wifi connection would disconnect  i would have to delete the re add the unit in the vesync app to use it  i worked with amazon support online but they were not helpful at all  i returned the unit and purchased another unit from a different manufacturer      
1336,4.0,                       i love my air fryer   it was a life changing experience   the kids can use it themselves to make healthy lunch or snacks without me   i don t don t like that the handle is always coming lose from the basket and face comes lose too   i always keep the screwdriver handy   otherwise  i love it   i picked this one because it is bpa free      
1337,5.0,                       love love love this airfryer   i use it every day   so easy to use and easy to clean   i recommend this larger size   very little oil is used so it s a healthy choice   it s great for reheating too   my kitchen is cooler and no bending over into a hot oven   highly recommended      
1338,5.0,                       i have to say  the customer service rep for this product was fantastic   although the air fryer didn t work out for me  the person that took my call was very kind  and professional acting  based on that fact alone   i highly recommend buying from this company   they do stand by their products   i believe my experience with the product to be an isolated situation  so  otherwise a good product in my opinion      
1339,5.0,                       i bought this air fryer because a youtuber i watch recommended it as she loves hers  i love it  it is so so easy to clean which may be my favorite feature cause i hate dishes   no dishwasher though it is dishwasher safe  it is super simple to use even my    year old grandma is going to buy one  i love it  very happy with my purchase      
1340,5.0,                       we love this air fryer   we could easily cook almost every food we make in this   we have not even fired up the grill in months   i am very happily surprised my one complaint is if you cook bacon in it it smokes a lot   we have to angle it toward an open window or it will set off our fire alarm      
1341,5.0,                       great product  so easy to get roasted veggies and baked potatoes in no time at all  loved that i could reheat a burger and fries in about   minutes and it tasted so much better than trying to microwave it sweet potato fries are amazing      
1342,2.0,                       not what we expected  preheating and all takes more time then expected and every time we use it  it sets off the smoke detectors even when we use the exhaust fan   foot away      
1343,5.0,                       we love it  our vegetable consumption has greatly increased since we bought this air fryer  with only a tablespoon or two or oil we  cook a   oz bag of broccoli and it is absolutely delicious  even our boys eat the veggies on their plate now  much better flavor than steamed vegetables  we have recommended it to numerous friends      
1344,1.0,                       other people i know have had great luck  this never makes good fries  and seems to not cook evenly      
1345,5.0,                       love this air fryer  performs better than i expected  i was worried i would not get that crunchy sensation  my husband and i are trying to eat better   ie less high calorie fried foods   we are enjoying using this for every meal breakfast  lunch and dinner   the recipe book has given me other meal options      
1346,5.0,                       just as described  this is a great product for people who want a healthier option to cook  fast  easy and convenient  not too big that it takes up to much room on your counter  easy to use and understand features  we have used the recipe book  included  several times      
1347,1.0,                       if you follow the instructions they dont work  you cant change the preset     degrees      mins like it says  it takes    mins to heat up  the instructions are wrong  that should be the last warning      
1348,5.0,                       it is no different than the convection on my toaster oven  but for a fryer i love that i can use my google home voice on it  easy to clean and use      
1349,5.0,                       i ve tired the ninja  instapot and a few other air fryers and this is hands down the best device  the basket lock  the heating element  etc it s all great i ve recommend and had three other friends get the same air fryer the wifi is an added bonus and allows you to preheat device when you re not next to the device  you also get an alert when your cooking is finished      
1350,5.0,                       we loved our first air fryer so much that we bought a second one because we use it for almost all of our family meals in the evening  it crisps everything so perfectly without oil and the flavor is incredible  by far one of the best purchases we ve made for our kitchen ever      
1351,2.0,                       all our food tastes like plastic  we ve had this air fryer for almost a year hoping the flavor would dissipate but it has not  would not recommend to my family     
1352,5.0,                       i purchased   units   there was a slight issue with one of the units  i emailed them directly and their response was amazing   quick  efficient and very considerate towards the customer   i highly recommend this product and this company   they stand by their product and i we are very pleased with our purchases      
1353,5.0,                       when searching for our first air fryer i didn t know what i needed  my friend recommended this one to me and so i took the leap and i m so glad i did  it s very easy to clean  either by hand or in the dishwasher  we use it often and are getting the hang of it  it s good a nice large capacity so i do very much appreciate that  i d highly encourage anyone looking to stop here  you want this      
1354,5.0,                       throw out your pots and pans and still avoid mcdonald s the future is here  that s right bask in the glory with pockets full of money cuz you re going to be saving a bunch boii  you ll finally be able to get that six pack  you might as well put a baskin robbins sign up on your front door cuz the ladies will be lining up or dudes whatever you prefer  if that doesn t work invite them in for some chicken that would popeyes and kfc to shame      
1355,5.0,                    me hizo mi vida m s f cil en la cocina         
1356,5.0,                       i purchased this air fryer because the one o had before was only   quarts  this one is much bigger  i can cook air more food  i also love that cleaning this item is so so easy  sometimes it takes me overnight to clean it  and all the grease still just comes right off with ought leaving anything behind  i have has it for a couple of months and still looks like new and i use it     times a week  you do need to change the presets because they don t really have the best optimal times for cooking but it doesn t take long to figure out what to put      
1357,1.0,                       this released a really bad chemical smell every time i cooked something  not impressed with the way it cooks food either  will be returning      
1358,5.0,                       i purchased this one as a gift as i have owned one for almost a year and have found it to be used in various tube videos of recipes and how to use air fryers   the two times i contacted customer service with questions i have been treated as a valuable  customer   highly recommend and gratitude to those that have served me      
1359,5.0,                       i did a lot of research before i made my purchase  i got this based on reviews that there was more surface area than the others as the other s had baskets that were round  this corosi s basket is square and it makes a world of difference  will be giving these to adult children for christmas this year      
1360,4.0,                       it does fries and chicken perfect  however i tried fish and shrimp disnt come out  how i wanted  guest i have to try another recipe  over all a great airfryer  don t second guest  it look really great on the counter top  easy to clean      
1361,4.0,                       we never used an air fryer before and this was our first purchase of one  this cosori is super easy to clean and the food comes out crispy and tastes great  it is trial and error to figure out how long to cook things when the food bags themselves do not have directions for air frying  but that is no fault of the air fryer  once we got the hang of how fast this thing cooks  there was no stopping everyone in my family to air fry everything and anything  would definitely recommend this product  it has a big basket and plenty of room for food for     people      
1362,4.0,                       i was so excited for this air fryer  i ve been slowly transitioning to smart appliances  it was easy to set up and i ran one batch of french fries   the next day it stopped working  i was heartbroken  however  i reached out to the company to see what further troubleshooting i could do since i can t get out much right now    and they honored the warranty  i can t wait to make more fries  and only took a star off for one defective unit  a  customer service      
1363,3.0,                       works good  the size is just right and the feature buttons make a good thing  the dislike is the temp and time buttons you have to touch it just right for them to work  makes me very frustrated when i have other things going on      
1364,2.0,                       the touchscreen doesn t work well  i try to hit a button and it doesn t register or thinks i hit the button next to it  what should take me one touch  ends up   minutes of touching different areas to try and get what i really want  mines probably a defect  but i can t give it a good review despite all else being good about the unit      
1365,5.0,                       oh my goodness   i cooked for the first time with air fryer and wow  this is awesome   easy to use and follow directions   i wasn t sure about cooking the steak on     degrees so i set it     for   minutes then check on it and tip it over add   more minutes   oh my goodness  move over top chief      
1366,4.0,                       i love the convenience and versatility of this air fryer  i ve cooked frys  fried chicken  steaks  hamburgers  liver  eggs  corned beef hash and so much more in this and everything has turned out great  the non stick isn t so non stick and it s a pain trying to clean in between the vents of the main tray  other than the cleaning of this  i love everything else about it      
1367,3.0,                       the air fryer worked well and was easy to use for    days   i also like that it comes with a cookbook and has wifi alexa connectivity  problem with mine is that on day    it wouldn t turn on   completely dead   the outlet had power  there were no visible signs of fraying or distress on the cord  mainly because it s only   weeks old and it never moved   and the basket was firmly in place i have ordered a replacement unit and will give it another try   very disappointing to have a total product failure after   weeks of limited use   we used it   times       
1368,1.0,                       i rarely write reviews   no different than other air fryer  large square basket  many functions but this thing smells cheap burning plastic  i think for holidays they have mass produced it with cheaper material   after many uses it still smells cheap burning plastic   i am thinking to return it      
1369,3.0,                       it sounds like it is falling apart with the rattling while it is running  but it works great   easy to operate and clean the basket   beats the heck out of a deep fat fryer  with the exception of the rattling noise while in operation      
1370,1.0,                       within several uses digital screen just stopped responding each time then just not at all  i wanted to love it and keep it  cost enough  i only made fries  tots  chicken wings once  never got to do real meals  i m w a s iting for response from service  its past return date  otherwise i d give it back and buy another brand      
1371,4.0,                       i enjoy the fryer very much but we have lost one screw from the basket and the other one is constantly in need of attention  i m worried that at some point the basket will come lose and fall  spill  or injure someone  other than that the food is always great and i m considering purchasing another one      
1372,5.0,                       ok  so i ve never written a review before  but i just had to write one for this product  as it is amazing fast and healthy cooking  so far i ve made chicken wings  chicken thighs  salmon  potatoes and french fries  my sister even made apple turnovers  everything taste truly wonderful without all the fat  while also adding crispness   the cleanup is so easy nothing sticks   i just spray the bottom with very little non stick cooking spray or add a little olive oil to coat potatoes  i definitely recommend this product  i m not sure why others had puddles or what not   because i ve never experienced any problems  i would recommend using something under it while cooking though  i use a chopping block      
1373,5.0,                       love this air fryer  i use it for everything  great size basket   i ve had it for   days and have not had to use my oven  tonight was salmon and it took   min and came out perfect  if you were debating about having another appliance  don t   you will not regret this air fryer      
1374,1.0,                       had this product for almost two years  it was great  like other reviews the handle is starting to be loose but hasn t come off for me  however  now i turn it on and after a minute it shuts off automatically  so it is of no use  doesn t work anymore  and it s been almost two years so out of warranty  pretty poor appliance if it can t even last two years  don t buy if you want it to last long      
1375,3.0,                       when cooking frozen broccoli in the air fryer  it get s very difficult to clean through these small ventilation holes  and no way to detach it from the machine  very hard to clean  and had to remove about    small screws to clean it  very much a hassle     
1376,2.0,                       this is a tiny convection oven that takes up a lot of space  the word fryer in the description is misleading  there is no frying  another problem is it takes enough time to cook barely enough of one thing to serve   people that if you wanted to cook more than one item or for more than   or   people  you ll be cooking for hours  just use your oven or toaster oven  it s not worth the investment      
1377,3.0,                       overall easy to use and clean   however the initial cook left food with a plastic taste   i was sure to remove all the packaging  not sure where this is from   i am going to run it without food for a while to see if the plastic taste goes away  if not going to return      
1378,5.0,                       great air fryer my first one and use it almost daily   one mistake i made i used aerosol oil so kinda ruined the no stock finish on the basket  now use oil sprayer much better  may buy a new basket if sold separately  highly recommend this air fryer     
1379,4.0,                       i ve only used it a few times  chicken wings  made three sauces to coat the chicken after it was cooked   amazing   frozen seasoned tater tots   great but not a stretch  and buttermilk fried chicken thighs  also  amazing   three observations   the basket is on the small side  i could fit four good sized chicken thighs  had to do the other two after  the chicken stick to the bottom  google suggested that i put parchment paper in the bottom i did not do that and i will try it next time  last thing  i don t really like the smell but i get over it   hope this is helpful     
1380,5.0,                       love my new air fryer   my favorite things to make is sausage and steaks   tastes like it was grilled outside on the grill   i discovered i can make boiled eggs  only not boiled   eggs come out perfect every single time and easy to peel       for    min    so easy to clean    did i mention what yummy chicken wings it makes     wish i had gotten one sooner       
1381,2.0,                       just wasn t what i expected  i was looking for something to give me that fried food taste as they all claim  it wasn t even close  it did a decent job with chicken but not that fried taste  with catfish fillets  it did a perfect job  but with nuggets  it failed   with steaks it missed the mark  my convection oven does a much better job of cooking and keeping in the moisture  overall  i was not happy with the unit and returned it      
1382,4.0,                       i have loved trying things in the fryer   only a few things   one is you have to do things in batches to really get them done right   things are not as crispy as you might want if truly fried  i could be doing something wrong but follow recipes to the t   wish there were   sides so you could cook chicken and a veggie at same time easy to cleanthe way the basket goes into the fryer is a little iffy   it doesn t always feel secure  like not the best made but we still get a lot of use out of it      
1383,5.0,                       wow  no regrets  awesome product  i cooked    perfect texture shrimp in   minutes and i can make amazing french fries in    minutes  with no oil  so easy to clean    nothing sticks  washes up beautifully with little effort  only thing i do not like is i feel it s a little difficult to push the button that releases the fryer from the base  i highly recommend this air fryer      
1384,5.0,                       we got this as a christmas present and we are already in love  we threw the deep fryer out right away after making our first batch or fries and tots  they come out so crisp and droop is and not oily  i can t wait to try all the other food options we can cook in this  i will post pics after the holidays when we make our first meal      
1385,5.0,                       i live in an on campus apartment that doesn t have an oven in the room    why i waited two years having only two stove top burners is beyond me    anyway  amazing    i love it  it s a great size for just two people but it is also big enough to fit a whole meal in  easy to use      
1386,5.0,                         heats everything and makes excellent dishes from the recipe book   i got the biggest one and it s pretty big   i am thinking about getting a second  or third   it makes whipping up stuff easy   i highly recommend   have had zero problems with it   very easy to use      
1387,5.0,                       looked at a lot of these  glad i picked this one   basket is big  super easy to clean  coating isn t chipping off like i ve heard on another brand   still trying to figure out the best cooking times for things  but works great   highly recommend      
1388,5.0,                       this thing is a life saver and everything comes out pretty great  doesn t just air fry  my husband and i travel for work and put in a pretty long work week  it is important that our children have healthy food options and quick meal time scenarios that create optimal quality time for our family  this thing is awesome      
1389,5.0,                       i m so happy   i want something to be able to fry up wings  this did an absolute amazing job  some of the best wings i ve ever had in my life  quick and easy and crispy  even made a tri tip in there and it was the best i ve ever made      
1390,5.0,                       after using the cosori air fryer  almost daily for the past   weeks  i can say that i m a big fan  it s definitely a keeper  the first thing that strikes me about this air fryer is the design of it  it s square  which means you have more usable space inside the machine  it s also very high end looking and easy to use  this air fryer is a win for me and would recommend this to any single person or family  not only is this a fantastic air fryer so is the company      
1391,5.0,                       l absolutely love this air fryer  the presets are amazing and produce quality meals in minutes  i can also link it to my alexa app or control it from the app on my phone  it really brings out the flavor in season of your food      
1392,5.0,                       i just got my air fryer just a few days ago  and the only thing ive made was french fries and although i miss the grease  the fries got golden brown and were cooked nicely   i like that it has a pre heat option and also has setting for a few food items and that you can adjust the heat up or down  it also has a feature to let you know when to turn the food for even cooking      
1393,5.0,                       this is an amazing air fryer  it comes with several heating options for different types of cooking preferences  the preheating option is amazing as well  just set the temperature you want it and it auto adjusts the time      degrees takes   mins      takes   mins   very easy to clean as well  there are only   parts you have to clean the basket and the part you have to take out  put aluminum foil in the bottom to save on clean up time  i would def recommend the     quarts size  when you re cooking a big dish the bigger size can turn   batches into one  if you re cooking for a group of people you can t have half of them wait    mins while the other half is already eating      
1394,1.0,                       returned the unit twice  first one did not heat from out of the box  plus there seemed to be a problem with removing the frying basket  it would get stuck  second one cooked things fine  however same problem with removing the basket  finally  it would not come out at all  no way to fully clean the basket  obviously  a defect in the basket release mechanism  needless to say i was not going back for a third try  getting a refund and have since purchased a different type  no similar basket  of larger air fryer for less money      
1395,1.0,                       the overall design of the product is nice  however  when i plugged the airfryer in and tried to press the power button on the lcd screen nothing happened  tried plugging back in and unplugging several times  even pressing and holding the button to see if anything happened  thankfully cosari customer support is sending a replacement      
1396,5.0,                       we love this air fryer   we have  fried  chicken many times and it turns out great i love not having a greasy mess on the stove when we used to fry chicken the traditional way clean up is easy and quick this is the only appliance that lives on our counter highly recommend this unit to anyone wanting an air fryer      
1397,1.0,                       i can say unequivocally that you should not buy this air fryer  three months after we bought the air fryer the screws for the handle started to fall out  one month after that the compartment slid open when it was at      and fell onto the floor  scorching the floor     
1398,1.0,                       i purchased this machine in june       it worked great until yesterday when it stopped during cooking corn on the cob  it shutdown and we waited until the next day to plug in and it s still not working      
1399,5.0,                       we have never used oil   the squareness of the cooking space gives lots of extra area to cook in   those corners are great   it also has a preheat function which allows for rapidly sealing in the moisture while cooking   we just love it      
1400,2.0,                       gave as a gift to mom for mother s day  she loved it and it worked great    until   months later  now it barely works  it keeps shutting off in the middle of cooking  and it will not restart for       minutes  leaving your food sitting there uncooked  i wish this would have lasted for more than   months update   it died before it s   month anniversary      
1401,2.0,                       during the air fryer working  sometimes the inner and outer baskets will auto come out by themselves  it s kind of scare      
1402,5.0,                       we hit the jackpot with this sucker   i read the reviews but i am not familiar with the cosori brand so i was still skeptical   then we had our maiden voyage and boom     we were wowed at first fry   note to other buyers   when the directions tell you not to push the button on the basket a million times over  listen      
1403,4.0,                       absolutely love my corsori  my favorite kitchen appliance i haven t had the problem  but i ve read many comments on the corsori facebook group sites about the basket popping out during cooking and screws on the handle loosening often  makes me super cautious when i use it      
1404,2.0,                       cooks great  easy to use   the basket on the third use would not keep closed i am returning the unit and ordered a replacement   should my experience improve so will my rating october         sadly  i have to report that the non stick coating on the bottom basket is peeling off  i have to downgrade the unit one more star      
1405,5.0,                       i had an air fryer a few years ago   didn t care for it  my son started raving about his cosori so i bought one   so glad i did    i m loving it  i use it     times a week   sometimes more  i had a little problem at the beginning but cosori customer service took care of it right away  they have the best customer service ever  i almost bought the smaller one  there s only   of us  but my son talked me into getting the      and again  glad i did  thanks cosori      
1406,5.0,                       life changer     nothing but great things to say about this airfryer  we completely got away from deep frying food as this air fryer is so much healthier and is just as crispy as traditional deep fryers  our family loves hot wings and we can make some of the best  most crispy wings with our air fryer      stars      
1407,2.0,                       we have made two dozen different meals and only two of them came out close to what i d consider crispy or  air fried   not sure if the heating doesn t work right or the fan but this was an epic fail  the pre set timers and heating amounts were definitely      in accurate even with pre heating the device  also tried adjusting based on internet recipes and everything was soggy or under cooked  returned this and will look into a different brand   model entirely  disappointed because there were so many great reviews      
1408,1.0,                       i bought this product late in       today is early      and it broke  although i owned it for a bit over a year  i didn t use it frequently  so i am surprised that it s broken already it seems to be some thermal issue  the fryer can turn on for about   minutes but once it heats  it shut off  it wouldn t turn back on until hours have past  the product concept is ok  i think the foods you can cook with it are fantastic  but i am very disappointed at the hardware reliability that i barely got to use it and it broke      
1409,5.0,                       let me preframe   i have burnt our backsplash  the knobs off the stove and almost started a fire with in the microwave   there was a reason most of the food we ate came pre cooked   until i purchased the cosori airfryer   it s so easy  little mess and fast   what more is there    now i am getting more adventurous with recipes and sunday meal prepping for the week   i made fried chicken  for the first time ever   completely enjoyable and recommend it      
1410,5.0,                       seriously  we love this magical machine  everything we ve made has been delicious   ribs  beets  chicken  fries  veggies  bacon  salmon  halibut  the list goes on   i would say the only downside is it doesn t hold a lot of food but for a family of   it works     
1411,5.0,                       i would      buy this for my mother  if you re one who likes to use that as a rule when buying or cooking something   the cooking results are unparalleled to pan frying or oven baking   i now use it for     dinners a week  the app was super simple to use when i downloaded it for first use my dislikes are the touch screen is a little tough to use  it s very time sensitive in the sense that i feel you need to move to the next option before the device locks in the displayed choice  i find myself  clicking a lot   the app is the way to go  i also ran into my basket and drip drawer chipping rather quickly  cosori s customer support was excellent and quickly took care of the problem  big shout out from a consumer who works in customer service      
1412,5.0,                       the cosori air fryer is extremely easy to use and everything we have cooked has been delicious   it is very easy toclean  fits perfectly on the top rack of the dishwasher  i love the cookbook that came with it and have enjoyed many of the recipes  they also have the best customer service  always happy to help   i did a lot of research before purchasing and am so happy i chose the cosori   i have purchased several for gifts and everyone loves them  i would highly recommend this product      
1413,5.0,                       i have an affection or kitchen appliances but was hesitant to purchase an air fryer  i didnt need another appliance to store away  well   after a few months of looking and trying to decide  i decided on this one and it did not disappoint  plus  i don t need to find storage for it    this air fryer stays on the counter and is used at lease once per day  it is very simple to use  very easy to clean and very versatile  we have made burgers  fries  fish  brats  etc and have been very pleased with the results  i now look for reasons to use it      
1414,1.0,                       have used this twice and the buttons no longer work  my wifi changed and now i cant reconnect to wifi and the actual buttons dont work      
1415,5.0,                       my second air fryer  but first cosori   the first one was damaged when the basket fell out   easy to use  large basket which is a must for a family   cooks well   feels more sturdy than my previous one and the basket seems to be better attached which is a plus   it does not feel like it will fall out easily like my last one      
1416,5.0,                       i love it  i highly recommend this  after having suffered     burns and most  rd degree trying to fry orange chicken from panda s express video  glory be to jesus who saved me   was about to die   i am now back on track and air frying food  praise jesus  thank you for saving me and for keeping me alive  what the devil meant for harm you have healed me and finishing up the last touches of skin burns  complete healing  and brought in goodness and blessings anyway  yes i highly recommend it  bought three of these  food tastes good  very easy to clean      
1417,5.0,                       i love this airfryer    my husband and i have made the chocolate souffles from the recipe book and they were delicious  i have made crisp roasted veggies  that were frozen   hamburgers  sausage links  and baked potatoes in it so far  everything has come out great   i also love that i can just pop it in the dishwasher when i m done  the airfryer has a nice big capacity which is awesome  i can fit   burger patties in the airfryer with ease      
1418,5.0,                       we are so pleased with this air fryer  saves time  saves us from having to turn on the oven and heating up the entire house  and i would imagine that is also saves on energy since you do not have to cook everything as long as you would in the oven   the food always turns out great especially chicken wings   super easy to use and i actually look forward to cooking now instead of dreading it      
1419,5.0,                       i used to have a     qt air fryer  gave it to my parents  and wanted something bigger  i read reviews and debating on this and the ninja air max xl and decided on this one and i m so glad i did  i love the cosori air fryer  it s so easy to use and clean  it s not very noisy  didn t matter to me  and i love the square basket instead of a round basket  you will not be disappointed      
1420,4.0,                       easy to use and works great  only thing i would improve is hard to detach the metal basket from the base even when you re pushing the release button  you have to shake it as pressing release button to detach      
1421,1.0,                       i purchased the wifi version and it worked for the first     times just fine  but then it suddenly wouldn t connect to my wifi any longer  and none of the other buttons would work or even light up besides the power button  i tried all the troubleshooting techniques suggested  but to no avail  i m hopeful the manufacturer will respond to my request i made through their website  i will update this rating if so  not too sure about the non wifi version  but beware of this one for sure  i ve seen other similar issues reported  i just wish i would have read them first      
1422,5.0,                       when i was looking into air fryers  i noticed others saying it has a smell to it but i bought this one anyway  turns out  it does and maybe others do too but it s still great  the food doesn t have a funky taste or anything and it does the job      
1423,5.0,                       i use this fryer at least     times a week  it works great  it is a little noisier than i expected  my previous air fryer was a lot quieter  i love the size capacity  love the fact i get that fried food taste without  all the grease      
1424,5.0,                       this is an awesome air fryer  so easy to use  easy to clean  easy to read display  and quick to cook  we rarely use our oven now  i have not used the wifi feature  but so far this is the most used cooking appliance in our kitchen      
1425,2.0,                       while this might be a good frier based on reviews and videos i ve watched  the one i received was defective  the main buttons located in the middle sections  specially the one to change the temperature and time was nos working and is very unresponsive  i had to press very hard to made it to work  i also did not like how hard it is to open it  they should find a better mechanism      
1426,5.0,                       this thing is amazing  i hate cooking  and now i don t have to  i try to eat healthy but meal prepping is a pain usually  with this thing i can cook all the meat for multiple meals  and veggies also  and then the clean up is easy if u line the bottom basket with a bit of aluminum  i actually lost weight cus i m not eating out anymore  and i don t spend as much money on food as much aaaandddd it saves me time cus i dont have to cook or go buy food  thank you jesus hallelujah if this thing was a person it would bring all the boys to yard okurr with that wappp        
1427,5.0,                       the best part about this af is the clean up   no muss  no fuss   i love it   i ve used it every day since i got it   i definitely recommend if you are trying to cut back on fried foods   it s a little adjustment  but overall the flavor of food is pretty good  and so easy      
1428,5.0,                       i actually waited several years to jump on the bandwagon of buying an air fryer   all of the ones i had seen before were just not a size that i felt was worthy of taking up space in my kitchen   when i saw this one  i felt like the larger size and shape of the basket was perfect for my family   i have not been disappointed   we especially love making hot wings in it   also it is great for making hot dogs and sausages   this is a healthy way to get very delicious  fried  food   i highly recommend it      
1429,5.0,                       this air fryer is the best kitchen appliance in my kitchen  it s the best thing to start teaching my son d how to cook  and cosori has an amazing customer service  my basket broke and after answering a few questions i got my replacement in less than   business day  my sisters and brothers have purchased the same air fryer  i highly recommend this air fryer to anyone looking for one  love it                                   
1430,5.0,                       never thought i would want an air fryer  but my husband decided to get this one i tried it the first time  and i was amazed  it s done a fantastic job on everything i have tried in it so far clean up is so easy  very little mess  am loving it      
1431,5.0,                       easy to use  comes with a recipe book too so you can get started using it right away with fantastic results  i want to air fry everything now      
1432,5.0,                       i love the cosori and everything i cook in it is great  i hardly ever turn on the stove now and i have no desire to go out and eat anymore  i use it daily and it is so easy to clean up regardless of what i cook in it   i liked it so much  i gave one to my daughter and one to my granddaughter   they love their machines also      
1433,5.0,                       this is a way to have food cooked in a way that is reasonably healthy and very tasty  plus  you just put the food in and press the buttons  it does the rest  it s a great device  i had a little problem  long story short  the customer service was outstanding      
1434,1.0,                       i purchased this product  air fryer  for my wife about  two weeks ago and to be honest  we re disappointed   we cannot use the touch buttons to make selections  they re very sporadic when making selections  sometime the buttons work and sometime they do not   returning exchanging       
1435,5.0,                       started using the af about a week ago  around christmas   so far i absolutely love it   i ve only tried some basic recipes so far    chicken wings  deep fried oreos  french fries  roasted potatoes  tj frozen hashbrown patties and reheated l o pizza now that things are getting back to normal  after the holidays  i can t wait to start making some of the recipes that come with the af and on their fb page  there is a permanent spot on my counter for the af  i will be using it everyday  no doubt  i love cooking and this is awesome addition to my kitchen  cosori also stands by their product      
1436,5.0,                       often i would decide not to have frozen chicken wings or fish sticks   i love the convenience of my air fryer and enjoy air fried foods more often   i especially love fresh french fries cooked with only a small amount of oil and the  shake  alarm is really nice   i can accurately cook my favorite foods every time      
1437,5.0,                       sent the air fryer   accessories to my neice in az    the first time she cooked in it  they madechicken  carrots  stuffed mushrooms    meatballs    she said everything  tasted great  was cooked to perfection  theclean up was so easy   would thus recommend  the cosariair fryer  very highly  to everyone  five           
1438,5.0,                       i love this airfryer  even a dummy  me  can operate this  i made fries and came out just as crispy as if made in the oven  instructions super easy  can t wait to try the recipes in the cookbook provided  only one thing that i wasn t  happy with  the cord is short which means i would have to move it to an electrical outlet every time i want to use it   bummer   still love it though  hence   stars      
1439,1.0,                       i bought this air fryer because i wanted to see if it lived up to the hype      welllll it did i loved it made food amazing  after   months the handle broke off  not only did it just melt off it landed on my bf foot and burned him  i did email cosri they did getback to me  wanted pictures when i bought etc   i am waiting on there response  i will update when and if i do          
1440,4.0,                       i bought this as a christmas gift for my husband so i can t really give a review until after christmas  i hope it is as nice as the reviews say      
1441,4.0,                       i haven t used it enough yet to comment extensively  but what i have made has turned out well  watching to see how my handle stays after more use  have read comments on the fb thread that says many have broken or that the screws come loose  i have had no issues with that so far      
1442,5.0,                       i did a lot of research on air fryers  i choose the best  pork chops were delicious  crispy and so tender  i would highly recommend this air fryer  great size  i m totally sold on the quality and safety features on this specific air fryer  will be my everyday best friend  highly recommend  love it      
1443,5.0,                       went through a ton of reviews and ended up on this corsori  the size  price  and reviews were great so i took a chance  life   changed  my wife uses this almost every day and it works great  chicken  french fries  vegetables  hot dogs  steak  you name it  everything tastes better  crispier  size is perfect for our family of    cleanup is a breeze  get one now      
1444,5.0,                       received the product in timely manner and great condition  read reviews of smell of plastic  took time to read instructions no plastic smell  very easy to use  have had product for over a month now  no problems are noted  the food from it tastes excellent  cooks chicken all the way through  highly recommend this product  for the price i paid  did not expect to be as great as it is      
1445,2.0,                       i have had this for about   months   i like it  its easy to use and clean and itd be great except that sometimes the touchscreen doesnt work  like some buttons do but some dont  some tomes  so its not like a burton isnt working its just wjenever it wants it world  so thats a pain in the ass  id rather it wasnt touchscreen      
1446,5.0,                       we are a family of three and we love this machine  first use we made frys  followed the directions  came out nice and crispy  we ve done egg rolls and all kinds of frozen tummies  haven t used it to it s full potential yet  but we re still learning      
1447,4.0,                       the only thing i don t like about the air fryer is the size  it takes up a lot of counter top space for the amount of food it will hold  it s good for the two of us  but it would be inadequate for a family      
1448,5.0,                       good size for family of    best bacon and chicken wings you will ever make  so easy to clean  seems durable  not too much plastic in the components  the temp and time settings require lots of hitting plus and minus keys to set up  but easy enough to grasp immediately  i didn t find many recipes that appealed in the included book  but have been just getting great ideas off the web  i am using this at least   times a week  totally changed how i cook dinner      
1449,5.0,                       in this era of new gadgets and gizmos  this item really has been a game changer for our kitchen  gone are the days of waiting long periods of time to warm meats and other frozen items in the oven  or risk turning them to rubber in the microwave  it s the counterpart to our instant pot    maybe should have been called the instant oven  this item simply does a great job cooking meat  kale chips  veggies  etc    in a very short amount of time clean up is easy the only thing that seems awkward is the clamp that attaches the frying cage to the drip pan  making sure the two are latched together is easy to miss  the construction is sturdy  so i m not concerned about it breaking      
1450,5.0,                       i am really enjoying this kitchen gadget   i will admit that initially i didn t think i would use it that often   but now that my child is in school  i can prep certain food for her to take for lunch and it s definitely made things a little easier in that regard   and anything making my life a little bit easier is deserving of   stars in my book      
1451,5.0,                    me encanta s per f cil de husar y r pido un buen tama o puedes estar aciendo algo m s en los que cocinas tu comida super recomendado        
1452,5.0,                       this is hands down my favorite kitchen thingy  i use it every day and learning more recipes all the time  perfect for singles or couples  might get the larger for bigger families but overall and amazing air fryer  great price and well worth the investment  love it      
1453,1.0,                       the design of the frame basket is dangerous  the inner frying basket is attached to the handle  the outer tray gets hot and is a separate piece from the inner basket handle  when you pull the frying basket and the outer tray out it inadvertently separates which allows the outer tray to drop   hot      to the counter or floor  then to make matters worse when it comes time to clean the unit it s very difficult to separate these same two pieces      
1454,5.0,                       this air fryer is fabulous  it cooks almost everything and i have been pleasantly surprised by it  i had purchased a cheaper version and the handle broke quickly and the unit was flimsy comparatively  much happier  great purchase      
1455,1.0,                       this product was awesome for   months  we loved the air fryer so much back in april we ordered one for my father n  law and it did t even work and had to return it which was a bad experience  last night the one we have had since january just decides not to even turn on and it is now aug  so we have had it for just a little over   moths now and it won t work at all  my wife and i are disgusted   nothing but junk      
1456,1.0,                       ok i ll say this i got the first one and it wouldn t close properly then they sent me a second on and the screws fell out about a month later  their product designers def didn t take in to account shaking  that releases the screws  don t do it      
1457,5.0,                       cosori has done a truly outstanding job with the cp    af air fryer   it cooks food perfectly every single time and has loads of options compared to other air fryers out there  if you are looking for the best air fryer out there  look no further than the cosori cp    af        
1458,5.0,                       this is my first air fryer  it s incredibly easy to use  the removable basket makes it very easy to clean too      
1459,2.0,                       everything has a funny taste that we cook in it  it s also extremely loud  this is our first air fryer and i think we won t ever use it  unfortunately we waited too long to return it so we will just have to sell it on craigslist or something      
1460,5.0,                       so i have had this air fryer now since august      and it has surpassed my expectations  this air fryer does what frying does but without the oil and toast like if did fry it  not only is the air fryer amazing the customer service i received from cosori is wow  i emailed them because the handle broke from basket and right away they sent me a replacement no questions asked  i approve this air fryer everyone go and buy one at amazon      
1461,1.0,                       reading the glowing reviews on this air fryer made me anxious to take it out of the box to use right away  unfortunately  it was defective   there was absolutely no damage to the box  but the fan that circulates the air never came on   i returned it an hour later           
1462,5.0,                       there are a lot of in depth reviews of this product so i won t revisit that same info  but will say this is a great kitchen addition  simple controls  but lots of options  it works well  it s large enough to do  real  food  and it s a blast to use  very glad i went with this model and absolutely glad i went with this size capacity     
1463,5.0,                       this thing is super easy to use  and so far everything has turned out great  sort of a pain to clean  but everything like this is   there s just no getting around it  we also have an emeril     powerxl air fryer  and the cosori is my favorite between the two  cooks faster  probably due to the smaller chamber  and things seem to be crunchier in it would recommend to anyone      
1464,5.0,                       so far i ve made french toast  chicken parmigiana  tuna potato patties  ginger salmon  pork chops  etc  love that we ve cut back on the oil without sacrificing flavor  i was sooo hesitant  thinking i would probably dislike the flavor and almost certain the food would come out dry or tough  but i was totally wrong  so glad i finally gave in and bought the largest cosori      qt  i found on special      
1465,2.0,                       on the other hand this device lasted for about   months  after it began glitching  screen would turn on off repeatedly  now the unit is dead  mind you the use of it while we enjoyed it was minimal max   times a week      
1466,1.0,                       i am attempting to get product help  the phone rings and then disconnected  i was so excited about using my new air fryer  i did not realize there was a problem but should have  i cannot get the wi fi to shut off  it has been increasing difficult to turn on the fryer   not sure what s going on  seems the touch screen does not respond  and finally last night it would not start at all  this is very disappointing  i probably was able to turn the fryer on maybe   times since i purchased it  seems like there are no resources left  amazon does not respond  calls are disconnected  what has become of customer service        
1467,5.0,                       best and quickest at heating up and consistent air fryer i ve bought    other brands from box stores did not stack up at all   great addition works best with all frozen potatoes snacks and breaded shrimp and warming stuff up really quick  even rhodes frozen dinner rolls like   minutes perfect  these appliances aren t made to cook a pound of sliced potatoes for fries like a deep fryer is or other raw meats and vegetables  convenient for side dish fries  tater tots  breaded shrimp  pizza snack and warming up leftovers      
1468,5.0,                       i ve had this cosori  air fryer for another a month and have used it about   days week trying to get used to it   i ve used it for  italian sausage  chicken  grilled cheese  shrimp  garlic bread  and biscuits   aeverything has come out great   i was in a hurry to learn it since i was taking it to use in a hotel room for several weeks   i used to think i didn t need one more gadget in my kitchen  but the air fryer was so fun to use  cleanup is very easy   i think i will purchase the parchment paper recommended from others  that would have helped with my biscuits      
1469,5.0,                       if i could marry this thing  i would  i absolutely love everything about it  the look is so sleek and not cheap looking like other air fryers  the recipe book it comes with is very helpful  i ve made some frozen chicken wings in this thing and they taste like heaven  so glad i  my boyfriend  purchased        
1470,5.0,                       i love this product i do everything in it since i have teenagers and all boys they eat a lot so like french fries chicken nuggets steaks fish i even big bread the other day i do almost everything in it and it is so easy to use my boys even try making steak for me the other day when i wasn t feeling well to cook and i hardly recommend it anybody can use it thank you so much      
1471,5.0,                       i love the fryer  literally only used the oven three times since i received my fryer  weeks ago  clean up is simple  i don t get popped with grease  and the food comes out perfect each time   food come out like something from   star restaurant  easy to clean  cooks quicker  and i ve taught my  yr old to operate  very easy   safe to use      
1472,1.0,                       it was easy to use  cooked wings and fries nicely  unfortunately started to become intermittent and now has failed completely   no signs of life when the power is plugged into working sockets  we liked the experience of air frying and as it s our first unit we are now looking for a higher end  better brand product      
1473,5.0,                       cleans up easily even if i forget to clean it for a couple days   most of the cooking settings i have tried have worked perfectly  but when i have needed to adjust the temp or timer  it s super easy   no need to wait for the oven to preheat   my kitchen is small with little storage and i didn t want this  eye sore  on my counter but i don t even think it looks bad   i shouldn t have hesitated so long   the only downside is why would i want a wifi air fryer   it could be cheaper without that option       
1474,5.0,                       i was skeptical about all the air fryer craze until i tried this one out  it is my new favorite way to cook    everything      
1475,5.0,                       love this thing   comes with some great recipes and sticking all our frozen foods in it is easy and comes out great  i leave all the cooking to my husband usually but i ve actually done a few meals all by myself using our air fryer and they came out great  love not having to mess with gross oil      
1476,5.0,                       i bought this item as a christmas present   my relatives loved it   they have cooked most of their meals in it since they received it   they did confess that they really didn t think they wanted or needed this air fryer  however since using it they wished they had gotten one sooner   great product wish i had kept it        
1477,5.0,                       let me just say that this machine is freaking amazing          i d give it    stars if i could    it is so quick and so simple     a caveman could do it    lol it is the ideal machine for every kitchen and any person who is always on the go and perfect for a bachelor like me    highly recommend and i will never go without one again      
1478,5.0,                       has significantly reduced my cooking time  i can make burgers  chicken tenders  veggies  a lot  and cleanup is easy  also  my touchpad works  idk what happened to other people  mine works fine  i might buy one as a gift for family      
1479,5.0,                       have had a great experience with this air fryer   easy to use and cooks great fries and other food   had an issue with a bolt coming loose from the tray handle   contacted their customer service department and they responded the same day and resolved the issue with a new tray in a couple of days   superb customer service      
1480,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          my whole family loved this fryer  easy to use and the food we made with it was so delicious  however the temp and time button was super glitchy and very difficult to set  i tried to ignore it for a week using it every day made this quirk untenable  so frustrating because i really wanted to love this product  processing a return      
1481,5.0,                       i use this mostly for french fries and tater tots  it works great  i have also used it for pizza bites  makes food crispy  i bought an oil spritzer to use for spraying a little oil on the potatoes  i like the timer that lets you know when to shake it halfway through the cooking time  the control panel is easy to use and convenient  i recommend this product      
1482,5.0,                       third air fryer i have used and this one is it   large basket  great presets  easy to clean and use   the recipe book is full of tasty meals   spot on with the timing of chicken   steak   potatoes   i hardly use anything else to cook with now      
1483,5.0,                       the reason why i gave only   stars for the use is that the dropping basket is a bit dangerous with my kids around   accidents are always bound to happen   i dropped it twice because i was in a hurry  like many moms   i just don t want to take a chance   what i don t like is that i have to pay for shipping it back      
1484,5.0,                       can t say enough about how much we love this fryer  very easy to use and clean  you can almost say its somewhere in between a microwave and an oven as far as how long it takes to cook food  much crispier results than a microwave and much less time than an oven  you can make anything from toast to grilled cheese to making fries from raw potatoes to cooking frozen pre made items that you d normally stick in a microwave or toaster oven  i ve even roasted green coffee beans in it      
1485,4.0,                       ordered this recently  about a week ago and could only use it this weekend  it comes on  and works  and the user interface and recipe book and look are all fantastic  the food is good  the only problem is i m getting a really loud rattling sound when it s running sometimes  i think something has come loose inside it  and have e mailed support  hopefully they can get back soon      
1486,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          was able to finally use it this weekend  have only used it for vagables to far  but its great and they taste amazing  looking up how to do meats on this  friends have one and the meat they make with it always comes out tender and with a lot of flavor  hoping mine comes the same way  it also should be healthier since we are using a lot of the oils to cook the food ive used it multiple times now and it s amazing  just on the time it saves you on pre heating and cleaning it s worth every penny     
1487,5.0,                       fabulous appliance   really thought it would be a waste of my money   favorite appliance i ve owned  literally use it everyday    best money spent   this  my cast iron pan  an my crockpot is all i need to survive   really researched these airfryer   found this to be best buy for size  options   an price   you will not be disappointed       
1488,5.0,                       absolutely love this air fryer  wanted one for the past year  i have already made hamburgers  french fries   panko chicken in it  the food comes out great   not dried out at all  i also got the accessory kit and love the little racks in the kit    they come in handy when i made the hamburgers and when i made the chicken as i made a lot and was able to put the extra chicken or the burgers on a rack above the what was cooking on the bottom of the basket      
1489,5.0,                       i love this thing  i first learned about it on the frugal fit mom youtube channel  and decided to try it  i have made vegetables  meats and breads in it  i save time and money by not using my oven all the time      
1490,5.0,                       i had an obscene amount of calamari in the fridge leftover from lunch today  and my roommate and i decided to test drive our new air fryer  boy  let me tell you  game changer  it made the calamari crispy again without a hint of sogginess  i m just spitballing here  but think what you could do with cookies or broccoli but more likely cinnamon rolls  i feel like this perfect machine will take us to infinity and beyond      
1491,4.0,                       after a week we have tried some frozen foods and reheated some pizza  everything has come out great  my only complaint is its hard to open for my wife who has small hands  i can put my thumb on the frame and slide it open with one hand      
1492,5.0,                       i couldn t be happier  the cosori     is just perfect  ii did a lot of research on which air fryer to buy  i am learning how to get the temp right  some recipes need less heat and shorter cooking times  but my cooking and desire to cook has definitely improved  i have bought my last pre cooked food  thank you so much      
1493,5.0,                       we were hesitant when we first recieved our air fryer  but now we have been using it for about a week and loving it   it makes better steaks thank on the grill   french fries are the best and i ve made banana bread and it was perfect   i highly recommend purchasing especially if you are looking for a healthy way of cooking      
1494,5.0,                       i love this air fryer  it has lots of space for larger quantity  and i find it s more than powerful enough to cook large portions  i find it s best to reduce the temperature and increase the timer as the presets are too hot in my situations  it s faster than a conventional or toaster oven and gets the food crispier      
1495,5.0,                       just received this air fryer  used it to cook several things  it works great for bacon  does frozen fries pretty darn good  it is extremely easy to use and clean  doesn t take much counter space  perfect size for me and my wife  i would recommend      
1496,5.0,                       this is my first air fryer  and i am so happy with it  it makes perfect roasted vegetables  and it is so easy to use  the instructions are simple to understand  the flavor of the broccoli  cauliflower  carrots  and mushrooms that i have roasted is fabulous  i can t say enough about this machine  just buy it      
1497,5.0,                       easy to use and clean   cooks relatively quickly   it is a bit bulky and the cooking element  top of the unit  is larger than the food bin  bottom part    i have e only used it a few time so only time will tell if it will last      
1498,5.0,                       at this day and age  who doesn t need an air dryer  we got this for our mother and she raves about it  the best part is the easy clean up and no oily mess compared to using a dryer  we might even get ourselves one now      
1499,1.0,                       instead of electronic controls as advertised  the one i received operates with the use of two     dials  it looks like an earlier generation of that which is advertised  rip off       
1500,5.0,                       i research multitudes of air fryers and deliberated between getting well known brands vs  this brand that was unknown to me   this one is perfect   does a great job   i rarely even use my built in oven any longer   it is a decent size compared to the traditional smaller round air fryers you see  so you may want to take that into consideration      
1501,4.0,                       this is my  rd air fryer  so far i am pleased with this one right from the start  used only     times and it worked really well  once i take the time to read the cookbook included i will for sure have a better feel for my ling term experience   so far so go  bought off the treasure truck hopefully it was a great deal       
1502,5.0,                       packaging was amazing  it comes with recipe book  a thank you card plus information on how to register your warranty  it s bigger than i expected so that s great  my vegetables came out so good  the timer said   min but i did   min because i love them a bit softer      
1503,2.0,                       very difficult to open bin or to release fryer basket  cheap plastic button to do so  may break had to call my son to come over twice in one day  once to press plastic button to open and the to press cheap plastic button to disengage tray  may need to return     
1504,5.0,                       i bought it to try to fix fried squash a little healthier  so far i can t get that just right  but it makes great roasted potatoes and is much better then heating my house with the oven  overall this product was just as described   i am enjoying discovering new ways to fix things     
1505,5.0,                    lo mejor de lo mejor   el sabor de las comidas es delicioso   es moderna   y sostificada        
1506,5.0,                       we can not say enough about this air fryer   it s the right size and easy to use  it s now a staple for our kitchen well worth the price      
1507,5.0,                       husband said we didn t need an air dryer  but great deals for christmas season  i bought one   husband uses it at least   times a week   vegetables have never tasted so good    yes  i meant vegetables       
1508,5.0,                       crazy easy to use i don t know which is best the cookbook with a lot of good recipes  the preset cook buttons  or the ability to control the time and temp  it s a very good product   the best thing about it i have not used half the stuff in my kitchen that includes my george foreman s grill     
1509,5.0,                       my kids use this daily   recently they reheated pizza   there are so many foods that now have airfry instructions   this model has presets that makes it super easy to use   my    yo is able to use this and clean up   definitely a good purchase as the kids are now even more creative in the kitchen      
1510,3.0,                       i don t like that i was unable to connect the unit to my cell phone  not even sure what the app is for  i don t like that it shows the temperature in celsius not fahrenheit and no instructions to change it      
1511,5.0,                       i don t have room for this   it sits on the floor and i dread having to clean it   a dishwasher would help   one thing i don t like is opening and closing the door is like opening and closing a      chevy door   no   an unkempt      pick up door   other than the door thing it is good build quality      
1512,5.0,                       family loves it now we can have homemade fries that s healthy  we ve only done veggies on this as we dont eat animal products but it s been fantastic so far and will soon try more complicated things like stuffed peppers      
1513,4.0,                       it s great for just about everything  i ve been using it constantly since it arrived   my only gripe is with how loud the beeping is   it s just too loud   obnoxious even   if they could silence the key presses  i d order another one      
1514,5.0,                       the size is great if you are looking for a larger air fryer  it has so many settings to choose from for different types of food and is easy to use  i love that it came with a recipe book  too  we have already made some of the recipes  the fact that the basket separates is super convenient for cleaning purposed  i have had no issues cleaning it  you can buy a lot of accessories for this air fryer which is nice  i plan on getting some to have more options with cooking  it cooks evenly and the food tastes delicious  i highly recommend      
1515,5.0,                       i bought it for my bf for his birthday because he had wanted to try out cooking with an air fryer for a while  he s used it   times so far and says it works great and cooks the food fast making it crispy and delicious  he was intimidated at first but says it s easy to use and the cleanup is simple too  the size is perfect for cooking for     people too      
1516,5.0,                       this is hands down the best appliance for me   this machine makes meal prepping soooo much easier   recently my little cosori stopped working   mo old    but within days corsori customer service team processed my request and i have another one in the mail and on the way   thank you      
1517,1.0,                       used it twice  second time screen went crazy and stoped working  followed recipe directions first time and it over cooked  did not want refurbished replacement  returned and had to pay shipping  had item mess than   month before it stopped working      
1518,5.0,                       wow i don t know why i didn t buy this sooner  i doubted it would add much convenience but it s a total life changer  air fryers particularly excel at dehydrating and roasting vegetables like brussel sprouts in my opinion  also good for quickly reheating things  this particular one  the cosori  is one of the best  it feels well built  the square design makes sense  and the touch panels and presets are perfect      
1519,3.0,                       we love the air fryer  food just tastes great  however i noticed one of the screws i the cooking basket came out  when i replaced it i checked and all the others were loose  this seems to be a design flaw      
1520,4.0,                       amazing  best small kitchen appliance i ve ever bought  it is a little big sitting on the countertop but it doesn t bother me  i use it so often that i can t put it away as i would be getting it out all the time  i use it for everything  quick appetizers when my kids are  starving  before dinner is ready  frozen foods  and even a small whole chicken  frees up my oven for other things as well  cleans up in minutes      
1521,5.0,                       everything i ve made has been very easy and very good  i would recommend buying it with a small bread pan or something  the basket is good but you can really do a lot more with it when properly accessorized  also  before buying make sure you have space for it  it doesn t fit in any of my cabinets so it s going to have to stay permanently on my counter     
1522,5.0,                       it s fabulous  i ve made garlic park chicken wings for the super bowl  which came out crispy and juicy and golden brown  also  breaded boneless chicken breasts    grilled  chicken thighs   brussels sprouts  which aren t high on my list  were cooked according to the recipe in the booklet that came with it abd they were delicious      
1523,5.0,                       great product and easy to use and clean  from fresh roasted green beans to chicken this air fryer works wonders  the buttons are easy to use and have pictures for suggested time of certain foods  the size is good      
1524,5.0,                       received this today and used it for dinner and it s so great  even more than my instant pot  this allows me to literally throw a meal together in no time at all  interface is easy to use  cooks quickly   used   tbsp of avocado oil and everything was beautifully crisp in    minutes  love the presets too will edit as i use it more  but for now  completely in love      
1525,1.0,                       i am upset that i went by the reviews for this airfryer because its not great  my food is left dry and hard and i realized that this was a return  barf  and im assuming they returned it for the same reason  maybe i got a bad apple  id pass     
1526,5.0,                       best investment ever  buy this and you won t regret it  makes anything from salmon to grilled cheese sandwich  love it  easy to use and to clean  connects to wifi as well and comes with a cool app  lots of good recipes      
1527,1.0,                       will not shut properly  i thought it was the basket so i ordered another basket but that was a waste of money because it either won t shut or it pops open even with a new basket      
1528,5.0,                       finally got an air fryer  i love it for cooking burger patties  or fries  when i do it on the stove it makes a huge mess and i m not really into grilling  if you re thinking to get one just do it  it does take a lot of space on the counter tho         
1529,5.0,                       so simple to use  my    year old can do it  the presets have extra features that remind u to shake the contents of the basket  if needed  i love the app on the phone  the recipe book really opened my eyes  i didnt know you could cook all that in an air frier  everything is cooked to crisp perfection and we absolutely love it       
1530,1.0,                       i bought the cosori smart wifi    qt in december  it s now may and the touch display has stopped working  the temperature keeps shifting between celcius and farenheit without me even changing it and the pre set cooking buttons do not work anymore  very dissatisfied      
1531,5.0,                       my wife and i are still getting used to our cosori air fryer but so far we love it  we have cooked french fries which turned out great  steaks that were pretty good and vegetables that were pretty good but needed more seasoning  i believe the more we use the better we will like it      
1532,5.0,                       am so glad i bought this bigger one   it is perfect for all kinds of things   chicken wings and shrimp are my two favorite things i fry up the most     plus french fries and onion rings  of course   i feel so much better using the air fryer and not having my food soak up in oil   so easy to use and clean   very glad i bought it and i think you will be too      
1533,5.0,                       oh my gourd  i can t begin to explain how skeptical i was of this at first  but i was wrong  this bad boy can make meal prep easy and quick  the basket is a bit odd  but the food is what blows any negative point away entirely  this is amazing and i highly suggest this to anyone looking to buy an air fryer      
1534,5.0,                          years old and trying a new method was worth it   preparing meals for two working males daily is a delight now   the food is healthy for all and no mess or fuss   fish  steaks and sausage are perfect   potatoes and cauliflower  are great  i like using the parchment paper as a base  and foil under the meat   it is so easy to use and follow all the directions       
1535,3.0,                       love it  i want to give ut   star       but after a month of use   the screws keep getting undone    everytime now  last night i had to stick my hands down the disposal to pick up the screw  when i wash it   i have a screw driver near by         
1536,5.0,                       it took me a while to decide which air fryer to get  but decided on the cosori after thorough research  i was not disappointed  the cosori air fryer is amazing  i ve been using it almost every day since i ve gotten it  there s a ton of presets  but you can also put your own settings  manual   it s super easy to clean both the basket and the tray  i usually put aluminum foil under the holed tray to catch any additional drippings or seasonings for easy clean up  overall  would definitely recommend this brand      
1537,5.0,                       what a great addition to my kitchen appliances  i have used almost daily since my purchase  and so far  have a blast trying out new  tasty  healthy recipes that are also easy to cook and even easier to clean up  so glad i took the plunge      
1538,4.0,                       this is a good air fryer that performs well with a nice large square basket   alexa works very well with it too   the only issue is that mine has that strange  metal smell  even after a month  use   i don t think it will go away  but has not been a total deal breaker   not sure it s worth returning under warranty      
1539,5.0,                       love the bigger size and the shape   it holds more food than the round air fryers   it also cooks faster and i think this is because of the wattage   i ve noticed i use a lower temperature and less time to cook the same food   i absolutely an air fryer and i m really enjoying this air fryer      
1540,1.0,                       hi  i bought this a month ago and it has been great but suddenly everything i cooked started smoking so bad i could not use it   of course  my    day window ended   days ago but basically this is not usable due to the horrible smoke coming out the back      
1541,1.0,                       i wasn t impressed  food cooked in the device had a funky flavor that wasn t really pleasant  and yes  i did clean it before using it  the basket that holds the food is tiny  too small unless you re cooking for one person  it s very noisy and the controls aren t exactly intuitive      
1542,5.0,                       bought this for my wife and i ll be damned if i don t use it more than she does  plus  i have to admit that we like cosori products  they are reasonably priced   perform just as well ad the higher priced competitors  they look good and customer service is top notch  we had a small issue with the pressure cooker we bought and they took care of it  no questions asked  that goes a long way with me too build brand loyalty  would buy again      
1543,4.0,                       we find this thing air fries really well   we also really like how it reheats things like pizza and fries   the buttons are a little annoying because you have to press  pause  for it to register but we are getting use to it   also  we ve been cleaning it by hand because i m still leery about putting the baskets plastic handle in the dish washer   overall it s a good unit      
1544,4.0,                       works as advertised and looks great   very easy to use although the preset timing is not perfect   i had to reduce the suggested time or else my food would burn   trials and errors   wish it s shorter and wider so that the basket will be bigger for more food      
1545,2.0,                       the product worked great for first few months then the screws kept coming out and would not hold when screwed back in and the drawer started to not shut properly  i imagine that it will no longer function in the very near future  great taste and easy to use but should last longer      
1546,5.0,                       best purchase i ve ever made   this air fryer is the best one i ve ever seen  it s so easy to use  it is very easy to clean  and is nonstick  love love love  i ve even bought this for my friends and family   highly recommend      
1547,5.0,                       i wanted this for a while before i justified the purchase   i m so happy i got it  i m sure i will use it often      
1548,1.0,                       received our cosori air fryer today and the fan does not work  and it isn t warming up to the     degrees temp it is set to  along with that the touch screen doesn t seem like it s going to last long  you have to press the buttons a couple times each usually to get it to do anything      
1549,5.0,                       it s great and so much easier than deep frying   it is especially great for wings and fried chicken  carnivore style with pork rinds    recipes are great that came with it  too      
1550,5.0,                       bought it because i have heard from a bunch of people how awesome air fryers are and this one was rated one of the best  it is amazing  i use it all the time  super easy to use and really easy to clean  fries or anything you can fry come out crispy  and even cooked steak in it because the grill broke and it was pretty good  can cook anything in it  comes with a good recipe book with a lot of good stuff in it      
1551,5.0,                       i use this thing a lot   like a lot  but i cook almost everything at     degrees  and the original one didn t hold up  the handle mount basically melted off  worked great each time  and probably would have continued to even after the malfunction but i contacted the seller and let them know what happened with some pictures  a few days later  i had a full replacement on my doorstep  great product  so easy to clean  and great customer service      
1552,5.0,                       best  purchase  ever  fell for the millennial hype and got myself this air fryer on prime day for a deal i simply could not pass up  i use this about   times a week to make dinner for my boyfriend and i and now i am getting requests by him to make the same dinners i ve cooked in this    that s a good sign  all credits to the air fryer  lol   i am just extremely happy i can recreate my favorite recipes with less guilt  love the sleek design  especially the touch screen  very easy to clean as well  no issues with grease caking onto the rack so far  main reason why i wanted to get one was because i was tired of our apartment getting way too hot when i would use the oven so using this definitely helps with that      
1553,5.0,                       this air fryer is great  it is a decent size  it holds a good amount of food  we haven t had any issues with it  run it once or twice for the new smell to go away  cleans easily  not too heavy      
1554,5.0,                       i love love love it   it s big enough to feed a family of     i love the design and the way it cooks  all my friends own an air fryer and heard only good stuff about it  highly recommended     
1555,1.0,                       i have never had one before and i looked for months before settling on this one   i dont know if this is defective or what  but i have to use the app every time to set it up   i cannot use the touch buttons   as soon as it detects i am touching it i keep trying to adjust but it does not register and then times out   so i have to keep trying to start over and repeating   i finally gave up and just use the app   this sucks   because now i have to set it up for anyone esle to use or install the app just so they can cook  i thought maybe it was just my touch not working but girfriend has same problem   if it was not for this problem i would have given   stars   i wish it would work better      
1556,5.0,                       finally got around to using this and really like it   works better for some foods better than  other  but i do recommend it  great for frozen fries and egg rolls and things of that nature    also made chicken fingers from fresh chicken and they came out almost as good as deep fried      
1557,5.0,                       i don t know how i got by before owning the cosori air fryer   it s easy to use  cleans up quickly  and there are so many things you can make with it   i ve made everything from fried or bbq chicken  to steaks  to fish  to veggies in it  and haven t had a bad meal yet      
1558,5.0,                       the cosori air fryer met and exceeded my expectations  i use it several times each day    cooking time is greatly reduced and clean up is easy   it is easy to get distracted  so the shake feature is greatly appreciated   great size for a family      
1559,3.0,                       works well   basket and liner coating coming off after   months of use and only hand washing with normal dishsoap and sponge   i recommend paying for a better quality unit if you plan on airfrying often as it seems this will need a new basket and liner twice per year      
1560,5.0,                       as well as being extremely happy with my cosori air fryer  i must say that their customer service is excellent   the second time i used my new air fryer  after only a week and a half  i dropped the baskets on my kitchen floor and was unable to get them to lock together again   i contacted cosori and asked if they could help   they responded to my request within a few hours and sent out the new basket i needed right away   i really was blown away by how concerned they were and how quickly they responded   i highly recommend cosori       
1561,5.0,                       just buy it  you will not be disappointed   look online for recipes  facebook and instagram have groups for air fryers  even cosori has a group  most used item in my house  best purchase ever       
1562,5.0,                       i enjoy the ease of cooking with this air fryer  i don t use it as much as i thought i would yet but what i do cook in it cooks quick and tastes like it should as i still use my toaster oven for some things  jalape o poppers are great in it as is many other things  it cleans easily  i m happy with my purchase      
1563,5.0,                       i love this  i ve grilled salmon  made fried mushrooms and baked a little pizza in it so far  lots of buttons confuse me lol yet this is so easy to use with the touch screen and very easy to clean     
1564,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          great appliance  the non stick layer of my previous air fryer was peeling and i decided to get this instead  so far works great  cooks fast and even and not too loud  display is clear and easy to operate  i clean it by just soaking it then wiping with a soft sponge  no abrasive cleaners      
1565,5.0,                       i was a little skeptical to purchase this product because i was a longtime user of the pizza pizzazz  loved the pizzazz and thought the air fryer couldn t be the replacement  but i am glad i gave it a shot  it cooks food quick and thoroughly  i am very happy with the time and complete cook it does to nuggets  corn dogs  french fries  bacon etc  i highly recommend giving this air fryer a chance  you will be happy you did      
1566,5.0,                       i really enjoy using this air fryer   i love the smart features that sends alert to my phone on what i need to do next to the air fryer   i have used this air fryer plenty of times and i have not had a single issue   i definitely recommend this unit     
1567,5.0,                       in the summer i use my grill every night  as temperatures dropped for  winter i purchased this air fryer   it s been perfect for everything i usually grill or roast      
1568,4.0,                       inner basket and outer basket loosing coating in one month   easy to use  great flavor  big enough  the customer is going to replaced with a new one   coming soon the update they replaced the air fryer  unfortunately is already loosing the black coating  it is a shame because  i love the air fryer      
1569,5.0,                       got this air fryer for christmas and i ve used it just about every day since  love it  simple to use  perfect size for my needs  fits on the counter  easy to clean  the preset buttons are a real plus  so many out there to choose from but i m glad i got this one      
1570,1.0,                       i couldn t stand the chemical smell and wondered what that would  do to the food   even if it was going to go away i didn t trust the non stick coating   bought a stainless steel one with no smell      
1571,5.0,                       i received this as a christmas gift  even though i ve only used it     times  i really like it  it is easy to use and cleans up quickly  so far  the food has been good  i received the     qt size and glad i did  can easily cook for       people  at first i was surprised how loud it was  but we got used to that and it doesn t seem so bad now  i know i m going to be using it often      
1572,5.0,                       i bought this item on an impulse when it was available on the amazon treasure truck two weeks ago  i ve been obsessed ever since and have only cooked things in my air fryer  i can t compare it to other air fryers  but i love the tastes  how easy it is and i wipe it clean  it s the most amazing non stick teflon      
1573,5.0,                       where was life before this gizmo   actually cooks so many healthy options quickly for family of two  steaks  veggies  bacon  pizza  we have tried many things cooking  healthy and non healthy  love the recipe and instructions booklet  easy to follow  air fryer has cut down time in the kitchen and everything tastes great      
1574,5.0,                       love love love it  so easy to use  and it cleans very well   i found out that some of my friends have the same exact one  there s different options to use but you can also adjust the temperature and time to your liking  i would def purchase again  let s just see how long it lasts        
1575,5.0,                       im sure more expensive air fryers are better but for the price this is unbeatable  if you are on the fence about this purchase trust me do it  if you work long hours and still like having quality meals this will be your savior  take about    minutes total to preheat cook clean meals     
1576,5.0,                       i have been looking at these air fryers and finally bought this one   i could not ask for more   it is great   we have used it every day since   the french fries are much better than mcdonalds  and not greasy or mushy    everything we have made is awesome      
1577,5.0,                       love this airfryer  i highly recommend it  i use it a lot and love trying new recipes  it s a good size too      
1578,5.0,                       this thing is amazing    i just got it yesterday and decided to test it with some simple raw drumsticks with a dash of lemon pepper      mins later crispy skin   juicy flavorful chicken    this is crazy  how good this chicken is then i threw in a bag of frozen wing sections coated       mins later crispy juicy tasty golden wings   this thing just changed our cooking lives i m using this daily  no pots to clean now and all      
1579,5.0,                       i cant explain to you how much i did not understand air fryers  but with much pressure from friends  and hearing good stories  i bought one  so far i ve made some of the best chicken tenders and fries ever    with no oils  this is huge  so many different things to cook that come out crispy and crunchy     
1580,5.0,                       i ve had this air fryer for about   months now and it works great  my only complaint is yesterday when i went to  shake  it during my fry setting a screw came off and was at the bottom of the pan  i guess it s poorly constructed or mine was defective i reached out to costumer service and they didn t hesitate one bit to send me the part  outer basket  that was defective  they did it promptly and easily  without a doubt one of my best costumer service experience had  this is why i ve upgraded it to   stars      
1581,4.0,                       i would give this five stars but the drawer is difficult to open   i need to push on the top panel and pull on the drawer   otherwise food is great   it does fantastic pork chops   i do suggest buying boneless meat cuts if possible   haven t done bone in foods   large size would do four pieces of meat      
1582,5.0,                       wow   i am in love with my cosori air fryer  i have made meatballs  chicken wings  peppered thick cut bacon  bacon roses and i ve only had it for   days  i didn t want to get another appliance  but  i did because i love crispy spicy chicken wings  so after dusting chicken wings in a little baking powder and  frying  them i am thrilled with the results  they tasted like they were fried in oil  crispy perfection  seeing over      reviews made my choice an easy one  i can t wait to use the inserts i bought for it      
1583,5.0,                       read a lot of reviews because deciding to buy the cosori brand  not disappointed a all  very great quality product  the design is beautiful  after few weeks of usage i am very happy with everything  easy to clean      
1584,5.0,                       love it  i was worried it was too large at first  but knowing it can cook so much food at once really helps  i ve done a few things like burgers  chicken  frozen mozzarella sticks  reheated holiday left overs quickly   it s perfect  i always line with foil or paper and there is never any serious clean up  would totally buy again     
1585,5.0,                       our family loves this air fryer  we ve cooked everything from non fried seasoned raw chicken  to reheated tempura shrimp  to cooking frozen garlic bread  it allows you to preheat  change cooking temperature  cooking time  and pause cooking too which makes it even more helpful  we have used it several times a week since we bought it  it is very easy to clean  highly recommended      
1586,4.0,                       i was a bit disappointed that i received a damaged air fryer the first time  it worked great the first time  however the second time it started making a weird noise that it seemed like it was going to explode  i was overall disappointed in amazon that they couldn t seem to send me the correct air fryer after i requested an exchange   however  the wifi capability air fryer works great because you can manage it from your phone and the taste of the food is great  i am giving it   starts because we think that the issue was just on amazon delivery      
1587,3.0,                       i would not recommend cooking a roast in any air fryer  it burns up the pork roast on the outside and red in the middle and dried it completely out   i would say these air fryers are only good for food like french fries  cheese sticks  etc   some people like them  but to me  it s a counter hog if you can only cook comfort food in them      
1588,1.0,                       air fryers are great for reproducing deep fryer results without all the oil   this wasn t the case for me with the cosori air fryer   pre packaged foods came out dehydrated instead of  fried    fresh potato fries came out limp with burnt edges   in addition  both varieties were left with a slight chemical taste from the teflon material used in the air fryer   my previous air fryer did not have these issues   i m not sure if the flavor of other foods would be affected because i m not willing to try at this point   i didn t buy an air fryer to cook steak      
1589,4.0,                       this air fryer is great for cooking whatever you can get in the basket   but the handle on my basket keeps loosing up and the plastic finally cracked        no problem     got in touch with the seller  support people      days from now i will be cooking with hot air      until then will be cooking with gas on the maytag stove         
1590,5.0,                       i would not have lasted quarantine without my air fryer  i never thought i would like the ability to use my phone to control  but i do  cannot rave enough about this product  air frying will change your life   especially with kids      
1591,5.0,                       be careful of timing and also use an olive oil spray inside the unit  i find it cumbersome to clean in the sink i put it in my dishwasher on a lite cycle  comes out great and no oily smell at all  i am glad i got it  recommended by my daughter     
1592,5.0,                       thanks to all of you that wrote reviews   that is what convinced me that the cosori was the af i need   it s terrific and no problems   of course the first thing i tried was frozen shoe string potatoes    divine   i just tried wings for buffalo wings    another success   next in the menu is a boneless ribeye   also  love the cosori community on facebook      
1593,5.0,                       so many foods taste better air fried  the presets help eliminate a lot of guesswork  get that fried taste without all the grease  sometimes i ve head to soak the basket to clean  dishwasher safe was very useful after making the thanksgiving turkey in it     
1594,1.0,                       first of all the screws fell out of the basket  luckily  i was able to replace them two icons on the front panel don t work    pre heat    temp time  you can still use the frier  but have to use a separate timer to set correct cooking times for recipes  etc also  on facebook the  cosori group   many complain about other malfunctions only had it for   months  and used a few times  with cosori can leave a message or email  they want pictures  copies of ordering it etc  over all  great customer service with cosori worked for me  thank you cosori for replacing my af      
1595,5.0,                       i was surprised with how often i use this product as i had originally bought it for primarily frozen foods  it has not left my counter since i received it and i have used it on a daily basis  it does take some time to get a sense of how long it takes to cook certain items  some of the built in buttons cook food for way too long in my opinion  but once you get a feel for it and get the timing and temp down it does a fantastic job  i would absolutely recommend this product  especially compared to some other air fryers that cost over           
1596,1.0,                       touch pad doesn t work  i just have to see what button i can get to work and then keep checking the food      
1597,1.0,                       excited to receive this air fryer    same day i got it  i tried to cook fried shrimp  however  the touch screen button for shrimp doesn t work   as i pressed the other buttons  i discover that the rest of the buttons in the row does not work either   i sent customer service an email    awaiting a response solution  disappointed as i wanted to love this update  customer service was amazing and understood and will replace it      
1598,5.0,                       i love this thing     i use it for everything and it comes out perfect  my only issue is the timing for the steak    it takes more  than   mins  subjected time  to cook but i can easily adjust it     
1599,5.0,                       i have to say this is probably one of the better kitchen appliance purchases i have made  it easy to setup  cook  and clean  makes frozen foods a bit more crispier than placing it in the oven will leave a   year update later      
1600,5.0,                       i m loving this thing  about double the time of a microwave and ten times the quality  i have not mastered the  reheat  thing so i will not be getting rid of the microwave just yet      
1601,5.0,                       amazing     i wish i would have gotten this first  i have a small air fryer don t get me wrong it did the job but this   is great   i haven t used the app yet but i ll get to that and write another review      
1602,5.0,                       i haven t used it a lot yet but has been very easy to use when i have   looking forward to a lot more  it is very roomy  can t complain would definitely purchase it again  got the red  love it      
1603,5.0,                       from my cold dead fingers    this air fryer is nothing short of amazing   i was very please with this   i will take photos next time i use it              which will be today or tomorrow        
1604,3.0,                       i got this as a present for my wife  i have issues using the touchpad on the device  it is not responsive about     of the time  i have to use the app  to use the air fryer  if i don t have wifi   internet this device is useless      
1605,5.0,                       i have had this for a month and a half now and absolutely love using it  we use it for burgers  brats  wings  french fries  taquitos  reheating leftovers  that last one is especially nice  no more using the microwave to unevenly reheat food  the cosori does it so much better  i originally purchased it just for wings  to save on eating wings at a restaurant  i have come to enjoy its versatility so much  its easy to use and easy to clean  don t hold out  get this bad boy now      
1606,5.0,                       love this product  makes some very yummy fried chicken tenders as well as other things  it is very easy to use  and easy clean  is not to big and fits on the counter so nicely  i could not be more happier with this product      
1607,4.0,                       everything we cook comes out great   french fries  we ve only used frozen at this point   steak bacon  broccoli  all delicious   cleanup is a breeze   we have the    qt   didn t even realize that when i bought it   would not want to go smaller   this size is great  my only complete would be that it is kind of loud      
1608,5.0,                       i bought this air fryer after a coworker raved about his   i have not found that it duplicates a true  deep fried  experience  but i use this almost daily as a very handy convection oven   it is easy to use and easy to clean  reduces the amount of time to pre heat and cook   i ve cooked salmon  chicken wings  potatoes  boneless skinless chicken breasts  shrimp and veggies in it   i even baked some cookies and reheated a slice of pizza with no issues  very handy to have and saves time and money over heating up the large oven      
1609,5.0,                       amazing air fryer  first time trying one and i m in love  cooks just about everything   and quick  make flavorful healthy   delicious food  i make it a mission to soak in water immediately after use for ease of cleaning      
1610,5.0,                       love this it s now my favorite kitchen appliance  so when i first started using this i was a little skeptical bc every thing had a weird taste to it  then after a little research i found that you have to clean a ton of times to get rid of the taste and then run empty a few times  once i did that every thing came out amazing  i have   kids and this is the perfect size to cook all of us fries at once or chicken  getting the hang out of making things and finding new recipes to try is fun      
1611,2.0,                       persistent chemical taste too the food  tastes like burnt plastic  this is despite multiple things cooked in this fryer  it doesn t go away      
1612,5.0,                       arrived two weeks ago and has been in use continuously since  whole family enjoys  beware   recipe books banana nut bread  came out pudding even with an extra    minutes  so times do vary   there is a learning curve      
1613,5.0,                       easy to use  cooks my food as desired with a little tweaking   make sure you practice with the settings for your favorite foods as the settings are more of a recommendation  but work well for most foods   i love the alexa integration and the included app   works like a charm        
1614,5.0,                       perfect for on the go moms when fixing up meals for the family  i use this every single day to whip up the kids healthy snacks and meal preps for my husband and i  thanks to the timer it cooks for so much time and beeps while i multi task other errands without burning our food  and it s sleek modern finish matches our urban kitchen theme  i love the air fryer and it s the best and most used appliance in our home

1617,5.0,                       amazons pictures don t give this justice  when i thought of red i thought of fire engine red  that is not the case this is the most beautiful color red  almost a brick kind of color with less orange  i gave a good reviews although we haven t used it yet  it s my husband s toy      
1618,5.0,                       i love this air fryer  i ve bought three different kinds and returned them  i thought i would put it away somewhere when i m not using it  but i use it everyday and cleaning it is so easy      
1619,5.0,                       this is probably the first appliance that my husband has appreciated having on the kitchen counter top and regularly uses it for quick heating  toasting pizzas  sandwiches  etc i am still experimenting with indian foods in this  but anything that needs shallow fried can pretty much be air fryed in this  love the size too   perfect for a family of

1628,5.0,                       of all the things i ve bought on line this cosori air fryer is amount the top three   i try to use it for just about everything i cook   being single it makes things so simple i wonder why i never thought about one years ago   i have found that everything in the cook book may not work exactly to your taste so it s a try n adjust for next time      
1629,5.0,                       nice size to cook food within it  no oil needed maybe some pan spray to get the same color as you would fry in oil  but made some pork chops in there took just about an hour and some change to make    and let me tell you worth the wait  the pork chops had the crunch as it was fried but the nice juicy textures as if you were to bake and i fell in love with this air fryer  take my word for it  it can be kind of tricky at first honestly but it is worth the buy      
1630,1.0,                       thoroughly cleaned and made sure to remove all packing material when it arrived  even after four uses  it stinks up my kitchen with the smell of melting plastic  food cooked in the air fryer take on the taste of melting plastic the touch interface is also not very responsive and a pain to use      
1631,5.0,                       this is my second air fryer  i use it daily cooking everything from chicken to steaks to finish to vegetables  so far the outcome has been great  i had a smaller one and i had to adjust the time and temperature to get similar results  i attribute the difference to the larger volume  i highly recommend the product      
1632,4.0,                       kinda bummed out that it doesn t sear your steaks to the level that a pan skillet would  but it s very convenient   has plenty of options  i m happy with my purchase  you can easily put a pound rib eye in there and it will cook it nicely in about    min     
1633,1.0,                       it s a good thing this unit works with an app  the touchscreen is mostly unresponsive  even trying to turn on the unit is hit or miss  i will not purchase another item by this manufacturer  other than that huge screw up  it works pretty good through the app     
1634,1.0,                       this is my second air fryer from this company  cosori  when i started the air fryer i noticed a smoking and burning  and there was a piece of plastic stuck behind the top coil which had melted  i tried my best to clean the coil but the machine is still smoking  when i reached out to cosori for a replacement  the only advice they had was to try to clean it more  horrible customer service      
1635,5.0,                       i love this product  for one it helps me eat healthy  and secondly  its so easy to use  considering buying a third for my parents so they can eat healthy as well  so many recipes  really adds some variety to my meals and makes me feel better about cooking      
1636,5.0,                       it s everything i thought it would be and more   i love it  should have bought it long time ago  it s a big machine  almost  qt  but worth it cosori is rated in the    best      
1637,5.0,                       absolutely in love with this air fryer  i use it often  at least   times a week  my chicken wings have never tasted better  clean up is easy  if you re on the fence  go for it  you won t regret it      
1638,5.0,                       this thing is so amazing   there s literally endless opportunities  if you are a mom to young children you need this for those days where you want to pull your hair out  trust me      
1639,5.0,                       instruction book was simple to follow  recipe book is included with helpful hints  the fryer is very easy to operate and clean  so far we have had fried potatoes  bacon and chicken thighs  everything has been nicely cooked      
1640,5.0,                       i had another air product before cosori and it worked okay but it rusted   so far my cosori has worked well with my food preparations and does not appear to rust  i have used frozen foods and chicken as my main ingredients   i will try other foods as time allows   i am quite pleased with its performamce   thank you so much corsori   the preheat feature is a great feature      
1641,5.0,                       made the best chicken of my life  following a cosori recipe  took   hour to roast a  lb chicken  vs   hours in the oven  moist and delicious  will also never make salmon any other way  was so good  love this air fryer      
1642,2.0,                       worked great  but not even a year later the actual bowl that holds the food is warping and bending  that s a huge defect      
1643,4.0,                       i really like this air fryer  i didn t think much of them because i used to own a cheaper one  i bought this one to replace it and it has changed my mind  i use it literally every day  it s     w so it has a lot of power and it s very easy to clean  it s also dishwasher safe  my old one wasn t      
1644,5.0,                       this air fryer is really good and easy to use   the only thing i had a hard time with is getting the basket out   you have to push the tab forward and push down on the tab   once you get the hang of that it is a breeze   the food came out really tasty   my husband  who does not like scallops  ate some from the air fryer and now he can t get enough   i even cooked a meat loaf in it and it turned out delicious   i would recommend this air fryer to everyone      
1645,5.0,                       this thing will fry a whole chicken  that s really all you need to know  a whole effin chicken it s glorious want perfectly seared medium rare steaks  this thing will do that too fish  pork chops  fried pickles  wings  tater tots  i haven t found a thing this won t fry and it s superrr easy to clean  would buy again      
1646,2.0,                       changed my previous review down to   stars  i said originally that there s a major design flaw with this thing because the basket drawer falls right out  there is no stop  i like the cooking of the air fryer but this has become more and more an annoyance  i do not understand why designers made it this way  it is a hazard and a pain      
1647,4.0,                       where were you   lbs ago   i highly recommend this air fryer  as it promotes you don t have to add unhealthy oils  stand over a stove or keep a oven on for an hour to get the same results  cosori  you did a great job  the only criticism would be the electrical output  you may have to use a separate powerstrip  gfci      
1648,5.0,                       great little appliance  uses little space  easy to use  good price  less time and energy   doesn t heat up kitchen  sister recommended it   thanks sis      
1649,5.0,                       simplified vegetable roasting   can make roasted butternut  cauliflower  etc in half the time vs  the oven   baskets are easy to clean   was easy to figure out controls and start to customize settings to fit desired cooking results      
1650,1.0,                       i brought this air fryer back in may of      and loved it but now it s falling apart  the screws are coming out and i only use the air fryer twice a week  i will never buy this air fryer again      
1651,1.0,                       i only used this unit about a half dozen times over the last   months and it was great until it failed  suddenly  the wifi stopped working and the touchpad also doesn t work at all  i tried re setting  but nothing happens           
1652,5.0,                       life saver  fast  easy  big capacity  easy to clean  didnt figure out yet how to make good chicken wings and chicken drumstick  fot me it akways either raw or burned all other stuff as french fries  corn  chicken nuggets  samousas  qataef  baked potatoes  sweet potato etc is perfect     
1653,5.0,                       totally obsessed with our new air fryer  only wish it were bigger so we could cook entire meals in it all at one time  everything that comes out of it perfect  crispy  and with so little oil  even our kids are enjoying food they wouldn t previously touch  prepared in the air fryer instead of the oven  if i could fit two on my counter  i d probably do it      
1654,4.0,                       i love the taste  this is a nice product for   or   people  if your baking for more  using the oven is much faster  as the baking times are usually the same  the main thing i don t like  is cleaning two separate pans of the air frier  i feel like i waste too much water      
1655,5.0,                       i love this air fryer  i ve used couple of other brands and this one is amazing and one of the best  i basically use it for many things including chicken  salmon  and others  so it looks like its grilled  and its still juicy from the inside  cooked perfectly also its super easy to clean compared to other similar air fryers  and it has the option to keep the food warm which is nice to have i highly recommend it  its worth the price        
1656,2.0,                       per the mfg website and the warranty card inside the box  i tried to warranty the product and the customer service sad that sine it was purchased through amazon  i had to go back to amazon to warranty it  i don t currently have any issues  but it is unrealistic to have customer service refuse to help with this when all literature says to warranty it through the manufacturer  i won t ever buy this product line again even though i like the product      
1657,3.0,                       best product from treasure truck  who needs a stove or microwave with these product  we use it daily and the food taste greatupdate  the handle has started to crack from use  update    the handle has now fallen apart  i was supposed to get replacement but never did     
1658,4.0,                       alexa    preheat the cosori   works like a champ   the cosori has proven to be a well performing air fryer and grill   however  it is noisy   not end of the world noisy  but don t plan on watching tv and air frying in the same room      
1659,4.0,                       this is my  nd air fryer   they are amazing   i have cooked every type of meat  vegetable and reheat everything  all is good   i hardly ever use my oven i would have given this   stars but   screws fell out and i had to replace them otherwise all is good      
1660,5.0,                       we love our air fryer   so easy to use  everything so far has been good   a few things i could of cooked less or longer  but learning      
1661,5.0,                       i was very skeptical about this being any different than our oven but it actually is so much better  you seriously can use the tiniest amount of oil to get that deep fried texture  i occasionally do a sos free cleanse and this works perfectly for giving a nice crisp to oil free cooking as well  it also cooks everything in less time than it would take in the oven  i seriously haven t turned on my oven since we ve bought this  so far we ve made fried pickles  crispy tofu  french fries  frozen and fresh cut   baked potatoes  and my mom tried cooking burgers in it and said they came out absolutely perfect  crispy on the outside and juicy in the middle   this was a mother s day gift but it has really been a gift for the whole family      
1662,5.0,                       i m not going to lie my husband bought this and i thought it was gimmicky  but it s awesome  we can make anything from fish sticks for the boys to chicken wings quickly and evenly  the interior is easy to clean  and the unit is big enough to accommodate actual meals  i thought it would be a cabinet hog  but it s always out because we use it almost daily for something      
1663,5.0,                       easy to use  easy to clean  best appliance for when you don t want to turn your oven on in the heat or need to make something faster or crispier  very happy      
1664,5.0,                       had an old air fryer for   yrs but this new  updated version is fabulous  once you preheat  didn t have that feature before  the food you cook is not dried out and browned  no soggy chicken skin or unbrowned brats  fast and love the temperature control i have     
1665,5.0,                       i finally took the plunge and after a lot of research decided to purchase this one because of other reviews   i wanted a larger air fryer  one with preheat and adjustable time and temp   this one is great and everything has come out delicious   i also purchased the accessory kit and love it too      
1666,5.0,                       i have owned a number of air fryers and i can say this cosori has been my favorite so far   it cooks very well  fairly quiet and easy to clean   i believe i paid a fair price for it and delivery was fast   i hope it doesn t disappoint me as i have been telling all my friends about it      
1667,5.0,                       i was trying to figure out if i wanted an instant pot or air fryer  i have so many small kitchen appliances  this is one of the best purchases i have made  it cuts cooking time in half and does a really good job of cooking more healthy  you don t have to use heavy grease or oils to get food crispy  i highly recommend      
1668,5.0,                       this is a very well thought out product   easy to use  easy to clean  very high quality throughout  i m quite happy with the product and find i use it several times a week  even though i don t normally use many kitchen gadgets      
1669,1.0,                       check the user reviews  problems with touchscreen  like many others  couldn t even turn mine on because the touchscreen was non functional out of the box   found that the basket and lock seem very flimsy and doubt it would have lasted long   returned immediately and got a philips      
1670,5.0,                       absolutely love this   such excellent quality  tons of options w hich include a pause feature which comes in very handy   i researched alot of different brands and this was definitely a great decision      
1671,5.0,                       pomade cooking sooooooo much easier and tastier as well  i can t stop telling family members about this  it s just made my life easier in the kitchen  hopefully it s also sturdy and stays working for a long time     
1672,5.0,                       the corsori  hot air fryer is my best amazon  purchase i ever made so easy to use and cleaning is a snap  have used it for three days now  we just love it  when i have more funds i will buy one for my daughter thank you corsori      
1673,5.0,                       seriously the best purchase i have made in years  i can start dinner  walk away and not worry about it burning or overcooking  it turns off on its own and even tells you when to  shake it    flip it  turns off til you turn it back on  everything is so juicy and good less clean upall pros     
1674,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          absolutely love it s beautiful and big but perfect size amazing quality you can use with baking paper to make it easier     
1675,5.0,                       i made breaded cauliflower and breaded eggplant slices  crispy and no oil involved  i also made a   inch thick bone in pork chop     minutes  flipped it at   minutes  very moist  it comes with a recipe booklet but i just google air fryer recipes  the clean up is very easy  just soapy warm water and a sponge      
1676,5.0,                       i  cooked frozen potato puffs last night that turned out great and today i made garlic parmesan chicken wings from their recipe book that came with the unit that turned out great and was crispy and tonight i m going to cook  a rib eye steak      
1677,5.0,                       great product  even better customer support  you can set it and control it with your smart phone  it comes with recipes  you put them in the fryer and it automatically cooks them  it works great as an air fryer as well      
1678,2.0,                       i absolutely loved this air fryer  it has a large basket so i was able to make food for my whole family at the same time  however  it suddenly quit working on me last night in the middle of making dinner  i ve had it less than a year  up until the last few months i was only using it  at most  once a week  sometimes every other week or two  these past three months we ve used it about   times per week  what a bummer      
1679,5.0,                       used our air fryer for the second time tonight  the first we didn t make the chicken moist enough so it came out dry but the second time we used the recipe that is in the recipe book that comes with the product and it was delicious   we ve only had it   days so i don t know about durability but it s easy to use  flavors retain well and it makes unhealthy things a bit healthier  the only con is it s hard to clean but i think that s true of any other air fryer  i would still rather clean the air fryer than worry about disposing off giant amounts of oil after use      
1680,3.0,                       i bought this air fryer as an upgrade may          it s april         and it stopped working midcook  i had no issues with it prior and no reason to expect it would stop working  luckily i kept my old air fryer but this one was substantially more expensive and it did not last a year      
1681,5.0,                       my whole family loves this because its easy quick   adds so much flavor to the food in the way it cooks  the customer service is a   i ve dealt with them two times   they quickly   satisfactorily took care of my situation  i will always buy this brand   highly recommend cosori       
1682,1.0,                       this thing is soooo bulky and has such a big electric pull that it blew up my kitchen wiring system also  to clean it you have to unscrew and screw the basket  you need tools and all to do this it is not convenient or good at all a waste of my          
1683,5.0,                       great little air fryer by an unknown brand  to us    we ended up ordering a second one for my in laws to enjoy  and they too are happy with it   super easy to use      
1684,5.0,                       i love love love this air fryer  it is so easy to use  even my kids use it  especially in times like now with covid  knowing that they can easily use this air fryer to make meals safely and full of flavor with a healthy cooking method makes me have peace of mind  i highly recommend  easy to use  easy to clean  perfect gift     perfect for a busy family      
1685,2.0,                       i have not tried the product but there is no recipe book included as advertised  may i know why the recipe book is not included  i paid         for this item      
1686,3.0,                       this works well  when you get used to it  but they sent me a red one instead of black  not the biggest problem but i can t leave it out because it doesn t match my kitchen at all      
1687,1.0,                       biggest pile of junk ever    screen quit working which resulted in not being able to connect to wifi at all so we could even cook with it  the most retarded idea of having to use your phone to work the air fryer   i recommend buying a air fryer you can control from the screen not a phone   say yourself some time and money and buy a different brand       
1688,4.0,                       this fryer is a great option for big families like mine    people   the basket capacity allows us to cook a meal in two times  we tried french fries  chicken drum sticks  meat balls and everything was delicious  my only comment is that the recipe book doesn t indicate how many people can eat from each recipe  something to improve in the next version      
1689,2.0,                       the two times the product worked the food was delicious  it was easy to clean and didn t have to stand in front of the stove frying food  the concept of the air fryer is amazing but since it is touch screen  it turned on when it wanted to  it is very frustrating when you pay so much for a product and it just stops working      
1690,5.0,                       we love it  i ve had it for a year now and it s a time saver especially when cooking meals  my kids love using it too to make their go to snacks only downside to it is that the quality on the basket is not great  it it finally cracked on my after a year  but cosori has great costumer service that they replaced it right away      
1691,5.0,                       just got this air fryer and i m really happy with it  easy set up to wifi and app  make sure you take all the plastic out of the baskets  it does have a funny smell when you first use it but i m assuming all of them do  if you register it on the corsori website you get another year warranty for free      
1692,5.0,                       this air fryer is great   i m still in the learning phase  and have had a few misses  but i have gotten my sandwiches down perfectly   easy to heat stuff up quickly too   love it      
1693,5.0,                       great purchased   i use this almost daily   love the selections so i don t have to guess the temperature and time   and the clean up is easy   i m glad to have made this purchase   i also ordered the accessories  separate order  and they are great      
1694,1.0,                       i bought this last year was excited to use it  unfortunately not long after   i was hospitalized for about       months  when i got outi was ready to use my brand new air fryer  to my surprise  after following the instructions and plugging it up air fryer never even turned on  i was very disappointing     
1695,5.0,                       there are many things you can cook with this fryer besides french fries and chicken wings  although the wings and fries come out very crispy  there is definitely some trial and error  but working at it  it s well worth the effort  i have convinced several friends to buy an air fryer      
1696,5.0,                       the first air fryer i bought last year had all sorts of gadgets and gizmos   like a rotisserie function and three shelves  i thought i was going to love it  wrong  i gave air fryers another shot  choosing this one with the simple basket  but large enough to cook our family meal at one time  love it    it cooks evenly  browns perfectly  holds plenty  is simple to use and oh so easy to clean  this is the one        
1697,5.0,                       this is a large unit   make sure you have room for it before you purchase   it works very well and appears well constructed   time will tell if basket holds up  you can use this easily for a family of         
1698,2.0,                       has several screws in actual basket that you slide into the air fryer and they come loose constantly  i have to re tighten them every time i use it which is becoming a pain     
1699,2.0,                       control panel has lots of fancy buttons which are just presets for temp and time  all of these air fryers are basically convection ovens with removable tray  this unit spews steam from front edge which i don t like and it took several runs to get rid of initial manufacturing plastic smelling output  my overall satisfaction is pretty low with this unit  but i missed my return window  i am thinking about asking the manufacturer for a refund directly      
1700,5.0,                       i am so happy with my cosori air fryer  it has really helped make cooking meals at home interesting   tasty   i just ordered the accessories   hope to test those out soon   after reading various reviews i also bought a misto   it works great with the fryer      
1701,4.0,                       the cosori takes up a lot of room on my kitchen counter   i ve only used it once to cook a small sirloin lamb chop it came our juicy  to the right pinkness  but it tasted a little gamey i am used to cooking lamb chops on a grill pan    like this way better      
1702,5.0,                       my husband even loves it and that s saying a lot  steak  fish  cookies  veggies  bacon     endless       
1703,5.0,                       best thing i have gotten myself  easy to clean    also looks great in the kitchen    cooks everything fast while not losing the quality in the cooking process    meaning not having your chicken too dry  i love it      
1704,5.0,                       had it for a week  love it so far  fast  easy to clean  food comes out tasting great  the cookbook that comes with it is very good too  the appliance uses quite a bit of juice  amperage   so if you have old wiring in your house  circuit breakers may pop if another high amperage appliance is in use  in my house   using air fryer at the same time as the stove is ok  but with microwave  the circuit breaker needs to be reset      
1705,5.0,                       this air fryer will do anything you would ordinarily put in oven or fryer  everything i ve used it for has come out great  unlimited cooking  and has great recipes  great quality as i can see why it s rated    of them all      
1706,5.0,                       i love to cook but wasn t sure i would like an air fryer  my daughter bought and recommended this one and we would often talk about how much she loves hers and what a great job it does  i now absolutely love mine too  great quality product and easy to use     
1707,5.0,                       omg  this is the best      i ve spent in a very long time   i ve had this now for a couple of weeks  and i use it nearly everyday   i ve made falafel  fries  brussel sprouts   to name just a few   the most impressive feature is how you can make crispy veggies in less than    minutes  whereas previously i would cook veggies for over an hour at      i know can get better results at a fraction of the time   couldn t be more pleased with this purchase      
1708,5.0,                       my favorite kitchen gadget    the best thing ever   i ve cooked every meal this week in this air fryer    meat and sides  perfect and quick meals  you can cook anything in this      
1709,5.0,                       this thing is awesome  i use it   times per week and it never fails to amaze me at how well it cooks foods whether fresh or frozen  have recommended to many friends and family  even if you cram the basket full of stuff  it still cooks everything thoroughly      
1710,5.0,                       had my eye on this for a while now  and decided to pick it up during prime day it s wonderful  it is easy to clean  cooks food quickly  comes with a full color cookbook  and    month extension on your warranty  if you are thinking about getting an air fryer  i would highly recommend this model the only non positive thing i have to say about this appliance is that you have to be mindful of where you place this in your kitchen  there is a steam vent located in the back  which can billow out quite a high volume if you are cooking food with too much oil or moisture in it  however  this will only occur if you go above the very clearly stated tolerances of this device   as was the case in my one and only experience with such      
1711,2.0,                       was happy with the size at first but not worth it the screws holding the basket together continuesly fell out  and into the basket holding the food  over the six months i owned this this air fryer  it finally all just fell apart and i lost most of thr screws  so i cut my loses and bought another ninja air fryer  super happy do yourself a favor ans keep looking  thus is a cheap and stupid construction  i believe you are better off with name brand     or at least not this brand      
1712,5.0,                       we love ours  it s good size    for instance we fry x  frozen chicken patties with no issues good quality     we enjoy it so much  we have purchase another one for a christmas gift      
1713,4.0,                       it was a great buy and nice to have a  second stove   fries cook fantastic in it   other meals are very good but do not come out with that  fried crunch  i thought it would have     
1714,5.0,                       this appliance is by far the best thing i have added to my kitchen  i can cook for all   of my family and everything is healthy and flavor is amazing  no more cooking with oil for anything  healthy french fries for my son and the chicken breast comes out amazing  highlight recommend this to help cook healthy for your family      
1715,5.0,                       i had a request for help with something that they did not have to do for me  i sent an e mail to the customer support team and got a favorable reply right away  the air fryer is easy to use  holds all the food we want to cook in it  cleans easily and the food comes out perfectly cooked  thank you cosori      
1716,4.0,                       recommend next generation with more than a single level   tons of on line recipes   some many things so easy to cook without making a big mess of your oven      
1717,5.0,                       i have always hated heating up my convention oven just to bake a potato or make oven fries   now i can make everything from banana bread  to french fries   using less power  less time  and much less fat   with the same or better taste    it is a game changer for me      
1718,5.0,                       easy to clean  easy to use  doesn t take up much room on the counter  doesn t heat up the whole kitchen and is fast  i have cooked many things and it s all delicious  this is my favorite kitchen appliance        
1719,5.0,                       great product  i m new to air frying but was very pleased with this  i worked in a smokehouse for   years in the kitchen  definitely the cleanest way to fry  what i like most is it s more like a toaster oven if you don t add any oil  i made wings in the pressure cooker and crisped them up in the air fryer to finish them  juicy crispy wings  will eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow      
1720,2.0,                       super annoyed with this air fryer the buttons have lost ability to begin the airfryer   i spend    minutes trying and maybe if im lucky the airfryer will turn on   it was great in the beginning but with low use  once a week  it now doesnt function properly less then a year later     
1721,5.0,                       i love it  cooks really fast  some of the setting are too long to cook  for example the fries setting i cooke    minutes less  the bacon i cooked a little longer  i like that you can adjust the temp and time of any of the pre settings      
1722,5.0,                       wanted an air fryer  but wanted to spend less than      and ordered this on prime day   the price was right and it is easy to use   both baskets are dishwasher safe  which i love   it even came with a cookbook and conversion chart for ease   it performs flawlessly    the pre sets are nice too   looking forward to using it more and more      
1723,5.0,                       my kids loveee fries and i didn t want to continue cooking them in oil  so i decided to invest in an air fryer  this thing is not only stylish but also it does it s job fairly well  and the bacon    omg so crispy   yummy      
1724,5.0,                       i was skeptical about buying an airfryer but took the leap  i love it  easy to clean  great recipe book  love the tuna chipotle melt sandwich  and my chicken wings were crispy and very tasty  i also bought frozen fish filets and cooked in   minutes no greasy pans      
1725,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i love this product so much  i did a review of it on my youtube channel as i have provided in this review  this is probably my favorite purchase ever on amazon  a      purchase      
1726,5.0,                       not bad  after looking at all the reviews we did not want to buy something and then have to buy a second one larger   this one had such good product and customer support reviews i decided to purchase it   this is our first air fryer and so far i am happy   easy to use and easy to clean      
1727,5.0,                       i never owned one but granddaughters love nuggets   with a recent flood my son s family lived with us for a few months   his was so easy to use  i ordered this one and it is great   easy to use and wrapped asparagus with bacon comes out delicious    recipe book included  love it      
1728,5.0,                       i love this air fryer  unfortunately i ve only used it for some frozen asparagus and frozen chicken nuggets but both turned out perfectly  it s easy to clean as well and it s sooo modern looking  fits the vibe of my kitchen rly well  it s pretty heavy and big but the matte black looks so badass i don t even care     
1729,4.0,                       finally followed all the rage and got an air fryer  a friend had this one so i went with it  it s easy to use  makes delicious food  and cleaning it hasn t been tough at all  my only complaint is it came in the original box which had been retaped   i assume it is used and didn t come with the cook book that should have been inside the box  other than that  i love it      
1730,5.0,                       i liked everything about this air fryer  but it s not for me   i see that it is a healthier way to cook  but i will continue with the  old  way   i m just to set in my ways to change i guess   this is a well made product  and i even found room for it on my countertop  i would recommend this to anyone that wants to cook healthier      
1731,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i used the air fryer about   times when all of a sudden  smoke starts coming out while in pre heat mode  i made sure i cleaned the basket thoroughly  tried again  and still smoke comes out while trying to pre heat  i didn t attempt to cook anything as i don t want to start potential fire  i contacted support and since the   year warranty is over the agent was not able to help or replace my item  i m really disappointed as i enjoyed using the air fryer      
1732,4.0,                       it is great  i m no cook  but the air fryer makes it so easy   i love this thing  the only problem is    the door on my air fryer wont stay closed unless i prop it close  it s really frustrating  i should have sent it back when i got it  but other than that    no complaints about the air fryer      
1733,1.0,                    no era lo que yo esperaba  ocupa mucho espacio  el sabor no es el mismo        
1734,5.0,                       great house warming gift  can cook alot of things and the interior is non stick  wipes clean and rinses very easily  favorite food is wings   it has a preset button for wings that cooks them exactly the way i like  yeah it takes    minutes with the preheat but worth the wait especially since you dont have to feel as guilty as fried wings in a traditional fryer     
1735,5.0,                       here are some tips    use oil spray in the basket     experiment with temperature and time to your taste     be careful with the sliding button guard used to secure basket   it is plastic and fragile     enjoy  and share your food       
1736,5.0,                       just received this fryer this week and love it already  beautiful wings  quick chips  and delicious chicken  lots of room and easy to clean  i had a smaller size and needed to upgrade  glad i did      
1737,5.0,                       easy controls  didn t think i would use it very much but i use it all the time  it makes frozen fries and other frozen snacks taste much better than the oven and in less than half the time      
1738,5.0,                       love  love  love it  it takes a little playing around with the temp and time for cooking some items  do not cook at the temp time listed on frozen bagged items unless you want it burnt   once you get the hang of adjusting these  it is amazing      
1739,3.0,                       easy to use and very convenient  i have used for about a year now  the screws on the basket fell off which is really annoying  this is not a product made for durability  other than that  if you need a large size air fryer this does the trick      
1740,5.0,                       so far this air fryer has exceeded expectations  i was a little apprehensive seeing a few reviewers mentioning problems they had  however  i experienced none of these  its presets work very well  but it is also a huge bonus to be able to set the time and temperature  the design makes it simple to use and easy to clean  i think that the only thing i can complain about is that i wish the max temperature would be just a little bit higher      
1741,5.0,                       i absolutely love my air fryer  it s so easy to use  you literally just press a button  walk away and your food is done a few minutes later  i use it for just a out everything         
1742,5.0,                       until this air fryer  i had a      failure rate when i attempted to make fried chicken  i used my cosori to make crispy fried chicken and sweet potato fries and it came out delicious  it s very easy to use   the digital buttons are easy to see and the presets are great too      
1743,5.0,                       i love it easy to use no need to heat up the kitchen with the oven and it is easier to cleanno need to keep the kids away from it they can t reach it     
1744,5.0,                       love that it s easy to clean  easy to use  i can cook a   lb  whole chicken in it  a small ham    sausage patties  preformed by manufacturer  so they re small  love hamburgers cooked in it  pork chops are delicious     
1745,5.0,                       i just got it  it arrived soo fast i love it   no more deep frying in oil or using lot s of oil  healthier and easier to prepare foods  thank you amazon      
1746,5.0,                       read a ton of reviews and compared features on every model on the market   very happy with the purchase   we are a family of     so although a larger basket may be a little more ideal  for the price and features of this air fryer  we know we made the right choice      
1747,5.0,                       i like that everything i cook taste great it s just as good as frying it or baking it which was a major worry of mine but overall i was very impressed and satisfied     
1748,1.0,                       haven t used it yet  been trying to get my phone to connect but it doesn t even see the air fryer  followed the directions  power cycled  still can t see it on my bluetooth  so  can t do the thing i bought this model for  great      
1749,5.0,                       i opened the box christmas morning and thought i am sending this back   looks way to complicated   decided i am going to do this    i started with something easy  tater tots and a corn dog  they turned out great  cleaning the basket was a breeze   so much easier than cooking with oil    this week i will be on to bigger and better recipes   my husband bought this on december  st and i thought i would lose my extended warranty  i wrote the company and explained that i didn t open the package until the   th and they gave me the extra year warranty     
1750,5.0,                       i have owned this air fryer for a month and have used it pretty much every single day  great design  easy to clean  easy to use  appropriate size  and convenient      
1751,4.0,                       great productspacious inside and works well only peeve is the release button between the   layers of the airfryer dish  kinda cumbersome to take apart n cleanwould have preferred an easy release operation or is mine the bad one of the batch       
1752,5.0,                       i was hesitant to buy an air fryer   now that i have this unit  i m not sure how i cooked without it  this is an amazing air fryer and i m grateful that i invested in it      
1753,4.0,                       the fan on this is really low and sounds grindy  i am thinking about taking the unit apart myself to see if there isn t something i can do to improve this  other than that   i really love it      
1754,5.0,                       bought another for my son and they love it also      
1755,2.0,                       i actually never used this item  as soon as i opened the box and realized that this item s outside casing  is made entirely of plastic  i put it back in the box and immediately returned it  had the item been metal i would have been more inclined to try it and keep it  it looks cheap especially for the price point   if you are used to nice looking appliances maybe skip this one      
1756,5.0,                       this is our first fryer        read all the reviews     folks mentioned the receipt book was really good and accurate      well  i m here to tell you     this fryer is awesome        easy to use      easy to clean  threw the baskets in the dishwasher     we made the  fried  chicken and we loved it   can t wait to try more receipts             
1757,5.0,                       i can cook anything in this appliance   i love it because it s easy and tasty   wings are especially good   also steak and burgers   cleanup is quick and you can put it into the dishwasher      
1758,4.0,                       i really like this air fryer  it is very easy to operate and it does a pretty good job of air frying  its weak point is that it is limited to heating no higher than     degrees f  i am not getting the crispy browned chicken wings that  i crave  i believe that if the unit could heat up to     degrees then it would easily get better results with making crispy browned wings and potatoes  etc   other than that  i am completely satisfied with the unit      
1759,4.0,                       good product overall but one ongoing issue   handle screws keep coming loose  and from screwing them back in so often  the screws are now stripped requiring new screws   unfortunately because we are now outside the    day return window  we will have to find   purchase replacement screws      
1760,5.0,                       first time using the air fryer with excellent results  wings are very good  as well as fish  vegetables   chicken  we had a problem with one of the unit components and received very timely  professional and attentive product support  customer service from cosori was superb  we truly appreciate finding a product line and support like this     
1761,5.0,                       finally bit the bullet and bought an air fryer  one of the best purchases i have made in quite some time   love this fryer  love this brand and never even heard of it before   i have had it now a little over   months and it makes the best wings   i haven t made much more in it besides things for my grandson but wings hands down are great      
1762,5.0,                       great air fryer   not too big  but has plenty of room  especially if cooking for up to     controls are easy  and the easily removable basket is a breeze to clean      
1763,4.0,                       this  fryer  is easy to use and clean  it comes with a lot of recipes and a general overview of times and temps for cooking foods  the basket is pretty large and easy to pull out insert  some things get browner than i would have expected and some not at all  but overall we re pretty happy with the product      
1764,4.0,                       this is a great af  only issue which is do big deal  steam does come out at the bottom but it s minimal and doesn t happen all the time  i knew this going in  the shape of this is way better for my counter      
1765,4.0,                       the only thing i disliked was the taste  i guess i m just a truly fried food nut      
1766,5.0,                       easy to use and clean up afterwards   have tried several of the recipes that came with it and all turned out as expected  not like the picture but it was edible       won t use in summer months but during the colder seasons this thing puts out some heat   just adjust the times per your preference for meats as it tends to cook fast      
1767,4.0,                       the fact it works from an app on your phone is a great feature  the app also has recipes and it notifies you when the time is up  it is not quiet but it is not loud  i upgraded from a frenchmay that had rust in the basket  so far so good with no rust  i d recommend this item      
1768,1.0,                       do not buy this product   i could not get the display panel to operate and could only operate it through the app so i returned my original purchase and ordered a new one   i had the same issue with the replacement except that the wifi function wouldn t work and i couldn t even use it with the app   customer service is only available m f     which are times i m not home and trying to use this   i was very disappointed because the reviews were great but stay away from this one       
1769,5.0,                       so easy to use  i get a notification on my phone when my food is ready and it comes with a ton of recipes  so much is preprogrammed it s literally as easy as         highly recommend      
1770,5.0,                       in love to cook in my cosori air fryer  i just bought another for my mom  in the picture is a lime chicken that i made in the cosori air fryer  it was delicious      
1771,5.0,                       an airfryer is the perfect tool to have in your kitchen during a pandemic  i use it almost everyday to heat up  cook  and bake food  never have soggy cold mcdonalds fries at home ever again      
1772,5.0,                       it s everything we hoped for in an air fryer and more   we use it most nights and the food is perfectly prepared   my kids use it more than me and am happy to eat whatever is prepared   i bought a second model and sent to my daughter in florida   she also loves it along with her roommates      
1773,5.0,                       this product changed my life  literally  i am able to make anything with it  i stopped using my stove and oven pretty much  this air fryer is very easy to clean  food doesn t stick to it  i totally recommend it      
1774,4.0,                       the non stick coating in the basket is already starting to peel  this concerns me   i always hand wash and never use metal utensils       
1775,5.0,                       my parents bought one first  and although i made fun  as soon as we tired it i bought one for myself  i went from a  i don t cook mom  to a  i still don t cook but i cook more still with this baby   definitely recommend     
1776,5.0,                       this product is amazing  i love it and i had been spreading the word about  it is a easy to handle  my main reason that i bought this product was to be more healthier  my husband like fry food and his cholesterol went very high so this situation open my eyes  i posted a picture si u can see for yourself how beautiful and real the dood looks  like is real fried  my hubby was amaze and ask how do they invented this product no idea but i loveeeeee it  thanks         
1777,5.0,                       i have had this air fryer a few weeks and it is great  i have been cooking chicken breasts and chicken wings and they turn out great  the food is cooked all the way through and leaves a nice crunchy layer on top which i like  the non stick surface is wonderful  it is very easy to clean and i dont have to scrub at all to clean it      
1778,5.0,                       i hesitated for a long time before i purchased an air fryer  i did my research and this one offered everything i wanted and the price much better than many other brands  i have made burgers  french fries  sandwiches  steak  toast and even salmon  everything has turned out perfect      
1779,5.0,                       i bought this unit based on the reviews  appearance and size   it looks better than the rest of the competition and it has to sit on the counter due to its weight   it is easy to clean and use   i use the stove top about half as much as i use to   i even make steak in it   i wish these things had been invented long ago      
1780,5.0,                       this air fryer works terrific  it s very easy to use and clean up is a snap  i did not have luck cooking a steak as per the recipe book   but it does do well w  air frying many items and i did do up some roasted veggies that came out great  it s essentially a convection over but much easier to clean  really love this appliance      
1781,5.0,                       works great and easy to use   have already used it for chicken wings  fried chicken  fries  and fish   cooks frozen food without any trouble   a must have  especially if you re looking for healthy alternatives to deep frying      
1782,4.0,                       i have made homemade french fries and chicken wings which came out delicious   the only reason for not giving a   star is that i don t feel it s big enough for a family of four   it s prefect for the two of us      
1783,5.0,                       i really enjoy cooking with my air fryer  however the first week i had it i dropped my drawer of the counter and cracked  i reached out to cosori and showed them a photo and they replied within a day asking for a best shipping address sending me a new one   great service  great experience  great product      
1784,1.0,                       it worked just for    days and game over  it doesn t get hot anymore  the worst thing is that amazon give the same quantity of days to return the product as if you live in usa  i feel like i just have been robbed the food didn t smell when was made with the fryer  the only thing that i did like was the sandwich made with it not nice      
1785,5.0,                       obsessed with this air fryer   have told all of my friends to buy it and have even purchased multiple as gifts  we use it to make potatoes multiple times a week  but everything we have tried has been amazing  russet potatoes  sweet potatoes  chicken  tofu  and different kinds of veggies   we look forward to experimenting with new recipes each week thanks to this guy       
1786,5.0,                       love this fryer  if i could use three or four at the same time without blowing a circuit i would cook everything in them  everything cooks quickly  thoroughly and if needed  crispy      
1787,4.0,                       perfect for cooking for my small family  not only does it cook in a much shorter time frame than the oven  it gives a good char on the outside and inside is still moist  the only thing i don t like is the smell the machine has while it s on  i m not sure how to describe it   it s like having the new car smell but not as pleasant  i m sure in time it ll go away but overall  i still love this machine  it does the job well      
1788,4.0,                       was already flaking pieces of black non stick surface after   month of use   it heats evenly and performs as advertised  but questionable quality of the non stick surface      
1789,1.0,                       purchased it a month ago  the first problem was a lot of steam coming out from the fryer   i contacted the customer support and they issued a refund  i kept using it occasionally and yesterday the fryer just burned out   a lot of smoke from burned plastic  fire alarm and so on not recommended  we enjoyed the food but the quality of this device is low      
1790,5.0,                       so far the cosori air fryer has worked perfectly   we used it continuously for the first week and now once or twice a week   used for cooking chicken wings  breasts and tenders  bacon  eggplant  fries and a few more that i can t remember   the best part is cleaning   soak it in some soap and water followed with a sponge and all done  no scrubbing   the wire rack sometimes needs a scouring sponge but not bad recommend as a quick easy way to cook      
1791,5.0,                       made  fried  chicken tonight using recipe from cosori cookbook   was very good not all recipes are wonderful  but this is a keeper      
1792,4.0,                       the product is good  on one hand i like the size as it allows to get a good portion cooked  but on the other hand it takes a lot of space in my dishwasher     need a bigger dishwasher now         
1793,4.0,                       it takes a little time to get use to the keyboard and separating the basket from the base is difficult  be sure to hold the top of the unit when removing the basket from the heating unit   other wise it s a great unit and the taste of th  food is excellent      
1794,4.0,                       this is a great fryer  it came just as advertised  the only thing i see that needs to be updated are the cooking times for foods  when i tried it according to what the times were suggested in the cook booklet my foods were either under cooked or over cooked you have to remember to preheat the fryer before each use  it has a button to preheat  this is very important so foods can cook accurately this is the only concern  otherwise great product       
1795,5.0,                       i highly recommend the cosori air fryer   it literally cuts cooking time in half and everything i have ever made is absolutely delicious   my families favorite is blackened salmon   so easy  the salmon comes out moist with an amazing blackened crust i also love how easy it is to clean   it has a non stick surface   you can also throw it in the dishwasher finally the company s customer service has been very responsive and great to work with      
1796,5.0,                       so here s the deal  why would a professional chef with two convection ovens like this  because sometimes you re only cooking for two and you just want easy fast convenient heat that actually seems to fry things without oil  which this does  easily  just be prepared to cook things a bit longer than a recipe says and don t forget to  shake       
1797,5.0,                       very satisfied with this product  got it as a gift for my so but everyone in the house loves to use it  easy to use  easy to clean  and you can always google recipes  i ve been making croissants  pizzas  banana bread  chicken wings  whole chicken  egg white bites  french fries  etc       
1798,5.0,                       i am so in love this air fryer it is so easy to clean and so easy to use  i have made quail and oh my gosh it comes out so juice and tastety  i would recommend this fryer to anyone      
1799,5.0,                       i was very hesitant to but an air fryer and am very glad we did  we cook fries  biscuits  pizzas  corn dogs  chicken nuggets  and many other items that are even better in this than the oven  i love to place it outside in the summer to not warm up the house like the oven would have      
1800,5.0,                       i love this appliance  i use it for almost everything  i use the microwave much less  i m just very satisfied  it took a little getting used to  because i prepare small meals  that means the time to cook is usually less than listed  i now check midway through the time  so i know how much longer to let it cook  good always comes out amazing  i have turned family and friends on this product  they all love it and use it a lot         
1801,4.0,                       it took some adjusting to at first as i was used to my previous air fryer after replacing it with this one  so far it has done the job  it seems that the cook times are a little longer with the cosori      
1802,5.0,                       was pleasantly surprised  easy to use  menu food settings makes it a snap  food tastes very similar to fried  with breaded shrimps being the exception  i would highly recommend this fryer      
1803,5.0,                       great small kitchen appliance that has been very versatile for us   we have used it for simple snacks to full meals  the size is perfect and clean up is super easy      
1804,5.0,                       i ve had this air fryer for a few months now  and it performs exactly as described  the capacity is large  it s easy to clean quickly  and the provided cookbook instruction manual contains some nice recipe ideas  the only major drawback is its size  it takes up a lot of counter space  so you better have a larger kitchen or a good place to store it when you re not using it      
1805,5.0,                       i have used this every day since i bought it a month ago  it is such a fun kitchen appliance that produces healthy  tasty meals i have renewed my interest in cooking and am now trying different recipes and ideas  much to my husband s delight you will not be sorry you bought it  i promise      
1806,5.0,                       oh my gosh  please stop what you re doing and order this air fryer with now  i can t believe i ve been missing out  it s perfect and easy to use  my roasted potatoes and chicken was delicious      
1807,5.0,                       i have wanted an air fryer for a long time and i researched a long time before i purchased this one and i have no regrets buying it  the only thing i wish it has was a dehydrator but that is easily overlooked because of all the other amazing features     
1808,5.0,                       i love the machine   i use it at least once a day and now i am buying food that i know will cook incredibly in the cosorio   don t leave the page without purchasing it      
1809,5.0,                       everything absolutely everything comes out better tasting than expected   brought this item because wife wanted one   i now use it more than she does  great  get it      
1810,5.0,                       we have been getting good use from this air fryer  eating vegetables has never been easier  and tastier   leftovers taste   x better  and get that perfect browning on your smores in   min  the knob is user friendly  just choose the cooking time and temperature  cleaning is a breeze  the inside tray just pops out and you can get to all the edges and crevices  does take up quite a bit of counter space  but well worth it and looks sleeker than other air fryers in the market      
1811,1.0,                       amazon refused to help   defective first time out of box  buttons don t work and   customer service reps no help  second couldn t even send an email of my receipt and told me to do it myself with another email of instructions after    minutes of trying   manufacturer offered to replace free with receipt and photo of bottom id info   amazon very unhelpful      
1812,5.0,                       got it fast and it works great   i was afraid it would heat up my kitchen counter  but it doesn t even get very warm   i was also worried about the fan exhaust at the back  but i have it on the counter near the wall and it s not hot enough to harm the wall paint at all either   i ve used it    times now and the food is always great   i love it      
1813,5.0,                       the first one i ordered had some of the buttons inoperative   amazon quickly responded and sent me a second one and to no avail  still had some buttons not working   i called cosori support and spoke with them on the phone about my issue   i wanted to make sure i wasn t improperly operating the machine   after speaking with them directly  they sent me a brand new one directly from them and it works amazing   the food tastes so good with very little effort   definitely happy with my purchase and with the a  customer service from amazon and cosori      
1814,5.0,                       this is my first air fryer and was only educated on which machine through internet research and user reviews  that being said  this machine is a little bulky and required countertop rearrangement  however  the best kitchen purchase made in quite some time  i have only had it for in use for    days and have created      meals per day in it  nice healthy way to cook foods i normally would put in a pan with oil      
1815,5.0,                       the air fryer itself is wonderful  and we have cooked anything from wings to dessert in it   the part that heats up can be cleaned fully if you use a bottle brush to get to the part that heats up      
1816,5.0,                       omg    where has this product been all my life  super amazing  and you can air fry absolutly anything  we have done chicken  super juicy   toasted ravioli and tator tots are to die for    can t believe i didn t add this to my kitchen sooner      
1817,5.0,                       this makes the perfect bacon  i haven t tried anything else  as i just got this last night  but so far  so good  i ll update after i ve had it a little longer edit  i have made several things in this and you really can t go wrong  it s easy enough that even my    year old can use it  i highly recommend this product      
1818,1.0,                       couldn t get touch pad to respond   waited on hold for a representative for quite a while then decided to give up and just return unit i was so excited to try the air fryer  now i am just disappointed     
1819,5.0,                       this is a wonderful little air fryer  easy to use  stainless steel constructing keeps it from getting extremely hot on outside  once i got it down on how much   how long to cook  it has been a great addition to my cooking  it s very easy   cuts coming time at least in half  pictured a salmon pattie   fried zucchini  it was fantastic  don t forget to add your spices  the recipe is what makes the flavor  enjoy       
1820,3.0,                       this came and definitely did not seem new   i don t think it was used to cook anything  but it had sticky spots on it  the box had clearly been opened and retaped   and the user manual had been opened   this is disappointing when you expect a new item especially when it is a gift      
1821,5.0,                       this is my second cosori product and they haven t  disappointed  it is hard to get chicken wrong  size is plenty to cook enough chicken for    it took me a bit to master the fries but are fantastic once i did  still need to try other things but so happy with it so far      
1822,5.0,                       my family has been using the air fryer routinely since we bought it with no regrets   my teenagers use it for snacks and it works great for veggies and potatoes for sides   recently we had an accident and broke the fryer handle   within   hours we had a response from customer service indicating they were mailing us a replacement free of charge   a great company that stands behind their products      
1823,3.0,                       i received this one damaged   i tried making fries for the first time but it burned all the fries on top of the fryer and the fries that were in the middle didn t cook too well  i expected this to be a lot better   i don t think i d ever recommend it to anyone     
1824,5.0,                       love  love  love it  never thought i would prefer air fried over deep fried but this machine works just as it should  easy to use and easy to clean  we ve had this for several months now and it really appears to be well made  we went to my parent s house and they had one  big brand name  was not non stick and the design sucked  managed to burn my finger when i tried to disconnect the basket from the drip pan  mom was like   oh yeah  that gets hot   very satisfied with this product      
1825,1.0,                       so the  buttons  never worked  but as i was able to connect to the app i was able to use the fryer  i recently got a new router and now  since the  buttons  don t work i cannot get the fryer to connect to the internet  useless  piece  of  crap      
1826,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          easy to use   i have only cooked a few things so far   i like that it provided recipes to try   garlic parmesan chicken wings came out really good  so far i have also cooked fries and bacon   chicken wings cooked on preset time   may have to check fries and bacon cooking time   i recommend shaking items like the directions suggest half way through  easy to clean and pretty quiet   i would definitely recommend this product      
1827,5.0,                       very good to cook in we cooked tater totts in ours the minute we got it and it took    mins to cook a full pan so crispy its wonderful plans are to try fried pickles  chicken nuggets  onion rings and more      
1828,5.0,                       we bought this due to its popularity on amazon  after several uses  the inside fastening screws were coming loose and caused the inner chamber to break  we called cosori customer service and they happily sent the replacement part at no charge  we have since tightened the screws and it works perfectly  i have  recommended it to my buddies     
1829,5.0,                       i love this air fryer    we have literally used it every single day   i hate baking add i feel as though it makes everything dry   it s fast   easy to use  and makes my life that much easier the only thing that i will say is that i wish it were easier to clean   it does have a non stick surface but any fried grease that still remains if cooking several batches at once can need extra elbow grease to remove   i use a toothbrush to help me clean between the grates so that helps all in all i love this appliance      
1830,4.0,                       it s pretty straight forward to use  but it tends to overcook the tenderloin we cooked in it  but maybe we are still getting the hang of it  overall  happy with the purchase      
1831,5.0,                       the best purchase i ve ever made i cook almost everything in this air fryer  i could never get steak right until i bought this  this thing is god sent  like the food gets cooked super fast  it s flavorful  and juicy on the inside  don t even question buying this    just buy it        
1832,5.0,                       the only disappointment i have is coming back a week later to write a good review only to see it for     less than i paid  but it s a great investment  quick  convenient  and the only thing i haven t enjoyed more air fried is my steaks  it cooks them well i just still prefer cast iron or grill for that      
1833,5.0,                       i love it  the food comes out cooked and tasty  easy to use and clean up  tried some of the different recipes andso far have liked them all  even the french fries came out good      
1834,1.0,                       i love the design but hate the air fryer  maybe i just got a faulty one  but the pan pops out during cycle and stops the whole process  sometimes wont start up again   totally not impressed with this air fryer  takes constant babysitting  or it shuts off       
1835,5.0,                       this is the best air fryer  i ve been cooking up a storm  i bought it to make french fries which i haven t even  made yet  instead i ve made a meatloaf  open cheese sandwich s  grill cheese sandwich s  italian sausages  grilled onions  and a bunch more  so worth the money      
1836,5.0,                       appearance wise the product looks very sleek  opted for the black color straight forward to use packaged well no dent or damages if you ve been looking for an air fryer this is the one      
1837,5.0,                       i bought and waited a few weeks to write a review  i honestly like this machine and it s super easy to clean  i wouldn t invest in the wifi model  only because i stood near it the entire time while it cooked and didn t need to check my phone  the wifi and app does work though  i would say   buy it      
1838,4.0,                       works well  i ve used my cosori most every day since i purchased   food comes out great  saves me time in cleanup  cleaning is generally easy but with splatter that occurs around the heating element that area is difficult at best to clean   i don t think this is individually a problem with cosori but air fryers of this type build in general   maybe in the next generation but i knew this going into the purchase   very good product  glad i purchased      
1839,5.0,                       this thing works great  cooks chicken wings and fries very well and evenly  it can be tricky using presets  but the touch buttons make it easy to adjust time  temp on the fly  the basket can be tricky to detach from the shelf  but otherwise the unit is easy to operate  very satisfied      
1840,5.0,                       this item was purchased out of curiosity   i know plenty of people who have purchased different brands but i choose this one because of reviews   the only issue i m having is finding a temp to cook cutlets that don t dry the meat using this  however it was a great purchase and i dont  regret it   it beats using oil to fry anything anymore         
1841,5.0,                       this air fryer is one awesome appliance   we love it  fries come out crisp and brown  steaks are perfect  clean up is a breeze  we line the bottom with aluminum foil  just remember to wipe out the fryer itself or you ll have some smoke      
1842,5.0,                       i ve used this almost everyday since i got it  it s awesome and super easy to use  my only complaint is that it sounds like a jet engine when it s in use  otherwise it does a fantastic job of crisping you foods without any oil      
1843,4.0,                       i love fried foods and was skeptical about  air  fryers  but i gotta say  ater making fried chicken  french fries and more  i am thoroughly impressed with the cosori  two minor issues   the first few times it stinks up the kitchen as it burns off production oils   i suggest running it a few cycles outside before using  though it does not affect the flavor of the food  also  it would be good if there were a more thorough guide for general cooking of foods not provided in the cookbook  however  all is fine  and their customer service was great when i had questions      
1844,5.0,                       i was skeptical about buying another appliance that says how easy and quick meal prep can be  but i am now a believer in my new air fryer  i have used it every night for dinner  i have cooked fried chicken  salmon  french fries  sausage balls and i even baked a cake  i love this cosori air fryer      
1845,5.0,                       this cooks great  the buttons that change temp and time seem to not always make contact and move  that is the only thing i don t care for  it cooks great the touch pad i do t care for     
1846,2.0,                       no cook book  few instructions  only instructions were a few taped on    like take the plastic out before using   some stuff online  but not a lot of help can t say how it works well or not  don t know how to use it        
1847,5.0,                       this was our first air fryer and i am glad we purchased this one   the fryer is easy to use and easy to clean   the ability to make quick healthy items is fantastic   the interface is easy to use and the system works flawlessly the troubles i hear about other machines not working well and are difficult to clean are not a problem with this machine overall a solid product      
1848,5.0,                       bought it for my son for college and he loves it  so i turned around and bought one for the house too  love reheating things as well as making fries in it  he cooks chicken and fish in his at college  just use foil to line and clean up is so easy      
1849,5.0,                       i find that there are many more uses for cooking than i originally thought  the cleaning is so easy  i squirt dishwasher foam into the tray   assembled   scrub with a kitchen brush  separate tray  rinse top of tray then lower tray then i m done       
1850,1.0,                       do not buy    if i could give zero stars i would  our display panel did not work and trying to get a replacement was nonexistent  i bought the extra insurance  amazon contacted the company and they no longer sell this model  so we got a lovely amazon digital gift card and a busted air fryer  customer service through both was a complete waste of time  save yourself the time and trouble and get a different air fryer      
1851,5.0,                       my first try   the air fried chicken wings were amazing   and guilt free       just batter egg  and flour your chicken and cook for       minutes   depending on the crispiness you want   i understand you can cook them without flour and egg for a more roasted bake texture   get one   you will not be sorry         
1852,1.0,                       i like the product functionality  but it stopped heating suddenly    it start the fan but don t heat at all  so an air fryer without heating    strange brands short life         
1853,3.0,                       i m so sad i have to leave a bad review because i loved and raved about this air fryer when i first purchased it and continued to do so until it randomly stopped in the middle of cooking one night and shut off  now its completely broken and won t turn back on  i used it twice a week every week since having it and had no issues until now  i just think an air fryer should last longer than    months  especially when i payed full price for it      
1854,5.0,                       as a single guy i love this machine   its my best friend    you can cook healthy food with no hassle in a very short time and its very easy to clean it  what else would like to hear about it           
1855,5.0,                       i was not sure if i would like an air fryer or use it much but i love it  it was hard to understand all the buttons and there are a few quirks to learn but the food tasted amazing  juicy and not dried out  the clean up is super easy  i put aluminum foil under the basket and its super easy clean up  the basket is large enough for a family of    and because the cook time is cut in half of a conventional oven you could prepare a meal for   in   batches  i tried to cook the french fries recipe and it came out overcooked because i cut them thin i think the recommended size was      thick  overall i m enjoying the fryer and thinking of different kind of foods to try      
1856,5.0,                       i ve already used this a few times and it s amazing  it makes cooking healthy food so easy  and delicious  can t wait to make a million more things with it     
1857,5.0,                       wife was like   what the heck is this thing    she checked it out  did some sample runs and talked to some people at work that owned them  now it is used all the time  here stove is lonely now  she loves it and wants another  bigger model to compliment this one  game changer       
1858,5.0,                       love this appliance  i cook shrimp  salmon and veggies in it daily and they are delicious  my only issue is that i have not yet been able to sync the wireless component to my phone  a little disappointed about that  so i need to try again      
1859,5.0,                       love it  great for reheating fried foods like chicken fingers and french fries that go soggy in the microwave  makes great chicken wings  great for frozen foods like taquitos and egg rolls  we even cooked a small casserole in it when our oven broke      
1860,5.0,                       we borrowed a cosori air fryer from a neighbor to make burgers and it was amazing  i bought one for myself to take to college  i don t really need to go out to the community kitchen to cook meals now that i have this  i recommend this air fryer   it s the best one we ve used so far      
1861,5.0,                       i had been looking at air fryers for a while now but i was on the fence as to which air fryer i should get  i saw this cosori     qt air fryer on an amazon deal and decided to get it  i am glad i did because this air fryer is great  i have used it to make many different snacks meals and i simply love it        
1862,5.0,                       i love this air fryer  since i received it   wks ago  i have cooked a whole meal in it ever night   i put aluminum foil in the bottom tray  for easy clean up  just throw away foil no mess    then put basket in tray  everything i have cooked turned out great     
1863,5.0,                       this has got to be the easiest  most efficient way of cooking consistently delicious food  i m simply amazed  everything i have made has been so tasty  brussels sprouts  cauliflower  potatoes  chicken  salmon  tuna steaks  all of it has been restaurant quality  if you are thinking about getting an air fryer  this is the one  consistent results  ease of use  versatility and simple cleaning  make this my go to cooking method from now on      
1864,5.0,                       what i love about this air fryer is its capacity to handle larger quantities of food than the previous air fryer i used  also  it does a great job of cooking a variety of meats and vegetables to perfection  i don t find the pre sets to be all that useful because i tend to use tried and true time and temperature settings based on past experiences  but the controls allow great flexibility in setting time and temperature much more precisely than my previous air fryer  cleanup is very easy      
1865,4.0,                       works well  basket is smallish  basically an air fryer is a gimmick  can t cook a while meal for more than   person  easier to use an oven and often the oven is quicker      
1866,5.0,                       love this air fryer do to the larger size and cooks food faster  had a year now and had no problems except for basket is hard to put in and pull out as it sticks a little      
1867,5.0,                       so far we ve loved everything we ve cooked in it  when it arrived it was super easy and fast to set up the app on my iphone which was a good thing because the touch screen was mostly non responsive so the only way to use it was with the app  i called the friendly customer service and the second they determined there was something wring with it right out of the box they said they were sending a replacement right away  it will arrive in   days and i assume it will function as intended very impressed with their customer service response      
1868,5.0,                       i love this cooker   very easy to use and i use it for left over warm ups as well as regular recipies   wish i had bought it earlier   i feel healthier already      
1869,5.0,                       have cooked coconut shrimp  rib eyes  chicken  potato wedges  different vegetables and everything cooks very well  the only cleaning is the basket and the pan  sponge with a bit of soapy water  rinse and that s it  the inside compartment stays clean  i looked with a flashlight  very simple to learn and use  read the manual and in less than    minutes your ready  nice bright keypad with several presets make it very easy to operate  this appliance may turn your microwave into a glorified water heater      
1870,4.0,                       my first air fryer  food cooks and crisps great  cleans great in the dishwasher like it says   it did not get   stars because  like many reviews i read before buying  it still smells the whole house up with a burnt hot plastic smell every time i use it  i ve used it enough that if this was just some coating or oil that needed to  burn off  or wash off  it would be gone  i m keeping it  but unhappy with burnt plastic smell at every use      
1871,1.0,                       screw came out  luckily caught it inside my mouth  touch functions didn t work since day one  except few  don t buy this one      
1872,1.0,                       dead on arrival  no power  nothing      
1873,5.0,                       i will be purchasing two more of these  one for myself and one for my daughter and son in law  the kids use it at least   times a week and love it  friends of theirs threw their air fryer out because you could not even cook enough food for   at one time  this one is large  easy to clean and everything they ve made has been delicious      
1874,5.0,                       what a great air fryer  the square basket gives you more room versus the competition  easy to clean  multi functions for ease of use  hands down so glad i chose this one over others  plus  plus it fits nicely under counter when not in use or in our case on a shelf  friends have the big bullet type model and we hesitated a purchase of a fryer just because their s is so big  sure it takes a little experimenting with but for all you newbe air frying peeps  less is better on any oil used  definitely found your quick go to guide a huge help  great product      
1875,2.0,                       gives off a strong smell of burnt plastic in the kitchen and worse off on the food  this even after five times of use and deep cleaning  nice aesthetic design  convenient size but will neither use again nor recommend to anyone  will go ahead and return this product      
1876,5.0,                       this is my third and favorite air fryer  the quality is terrific  it cleans so easily  it is user friendly and looks great too  absolutely love it    stars      
1877,4.0,                       perfect for cooking vegeatbles in short time   reheating frozen food without the need of preheating got it on cyber monday for good price  totally worth it        
1878,2.0,                       it arrived quickly  it s a beautiful machine  sturdy  but sadly ours did not work  the power button just would not work  we opt d to return for refund  seems some are just defective and other work wonderfully      
1879,5.0,                       my daughter and i love the cosori air fryer max xl  it is easy to operate and to clean  it is a very good size to fit on our counter amongst our other appliances  we don t use parchment paper and have no problem with clean up      
1880,1.0,                       i was very happy with the product and used it     times day  however  after   months using  i found the screws keep coming out  i have to really pay attention and keep checking it every time when i wash it  because this i don t put it into the washing machine      
1881,1.0,                       crispy is one thing  charred is another  following the instructions i tried making roast chicken  fried chicken  fries  and the results were abominable  everything was dreadfully burned  not sure what to say  expected more out of an  amazon choice   the machine should be better calibrated to cook and distribute heat as to not end up with these awful results      
1882,1.0,                       showed up with nothing but the machine  sent it back      
1883,5.0,                       after reading evaluations  this air fryer was a great value  and knowing i could always return to amazon  i purchased   i don t know and can t think of anything more i d like from an air fryer  the only negative comment i could offer is it is loud  but i would guess all air fryers are loud      
1884,5.0,                       we love this air fryer  we just got it and made zucchini fries that came out amazing  it s super easy to use and clean      
1885,3.0,                       i docked points for the east to clean because the bottome tray is already peeling and rusting  i ve reached out to the company listed for technical support and it goes straight to answering machine that says no one is available   this is after less than   months of use and it was used maybe every other week      times      
1886,5.0,                       just got this today   did asparagus in it  they turned out great   easy to clean my only issue was it was delivered in a box that said what it was with these being so popular right now  i d prefer no one know what in the box      
1887,5.0,                       i love this machine  i honestly think i use it almost every day at least once for everything from just reheating to cooking  i can t imagine what i did before i got this  it s so easy to use and super easy to clean  can t think of anything negative to say at all  highly would recommend this      
1888,5.0,                       i love this air fryer and use it almost everyday   super easy to clean i usually just let it soak with water and soap so no need to scrub  every thing slides off  also i cook bacon in this thing and wow the most perfect bacon      
1889,4.0,                       this air fryer is pretty good   the basket is huge and super easy to clean   the wifi setup was simple and this fryer works great with the app  it even reminds you to shake what you are cooking  half way through   however     and the only reason that i m giving it   out of    the front display buttons do not function properly and are     unresponsive   i wind up using the wifi app which is far easier anyways      
1890,5.0,                       i decided to purchase this air fryer and give it a shot because i liked the features  look  and the basket was larger than the one i have  i love this new air fryer   best choice i made was buying this after i debated for months      just wish i pulled the trigger sooner      
1891,5.0,                       we bought the air fryer just a week ago  so far it has been a breeze to cook fish  chicken and vegetables  my favorite this is the clean up  it is so simple to simply wash and replace the bin   i look forward to trying out different meals with the air fryer    goodbye fry daddy and the smell i give the air fryer      satisfaction      
1892,5.0,                       this is probably my favorite purchase of all time  not even kidding  i ve been on the keto diet and this air fryer ya completely changed the game  i don t even feel like i m on a diet anymore bc anything i cook in here tastes like a dream   i d give it   stars if i could       
1893,1.0,                       i purchased this item in sept        the item title clearly stated there was a   year warranty   the unit failed   days ago and now corosi will not honor the warranty   i notice the item description not longer states the warranty term   its unfortunate a company will not stand by their product and honor the warranty term      
1894,5.0,                       easy to use  easy to clean and does a great job cooking   i bought this for french fries and it did not disappoint    just do not over fill   a       
1895,5.0,                       anything that is normally cooked in an oven that will fit in my air fryer i will air fry it comes out crispier juicier and taste   x better     
1896,5.0,                       amazing product  we had bought an air fryer years ago and were very unhappy  we bought this due to the reviews and were not disappointed  we use it several times a week and love it  food is flavorful  clean up is easy  and the family is happy      
1897,5.0,                       this is the second air fryer i have owned and i have not regretted the purchase for one minute  it seem so much more powerful than the first one i owned and provides a nice even cook to whatever you make in it  it s easy to use and easy to program with the display screen  highly recommended      
1898,5.0,                       i love this thing  cooks even   fast  and keeps the juice in  soon as i got it i went on a chicken wing bender  wish i bought one sooner  it also makes some of the best toasted sandwiches ever  im amazed how it toast so evenly without burning any side      
1899,4.0,                       not as easy to clean as other models and i really wish it came with something inside so you could stack your food and succsesfully cook more smaller things at once so it wouldn t take as long to make a decent sized batch  my favorite thing to make in the air fryer is chicken wings  just coat with seasoned flour  spray with water and cook  super crispy and delicious      
1900,5.0,                       very happy with the purchase   it s much bigger than my previous air fryer and better designed   i had a nuwave before and it had a mesh basket which was a nightmare to clean   no problem with non stick finish so far and it s a breeze to clean   makes one fabulous new york strip steak      
1901,5.0,                       it s great to use makes great easy meals   this itemi ve fallen in love with this product  it has made cooking sooo much easier and healthier      
1902,5.0,                       love this product  works great  easy to use  so easy to clean  only complaint is the basket sometimes pops back out after it s running a bit causing the machine to pause if i don t push it in securely      
1903,5.0,                       i love my air fryer  so easy that my kids can use it with out the worries of turning the gas stove and cooks in no time  no more greasy fries  my kids also loves to make broccoli  brussel  sprouts     
1904,5.0,                       nothing to dislike  made zucchini fries  hasselback potatoes  french fries  poached eggs  steak  fritatta  all in the first week  several batches of wings    whole wings each time split   not a clunker in the group  the presets are spot on  lottsa room in this one  got the    qt  model      
1905,5.0,                          a must buy   so easy to use  we are loving the effect of air frying      
1906,5.0,                       almost perfect transition from using oil to fry up everything from shrimp to wings   bacon came out perfect if you use the presets that are given  obviously you can adjust time and temperature as needed   would definitely recommend to all my friends   only issue is once you re used to frying in oil the flavor profile stick with you  no amount of salt and pepper can cover that up      
1907,5.0,                       omg what can i say i never knew my food could be so good air fried  im in love and this air fryer is the bomb com it allows to be paired to your phone so it will alert you when your food is done  just amazing      
1908,5.0,                       i am so pleased  i use it for pork chops  turn out perfectly juicy   frozen fries  tastes like restaurant fries   and so on  everything turns out great  we love this       
1909,1.0,                       i purchased this because it s just me and i thought it would be easier and clean up  i have to say that i was so excited for this machine and when i received it as soon as i took it out of the box it s smell was of burning plastic   i removed everything inside and gave it a good cleaning  i made some french fries and all i could smell was the burning plastic and it was so strong that i had to open up windows   i also have to say that it made the food taste of the smell also   horrible and i m very unhappy with this product        
1910,5.0,                       great air fryer  this fryer is very big as compared to my prior air fryer  comes with great instructions and some recipes  cooked chicken for my family and they really enjoyed it and even thought it was actually fried  clean up is easy and simple  cool a complete meal in minutes  definitely a great investment      
1911,1.0,                       i ordered this           and the nonstick coating is bubbling and peeling off  i ve only ever washed it with a little bit of warm water and a soft sponge      
1912,5.0,                       very easy and quick to use  food comes out hot  crispy and delicious  got one for my parents for christmas i liked mine so much  definitely worth it      
1913,1.0,                       my basket came broken   it worked  but the broken part made the basket very delicate and difficult to keep closed   i contacted customer service who promised a replacement part that never came   it s now junk and i ve only used it a couple of months      
1914,5.0,                       we love the air fryer  it s amazing  and we get to eat traditionally unhealthy food in a healthier way  it s also great for things like chicken strips  fish fillets  etc  that you would normally bake  they all come out way better in the air fryer  we even made burgers      
1915,5.0,                       so easy to use and love the white color  looks great in my kitchen  i use this every day for my meals  would       recommend and have suggested it to multiple friends      
1916,5.0,                       this make the best homemade french fries and without the guilt of so much oil fried mushrooms are yummy squash is too      
1917,5.0,                       liked all  easy to clean and enjoy the rapid cooking food one   meat is delicious in the air fryer and i think i will get one more     
1918,5.0,                       we love it     easy to use to cook vegetables  french fries and warm up left overs too   be sure and get the   piece accessory bundle when you order the air fryers as well  it comes in handy   great product      
1919,5.0,                       awesome  the family uses it daily  recipe book is great and the recommended cook times are spot on i recommend purchasing a utensil kit to maximize the machines full potential      
1920,5.0,                       love it  my only advice is to trust the process  if you follow the cooking guide  the food will come out perfect  i will say the first time or   using it  there was some uneven cooking but i think it s worked itself out     
1921,2.0,                       i really want to   star this  i bought it based off all the wonderul reviews and the food does indeed taste amazing  however  the coating on the bottom of this air fryer peeled after one use  figured no problem i ll exchange it  so thats exactly what i did  the  nd one i got same exact results  big bummer  read manual thoroughly and washed accordingly  returning the  nd unit as well and now back on the hunt for a reliable air fryer      
1922,1.0,                       the item i received appears to be used     
1923,5.0,                       would not recommend this product  i used to be able to cook bacon in the airfryer but now it produces lots of smoke even after cleaning it a few times      
1924,1.0,                       ordered the wifi model         it will only work via the app downloaded on to my phone   no way to manually operate it   the air fryer itself    is awesome but it s inconvenient to only access operating it via the phone app      
1925,4.0,                       i am very happy i purchased this  it is extremely easy to use and i am having very good results with different food items i am cooking  for me it is just a learning curve of exactly how long to cook different foods to the degree of doneness i like  but it is so easy to operate you can check the progress of your item frequently to make sure you are getting the result you want      
1926,4.0,                       easy setup  easy to program baked breaded chicken as well as a couple baked potatoes in this air fryer and both turned out great      
1927,5.0,                       we upgraded from a much smaller airfryer to this one and i couldn t be happier  i use this for everything  it s perfect and the preset time and temps work perfectly  i cook biscuits  chicken  fries  and even reheat leftovers that i dont want getting soggy in the microwave  this baby is perfect  it will not fail you in the most desperate times when you have those dreaded cooking days      
1928,5.0,                       so far  this unit is magic  air frying is a great concept and has changed the way we cook for the better  this unit works as described     
1929,5.0,                    me encant   super  por muchos mis expectativas  ten a dudas en comprar una freidora de aire  y luego de buscar opciones vi esta y la compr   y no me arrepiento  es perfecta  la comida queda bien cocida  crujiente y muy buen sabor  parecer a que se hizo de la manera tradicional y no con una freidora de aire  le doy un           
1930,3.0,                       i ve had this product since november of       and have used it maybe       times  it is nice  has a clean design  and is easy to use  however  i will caution and i don t know if i have a faulty one but the screws inside the fryer basket have come unscrewed and fallen into the food a few times  it really requires that you make sure they re tight each use  so be careful before you bite      
1931,5.0,                       i love this thing  i shopped forever for the right one and was really tempted to go for a cheaper option  i m glad i didn t  i use this thing almost every day      
1932,5.0,                       high quality  easy use and food tastes great  most of my family has this brand so i took the leap and never looked back  i can t believe i didn t get this sooner      
1933,3.0,                       the fryer works really well from a cooking stand point   but  from day one of having the thing  the fryer basket is a challenge   for some reason  it almost always wants to pop out while cooking   it s great to have a large basket  but there isn t much point if it can t handle heavier items like chicken wings and other meats  despite providing cooking settings for those foods   really annoying and  quite frankly  unsatisfactory   i would not recommend this product      
1934,1.0,                       this thing sounded like there was a minor earthquake in my kitchen  and the entire counter shook when it was running   even the part of the counter that was on the other side of the stove  if i was lucky  it would work for   minutes continuously  total waste  frustrating because most of the reviews for this fryer were good  it would seem that i got a dud      
1935,5.0,                       have only had a few days but have made steak  ribs  burgers  fries  and fish in this dude and it works great  have no experience with air fryers but this thing works great and is very easy to use  wish i would have bought a long time ago  be sure to register it with the manufacturer and get the warranty extended for free      
1936,5.0,                       this air fryer had high reviews from other publications and they were spot on  easy to operate  food cooks the way it should and  is easy to clean  having a downloadable app where the fryer communicates with you when it s done is an added bonus  well worth the purchase price which    is really reasonable        
1937,5.0,                       i ve used the large basket to make fried potato wedges  bacon  chicken  pork chops  and brussels sprouts   i m still adding new foods to try   the clean up is very easy and i love that when i pull out the basket to shake or turn the food  it shuts off until i put the basket back in      
1938,5.0,                       this air fryer is everything  i made these chicken wings and steak fries with the air fryer and they are amazing  i also made the goat khebabs with them  never deep frying meat or fries again  i also made pizza  chicken khebabs and i m still exploring the recipes from the recipe book that came with it  it s totally worth it to get it      
1939,5.0,                       updated review  i contacted the company about our issues and they immediately sent us a replacement  it has been everything we hoped  it is working perfectly and have enjoyed numerous great meals ihad high hopes for this  as it has such great reviews  i enjoy the way it cooks  however  the touch screen doesn t work all the time  so i am standing their frustrated trying to get the temp or time i need  wish i would have bought one that isn t touch screen      
1940,5.0,                       love love love  big enough for a whole chicken  but not cumbersome  and not loud  my air conditioner is louder than this  use it several times a week  the recipe for   spice sticky chicken that comes with is amazing the most tender chicken thighs ever  i m not a kitchen gadget person  but this is amazing       
1941,4.0,                       i have never liked cooking french fries in the oven but wanted the health benefit of no oil  this seems to fix that problem i have only done french fries so far but they did come out crispy  i will be trying more of the recipes from the included recipe book in the future      
1942,5.0,                       i absolutely love this   first thing i cooked was one pillsbury frozen biscuit with two pieces of bacon   omg  i preheated  then cooked them on     for    minutes  the biscuit was perfectly brown and the bacon was crispy  i decided that i will leave it on my counter      
1943,5.0,                       we ve only used this fryer a few times but so far  it s done great   we fried bacon  pork chops and cooked corn on the cob and all came out very well   we reheated some chicken we cooked in our oven and ate that for leftovers and it came out good also   plan to continue to try different foods in it and see if it continues to cook well      
1944,1.0,                       just first used  today  made a grilled cheese  it was just dried out bread  no moisture  will return it       
1945,5.0,                       i can t express it enough how great this air fryer is  the food taste amazing and the use of this product is so easy that any one and any age can use it  it s set it and forget it  this is the best kitchen friend you need specially great with cooking chicken any way  the broil setting is amazing      
1946,5.0,                       nothing to not like  it s awesome and i haven t made a single thing that isn t great  really like the app to use the recipes and start and pause the cooking      
1947,5.0,                       i love love this air fryer  it is user friendly  easy to clean and just so convenient when you do not want to spend hours in the kitchen  i recently contacted cosori directly to let them know that my handle on my basket was broken  the associate was helpful  kind and patient with me  she immediately sent a new basket to me without any additional fees  this exemplifies great customer service and cares for their customers  two thumbs up for cosori      
1948,5.0,                       very easy to use   need to use different settings than what it says at times  such as with eggplant  when i tried cooking it as a vegetable it wouldn t brown   tried it at     degrees on steak setting and got a wonderful looking great tasting eggplant      
1949,5.0,                       after initial struggles connecting to the internet and ready to write a nasty review  i realized it was a satellite router on my end that was poorly configured   after fixing that  it connected right away and has been awesome   alexa helps me preheat and cook and the food comes out crispy and fantastic   so far  very happy with this air fryer      
1950,5.0,                       this is the stupidest thing i ve ever bought  the wifi feature is absolutely the most ridiculous feature  the only way to work this junk is by using a smartphone   seriously  it has buttons all over the front panel none of which work  don t waste your time or money      
1951,5.0,                       i bought this air fryer because it was larger than the one i had previously   this one allows me to cook more food at one time without doing batches   it is easy to use  easy to clean and ami very satisfied with it      
1952,5.0,                       this air fryer is great  i picked this one because i liked the look better then the typical air fryers on the market   its sleek and the basket is really big   easy to use and easy to clean      
1953,5.0,                       only cooked   items so far  tater tots   perfect  french fries   perfect  fried chicken   perfect the clean up was so easy too  i waited too long to buy an air fryer  get a corsori  easy to clean inside and out  great directions and the recipe book is handy      
1954,4.0,                       note i m happy with my purchase but a note to potential buyers  remember this is a metal item which expands and contracts under high heat  so when you clean it make sure the screws on the basket and handle remain tight      
1955,5.0,                       saves a lot of time  and so far everything has come out delicious and tender takes a few tries to get the cook time down  because people like their food cooked differently  adjustment on time is necessary still finding things to cook in this bought   and kept   and gifted the other   everyone is excited and send pictures of dishes    definitely recommend     
1956,4.0,                       my entire apartment smells like burned plastic after just one use  i had to trash chicken  which was organic btw   based on the recommendations of the seller  i had to run it empty several times to get rid of burned plastic smell  let s see how it goes from here  will update you in a week      
1957,5.0,                       this air fryer cooks hamburgers  breaded chicken  and pork roasts beautifully  we cut the pork roast into   x    cubes and the air fryer gave it a charbroiled flavor as if we had grilled it outside   it did so in much quicker time than in the conventional oven without heating the whole kitchen up it also reheats leftovers beautifully  makes leftover chicken fingers  french fries or egg rolls nice and crispy again in just a few minutes without preheating      
1958,5.0,                       very impressed  made broccoli tots and chicken wings in under an hour and both were crisped to perfection  very easy to use and set up  i love how easy it is to clean      
1959,5.0,                       if you can work a microwave  you can work this   it literally requires pressing two buttons and dumping the food out of the basket  or using tongs    if you re worried about buying this because it might be too hard to learn  trust my review   this thing is easy      
1960,5.0,                       this air flyer is very easy to use and clean up  i place parchment paper or foil to make sure nothing sticks  the flavor of the food bursts out      
1961,5.0,                       first time user owner of an air fryer and we love it  plus we feel so much better that we re not soaking food in oil just to cook it to get that yummy crispness  totally happy with this unit plus the red looks great against the granite      
1962,5.0,                       i like the product   but the basket is a little difficult to release   otherwise it works well and cooks things as indicated      
1963,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                           update cosori send me a new replacement and everything is working flawless now  awesome customer service  thank you so much cosori keypad is very unresponsive as you can see by the video  temp time button practically doesn t work  presets work fine  preheat only works sometimes    overall great looking machine  poor keypad  i ve contacted customer support  will update my review pending on what they say      
1964,3.0,                       well brought it in july and now it s not my friend anymore  the breakup is painful i will miss my air fryer so now i m looking for a new  i called them they sent me a new one great customer service      
1965,2.0,                        update   i contacted the company and they responded very quickly  a new basket is being shipped  hopefully it holds up i love this air fryer and use it a lot since receiving it  i ve only had it about       months and tonight i noticed the handle was loose  i tightened the screws on the inside  because they had all come loose  but the handle still wiggled  upon taking a closer look i noticed the handle was broken on both sides  where it attaches to the basket  now i cannot use it until the problem is resolved unless i want to lose my food onto the floor and possibly burn myself      
1966,5.0,                       i ve only used it twice so far but i m already in love with it  i made shake and bake chicken nuggets and they were so crispy on the outside yet so tender and juicy inside  also made some green beans and they were amazing  the machine itself is easy to use and even easier to clean  the basket size is a good size for a small family    people i d say   i ve been debating on an air fryer for a while now and i m glad i ended up getting this one      
1967,5.0,                       had problem with first unit but customer service is excellent and took care of everything  i mean no hassel took care of the problem  new unit works just as it should  kids love this  it s easy to operate and used a lot  i like cooking wings and fries in this      
1968,5.0,                       my daughter and i eat healthier wings almost   days a week now   so easy  works perfectly love making snack like pizza rolls  mozzarella sticks  and egg roll     so easy  fast and no heating the place up with the oven      
1969,5.0,                       incredible piece of machinery  super easy  efficient  clean and delicious  the food  not the machine   where was this all my life       
1970,4.0,                       used it about   times now it cooks pretty good and is easy to maintain  just need to get used to the settings only complaints i have is i m struggling to connect to wifi via the app and the touch pad doesnt work sometimes     
1971,5.0,                       a requested christmas gift for my daughter  she loves using it  especially for french fries  and enjoys being able to quickly cook several foods at one time  it comes with a recipe book and she says it is very easy to clean      
1972,1.0,                       the first unit had a touch display issue right out of the box   they sent another unit  now   months it has decided to quit working mid cook  would not recommend     
1973,5.0,                       i purchased the cosori air fryer a month ago and have definitely put it to good use   it has performed better than expected on all type of foods   especially love it for cooking a full    lb rotisserie chicken and dry rub wings   it holds a large amount in the basket   it also made fantastic chicken and eggplant parmesan   we ve made crispy sweet potato fries  and perfect bacon too   the air fryer directions and recipes are easy to follow and it is very easy to clean   i highly recommend it      
1974,5.0,                       i got this for my mother and she loves it  ironically enough her stove stopped working right after i got this for her  i m honestly not even sure she would use it if she had it  she absolutely loves it  she cooks everything in it  from fried chicken to biscuits if there is one negative it is that it a little smaller than the amounts she cooks  i may just have to buy her another one so she can cook everything at once      
1975,5.0,                       super easy to use  very convenient  it does have a slight plastic smell when its on but doesnt bother me at all  food tastes delicious and its ready super fast     
1976,5.0,                       ever since i got this airfryer my life in the kitchen is   x easier  i cook sweet potato  chicken  bread  anything and everything while i do things around the house its amazing     
1977,5.0,                       i bought this as a replacement for another air fryer and i used it today for the first time and love it  on top of being easy to use and very easy to clean  it looks great on my kitchen counter and takes up very little space      
1978,4.0,                       my first air fryer  i m glad i bought one that had plenty of room  it has alot of presets that i m still trying to figure out perfect timing for things  i love it  i make steak and chicken in it and its perfect       
1979,4.0,                       would have given   stars  but temp can only be regulated by    degree intervals  so     or     are not optional selections only     or     can be selected      
1980,1.0,                       we tried chicken legs  small chicken pieces  even french fries  we get lot of smoke out of the front side of the airfryer  strong plastic smell as well update             excellent customer service   they sent another replacement unit but unfortunately even replacement unit had  faulty touch pad and most of the keys did not work  so as they suggested initiating the return process  bad luck     
1981,5.0,                       i got this for my mom and she s used it everyday since getting it  the thing huge so we have had difficulty figuring out where it should go when not in use but it cooks a lot of food quick and it s tasty  the recipe book is amazing and also has a section that tells you how to cook simple things like frozen chicken nuggets for the kids super fast      
1982,5.0,                    my buena lo mejor  f cil de usar con el wifi precio conectarlo y controlarlo por mi tel fono     aunque se debe tener cuidado para limpiarlo de no ser agresivo y quitar la capa antiadherente        
1983,1.0,                       don t buy this thing   it sucks   takes twice as long as it says to cook anything   if they don t refund me i m going to just smash it to pieces with a sledge hammer     
1984,5.0,                       i had a different brand before of the same size and it broke   i purchased this one  and it is amazing   my old one never let anything brown and didn t reach the right temps   cosori seemed to have done a lot of work researching this because this model is great      
1985,5.0,                       gift for wireless addicted son in law  had the app and alexa loaded in minutes  then frozen french fries were cooked cooked to crispy perfection      
1986,5.0,                       we bought both this unit and a      emeril high end air fryer  the emeril fryer was returned the day after it was opened because the cosori blew it out of the water  this is an amazing air fryer   everything has come out amazingly crispy and tasty without needing to add any extra oil  i never imagined how easy to use nor how good the taste would be in an air fryer  if you re shopping around  stop here as there really is nothing better

1989,5.0,                       once you learn the button sequence  its a dream  i use mine almost daily  i live alone and its perfect for me as i don t have to warm up my oven for    min just to reheat pizza or cook chicken just for one meal  heats to    f in   min  and cooks quickly

2001,3.0,                       i ve only had my air fryer for two months and the nuts on the screws are already rusting  the screws loose and very quickly and have to be retightened at least once a week  very disappointed that they wouldn t use stainless steel nuts i need food prep item      
2002,5.0,                       we cooked every fish meat potatoe in it  eliminates all the preparations timed like heating stove pots or pans cooking oils etc  steaks come out juicy and fish as well   can t beat if in the hurry or simply too tired or lazy that eve to get into the conventional cooking

2006,5.0,                       purchased this for my husband as a christmas gift back in november  when i got home from work he had it opened  on the counter  and already using  ha  needless to say he loves it and uses it up to     times a week  surprised at how good the food is cooked and tastes  very convenient      
2007,4.0,                       i bought it a month or so ago and really do like it  still trying to perfect the cooking particularly meats  it is tasty though  have done great fish tilapia  was fresh tasting and crispy  the homemade chips were amazing definitively slice  use mandolin is possible  easy to cook and so crispy  i would definitely recommend this product     
2008,5.0,                       i am enjoying my cosori air fryer  it works very officiently it is very well made  it doesn t have the hot air escaping thru out the back   sides like my other had done  it is even quieter while in use   the cosori company seems wonderful so far      
2009,5.0,                       this product is wonderful for cooking   the first one the digital button were not working properly so i returned  however the replacement works excellent and i am very happy with the machine      
2010,1.0,                       the first one i received as a gift and the touch screen did not work so the only way to use it was through the app so i sold it to someone who didn t mind that  the second one i bought for myself but the tray kept randomly popping out during cooking time and then i couldn t separate the inside tray to properly clean it after use  i ve seen some people happy with their purchase for these but i personally did not have a good experience      
2011,5.0,                       this airfryer has worked great  big enough for our family of    a guy at work purchased one and we also purchased another for our office  great product and no issues with the any of them      
2012,5.0,                       intended to use this occasionally and keep it in the basement  it is large but found room for it in the kitchen because we use it so frequently  it cooks frozen fried foods to perfection but we use it mostly for reheating leftovers that should be crisp   tortilla chips  bagels that taste like they were just baked  grilled cheese sandwiches  hors d oeuvres we even reheated lasagna in it  it is wonderful for roasting vegetables as well     
2013,5.0,                       i have had this only   weeks  but have made the panko breaded zucchini  yum  nice and crispy  and strawberry scones  yum    my friend says the chicken wings are the best ever   i definitely would recommend buying the     qt size  so much better than heating up your whole oven  and food cooks really quick      
2014,5.0,                       great product  good size for family of    have tried multiple things from fries to ribs all is cooked perfectly and delicious  has a   year warranty which is great compared to most and liked the difference shape compared to the rest of air fryer s  kids love the fries and nuggets in it      
2015,5.0,                       i ve got to say this was a good investment and change from a deep fryer  my only complaint is the design of the basket  the basket has many vents which is great to hear food but sometimes food gets into these cracks and are really hard to get out since you can t deep clean scrub since it s in such a tight space  personally i believe this is a design flaw but other than that it is super easy to use  love it       
2016,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          the absolute best thing i ve ever ordered from amazon and i buy a ton of stuff on here  this thing is amazing i use it daily since i received it  if you re thinking of buying it just do it  the chicken wings are actually better than fried ones  yes i said it better than fried      
2017,5.0,                       i typically don t write reviews  but this little gem is nothing short of remarkable  it is easy to use and cooks both meat and vegetables to perfection  the cookbook that comes with it is just as incredible  filled with simple  practical recipes that require only basic kitchen ingredients for the most part  i am debating buying a second one      
2018,2.0,                       bought this for my mom in mother day of       worked great and we loved it until it randomly broke in october       had been using it and it was preforming great until one day it just broke      
2019,5.0,                       just received my cosiri air fryer   having fun trying out different frozen items and am pleased with outcome   frozen breaded shrimp and frozen french fries were done perfectly  crispy  completely cooked through and had a good taste and i only used      tsp of oil   make some onion rings as well and they were crispy   love not turning on my regular oven or using my deep fryer with all that oil   clean up is fast and easy   love this air fryer      
2020,5.0,                       love this thing   it s essentially a mini convection oven   does excellent chicken and ribs   if you are on the keto diet get one   the wifi feature is meh     but who knows in the future      
2021,2.0,                       works pretty good if you can get the buttons to work  luckily we only use it for a few functions and this buttons work  half the buttons won t sense touch  so making those functions useless      
2022,5.0,                       it is a really good machine  easy to clean and use  but admittedly have not tried any large or complicated recipes in it yet  but cookbook looks like it contains some very good recipes     
2023,5.0,                       i love this air fryer   while having the a c running during the summer not wanting to turn the oven on iam using this constantly   it s a quality product it s worth the money      
2024,5.0,                       this air fryer is great  i had an issue with the screws from the basket falling out  but customer service responded right away and they are shipping me a replacement      
2025,5.0,                       bought this a few weeks ago and have used it for making potato   avocado fries    crispy tofu so far they all turned out very well the product looks good and is easy to clean as well  i would certainly recommend it      
2026,3.0,                       very loud  have had   air fryers now and this is by far the loudest and gets louder as the time progresses  i actually think something is wrong with it as the noise is clanging and rattles when cooking and this one i can see steam coming from the bottom when cooking     
2027,5.0,                       it has changed our life for the better  thank you cosori for making our food even better than it was when we baked it or grilled it      
2028,5.0,                       dummy proof and amazing  the new appliance taste  smell is finally gone after about three uses  cooks on bread setting  my japanese sweet potatoes flawlessly in half the time          
2029,5.0,                       this air fryer is awesome   we use it every day  it is easy to use  makes great meals and is easy to clean   my only negative comment is the recipe book started falling apart after only using it a short period of time      
2030,1.0,                       size is nice but this one has a lot of moisture to build up while cooking so there seems to always be smoke steam addition  the condensation is ridiculous   the amount of smoke steady coming out and water dripping out is a bit much  wouldnt buy this again  or recommend     
2031,4.0,                       love this product  better than i anticipated  however  screws in the basket have fallen out and i have had to order a replacement basket for        wish they were locked down with nuts      
2032,5.0,                       i love this thing  it is so easy to use  cooks meals in little to no time and gave the best crunch i have ever had in tots  it is very large  but the sleek design minimizes the usual offensive appliance look on the counter  i preferred this design over the other space ship designed fryers  i highly recommend  best purchase in a long time      
2033,5.0,                       this is the most amazing air fryer   i bought during amazon prime and it s been such a great investment   you don t have to use your oven anymore and heat up the house  this cooks everything perfect  i will be buying one for my mom      
2034,5.0,                       great product  made fried chicken  tofu  fries  zucchini  reheating leftovers makes everything crispy and tasting fresh  don t really use the presets but the timer temp settings are accurate since the controls are digital  overperforms when it comes to cooking so for any recipe  round down for the temperature the catcher for oil is easy to clean however the basket is a little harder  got to get in between the nooks and crannies to clean it overall a solid buy      
2035,5.0,                       used my corsori many times  frozen filet mignon  hambuger patty with delicious results  baked potatoes came out crispy on outside  the way we love them  and perfect on the inside  last night made crab cake patties  used the fish setting and they were perfect  i am so happy i bought my corsori      
2036,1.0,                       you have to push display buttons repeatedly until they eventually work  definitely returning  i bought this over ninja bc the basket size is a little wider but what use is that when it s such a hassle to operate      
2037,5.0,                       love the look  it has a bigger basket  easy to clean  soak the basket with soap and hot water after each use      
2038,5.0,                       my sister gave me this for christmas  it s my first air fryer and so far i love it  it is easy to use  works great and clean up is a breeze      
2039,3.0,                       we really like this product and our food has come out with a good taste  not all of the touch screen buttons work on it  especially the temperature and time controls  we have to use the app to operate the fryer  which is a pain when you are needing your phone to go back and forth to follow a recipe      
2040,5.0,                       i like this product so much i don t know how i live without it it cleans up fast it cooks great  i would highly recommend this product      
2041,4.0,                       easy to clean  super easy to use   came in nice packaging does give a funny smell   otherwise    i enjoy it     
2042,5.0,                       i absolutely love this air fryer  its best to experiment with your food because the times they list are sometimes too long  that being said   this is way better than baking  this is an excellent bargain        
2043,5.0,                       love this air fryer    i ve made chicken breasts  home fries  salmon with asparagus and hamburgers   cooking presets are spot on too   looking forward to using this in our rv instead of using the propane oven or convection oven that heat up the whole camper      
2044,5.0,                       great for warming pizza   warms it up w o making it soggy  it is also terrific for cooking almost anything  ear corn is amazing with just a little oil and pepper      
2045,5.0,                       i love my cosori air fryer   it works great   the only thing that i don t really like is that as far as i can tell i have to have my phone handy with the app   you cannot use the buttons on the fryer   again that is as far as i know   when i press them nothing happens      
2046,5.0,                       we have been playing with our air fryer for about a week now  and it s been pretty great all around  the one thing that i found to be confusing  though  is that there are not simple instructions for how long to cook certain things  for instance  there is no basic information on how long and at what temp to cook chicken breasts  the pre set button appears to be for thighs and bone in portions of the chicken  it s meant a lot of trial and error  including more detail would be helpful      
2047,5.0,                       absolutely the best air fryer for our family  my husband cooks a lot in this fryer   came fast and so healthy and fast      
2048,4.0,                       i love my air fryer and for more than just french fries  too   french toast in    minutes without having to stand over a stove  the recipes that came with were fun to try also   some of the things i tried definitely taste better when cooked traditionally  like my homemade chicken nuggets  but overall the food comes out yummy with a great texture      
2049,5.0,                       makes delicious and crispy wings  tenders and cutlets  i like to use my purelite oil mister to spray an even coat of olive oil to make foods crispy  much faster cooking times than using the oven  great for busy people who dont have the time to cook      
2050,5.0,                       makes excellent food  brussel sprouts  sweet potato fries  chicken nuggets  bacon  and so many other items that the family loves  very easy to use  we had a slight issue with the control panel and the cosori team was super helpful to get the product replaced right away  highly recommend this appliance      
2051,1.0,                       easy  intuitive  great space  i d not want one any smaller   first one died  but customer service was amazing   got me a new one with very little hassle   the replacement lasted about   months   met the same fate  it just died   no power  nothing  reliability means a lot  two bad ones in less than a year isn t worth the trouble   i ll find another brand      
2052,1.0,                       this air fryer did well with making food but didnt hold up  a chunk of the machine broke off within two months  very disappointed      
2053,5.0,                       this air fryer is fantastic  i love it  food taste so good  my kids really enjoy there chicken tenders  nuggets  fries  burgers  etc cook with this item  it s awesome       
2054,2.0,                       pros  this was our first air fryer and when you get it to cook  the food comes out great cons  the touchscreen is super finicky  usually won t pick up my finger and we have to use the app on our phone to set it  we bought it   months ago and used it almost every day  but today it stopped working  it no longer senses when the tray is in and therefore is unusable  because it will not start  cleaning the outer bin can become an aggravating affair if food gets into the airflow channels  i had to disassemble it once to clean it      
2055,5.0,                       if you want to impress your wife just how smart you are  surprise her with this winner   it cooks much faster than pan frying  it does not pop grease out all over your beautiful and expensive gas range top and controls  it cleans up very quick and easy   now you have more time to sit and talk with your wife   smart choice   easy to order      
2056,5.0,                       this is absolutely my most favorite kitchen gadget   it is really easy to use and clean  does not heat up the kitchen like the oven and is fast  i have cooked glazed carrots  breaded chicken breast  pork chops  tator tots and  avocado fries  i have also used it to reheat leftovers  such as pizza  stuffed mushrooms and eggplant parmesan      
2057,5.0,                       i am so impressed with cosori s customer service  i recently reached out to them to help with an issue i had with the air fryer due to my own fault and they immediately resolved my problem  i was so appreciative of their customer service  would definitely buy another air fryer from cosori   i can t believe all the wonderful dishes we have made while keeping it healthy   crab cakes were especially great      
2058,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          received the product and the touchpad not working except for   buttons after reading the reviews here found out it s a common problem      
2059,1.0,                       the product would not work until i downloaded the app on my smartphone  the only way to operate it is via my phone  if i am not home no one can operate it  i should have purchased an older model    update    i haven t used the product in months  i attempt to use it to air fry a steak and it won t connect to bluetooth or even power on  this was a total waste of money     
2060,5.0,                       i never knew what an air fryer was but i thought why not  best appliance i ever bought  i can t wait to learn all that it can do      
2061,3.0,                       liked ease of use   disliked capacity i e   small chicken thighs at   time   otherwise is was good   electric use is minimum compared to oven but oven can cook more chicken at   time      
2062,5.0,                       we love this airfryer   i was afraid it would become another appliance that just takes up space  but we seriously use this almost everyday   we do pork chops  wings  chicken tenders  seafood  and all the veggies in our airfryer   everything comes out perfect everytime and the flavors are awesome   the buttons are pretty self explanatory and easy to use    highly recommend      
2063,5.0,                       we had phillips ayr fryer before    times more expensive than this  we returned that one because we weren t happy with it  and ever since we got the cosori ayr fryer we have been very very happy with it  we make our chicken  steak  vegetables  basically everything in it  totally recommend it         
2064,5.0,                       our daughter purchased one of these   said she loves it   we purchased this one   we re still learning to use it but what we have done is delicious      
2065,4.0,                       while i like the results  there is a lot of effort in using this  there is also one more appliance to take up space in a cabinet or something else sitting on the counter  it is worth it if you will use it frequently but i just don t know that i personally would enough  i also feel like the size  xl  is fine for two but if it were a larger family you d have to do everything over   over again  too much effort      
2066,5.0,                       wow     unbelievable product  we started keto diet and everyone recommended an air fryer  we are very happy   i would highly recommend to anyone  it s a really good looking product also the cooking time is so quick it s kind of crazy  very happy     
2067,1.0,                       the  non stick  surface bubbled and peeled off after one use  also  the tray doesn t stay shut i won t use it anymore because i don t want to be eating that chinese made non stick coating  absolute junk now      
2068,2.0,                       this air fryer is great  but it makes a very loud rattling noise when using  it is odd because the rattling noise doesn t occur the entire time while cooking  but it is very loud  you can hear it from another room   i am currently waiting on product support to get back to me  i was very disappointed after spending this much on an air fryer and i didn t expect to have a problem on the first use  i will likely return if support cannot help me  overall  the air fryer works great if you can stand not being able to hear the tv when using it      
2069,5.0,                       i love this   it is taking some time on perfecting everything but so far so good     
2070,5.0,                       i never leave reviews  but this air fryer is too good not to leave a review  we have had another air fryer for a couple of years  but i would never use it unless my hubby could help because you literally would burn your arm trying to open   close it   they made that one way too difficult to use    but  the cosori air fryer is so easy to use  easy to clean  we ve had it for a week and i ve used it almost every day           
2071,5.0,                       one of the best air fryers i ve ever owned   love that it can be controlled by a smart phone  my kitchen is on a different floor then where i spend most of my time so very convenient       
2072,5.0,                       i have used this for almost all of my meals  roasted veggies  meat  fish  seriously this thing can do it all  figuring out the temperature and time for different foods has been a bit less than the recommended time from the booklet      
2073,5.0,                       i really had my doubts about this or any air fryer i can honestly say i love everything  about it ease of use cleanup performance all it takes is a little practice and you will see it is very easy to cook with i highly recommend the cosori air fryer       
2074,5.0,                       i use this daily  i love it  i still need to sort out how long to cook things because most things don t list air fryer times on the package      
2075,5.0,                    me encanto        
2076,5.0,                       i love this thing     so easy to use and clean  already recommended it to a friend when she said she needed a new air fryer  juicy flavorful steak and meatballs that were not too dry  it is my new favorite kitchen appliance      
2077,1.0,                       this would be an excellent air fryer if the buttons worked  the only way i could get this unit to work was to use the vesync app or have alexa do it for me  i will be returning my cosori air fryer and looking for a different brand      
2078,5.0,                       i really like this air fryer   cooks food fast and crispy   i really like that it comes in white too      
2079,5.0,                       multiverse sleek design love all thing cooked with only downside which in my case is a major fail outlet is far too short and basket falls out when slightly open if released  to like let the food cool down open the basket and can stay locked in sliding rails just to hold in place would ve been  amazing if those two could be fixed      
2080,5.0,                       we use this product for everything from chicken  two fish  two steak  the list goes on it s excellent for so many things  money well spent      
2081,4.0,                       i bought this for my son and daughter in law as a gift and they loved it  replacing parts was not easy for them though      
2082,5.0,                       most amazing invention ever  my husband has been trying to talk me into getting an air fryer for the longest time  i finally caved and bought this one  i m glad i did  so easy to use  super easy to clean  and the food tastes amazing      
2083,5.0,                       i thought i would try this out  it had decent reviews and i figured why not  when i first started using it  it was not working out like i thought  you have to get your times and temps down by trial and error and after that you should be very happy with it  i use it practically every day for one thing or another      
2084,4.0,                    muy buen equipo  un buen precio  es mi segundo airfry que compro  este hasta ahora a sido mejor que el anterior de otra marca         
2085,5.0,                       i delayed purchasing an air fryer because i feared it would not be something i would integrate into regular cooking  i am plant based and finally bought this product to assist with oil free cooking  it is amazing  the basket is large and easy to clean  the learning curve is quick and it makes delicious   crispy vegetables  potatoes and tofu with no oil  i love it and use it daily      
2086,5.0,                       very convenient and easy to use   i jump  in the shower  by the time i come out and get dressed  my chicken wings are cooked to perfection   if you are putting any kind of sauce  put it half way the time so it wont burn   i m so happy i got it   i would give it a    star      
2087,5.0,                       after   months the on switch where the basket installs would not stay activated  i contacted cosori and they remedied the problem very quickly by replacing the entire item  i really didn t expect that response  am very pleased  i only hand washed it andused heavily  daily      
2088,5.0,                       i bought this air fryer for a dear friend who has wanted one for a long time  she has not stopped raving about how wonderfully tasty the food is after being cooked by this fryer  she loves the size of the basket and has used many of the recipes out of the cookbook  she has even learned how to  bake  recipes in the fryer      
2089,5.0,                       i bought the air fryer as a christmas gift  in fact  i bought two fryers  one for my daughter in law and one for her daughter  they have only had good things to say about the fryers  they seem to be in competition to see who can cook the most  they say the flavor is better than the same food baked in the oven  the fact that a cookbook came with the fryer was definitely a plus      
2090,5.0,                       this is such a highly recommended product i use it all the time with various foods easy to cook with i love it     
2091,5.0,                       omg this is the best product ever    easy  works great   cleaning is a breeze   my child can put in nuggets hit a button and cook his own meals they are made for a busy lifestyle   we have bacon every day   the best purchase ever        
2092,5.0,                       this is  by far  the one appliance that i use the most  it s been over a year since i purchased it and three other friends bought it after seeing what it does at my house or just because they heard me talking about it  one even thanked me for the recommendation after she bought it  their customer service is the best you will ever encounter  all of this should tell you everything you need to know  buy it  you will never look back      
2093,5.0,                       i ve only used it once   but love it   i m not a great cook   this is easy to use   very happy with the purchase   it might be a little large for my family  father and two teenage girls       
2094,5.0,                       what a surprise from freezer to plate in    min or less  just pre heat  place frozen items or raw fish meat or chi ken and bammm its done so fast and cleaning is a breeze  my wife and i absolutely love this device what a godsend  dinners have become fun again and its speed and simplicity are just amazing  best money i have ever spent  what a truly amazing gift      
2095,5.0,                       he finds it easy to use for cooking  easy to clean  and enjoys the taste of food  i ve used it also and find it  ntuitive  to use      
2096,4.0,                       i was never going to get one of these  but i became intrigued  it does a good job of making crispy prtotens like chicken and pork  with breading   does ok with frozen fries  soft inside and crisp outside  i haven t used it enough to try other things  but it s like an intense convection oven  it does the job      
2097,5.0,                       absolutely the best air fyer i ve ever used  very simple to operate and the food turns out delicious every time  for the price  it s a no brained      
2098,5.0,                       love my new air fryer  couldn t be happier with this appliance  have had it over a week and have been using it daily to cook healthy meals  definitely recommend       
2099,5.0,                       cosori has top notch products  i already own their   qt electric pressure cooker and i couldn t be happier with it  now that i have their     qt air fryer  i know i made the right choice   easy to use  and easy to clean  easy to follow user manual also  definitely a cosori fan      
2100,5.0,                       love this air fryer  works great  easy to use  it is pretty large though  so make sure you have enough counter space      
2101,5.0,                       after waiting and doing my research  i m glad i decided on this fryer   the app makes cooking stupidly easy  find a recipe and  cook this    it notifies you when it s preheated or when it s time to shake the contents and when it s done   definitely love it     
2102,1.0,                       it gave off a horrible burning smell  possibly from the non stick coating  the food had the smell as well      
2103,1.0,                       such a piece of trash would never buy anything again     
2104,5.0,                       this air  fryer does  all it was advertised to do  have made meatloaf  fried fish  done potatoes several ways  as well as other dishes and especially how easy and delicious bacon comes out  had people tell me that air fryers were a waste of time  hint  when buying an air fryer  get a large one  this one will fry   fish fillets at once      
2105,1.0,                       i originally posted that i loved this air fryer but only after a few months of use it has stopped working entirely  do not buy       
2106,5.0,                       my daughter has one and she got one for me even though i didn t think i would use it  it s so easy to use and clean up is a snap  i bought one for my diabetic sister who has really missed fried foods  she said she feels like she has so many more options to cook without the added carbs of breading on chicken  etc  i absolutely love this product      
2107,1.0,                       when it works it is awesome but     times the buttons won t work and we can t get it to turn on        
2108,5.0,                       i cook almost all my meals in this fryer  besides it making food taste better  i love how spacious it is  and it s super easy to clean  definitely worth buying      
2109,5.0,                       i finally purchased an air fryer during the amazon prime days and could not be happier  i used this to cook a steak in the other day  i ve never had good luck cooking a steak on the grill or stove and this turned out amazing in about    minutes

2119,5.0,                       wow   almost as fast as a microwave but doesn t destroy food      mins give or take to roast and brown  most anything you want    healthy   because of little to no heating of oils etc   cleanup   almost none   certainly if tray is lined with aluminum foil   with the typical american household consisting of   now     why fire up that darn oven and waste energy         this could even be a solution to climate change       
2120,5.0,                       i like the size and how quick it cooks things   and it keeps all the juice inside your ribs  steaks or anything u choose to cook  great taste without all the added hours of preparation      
2121,3.0,                       the air fryer worked great until the second time i used it and the basket stopped closing  nothing was broken and the hinges didn t appear to be bent  the basket just stopped securely closing

2133,5.0,                       i love using this cosori air fryer  it is well designed and looks great  the temp and times are exact as far as cooking properly and the foods taste awesome  so far i have cooked chicken  shrimp  bacon and frozen string beans  everything was perfect  thanks cosori      
2134,4.0,                       steam comes out of the front   we have contacted the manufacturer and sent them a video of it and have not received a reply yet   other than that  it cooks well and we like the food it cooks      
2135,5.0,                       i bought two of these last year for our granddaughters for christmas  they love it  i decided i would buy one for myself  i love it  the best thing is my husband loves what i cook it it  i ve used it every day since i got it      
2136,5.0,                       this is definitely great product  and better than greasy stove cooking  i have made some delicious pork chops  battered chicken  bacon  and french fries  i have made so many dinners and my wife now does not have to think a day in advance for dinner but now in the same day because it s so easy to make  the great thing is you do not  need as much seasoning because the grease or oil does not take it away      
2137,5.0,                       bought this for a friend who doesn t really like to cook  and is limited to what he can eat for medical reasons   it opened a whole world of foods he can add back to his diet because of  air frying   easy to use and clean      
2138,5.0,                       well  i was skeptical at first but when i saw what people were doing on pinterest and on youtube with this cosori air fryer  i had to have it          for this air fryer was the icing on the cake as well   lol we use it everyday and why not  it does it all  i cooked   ribeye steaks the first day and guess what  delicious        i rarely leave reviews on amazon  but this had to be done    lol buy it      
2139,5.0,                       love it easy to use i think here in there you have to adjust the temperature in minutes to what you re cooking i do a few minutes last time whatever it says or i will lower the heat       
2140,5.0,                       i love the design   and it truly made my wings crispy with out any oils or grease   i did underestimate how hot and how fast it would cook my food it said    min for chicken but mine was done in    which i didn t know and i let it cook the whole    min    the buttons are easy to use and i like the cookbook   but i m so excited about using this air fryer every day    it s simple and easy     
2141,5.0,                       no dislikes  everything i have used it for has been better than i expected   our favorite so far is chicken thighs seasoned our way   our second favorite is scratch biscuits far less heat than our oven and what must be a fraction of the cost   haven t dealt in with more sophisticated dishes yet  but i will      
2142,5.0,                       great instructions and awesome product     
2143,5.0,                       this is a simple design that works really well  is easy to use and clean and cooks a wide variety of foods perfectly   i love it      
2144,5.0,                       i have been looking for a airfryer for awhile   thos popped up on today s deal when i bought it   read the reviews and it looked simple   we are very pleased on how easy it is to clean  cook and well everything   it even comes with directions on how to do the math for cooking time if you only have directions for the oven   we absolutely love this fryer and our friends are looking into getting one      
2145,5.0,                       bought this for my daughter who loves cooking with her new cosori  portal enough for her to bring over to my house to cook wings for my birthday  amazing taste and so easy to clean  pork chops are another of her favorites  buy it you won t be sorry      
2146,5.0,                       i had bella   air fryer first and was ok food was ok just bought the cosori air fryer and i love it key thing i love is the preheat and the warm setting  is small do not take up to much space     
2147,5.0,                       love this more than i thought  i use   x week  it does so much more than air fry   delicious bang bang shrimp and roast chicken even though x large doesn t take too much counter space   i already ordered the accessories      
2148,5.0,                       since i got this airfryer i can t imagine my life without it  i practically cook everything with it  easy to use  to clean and you don t need oil at all      
2149,5.0,                       so far  this machine has been great  one of things  amongst many  that attracted me to this particular model was the  square  basket  most on the market seem to be round and you lose valuable space  it is easy to use  works perfectly and is pleasing to look at so i don t mind it sitting out      
2150,5.0,                       we have cooked frys rings  taquitoes  fish  steak  pork tenderloins among other things  they all were easy and very good      
2151,5.0,                       love my new air fryer   on oxygen full time and can t use stove   this allows me to cook almost anything      
2152,5.0,                       cooks great the bottom pan is starting to flake the teflon coating off after   months of light use      
2153,5.0,                       this is the best air fryer i have used and it cleans up very easy  the digital display is easy to understand and read  the large capacity is also a big plus  air fryers are the best invention for the kitchen i have seen in a long time  we use it every day     
2154,5.0,                       i ve owned   other air fryers  including the power xl  and i really like this one the best   it is easy to clean and produces great tasting food      
2155,4.0,                       we have used this airfryer for multiple dishes  french fries  brussels sprouts  fish and chips      and have been very impressed with the results  if you do not overload the airfryer  everything is super crispy  the only issue we have is with the touchscreen  it can be unresponsive from time to time which is frustrating      
2156,4.0,                       the double basket design gives space for great convection cooking  it also creates more parts to clean  the button to release the inner basket from the outer basket is awkward  my thumb nail interferes   but i manage it and the cooked results are delicious      
2157,5.0,                       very versatile   love it first for how easy it is to cook bacon   it is worth it just for that   a great alternative to using the microwave when heating up food or cooking frozen items      
2158,5.0,                       my new favorite in my kitchen right now  if u don t have air fryer yet this is the best  and i follow the recipe too oh you will be eating good and healthy foods      
2159,5.0,                       i made boneless pork chops and they were tender   juicy  steak was good in it too  i had previously bought a bag of extra crispy french fries and the air fryer made them too crispy  so next time i will just buy the regular ones breaded chicken   breaded veal patties are delicious  i love the easy clean up      
2160,1.0,                       didn t power on when recieved  ordered  nd one works fine      
2161,3.0,                       received this about     weeks ago and have been barely using it  finally decided to use today to cook an entire meal and it stopped working  the pan won t stay in  it pops out and i can only get it to stay inside if i use something heavy to hold it from popping out  very frustrating since it s new and i have hardly used it      
2162,1.0,                       the door keeps popping open while cooking  the parts are difficult to take apart  pay a bit more and get a better quality air fryer      
2163,4.0,                       great airfryier food very tasty very fast cooking love it   but it requires an air vent in the back or side that would have make a huge difference  to me     a   instead of a        
2164,4.0,                       love this thing   what would normally come out soggy if i put it in the oven comes out crisp as if we deep fried it but without all the oil   have also cooked some other stuff that you would not deep fry but didn t want to heat the oven  and the house  up and it came out great   definitely would recommend   only concern i have is the handle for the basket assembly seems a little flimsy to me so i am careful as i don t want it to break rendering this great appliance useless      
2165,5.0,                       i use this air fryer for everything now   excellent way to make frozen vegetables   i have made chicken wings  fried pickles  pita chips  tortilla chips  potato chips  fries and more   it is so easy to use and clean up is simple   it comes with a recipe book which it helpful for cooking tips and times but the recipes themselves are a bit bland for me   add some more spices and you will be very satisfied with the product      
2166,1.0,                       the food basket opened by itself and dropped to the floor after the machine ran a couple of minutes  the hot oil and food spilled and damaged our wood floor  we should thank god no one was around and got hurt at that time  the plastic part of the handle and hinge was broken and the fryer cannot be used any more  the product is not safe to use  second  they shouldn t use plastics in the food basket which is subject to high temperate and repeated operation      
2167,5.0,                       i ve only had my air fryer a few days and i m still learning what and how i can cook in it   so far  the only thing i ve cooked is bacon and i ve got to say it s the best bacon i ve had  very easy to cook and very easy to clean  can t wait to really find out all it can do      
2168,5.0,                       excellent product   so easy to use and everything has come out amazing   well  except my asparagus   but likely user error   i love cooking with this air fryer   i think i will continue to use it   it won t go in the cabinet with the instapot   keeping this on the counter      
2169,4.0,                       i have had this thing since july  one of the best things ever  then in the  middle of using  it just stops and wont turn on  so disappointed in this thing   on top of that   having trouble getting it exchanged i stand corrected   they made it right and shipped me out a new one      
2170,5.0,                       i absolutely love my cosori air fryer    this item is truly better than expected   the quality for the price is superb    it is super easy to use   clean up is a cinch    i just ordered a replacement basket just to have on hand for those nights when i have to cook alot i have the all black one but i am really thinking about getting the new cosori stainless steel     air fryer as everything in my kitchen is stainless steel      
2171,5.0,                       this is my first air fryer and i am very impressed with it  simple to use with either the built in controls or through the app  it takes a little getting used to not needing to oil the pan before cooking  i have recommended this model to several friends and family      
2172,2.0,                       this air fryer cooks pretty well and i have no complaints about the food i ve made in it  but when i remove the basket it separates from the cooking basket   every time i pull the basket out of the air fryer it detaches from the second basket without me having to push the button and that s a problem because he keeps dropping on the counter and once i burnt myself to keep it from dropping on the floor with my food in it   if i could send it back i would i think this one must be defective      
2173,5.0,                       this is a must have in any kitchen  we have used it every night since it has arrived  cuts down on cook time and you can have multiple supper items in just minutes      
2174,5.0,                       does a terrific job reheating fries from our take out and cooks meats up well   i have to adjust the timing a little longer  maybe because of altitude    i m completely happy with it      
2175,5.0,                       took advantage of purchasing this during amazon days   wow  wish i would have purchased this sooner   i love this and is so easy to use   i have made sweet potato fries  grilled cheese  buffalo cauliflower bites and even pizza easy to clean and i can operate it from my phone or alexa if you are wondering if it is worth it  let me tell you  it is      
2176,5.0,                       this was given as a gift to my adult children and they have used it a lot and have been happy with it   it s nice and big for a family      
2177,5.0,                       perfect size for a small family  i can t seem to go one day without an air fryer these days  ours broke  and this one arrived in two days and works perfectly      
2178,3.0,                       make a lot of eggrolls and dislike all the unused oil   had high hopes for the air fryer   sadly  airfrying made the eggrolls stiff like cardboard not crunchy      
2179,5.0,                       i was looking for a bigger pan and the phone control was a plus   i can ask my kids to put in our food and i can start it from the train while i am commuting home   it s great on all types of foods  i use it for almost all my meats   i ties hot dogs and it came out so good   wings are even better   easy to clean   love it so much that i convinced my friend to get the same one      
2180,5.0,                       i went with this one on black friday because of the great deal but it has been the best kitchen purchase maybe ever  my favorite feature is the  preset  buttons  one for fries  one for soft vegetables  bacon  meat  etc  takes a lot of the guess work out of cooking with it  so easy to use and clean  slick look  it s the best        
2181,5.0,                       i ordered the air fryer   after reading the reviews and trust me its wonderful    i made fish and squash for my first meal right out of the box   amazing       after removing the paper and washing it out lol  it comes with a cute cookbook  and simple instructions    press and go  easy peazy   you will  also get an extra year warranty when you register on line  happy cooking              
2182,5.0,                       i ve had this for over a year now  and i use it often  at least   times per week   my wife even cooks her meatballs in it  and it cooks them perfectly  even frozen food is way better out of the air fryer  the recipe book is a great reference for how long to cook things  even if you use your own recipes  my only wish is that i purchased one twice the size  if they even exist       
2183,5.0,                       i was not disappointed when i purchased the cosori     qt air fryer   since the day i got it i have been making all kinds of food  hand held fruit pies  steak  fried chicken  roasted potatoes and more   it is extremely easy to operate and clean   the recipe book is great and the cosori community helps with questions and provides more recipes   this is an extremely versatile air fryer      
2184,5.0,                       the cosori air fryer is so easy to use and the food tastes wonderful   it is easy to clean   i give it   stars for everything   i ve had   ninja air fryers   while they worked well  the first one died after   months  the second one after   months   so i opted for the cosori and should have purchased it in the first place   highly recommend      
2185,5.0,                       i ve used this almost daily since i bought it  it works really well  as some have mentioned the temperatures suggested arent always the best  if you play a littke and invest in an oil sprayer  you ll be killing it  i purchased with the intent of mainly using it for frozen fried foods  i ve cooked chicken and beef as well and it works pretty well once you have experimented  would recommend for the price      
2186,4.0,                       this was an awesome air fryer   i love how easy it is to use and highly recommend it   downside is cooking bacon  can only cook a few strips at a time   other than that   it is awesome for fries and chicken wings      
2187,4.0,                       love how food comes out crispy when using this air fryer   and it is room enough to feed my family of four  but not roomy enough to feed a large crowd    the only thing i do not like about this product is that the bottom of the food basket insert is easy to clean  but not the sides   the way that the vents are facing on all four sides of the food basket  it is difficult to get in each vent to clean off the grease and food   besides that  i love it and use it almost every day      
2188,5.0,                       i received this for xmas and i have not been disappointed  i haven t made any from scratch items but it s been great for heating up frozen food for my kids  i love that i don t have to preheat it and it cooks faster  i will say between running this  my microwave  and oven it has blown my breaker a few times      
2189,2.0,                       this air fryer smokes really bad  it is whit smoke and will fill the room  have tried lower temps and used parchment paper to catch crumbs put small amount of water in bottom of pan that holds basket  smokes no matter what i do  it cooks food well and is easy to clean  but i would not buy again because of the smoking  have had other air fryers and did not have this problem  i clean the inside and coils every time i use and wash the basket and pan also      
2190,1.0,                       i gave this as a gift on christmas and unfortunately had to return it not long after  my friend said they followed the directions as provided and could not eradicate the plastic taste   smell after cooking   so a no go for me      
2191,5.0,                       i like everything about this air fryer   large capacity  easy to clean  fast cooking  and terrific customer service   i hardly use my stove oven anymore   recipe book that comes with air fryer contains many good recipes   cosori has a fb page for users of air fryer and their pressure cooker   very helpful  an excellent product      
2192,5.0,                       makes great food in a short amount of time   fits nicely on my counter   makes great steaks and stuffed mushrooms  please put a few drops of oil on french fries to give them a crispy texture   same with chicken and fish its easy to use and saves time   very efficient   easy to clean   just place in dishwasher      
2193,5.0,                       unfortunately  we had a problem with our air fryer   contacted company support and sent it back to them with them paying for shipment and they gave us a credit at amazon for total amount so we bought another one   we love their product and customer services     
2194,1.0,                       received product today  the shipping box was fine  however  the product in the original box when taken out of the product packaging box  was damaged from factory  it has a damaged crack in the unit at the bottom right  where the door is  when taking the door out  because of the damaged area  it won t let the door go back in properly  i have to return this product before even getting to use it  i very disappointed   cosori needs to inspect their products before packaging them      
2195,5.0,                       worked well first time   as i have learned how much time   correct temperature   its even better cooking       
2196,1.0,                       has not held up to use   the screws literally pop out in multiple locations  really a hazard   one time i didn t notice and found it in the food  zero percent recommend     
2197,4.0,                       product broke down on me in   months maybe with about   to   uses  would never buy again update  received a new fryer and it has been working perfectly  thank you guys so much  love my new fryer      
2198,5.0,                       i debated buying one these forever  finally did and omg this one is amazing  perfect food every time  but more importantly  so so easy to clean  pop both trays in the dishwasher and done  love it  i rarely use the oven anymore      
2199,5.0,                       big  easy to use  and easy to clean     
2200,5.0,                       this is my second one i ordered because i loved the first one soo much that i gave my son one who also loves it     i love that the touchscreen has so many options   this is so easy to clean and cook in   i highly recommend this cooker      
2201,5.0,                       throw in some chicken parts drizzle a bit of evoo over it a dash of salt and pepper to taste    minutes later enjoy amazing tasting chicken      
2202,4.0,                       comparing with the philips the results its pretty much the same  but the philips looks more sturdy build  but for the price this is a much better deal     
2203,1.0,                       received the product but totally damaged  very disappointed     
2204,3.0,                       i did not use it once  because it was bulky and i do not have a space to store it  so i returned  i should have place no stars because i returned but there was not that option     
2205,5.0,                       easy to use  large compartment and fast cooking  the cosori is a beautiful compact device  quiet and cooks so so fast  cleaning is a bit annoying but make sure to clean it inside carefully as well as the basket and its little metal windows      
2206,5.0,                       absolutely love this appliance as the the recipes are limitless and the finished meals are fabulous     
2207,5.0,                       among recent newly developed programmable counter top cooking appliances  cosori air fryer is a cooking appliance with revolutionary concept design  a stroke of genius it is very well made  the pamphlet is very well written  clear and precise  easy to understand and to follow  especially on safety  the recipes are very easy to follow  especially  the instructions on which and when to push which bottoms  we tried two other new types concept of counter top cooking appliances in the past year  we are now very happy with this cosori air fryer machine how to register for warranty      
2208,4.0,                       great product  easy to program  still learning the correct temps and time to use on different foods  but overall very happy with this purchase      
2209,4.0,                       i really like this air fryer and use it several times a week i just wise i had purchased it sooner      
2210,5.0,                       i buy so many things on amazon that i rarely ever write a review about them but this  this air fryer has replaced my toaster oven  regular oven  and stove top in so many ways  dinner is ready and served in under    minutes with an easy clean up afterwards  worth every penny      
2211,5.0,                       omg  this takes a quick dinner to another level  i forget life before my air fryer  lol  grilled cheese  nuggets  motz sticks  fries  coconut chicken  egg rolls    the list goes on and on      
2212,5.0,                       the quick cook time  the flavor  crispness   moisture retention and easy cleanup  i have cooked steaks  fried chicken  sausages  hotdogs  hamburgers  ham  bacon   french fries  i had a table top convection oven  prior to purchasing this air fryer  this is much easier to use and clean  best purchase i could have made      
2213,5.0,                       i have purchased and tried many air fryers and this one is by far the best that i have used   i love all the features it has  the shake feature  the pre heat feature   this one also seems to cook food much faster than other air fryer s   like half the time   i highly recommend this air fryer   plus its larger than some of the other brands which is nice      
2214,5.0,                       you can make almost anything  and it turns out great  with less cooking time  if you are a fan of crockpots or pressure cookers  then stop reading this review right now and just hit add to cart  seriously  go      
2215,5.0,                       brand is new   not used            but i did not receive any gadgets that go with the airfryer why did it say i would receive them  i did not  both airfryers        
2216,5.0,                       i love my cosori air fryer   pan frying and fry daddy s are my least favorite ways to cook  with my air fryer i can make excellent fried chicken and know that it is cooked inside and out  there is also such a large variety of things i can cook in my cosori air fryer  clean up is easy      
2217,4.0,                       i ve only used it a few times but so far i love it  also  my original basket wouldn t separate from the outer part  but they sent me a new one   it shipped pretty quickly  so now it s working   i can clean it easier  good customer service      
2218,5.0,                       this is an excellent  easy to use product  i cook meat in it everyday  usually steak  or chicken  i put the meat in  season it  then spray it with a spray oil  avocado olive   the results are excellent  my wife will cook sweet potato fries  chicken nuggets etc  all with great results      
2219,5.0,                       love this air fryer  just wish there was roomfor more food  also  i m having to screw the screws in every few uses      
2220,4.0,                       as a typical latina i love fried plantains    if you buy frozen sweet plantains they are perfect for this machine but if you try to make tostones buy cutting the pieces and air frying them they dont taste the ssme     
2221,4.0,                       an excellent product  we have made pork chops  fish  shrimp  fries  baked potatoes  etc   we us this a few times per week  an excellent product      
2222,5.0,                       works exactly like it s supposed to  doesn t smoke  the removable tray is easy to work with  the only problem i would say is cleaning the tray  i m not sure if i m the only one with this problem but putting just a little bit of pressure when trying to clean it dents the tray  otherwise  everything works well      
2223,5.0,                       best gift ever  i ve had it for more than a year now and i ve used it everyday  if it breaks i will buy again      
2224,2.0,                       i was really looking forward to using this new air fryer but it didn t work properly   the functions seemed to work via wifi but the manual buttons on the air fryer itself didn t work at all with the exception of maybe   of them when pressed very hard  perhaps it was defective so i had to return it  really disappointing      
2225,4.0,                       love my cosori air fryer  got about a months ago  very easy to use  works great  so far i haven t used oil in it at all   everything i cook tastes great  would purchase again      
2226,5.0,                       i was on the fence about air fryers  but wanted to fry without all the oil  while this hasn t made home sliced fries as good  probably user error   it has been awesome for everything else  so far  tator tots  crispness on already cooked potatoes  chicken wings  pizza  nachosglad i took a chance  use it regularly      
2227,5.0,                       how did we survive before cosori air fryers were invented  if you don t have one yet  then you re ain t living life to the fullest  we have yet to find something that doesn t cook better in a cosori air fryer  things cook faster  the thing is easier to clean and it makes you life better      
2228,5.0,                       i got this as a replacement for a yedi air fryer that died within   weeks  this one is a little louder but it cooks the food very well  been using it for   weeks and so far there has been no problems     
2229,2.0,                       looked good   followed recipes   food didn t taste good   return because it didn t work for me      
2230,5.0,                       i love this air fryer  i have used it just about every day since i got it  it doesn t always give you accurate times on the recipe app but with a little time  you learn how long to cook stuff  highly recommend this product      
2231,1.0,                       too bulky  hard to slide basket in   out   lengthy heat up time   not for quick smaller meals       
2232,5.0,                       i have no oven or hot water so couldn t do all i wanted in my tiny trailer kitchen  this device fitted under the stove hood and there was    clearance for the exhaust  my air fryer has resurrected my interest in food just as the instant pot did when i got it  the cosori is well designed  cooks real fast      
2233,1.0,                       touch screen buttons failed within months  got around this wifi option but now the unit has failed because it does not recognize the basket being inserted  while i love the air fryer option  this product has been nothing but frustrating  also does not cook much food      
2234,5.0,                       my family love this air fryer   both of my teenage boys love using this to cook their pizza rolls  french fries  and today they made home made cheese sticks   my only slight negative is that it can be a chore cleaning with all of the ridges in the basket   but we are completely satisfied and i am purchasing one for my oldest daughter      
2235,1.0,                       this worked good at first but now it takes        minutes for me to get the basket to shut and stay so i can set the temp and timer  i have to practically slam it shut to work which moves my food so it is on top of each other and doesn t cook evenly  not worth the money      
2236,5.0,                       purchased this on july    and have used it multiple times for fries  mozzarella sticks and frozen potato skins   everything turned out wonderful  lined the bottom basket with foil and clean up was easy   plan on trying to make some healthier items in the future      
2237,5.0,                       we had a oil fryer it died on us and we decided to try out a air fryer and picked this up  we love this thing corn on the cob in under    min and some really good stuff too we are using this for a lot of stuff  and so far everytime it has been great      
2238,5.0,                       love this kitchen gadget   fries are crispy  desserts are perfection   it has a large basket  big enough to cook at meal for     people   watch the times on recipes though   it cooks a little faster then most air fryer recipes call for      
2239,5.0,                       super easy to clean love that is had its own recipes to try  love that it connects to an app so i don t have to be inside to know when it s done     
2240,2.0,                       i purchased this air fryer in january of this year and it is already in shambles  there is a smell that comes through that is horrible and makes you think you are eating toxic food  the paint also chips off inside over time  so hopefully i do not get sick  the screws of the basket came off and now it is not usable  i need to purchase a brand new one  definitely not going with this one  air fryers are amazing  but this one has lots of flaws      
2241,5.0,                       i got this for my mom for christmas and so far we have made shrimp  fish  and chicken in it  everything was super juicy and stayed crunchy  we tried wet batter and it dripped a bit  but everything that didn t was awesome      
2242,5.0,                       i ve been using this air fryer for over   year now and it s amazing  looks great too  after a year of constant use the handle for the basket broke so i contacted the manufacturer and the send me a new basket  would definitely recommend it and purchase again      
2243,1.0,                       took me pressing the power button many many times to eventually power on  i watched videos to see if i was doing something wrong and i wasn t  the touch screen is simply ineffective  not going to waste my time cooking in it  sending it right back so i can buy one that works the first time      
2244,5.0,                       the best air fryer i have ever purchased  the square basket is perfect  food lays flat and can be better organized than the round baskets  i highly recommend this fryer      
2245,5.0,                       omg this product is amazing   i don t know why i didn t have this along time ago  so easy to clean  and to use is so simple  the food is done so quickly      
2246,5.0,                       i love this and use it everyday   fries taste a little different but once you learn to lightly butter spray them after they re done so the seasoning will stick to it  they taste great  best investment ever      
2247,2.0,                       i was for the most part happy with this air fryer  it s easy to use and has a wide variety of uses but i noticed after only   uses that the coating in the part that holds the basket was already peeling off  i didn t use any abrasive cleaners  or scrubbers  it appears as if it bubbled up in many areas and started peeling during cleaning  this made me very unhappy     
2248,5.0,                       this thing is amazing  easy to use and all of our food has come out great  i really like the cook book that came with it too i just cooked some frozen pagoda egg rolls in it and they are so good      
2249,5.0,                       with limited counter space this machine is wonderful  i was fearful it would end up being another appliance collecting dust but it is so convenient and i use it almost daily  i often wish i had more than one to use at the same time  you re definitely able to use no oils but i use some for things like brussels and potato s to keep them moist but i definitely use less than i would saut ing or frying  the tray is large enough for a dinner for     but not large enough for whole chickens or large amounts of meat  love it      
2250,4.0,                       i have loved this product for over a year now  one of the most used appliances by far in my kitchen  tonight while cooking chicken the handle came off completely  the piece connecting to the basket had become very brittle and in some places appeared melted  i will purchase another but am very disappointed it did not last that long  very thankful no one was burned      
2251,5.0,                       a slight learning curve  but i m getting more and more comfortable using it   it is very easy to clean   it makes the best coated pork chops   this allows things to get cooked on both sides more evenly and keeps things crunchy my only issue  is i wish the cooking area was larger   i can only cook three pork chops  with bone    things do seem to cook faster  than in the regular oven  so not too big of a deal      
2252,5.0,                       modern and easy to use  the flavor is great  i would say the flavor is similar to cooking on an outside grill      
2253,5.0,                       works much better than expected   food is very crispy and tasty  plus can be used for baking   german chocolate cake tasted actually better than using regular oven  fluffy and moist       
2254,5.0,                       this thing works like a charm  have not had one bad dish  only complaint is that it s too small  to make a complete dish of fried cauliflower and fries for my husband and i takes   uses and by then something is certainly cold      
2255,3.0,                       worked great for little over   months then it wouldn t heat up  everything worked on it except the heating element wouldn t get hot called amazon and had a replacement shipped in a few days     
2256,3.0,                       the drawer doesnt slide in and out easily  i had to steady the machine with one hand to try and yank out the drawer with the other  it also gave off an electric smell when in use  im returning it      
2257,1.0,                       delivered today and returning tomorrow  thought touch buttons would be easy to use  you have to press hard on them and hope it works  app wont connect to appliance      
2258,5.0,                       the air fryer was everything i expected  what i didn t expect was the super customer service  i had a slight problem with the first fryer i bought  i called customer service and spoke to adrianna about my problem  she knew the product very well  she told what the company required and how to go about providing the information  i had a brand new fryer within    days  this  company provided the best   customer service  i have ever received      
2259,5.0,                       this smart wifi air fryer is super easy to use  here i made some crispy fried chicken in only    minutes that was full of flavor and very juicy  and  the clean up was a breeze  the wifi comes with easy to follow recipes  i use my air fryer   or more times a week       
2260,5.0,                       glad that we chose the larger size preheating is a great option quickly became a go to appliance for quick meal prep i like the squared shaped design  it adds to the basket size      
2261,1.0,                       wonderful but no longer working  not even the preheat  shorts out and flickers off and on   no idea how to get in touch with customer service to see about replacing      
2262,5.0,                       my first time use i cooked a ribeye steak  my family loved it  my af is so easy to use and the clean up is faster than if you cooked it in the oven  the next evening i cooked salmon   the temperature was perfect and this was also easy to prepare and clean up  i have the app on my phone and i love the wifi feature      
2263,4.0,                       screws that hold basket to handle loosen every time i use it  it isn t hard to tighten them but they do loosen easier than they should      
2264,5.0,                       it is easy to clean  it is very spacious and wide  what i love the best is that it had a preheat button  just by using that it melts the fat that s inside making it easier to clean      
2265,5.0,                       my old air oven died and i was looking for an alternative  i read many positive reviews on the corsi air fryer and decided to buy it  it is so convenient  i gave away my smaller air fryer and toaster oven  the corsi is compact and easy to use  i am very pleased      
2266,5.0,                       i can not explain to you in a review how much i love this air fryer  perfect  it works great      
2267,5.0,                       this makes roasting vegetables so easy  chicken breast cooks beautifully too  incredibly easy to use  i ve seen other people complain about a plastic smell  never experienced that  some people say it is loud  i would say it puts off the same amount of sound as the fan above your stove  definitely recommend     
2268,2.0,                       the controls are frustrating to operate  they are touch controls and you don t always get them to work  i have pressed and pressed the presets and they will not work consistently  i would not purchase this again      
2269,5.0,                       this is such a great product  the only thing i have had to do is turn down the temperature on the different setting for some food because it burns  other than that it cooks quickly and food taste good after it s done cooking      
2270,5.0,                       i love this air fryer  i use it for my family all the time  the presets are so helpful and i love the feature where you can keep your food warm  the flavor is wonderful  it s easy to figure out how to use and the best part is it s so easy to clean afterward  everything literally just slides off of the trays and into the sink  definitely would recommend to anyone looking into an air fryer      
2271,5.0,                       only one item of concern  no way to cook multiple foods in the one basket  it needs a separator      
2272,5.0,                       i can t say enough good things about this airfrier   it s large enough to do a lot in one batch  but small enough to fit on my counters we hardly use our oven anymore  food turns out perfect every time  no more grease small in my house      
2273,5.0,                       i love this air fryer   clean up is a breeze   very easy to use      
2274,1.0,                       i purchase to of the wi fi models and had to return both due to the fact that not all the bugs would work i am now can order the model without the wi fi and see if i have better luck      
2275,1.0,                       this is crap the front button panel does not work the only way it can be used is from phone app absolutely going to return it      
2276,2.0,                       the touch screen doesn t work  and neither does the wifi  the temp is also inconsistent  if the screen says     sometimes it s actually    ish and other times it can be even close to    ish  regret buying it  but don t want to go through the hassle of returning it        
2277,5.0,                       i love my new cosori air fryer  it s easy to operate  it s easy to clean  it also makes good food easy  i definitely recommend getting the cosori air fryer  can t wait to make many more recipes in it      
2278,4.0,                       while this works great  the manual for newbies is not clear  you just have to figure out what to push to get the pre heat going  could be a lot moe user freindly     
2279,5.0,                       i use the air fryer for mostly roasting vegetables and cooking meat  it works great with both  roasting vegetables are a little crunchier than an oven plus you don t have to heat up an oven   cooking meat gets it a crunchy taste without it being battered and fried  you can batter it for more of a fried look and taste  but we don t   it cooks fish great      
2280,3.0,                       love it   but  i almost ate a basket screw that came out  and in total i had to retighten the basket screws   times  so keep an eye on them  also the basket sometimes is a pain to clean     
2281,5.0,                       it took me a couple of tries to feel comfortable using an airfryer  but now i love it   it s easy to use  easy to clean and with each use  the results get better and better       
2282,1.0,                       already starting to rust   we love this air fryer   it is our first one and have been incredibly impressed with the evenness of the cooking   just wish the no stick coating around the metal trays was of a higher quality   working with them for replacements      
2283,1.0,                       we have had this air fryer since mid aug and it s literally falling apart    all the screws are coming out    amazon said this is our problem and we have to deal with the company directly  of course they keep  forgetting  to send the link   i question some of these reviews due to the fact that it s falling a part  we ve had a few other air fryer s over the years that were amazing  stay away if you don t want to screw in your food     
2284,1.0,                       the touch pad doesn t seem to work  as mentioned in other review comments  i was managing with the app for a while  but when i changed my wifi connection i wasn t able to rest the air fryer to connect to it  waste of money      
2285,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i am sooo happy with the purchase   its a bit loud but it does an incredible job      
2286,1.0,                       i brought my air fryer on may  after two months is not working and then l tried to contact support the website is closed omg     
2287,5.0,                       all i can say is this air fryer is amazing  it s large  beautiful and cooks magnificently  so simple to use  although it does sound like a spaceship when cooking  i imagine that s just the convection air circulating so it can t be helped      
2288,5.0,                       i am very happy with this purchased   the product design is absolutely stylish and the function setting is clear and easy to use  plus easy to clean it  also the     recipe is very handy  love it        
2289,5.0,                       i love this air fryer   super easy to use   i love how big the basket is  i put   large chicken drumsticks in it hit the  chicken  button and they came out perfectly  so easy to clean no grease smell   the user manual tells you how to prep your air fryer and you re good to go   i wish i would have bought this years ago   totally worth the price      
2290,1.0,                       had fryer for   months  used about    times and stopped working  just shut off one day and won t power back up  don t waste your money      
2291,1.0,                       i loved this air fryer  i mean  love  love  loved it  i used it at least once a week  it was so simple to use and clean  it cooked everything really evenly  but it sputtered and shut off a year into owning it and will not turn back on  after reading similar reviews  i see now that it will not be revived  it s frustrating to spend upwards of      on an appliance to only have it last a year  not cool      
2292,4.0,                       i used this today for the first time   made chicken wings   they were very yummy  but the most important thing  for me  was the ease of clean up   i had purchased  and used  a different brand  and returned it because it was a nightmare to clean up   the basket was very difficult to remove and the grill was a removable wire piece of junk   this fryer was so much better   the basket came out very easily  and the grill is a coated piece that is part of the basket  not removable   loved it   would definitely recommend     
2293,2.0,                       i have only had this air fryer for   months  i love everything about it until the last month when the coating in the basket is pealing off  it s gotten so bad i can t use it  very disappointing because i truly love everything else about it      
2294,1.0,                       touch screen is garbage   doesn t work well at all  most of the time the buttons won t activate from touch  i have to keep pressing the buttons over and over  and it almost never registers  trust the reviews about the touch buttons not working      
2295,4.0,                       however  the food comes out good and crispy and very convenient  just pop bacon into the fryer and press the bacon button and keep getting ready for work or cooking the next dish  cleaning is easy      
2296,4.0,                       i bought this air fryer a few months ago and i just love  i find that it works great for cooking frozen foods such as onion rings  corn dogs  fries  we use it a lot but not just for prepared foods  great staple kitchen small appliance      
2297,5.0,                       i ve bought   of them so far   mostly as gifts  our favorite air fryer  good for everything      
2298,5.0,                       got this for my wife as a gift and she can t stop talking about it  if you don t  know how to cook like me   this will save your dinner  the food is delicious  just place it in the fryer and it s  done  my top purchase if the year       
2299,4.0,                       heating element is placed too close to the frying basket causing uneven browning   user must interrupt and modify programming to shake and turn over food for optimal results      
2300,5.0,                       i couldn t wait until i got it  heated up pizza  not mushy  making a small turkey breast and smells awesome  highly recommend product and seller      
2301,2.0,                       looks of the fryer is attractive  package very good  but    the release button for the fry basket you have to press down on  well it ripped half of my finger nail   not good for females longer  finger nails      it was even hard for my husband to press down on to release  i am returning it       
2302,5.0,                       very easy to use and clean  not quite the flavor you get with traditional deep frying  but we are very happy with the purchase      
2303,5.0,                       absolutely love this air fryer  easy to operate  super easy to clean and the food comes out fantastic  it has completely changed the way i cook  where has this been all my life      
2304,3.0,                       the basket does not seal well allowing steam to come out the front and side  very difficult to get food crispy  easy to clean and controls are intuitive  nice recipe book included      
2305,5.0,                       this thing is my baby  i cook every meal in it  the little guy helps me to cook fast and even get the kids to eat more vegetables  ps im  the kids       
2306,5.0,                       it s so easy to cook in  so easy to clean  i ve never been a techy person but i bought alexa when i bought this it makes my life so much easier when it comes to cooking  coming home to   kids and a husband momma now has time to workout     
2307,5.0,                       i like this air fryer  this is my first air fryer and i am using it for a month now  atleast twice a week  it s easy to clean and works great  it feels little flimsy but does it s job very good      
2308,1.0,                       product was great for the first   months  now the tray won t stay in during the cooking process  today  the tray fell out while cooling and landed on the floor  is it bent and won t fit inside  you re better off getting a top loading air fryer      
2309,1.0,                       i ve tried using my air fryer for   months and it gives off an awful chemical smell and the food taste like chemicals too  i m very disappointed with this purchase      
2310,5.0,                       this air fryer is so easy to use and clean  the recipe guide book has easy to make  delicious recipes  i have tried recipes from every category and they were all delicious  the best thing about this air fryer is the easy cleanup  if you are looking for an air fryer   this is it      
2311,5.0,                       large size and comes with a directions  i did make the  fast food  style fries and used the fries option and i think it was a few min too long as they were pretty crunchy  which was totally my fault because i didn t account for the fact they were thinner  it was extremely easy to clean as well   just wiped it out     
2312,5.0,                       absolutely love my cosori air fryer     qt   has opened up a whole new world of cooking for me   love the clean sleek design of it   ive cooked chicken  fish  pork chops  sausage  french fries  baked potato and all have turned out awesome   two critical points   check your food every few minutes for the level of doneness you want and be sure to spray the basket with cooking oil spray and spray your food with olive oil      
2313,3.0,                       it works great just fiednt do all of what i thought it would do   still figuring out how to fry with it      
2314,5.0,                       i was given a cheap air fryer and told my mom how much i loved it so she wanted to try one   the reviews on mine were terrible so i upgraded to this one for her   she loves it   learning curve as this one is digital but she is using it often and really enjoying it      
2315,5.0,                       first time steaks    holy cow   amazing   super easy to clean     tasted liuu u e they came straight off the grill       
2316,5.0,                       it s perfect  this thing is just perfect to me  it s very easy to use and to clean  there s no one day that i don t use this at my home  i use it every single day and will use it till cosori wants haha      
2317,5.0,                       the machine is very user friendly makes a bit of noise during operation  but the output is so much healthier for me and my family  plus it won t leave that normal odor in the air that tends to come with heavy frying in oil      
2318,4.0,                       i haven t try the alexa feature yet  but it works pretty good  tips  you need to try couple times then find out the best timer for cooking  don t need the receipt      
2319,1.0,                       wasn t a fan     
2320,5.0,                       so far i love it  everything been good except for the blooming onion  but that s probably me       
2321,2.0,                       i got this particular air fryer because a friend of mine had it  and i loved how great it was  however  the one i got is almost perfect except for the  touch  buttons  for some reason  the buttons don t function as they should  i have to press     times and try out different fingers in order to change the cook settings  i ve resorted to not changing the temperature and time because it takes too long to get the buttons to work      
2322,5.0,                       love it   really good flavor and the perfect option to still get that bbq look even in the winter time when you don t want to be outside grilling   a little noisey  but not too bad      
2323,4.0,                       very good fryer  it cooks fast and does not dry food  been using it for over a month and we are very happy with results  had a small problem witrecommend bin at first and called company and service was excellent  they resolved the issue very fast and sent me a new one  i would highly recomend this  all fat drips to bottom and food comes out crispy      
2324,5.0,                       i wish i wouldn t have waited so long to buy this  since this purchase i have bought another one for my brother and have recommended it to two other people  super easy to clean  very easy to use  we have commercial grade appliances in our kitchen and we still find herself pulling this out a couple times a week to use      
2325,5.0,                       i have had this air fryer for about   months and use it every week if not everyday  my ribeyes are sooooo good and taste like they just came off a flamed grill  my fries are crispy without them having to be dumped in oil  everything cooks so evenly and quickly  i swear by this air fryer  i m so glad i chose this one out of all the air fryers i did research on for literally months  best purchase i ve made in a while      
2326,5.0,                       very easy to use but it puts out a ton of heat  not as much as an oven but still a lot  works well though  taste is as close to frying as you can get without being fried  size is great  you can cook an entire small chicken in it      
2327,5.0,                       not exactly as good as a deep fryer in taste i love it though i reheat chicken brisket donuts  much prefer it to microwave and much prefer it to heating up my big oven     
2328,5.0,                       very pleased with this air fryer   i ve used it for pizza rolls  asparagus  and potatoes  i ve even named it steve  sometime steve can be a jerk  i went to high school with a person named steve  he was a real tool  steve was horrible at sports so we all made fun of him  but steve the air fryer has been nothing but awesome  steve the air fryer does not suck like the steve i went to high school with      
2329,5.0,                       it s a learning curve but if you keep eye on it you can learn  this was a pork cutlet     
2330,5.0,                       i have never had an issue   it works like a champ      
2331,5.0,                       i would like too see a  heavier gauge power cord with a grounded plugthe first kitchen test cajun chicken drum legs   they were fantastic and very quick to make         
2332,5.0,                       i have been looking for a few years at the air fryers  nothing really caught my eye until i saw this one  ever since day one of get this baby out of the box it has been an excellent buy  i love how user friendly the touchscreen is  along with the perfect sized basket  i did purchase the extra accessories as well  the cook book that came with the air fryer has yummy receipes  i m so impressed and satisfied with my purchases        
2333,5.0,                       i love this air fryer   so easy to use   i have roasted a chicken  steak  banana bread  etc   everything has turned out delicious      
2334,5.0,                       the best chicken wings i ve ever had are made in this air fryer  everything we ve made in it has been delicious  easy to use  cooks fast  and can make some recipes more healthy because you won t need to cook in oils      
2335,5.0,                       bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loves it  chicken wings are one of his favorites and now he makes then    times a week with this air fryer  it s so easy to use and to clean  although there is a bit of a weird taste for the first use or so  but that went away quickly  we ve also used this to make fries tots  and they come out just as good as if they were actually fried in a restaurant      
2336,5.0,                       love  great size for a family of four  easy enough for both of our teenagers to use  easy to clean  large basket to fix a lot at once  steaks in it we re amazing        
2337,5.0,                       cosori air fryer was a replacement for my beloved first air fryer   did not know what to expect since i had never heard of cosori brand   i bought this air fryer based on all the good reviews   i am so glad i did   so far it has been a joy to cook with and maybe even better than my first air fryer    it cooks evenly and the features are awesome   it is also very easy to clean and it appears to be very well made  durable    i highly recommend this product   you wont know what you ever did without it      
2338,1.0,                       didn t work out if the box  have a replacement coming  but nothing is quite like surprising your wife with something she really wanted and then having it not function once unboxed      
2339,5.0,                       love this air fryer so far   it s still pretty new  i ve only used it a few times  but it does the job  the only complaint i have is that the beeps are really loud  i wish i could turn down the volume lol     
2340,5.0,                       my son loves this gift and continues to thank me for it  so much better than microwaving food      
2341,5.0,                       great size  can t recommend enough   it s the best at re heating food and making sandwich m we let s   chicken wings and everything is great   i ve had other air fryers    this one is the best      
2342,1.0,                       first day using  very strong smell second day using  basket already stuck and cannot be removed from the base  rd day using  stop working all together       
2343,3.0,                       overall cooking performance wise  very good air fryer  it s easy to use and clean  my only concern was that the fryer had a plastic smell when being used  i even sent one in for a replacement and the new one still has a plastic smell when cooking foods  the second fryer had the same issue of having the plastic smell but just a little less  i suggest do some research before buying any air fryer in general      
2344,5.0,                       best thing i have bought it a long time   i use this all of the time and it works so well  totally recommend      
2345,5.0,                       if i could advertise on my fb and instagram i would  i do show pictures of my food  this is by far the best appliance i have ever purchased  i cook   to   days a week dinner and weekends breakfast and lunch   i have not once used my oven since getting this in the mail  i have shared my pictures and told so many about this product  love it     
2346,5.0,                       it has a basket instead of trays so really easy to clean   we use it a lot faster than heating up the oven     
2347,5.0,                       i purchased the product    yrs ago and had worked perfectly until a heating problem came out  i reached out to the cosori customer service and got the feedback promptly  i received a new replacement within one week  i m pretty happy about their great customer service      
2348,5.0,                       i ve purchased     one for myself and then one for christmas gift   this product is a great size and easy to use      
2349,4.0,                       edit  it was a simple mix up  and the people at amazon and cosori where both extremely professional and have already got a replacement on the way  as the saying goes  alls well that ends well it appears i have received a used cosori     quart air fryer  despite paying for a new one  there is a residue on the inside of the basket  plus grease stains on the startup guide  the tape holding the basket in place was already peeled back  and a complete lack of the cookbook  it plainly states on the side of the box is in the box  not sure it it was a mix up or what  but disappointed nevertheless      
2350,1.0,                       i just got mine delivered today    the front is completely cracked   i cant find any contact info  i would just like a replacement  basket and pan as i ve never even tried it     
2351,2.0,                       the one of handle screws fell off and lost is inside the handle compartment hole after a month  i managed to insert another one  after another   months  the plastic part where the screws are broken  it is very bad design on the handle with   screws on a fragile piece of plastic  the air fryer is working but taking the basket out is a pain      
2352,2.0,                       the fries and sweet potato fries don t come out nearly as crispy as expected   the unit almost always takes more time  than listed in the recipe  to get things done   the flavor of the food is usually kind of bland      
2353,5.0,                       amazing air fryer  super easy to use and clean up  this has become a major part of the cooking in our house  can t imagine life without it

2357,5.0,                       my mother in law is very pleased   she uses it all the time  so easy to use and easy to clean      
2358,1.0,                       i returned this product as it is not large enough to feed a family of   much less any guests      
2359,1.0,                    explot   y se rompi  una parte la parrilla que da calor a   minutos de empezar a fre r en programa para pollo  cambie la primeraya es casi un mes  que recogieron el producto  env e las evidencias a cosori y hasta ahora no me solucionan el problema

2361,5.0,                       received the     qt air fryer and so far everything i ve made has turned out crispy and tasty      i haven t used my oven since   the best part is the clean up is easy and their customer service fantastic  featured in the photo is my first try at cooking with the air fryer   wings never tasted so good      
2362,2.0,                       screws came off because of heat  and the curved basket made it hard to clean      
2363,5.0,                       i have used this air fryer about       times and i have to say     i love it  it cooks the food in a much shorter time than the oven  i love the size  and am impressed with the ease of use and of cleaning  the customer service is also impressive  thanks cosori      
2364,4.0,                       it worked great  but the display goes dark when you remove the pan  which is annoying  also  when making multiple batches it is frustrating that is has no memory and needs to be reprogrammed for every batch     
2365,1.0,                       do not buy this arrived broken  not damaged  it just doesn t work  created ticket with cosori the next day  got a support ticket number  then nothing  silence  no reply to email  no call  nothing  it has been over   weeks  no excuse do not buy this      
2366,5.0,                       super easy to cleaneasy to use   makes corn on the cob perfect  nothing is dry eitheronly negative is the size of the machine      
2367,5.0,                       love this so much  my first one died after   months  i contacted the manufacturer and they didn t hesitate to give me a refund      
2368,5.0,                       i love this air fryer   works great  easy to use and a wonderful addition   sweet potato fries are amazing out of this as are taquitos   love love love it      
2369,5.0,                       bought one for our personal use and since then we have purchased for our entire family   absolutely fantastic and clean up is a breeze   great flavor   cook two new york stripes side by side for    minutes depending on thickness and you will think they were cooked on the grill      
2370,3.0,                       louder than a microwave      
2371,5.0,                       this is the  rd fryer i ve bought  i even bought a ninja and all the previous ones had a nasty smell during use and or first cycle  this one did not      
2372,5.0,                       easy to use and super convenient i have gotten two  the smaller one and this one they are both amazing      
2373,5.0,                       these are the best   my first one did break a little on the handle but i use all the time and have had it for over a year      
2374,5.0,                       i must have watched over a dozen videos and read hundreds of reviews to pick a new air fryer  everyone said what a great product the cosori air fryer is and i definitely agree  it is well worth what we paid for it and i know it s something my family will use several times a week      
2375,5.0,                       i did a lot of research on air fryers before purchasing the cosori  we wanted something big enough  but not huge  it s not the quietest  but it s not loud  about the same as a microwave running   very easy to use and the food is so much better      
2376,5.0,                       wow  i am so happy with this air fryer  it is amazing and works so well  highly recommend      
2377,5.0,                       easy to use  easy to clean   it s like having a mini oven on the countertop   crisps up tater tots well  with no hassle of flipping  as you would in a conventional oven  half way through we don t even use all the featured settings but it s cool they re there my wife uses it now more than our oven      
2378,5.0,                       wife loves it  she is making everything in this thing  wife happy i m happy  cost a little more than others but well worthier     do it     
2379,5.0,                       been using it for a few times now  so far so good  food came out quickly except it does makes huge noises      
2380,5.0,                       really like the square tray over the round ones  touch screen is very responsive and easy to use  very easy to clean as well the images provided are way better than anything i could submit so i did not include any      
2381,4.0,                       unfortunately   the control panel did not detect my finger and was really a challenge  i did read some others had similar problems  i sent it back today  the few trials i made did work out      
2382,5.0,                       my son had one and i tried his  i loved the ease of use and cleanup  i did buy the larger size  i now cook our bacon in it  so easy to clean up  i even baked my husband s frozen pot pie in it  quick and doesn t heat up the kitchen      
2383,5.0,                       we love this thing  it is easy to use and we have managed to cook try many new recipes with it  i was worried that it was another kitchen gimmick but it isn t      
2384,1.0,                       the unit i received was defective and had to be returned   i never really had a good opportunity to put it through it s paces   otherwise i m sure it would have been satisfactory      
2385,4.0,                       i love the fryer  it works very well  and is easy to clean  my only complaint is that i wish there was a tactile response to the buttons      
2386,5.0,                       this is the best appliance we ever bought   it has been a great alternative to using the oven  and everything we have made in it has been great   it is very easy to clean  easy to understand the controls  when you cannot use a grill in the winter months  this replaces it perfectly      
2387,5.0,                       i bought this for my wife for christmas  here is her review  and yes  she uses it everyday and i have benefited from it i love my cosori air fryer and use it every day  i ve made lots of different things in it and the preset buttons make it very user friendly  they have awesome customer service too  i had a minor problem and contacted them and they took care of it right away  thanks cosori      
2388,5.0,                       i wanted an air fryer to use as an oven during the summer and i really love it   it does not heat up the house at all   it s a snap to clean and easy to handle the baskets   of course there is a learning curve on how and what to cook  but there are a ton of youtubes and blogs so this has not been a problem      
2389,5.0,                       best air fryer out  works great and i love how you can tell alexa to preheat or stop cooking      
2390,1.0,                       it just stopped working after the fourth time  extremely disappointed      
2391,1.0,                       it overlooks all my food  it is big and bulky  do not recomend  i would return it if i could but the window has passed      
2392,5.0,                       been using this fryer for   months  works well and cooks fast  haven t used all the pre set buttons  but the ones i have are accurate      
2393,5.0,                       great air fryer  it doesn t take up too much counter space  it isn t very loud and is easy to use  i wish cleanup was a little more simple and i don t like that the button to take the basket out of the bottom is hard to push      
2394,5.0,                       my wife bought a small deep fryer not long before we bought this awesome air fryer  long story short we used the deep fryer once and we use this almost everyday  since getting this we have put the deep fryer in storage  we cook everything in it   baked potatoes  fried liver  fried chicken  whole chickens  turkey breast  freis  tater tots  tater wedges and the list goes on and on and on  everyone that asks me which air fryer to but i point them to this brand  easy to operate and a breeze to clean   in a word fantastic      
2395,5.0,                       we have this air fryer for almost   months now  and we have used it quite a bit  cooking french fries  battered shrimps grilled whole corns  grilled bbq chickens      etc  and  they all turned out great the     qt is a pretty large capacity  and the handle mechanism and the electronic control have been great      
2396,2.0,                       does not live up to the rave reviews  the display requires an excessive amount of force to push the buttons  any of them  system is not intuitive  if you push  french fries   for example  the system would not let me change the temp or time  none of the buttons actually worked  even if i could push them  steam also escapes  which means the food does not fry properly  this was evident by the uneven crisp on the food  do not buy      
2397,1.0,                       don t buy  cheaply made handle broke off in less than a year  there is no one to contact support phone disconnected     
2398,5.0,                       i love this thing  this has changed the way i cook and it saves me a lot of time in the kitchen  i love that it can fit a lot of food inside of it and that it comes with a handy recipe book  i would recommend this      
2399,5.0,                       i absolutely love this air fryer  great for doing meal prepping  easy to use and clean  highly recommend     
2400,1.0,                       everything about this air fryer just screams cheap  the basket after   months of regular use lost it non stick surface  only washed it with a soft tooth brush  also the handle of the basket broke  if you buy it be very gentle with it  one wrong pull will end its connection to the base  i recommend shelling out a little more money to get a higher quality product      
2401,4.0,                       had this air fryer for   days  i ve already made cornish hens  a grilled cheese sandwich and some fried cauliflower  my only wish is that it was larger so i could cook more then one dish at a time  my hubby is loving the food i made with it      
2402,5.0,                       bought this for my aunt who is hard to buy for  she loves it  made her keto diet even easier cooking for one  it has replaced her grill   fast  easy clean up and cooks amazing  never been more happy with a purchase      
2403,5.0,                       i knew the air fryer would be great for quick food with less grease  however what exceeded my expectations with this air fryer is i had a power surge and then i flipped the breaker back on the air fryer had saved the time left and setting for my food  it saved me from over cooking or under cooking  well worth it      
2404,5.0,                       easy to use and clean  cooks well and quickly  would purchase again  customer service is excellent as well      
2405,1.0,                       didn t even last a year   now when i try to use it  my house smokes up and food is overcooked despite being the same food recipes ive cooked since i got it would not recommend   this is only     months old      
2406,2.0,                       the screws on the basket have to be tightened after every other use  the button to increase temperature gave up the ghost shortly after purchase      
2407,5.0,                       i overcooked my salmon  it was delicious  it cooks so fast without the terrible smell of fish and great taste  yum    best invention     
2408,5.0,                       i finally joined the air fryer gang  and i m obsessed  so easy to use and great for cooking for one or my entire family      
2409,5.0,                       i like not having to heat the oven on hot days in the summer for meals  only dislike is when cooking something premade with grease in it  you have to remember to clean above burner after it has cooled   i use mine on rangetop with ventilation fan  to cut down on any heat build up in kitchen   use very frequently after work for a quick meal       
2410,1.0,                       i only use it once because it smelled like plastic was burning inside of the unit  it was returned immediately      
2411,5.0,                       i love that this fryer cleans so easily        haven t used it much yet  but one reason i ordered it is because of the square basket         i figured it would hold more  and i believe it does      
2412,5.0,                       i have been studying these to figure out whether to buy one or not  we almost never fry because of my husband s health condition  but now we can  fry  things again  made onion rings the first night and they were absolutely delish      
2413,5.0,                       this is my first air fryer purchase  we use it almost everyday  perfect size for a family of     love it  why did i wait so long       
2414,3.0,                       great when it worked   became harder to use touch panel and finally doesn t work  can only use auto settings      
2415,5.0,                       excelente producto     no words to explain how good this works  thank youi do recommend            
2416,5.0,                       cooks perfectly  i have cooked chicken and i have cooked fries  both have turned out perfectly  the presets make cooking a breeze      
2417,5.0,                       it s very easy to use although i thought it would be larger inside for the size of it  i enjoy learning to use it and everything i have made could ve use improvement but still tasted good      
2418,1.0,                       the entire middle buttons have stopped working  including where you set the temp and time  this happened on the first one i received so i returned it for a replacement  i am now   months in and it has stopped working  it was never very easy and i d often have to find just the right spot for it to work but now it has broken completely  highly disappointed      
2419,5.0,                       great product  easy to use and and clean  highly recommend to anyone to buy this product      
2420,5.0,                       i love this air fryer first time i have used one  it paired right up with my phone and is so easy to use  i would definitely recommend buying this product      
2421,5.0,                       this is easy to use and produces great tasting food with less fat than frying  but a similar texture   we have made potatoes  chicken  veggies  and even chicken nuggets for my daughter and it all came out great      
2422,1.0,                       this was perfect while it was working   it would ve been   stars    less star bc the front buttons didn t work so well only had for almost   months and the heating element stopped working just blowing air       
2423,5.0,                       i can t get over how easy this is to clean  i don t even use any non stick spray  i am obsessed with this air fryer  everything i make comes out so full of flavor and cooked to perfection  highly recommend     
2424,5.0,                       i love this air fryer  my oldest son kept trying to talk me into buying one  i did a lot of research and read the cosori is one of the higher rated  the other thing i read was buy bigger than you think you need  best advice ever  we use this every day  if not multiple times a day      
2425,5.0,                       i love this brand  i ve made fried chicken  sweet potato fries  pork chops  breakfast pizza and more and i ve only had this air fryer a short time  everything turns out really good  great when cooking for one or two people      
2426,5.0,                       if you are using to heat frozen pizza  fries  chicken  don t go by the times suggested  it takes less time to cook  i like that it lets you check your food without hassle     
2427,1.0,                       hazardous  love the unit  but hot drawer shoots open during cooking and preheat  once it shot    inches across counter and onto the floor  another onto the counter still upright  grateful no burns happened  outside return window  not optimistic on credit being issued      
2428,4.0,                       only had it for about a week  so far i love it  my chicken came out fabolous with out all the grease     will update in a few months     
2429,5.0,                       i like the flavor and texture of food cooked in this air fryer  it is very easy to use  and clean up      
2430,4.0,                       so far  it has worked well  and we ve had great results  food wise  the one really frustrating quirk about it enters in if you re cooking multiple batches of the same thing  ie  egg rolls   every time you open the drawer  it shuts off and erases your cooking time temperature settings  not a deal breaker  necessarily  but it can definitely be frustrating      
2431,5.0,                       i have been using this since the day it was delivered  like almost everyday  its so easy to use to cook anything or to re heat food  very fast too  use it to prep breakfast  bacon and sausages  or prep dinner e g  chicken wings or spring rolls etc  absolutely highly recommended      
2432,5.0,                       i have ordered from amazon for years and never written a review   wow    this was an amazing air fryer   i have made french fries and fried chicken    both were amazing   the fried chicken was so juicy and tender  i was quite surprised because i did breasts instead of legs and thighs   it turned out great with such little mess   no oil over my stove and the guilty feeling of how long it would have had to sit in oil to cook   i think everyone is getting air fryers for christmas        
2433,3.0,                       there were three screws securing the barrel  and two suddenly fell out  fortunately  i got it out of the dishwasher and put it back in  watch out for screws      
2434,5.0,                       great product  reheated fries are actually good great for hot wings    fish too      
2435,5.0,                       we have used this air fryer at least   times now and i love it   it is easy to use  cooks quickly and is a breeze to clean   we don t have a dishwasher but with the non stick coating  it cleans in a jiffy   easy to keep clean  i don t know why we waited so long      
2436,5.0,                       love love love this af  work great cooking my vietnamese pork chop  easy to clean and i use foil to put on the bottom so all i need to wash is the basket     
2437,4.0,                       it is definitely different  cooks food  no oil so items take a bit longer to cook but well worth the wait    my only dislike is that somehow the basket close to the handle has broken already      
2438,5.0,                       love the air fryer  don t even need to dethaw chicken breast or fish and still cooks perfectly  one little thing i wish it could do is app related  would love if they added a shake basket at certain set points for a reminder when making your own recipes   buttons are not easy to press but works perfectly alexa  no buttons needed  highly recommend purchasing      
2439,1.0,                       with my first use with sweet potatoes  it completely shut down  i followed the instructions  letting it preheat prior to cooking  once i started cooking  at the halfway mark after i shook my sweet potatoes and put the basket back in  the whole system shut off  all of the buttons were not responsive  i checked the outlet with other appliances and they still worked  unfortunately  i will be returning this      
2440,5.0,                       we love our cosori  we have wanted an air fryer for a long time  but was not sure of which one to choose   my husband did his research for a while  he came up with cosori and it was not a disappointment   we love it so much  it cooks evenly and the clean up is so easy      
2441,5.0,                       this fryer is badass lol cooks great and fasts plus easy to clean     chicken wings  no problem at all and cooked nearly perfect imo and it informs me on my phone when it s finished  we love it     
2442,5.0,                       this is an excellent product that is so simple to use and yields tasty food     
2443,5.0,                       i love this air fryer and i m so glad i brought a corsori  after looking at other brands this one is truly the best      
2444,5.0,                       the first thing i made was chicken wings  and they came out great  crispy on the outside  and well cooked on the inside  the accompanying cookbook has so many recipes that i will be trying  which is rare  so often  a cookbook has just a few recipes i am willing to try  but this cookbook is loaded with good ideas  i     
2445,5.0,                       i was skeptical to get an air fryer but finally did it and it was the best decision ever  after reading a lot of reviews i decided on this model and i m sure i made the right choice  i have had it now for two weeks almost and i have used it at least once everyday  i ve made bacon  fried pickles  chicken  burgers  butternut squash  steak  and salmon  it is so easy and fast and the food turns out perfect every time  i highly suggest it      
2446,5.0,                       we love this air fryer  it cooks to perfection and is easy to clean  so happy we purchased this      
2447,3.0,                       i love how easy this is to use  but that plastic smell that is supposed to go away after a few uses is still there and it doesn t look like it s going to go away ever  it s very disappointing because the smell is now leaching into the food  if i had to do it over  i d probably get something else      
2448,5.0,                       i love the touch screen and the pre set buttons  it took no time to learn to use it  i also like the included recipe book i researched a long time before deciding on this air fryer and i am so glad that i decided on this one  i highly recommend it      
2449,1.0,                       product seems to work using the app  the touch display is defective as others have mentioned  i requested a replacement product after the first one had this issue  i tested out the replacement product and it also has this issue  but hey at least the power button worked on the replacement      
2450,5.0,                       this was my son s idea but glad we listened   fries are much better and quicker   it really uses less time cooking fries on this than oven      
2451,5.0,                       absolutley love this air fryer  so worth it  only thing that sucks is the constant need to tighten the screws on the basket  but as long as you know to check them  its perfect      
2452,5.0,                       just amazing   we have cooked multiple things in this fryer and they have all come out delicious   we love to cook but my daughter does not and she loves the air fryer   we made mahi last night and it was so juicy and delicious   this one has been written up as one of the best     
2453,5.0,                       amazing worth the price  couldn t believe how well the foods cooked  my family couldn t believe it wasn t actually fried  so many options in the recipe book as well     
2454,5.0,                       this is a wonderful way to enjoy fried flavor without the extra calories  my husband was not a fan of air fryers until i got this one and tried it  now we love using it and eating what we make      
2455,5.0,                       a great air fryer and i ve tried others  easy to use and pre sets are a big plus  made air fryer fresh shrimp last night  olive oil and minced garlic and red crushed pepper  used the shrimp pre set  came out excellent  love the preheat also  don t hesitate to purchase  many recipes available online and on pinterest for air frying      
2456,1.0,                       i bought it couple of months ago  today was my third time trying to use but wasn t in function  after power on the sensor wouldn t work further to get on the screen   this first time i used take long time to open the screen after touching many times  i am very disappointed to purchase in the expensive price  please make sure to use it couple of days      
2457,5.0,                       love it  buttons are easy and useful  fries are the best  haven t really used the wifi part but i m sure it s fine      
2458,5.0,                       received this earlier than expected that was a nice bonus  we tried multiple items and have not been unhappy with any of the results  even made cinnamon rolls and homemade stromboli  the poor stove has been sitting idle since we got this  meals are quick and cleanup is fast and easy  we just ordered another one for my father in law      
2459,5.0,                       love  love this air fryer   the presets make is so easy to use  basket material very easy to clean  no peeling   highly recommend this  i would buy again as a gift or for myself      
2460,5.0,                       i love the fact that with a simple wash of   pieces you are back up and running in a few minutes   this works fabulously   i will buy one for a gift for my mother   love it      
2461,5.0,                       works great and is easy to clean   only thing you have to do is learn how long to cook things since it is faster than a regular oven and slower than an oil deep fryer      
2462,5.0,                       highly recommend real crispy chicken no oil needed the oil drop tray catches all the grease that comes out of the food pastelillos   min on each side total of   min     
2463,3.0,                       it is ok  not what i expected  i followed the recipe to make sweet potato fries  did it  x the allotment the recipe says that they still came out soggy  i put   stars since it  sort of  did the job      
2464,3.0,                       this is a decent air fryer when it comes to frying things but the design and instructions leave something to be desired the touchscreen ui is not very clear and the buttons feel very unresponsive  it s not a bad product by any means but i was expecting something a little better for the price      
2465,5.0,                       glad i went with the cosori  it s easy to use  easy to clean  and quick  it makes a nice crisp to foods such as salmon or chicken  and when reheating fries  it s as if they were just cooked      
2466,5.0,                       love this air fryer  super easy to use  easy to clean and i use it daily   i highly recommend this product      
2467,5.0,                       received my cosari air fryer yesterday  it was packaged well and easy to set up  we quickly skimmed over the manual but this unit is very easy to use  the basket does tend to stick a little but we are not bothered by that  we made sausage patties this morning and it took   minutes per side  no grease spattered stove to clean  i m very happy with this purchase and it has an    month warranty on it  you ll hear people complain about a plastic smell when they use it  we did notice it slightly but it wasn t anything major  my husband is like a kid at christmas  he can t wait to do chicken wings      
2468,5.0,                       love this fryer  purchased    and gave as gifts  i have heard nothing but rave reviews from my family  arrived in perfect shape and ina timely manner   i would recommend this item      
2469,5.0,                       love this air fryer i had a brand before that was awful so i thought i d try this one and this one is great    easy to use so cool it connect to your phone  and cooks things how it should unlike other brands i ve tried

2471,1.0,                       this air fryer is horrible everything comes out dry  no matter what you do  i followed recipe and you couldn t eat the meal i been talking with a lady that also has this fryer and she said the same thing  she will be writing a review i would not buy this fryer        
2472,5.0,                       easy to use     
2473,5.0,                       works really well and all the foods we have tried so far have turned out delicious     
2474,1.0,                       the burnt plastic chemical smell is terrible  to bad  this product could be all   star      
2475,5.0,                       my wife loved this for an xmas gift  works great  super cool   the food is amazing      
2476,1.0,                       handle broke off after a few months  cosori      number wasn t any help since they only accept emails  poor customer service      
2477,5.0,                       easy to use  especially since it works with alexa  food taste way better than using the microwave  definitely would recommend      
2478,5.0,                       bought this for my mom  she uses it for everything now  works great  really easy to use  super versatile  this thing is worth every penny as long as you use it enough  haven t tried making anything  fried  with it yet but it does make things adequately crispy the only really con i have is there s a bit of a smell while its running      
2479,5.0,                       thus far we ve cooked chicken  beef  potatoes  pork chops  bbq meat   it s great   we love it   we set it and come back and it s done  i love it

2481,5.0,                       i had to try this as soon as i got it and i have to say i love it  i tried fried chicken it came out juicy and golden brown the biggest plus was there wasn t the after smell of fried food in rhe apartment the only thing was that it took me a long time like    minutes to connect the appliance to my wi fiother then that this product is great      
2482,5.0,                       the cosori air fryer pre heats quickly and cooks food to a crispy texture   the non stick surface of the basket and its base make cleaning quick and easy   we are very pleased and wish we hadn t waited so long to purchase      
2483,5.0,                       got it for a christmas gift for my husband and he loves it we have tried chicken and different types of veggies in it  everything turns out great with excellent flavor it s also very easy to use almost self explanatory  cleaning it is also a breeze  it is our new go to in the kitchen  love this product

2485,5.0,                       best appliance i ever bought  would highly recommend this to anyone      
2486,5.0,                       this actually works really well and i think will be a a daily must in my cooking routine from now on  i m awed with the concept of this   stars  add flour for frying no flower for general cooking heating up     
2487,5.0,                       fantastic  i highly recommend this product  i have cooked a whole chicken  salmon  french fries  chicken parts and bacon    each recipe turned out absolutely delicious  clean up is so easy      
2488,2.0,                       i got this in may  i ve used it several times  first couple of times  i hand washed it in beginning and noticed it was starting to peel and turn brown and rusty and always look like there is dried food stuck to it  thought maybe it would be better in dishwasher but its not  this is my first air fryer so not sure what i am doing wrong  i will probably end up getting another brand      
2489,4.0,                       the wifi wouldn t link to phone and the troubleshoot was not helpful      
2490,5.0,                       pretty dang awesome for someone busy  i ve done southern fried chicken  veggies  and frozen foods  so quick and easy it s a game changer      
2491,5.0,                       this is a great product  easy to use does what it says and is a complete game changer on its own  add to it they took great care to create an easy to follow recipe book and for the price its a winner      
2492,1.0,                       the basket keeps popping out  hard to get baskets apart   all food tastes the same      
2493,5.0,                       never used one and didn t know much about them but got as a gift and absolutely love it   easy to use  great recipes included  quick  delicious and even healthier eating yah      
2494,1.0,                       the touchpad do not work  works okay after pulling the plug in and out about    times  very annoying  tried it now after purchasing a few months ago and now i can t return it        
2495,5.0,                       i am using this air fryer more and more    so easy to clen up after and saves me time

2501,5.0,                       best thing since slice bread  love cooking with it  have only done chicken wings and it s so much easier than deep frying in oil  in side with everyone else and not missing anything with the family  great flavor with what i have cooked  recommend to anyone who loves deep frying     minute clean up also   no oil that you have to wait for a day to cool down before cleaning that up

2504,5.0,                       my life has changed after buying this  my life is pretty boring so it didn t take much haha      
2505,5.0,                       this air fryer has been amazing  i use it on a daily basis and love it i have had   minor issues  screw falling out  and each time customer service has been super helpful and sent replacement parts with no hassle highly recommend this product      
2506,5.0,                       this thing is great  so efficient and easy to clean  makes my job waaay easier  i dont use it very often  maybe once or twice a week  but it definitely comes in handy  i can pop something in there while doing other things  its great      
2507,4.0,                       this is my first air fryer so i cannot compare to another brand   i have had the unit for one week and am satisfied with the product   there is a bit of a learning curve as there is with most new appliances   i have followed the directions carefully and i am pleased with the food and ease of use   the fan is louder than i expected  otherwise i would have rated the overall performance a five star   the basket is of ample size to cook most recipes      
2508,5.0,                       maybe it s me but i couldn t get the hang of cooking with this product      
2509,5.0,                       cooks things quicker and with less oil  we have enjoyed making a variety of different foods in this fryer and it is quickly becoming an oft used appliance in our home      
2510,5.0,                       it s perfect  it cooks the food exactly how you re hoping it would be      
2511,5.0,                       its easy to use with alexa  if it marks er  itd because the vents in the back are blowing out hot air onto itself or a close wall so it needs a lot of space behind to blow out all the heat  the food cooks great       
2512,5.0,                       i absolutely love my air fryer  the white is so beautiful and easy to keep clean  the best investment i ve made in a while  cooks food to perfection      
2513,5.0,                       this is my first air fryer i must say this baby saves me alot of time an cleaning good for sausages bacon chicken wings burgers salmon ive tried it all an it works perfect

2517,5.0,                       i loved everything about this air fryer   i had to keep my word to someone and give it up  i miss it very much  it has enough space to cook my wings and it cooked it well  i hate using oil and deep frying so i see the difference because i m very sensitive to greasy food      
2518,3.0,                       i don t like the air fryer  i never can get the time right  the food comes out dry or burnt      
2519,5.0,                       the size of the basket and the shape of the basket makes the cooking more even  i have cooked asparagus  french fries and boneless skinless chicken  fries and asparagus crispy the skinless boneless chicken juicy  homemade onion rings next yum yum      
2520,5.0,                       awesome  it s really nice being able to preheat this from couch over wifi     
2521,5.0,                       this is amazing  try cooking frozen pillsbury biscuits in this cooker   they are the best biscuits  and i didn t even like biscuits before   chicken is delicious  beef  pork  all delicious  it s a huge time saver too  i m totally satisfied with mine      
2522,4.0,                       this is an easy to clean air fryer that makes amazing food   especially wings    the only problem is the screws get loose on the handle and have to be tightened at least once a week  it makes me wonder how long the handle will last      
2523,2.0,                       to program anything we really have to press the buttons really hard half the time none of them even work   we have had this air fryer for less than a year   purchased may      poorly made  and seems cheap and flimsy   the screws holding the basket handle on have to be tightened before every use will be looking for better product      
2524,5.0,                       i am drilled with the cosori air fryer  it is easy to use and clean   the instruction booklet is easy to understand and the recipe book has great recipes to use  it is also easy to store away  thank you for creating such wonderful air fryer

2527,5.0,                       have used this air fryer twice now  i also bought my mom one  she has used hers more than i have and we are both very pleased  i read some reviews about a bad smell when cooking and we have not experienced that      
2528,4.0,                       i am pleased overall with this air fryer  the cooked food is flavorful and healthy my only complaint is with the basket release button  when i follow the directions and push it forward  it is tedious to pull the outer tray out  this is a design flaw and the release button should be easier to operate      
2529,5.0,                       the basket handle is a bit difficult to release but the machine is easy to use and makes great food  my only regret is that i didn t buy a bigger machine  love it      
2530,5.0,                       we love it   it has a fairly large footprint  but other then that it s great   the control panel is easy to use  and it cleans up quickly and easily   we cook meats  roast veggies  french fries  reheat foods  even bake biscuits

2544,5.0,                       i am not one to write reviews  however this product is special   it took a little getting used to   at first i had trouble removing the basket   patience paid off and i am enjoying salmon  steak fries  kabobs  etc   i especially like the toast feature   it even cooked a steak quickly and kept it juicy and delicious   it is well made and very easy to clean   highly recommend this product      
2545,2.0,                       i received the air fryer a couple days ago and i noticed that the machine has a lot of scratches  i ordered this as new and it looks used  the inside of the air fryer is scratched and the outside as well  the bottom of the air fryer looks like it s dented  the box that the air fryer was in looked new without any dents  i am dissatisfied      
2546,5.0,                       i am still playing with my new air fryer  but so far it has been a blast   this weekend i am going to fry bacon and bake some stuff mushrooms   it is handy and easy to clean  and i am pleased with my purchase      
2547,5.0,                       love the convenience and the look of this fryer  the white perfectly matched with our modern style kitchen  we have been using it almost everyday by trying to cook different items to snack on for fun i don t normally write reviews but this is one item deserves to have a               please note  you will need to make fine tunes with temperatures and timer to find the perfect cooking meal  you will get an idea after     times      
2548,5.0,                       best ever purchase on kitchen appliances    love it so far  more ever i feel like m making healthy food  cz no oil use at all to fry      
2549,5.0,                       we absolutely love the cosari air fryer  it does everything it said it would  the recipe book is wonderful and the cleanup is so easy  we have a toaster oven air fryer and it s much more difficult to use and harder to clean     
2550,5.0,                       this has become one of our most used appliances in the kitchen   everything cooks fast and oil free   very easy and fast clean up   i recommend this unit to everyone      
2551,5.0,                       never had an air fryer  this came highly recommended from family friend   it is everything we were told it was  food taste great  clean up is easy      
2552,5.0,                       my chefman     liter air fryer finally kicked the bucket after a year of constant use  picked this up as a replacement and it blew me away on the first use  the air circulation is definitely on another level compared to the chefman i had  also  i was really surprised by how easy it was to clean the inner and outer basket  fryer is not too loud when running either      
2553,5.0,                       first time using an air fryer    love this new way to make a healthy meal  i have not experimented with any recipes just the basics steak chicken pork    all delicious   so quick to make  would highly recommend to anyone look for a quick way to make a delicious dinner in minutes       
2554,4.0,                       i ve had mine for almost   months now  i love it  i ve done a lot of filets of fish and that can be kinda tricky  the book tells you one thing  you try it and then adjust it to what you really need for the next time  ex  swordfish  book says     degrees for      min  the filets i get are thicker so i end up having to cook it for    min      
2555,5.0,                       we love this cosori air fryer  it exceeded all our expectations  we loved it so much we have bought two more as gifts for family  easy to use and makes wonderfully flavored food in very quick times  great health benefits too      
2556,5.0,                       i love making pizza with this air fryer  so fancy  fast shipping      
2557,1.0,                       i read all the reviews and ordered this fryer  when i tried to get it open to use it  i couldn t get the basket in and out it hangs up and won t slide out    i am disappointed but it s going back   i would give it a zero rating if i could     
2558,5.0,                       love this air fryer   the manufacturer offers great support and updated recipes  it s not super easy to clean but i imagine none of them are      
2559,5.0,                       did a lot of research and so glad i purchased this one   found it easy to use  as someone who is not too good in the kitchen   all of the meals so far have turned out amazing  chicken  pork  meatballs  veggies  sweet potato fries  etc   great design of the machine and pretty easy to clean   great purchase and definitely recommend       
2560,5.0,                       best investment i ve made in a long time  been using it almost everyday  made meatballs in it the first day and they came out so good that the wife and i were just eating the meatballs instead of putting them in the pasta  plenty of ideas and recipes online to use or make in this air fryer  all i have to say is i wish i would have bought it sooner      
2561,5.0,                       love this airfryer we use it for everything   it doesnt heat the house like the oven  ig heats quickly and cooks food quickly      
2562,5.0,                       game changer   this was my first air dryer and my god   i m not sure how i lived without it   everything i ve made has come out amazing  a cookbook is included with a ton of delicious recipes also  you won t be disappointed      
2563,5.0,                       loved the large size  ease of use and best was no odor from frying fish   one dislike is that bacon is difficult to cook without smoking up the kitchen      
2564,5.0,                       so much easier to use than i expected   i use it everyday  cleans easily and it is like my own little easy bake oven   lol      
2565,5.0,                       my son and college roommates love it   getting a lot of use from it   so easy to use and cooks quickly      
2566,5.0,                       my family is very pleased with this appliance   we just bought it and we have used it every day for a variety of meals   i am very happy with this purchase and recommend you purchase it too      
2567,5.0,                       haven t used it that much but the few times i did the food was excellent  you have to experiment with times for cooking because some recipes make the cooking time too long      
2568,1.0,                       the buttons didn t work  i called the support people and they said to send it back  i will try again  but am disappointed about the lack of quality control      
2569,5.0,                       it doesn t happen all the time but it sometimes pops open   i have no idea   we love it thoughcontacted corsori customer support  a little information and a video they are sending us a new one      
2570,5.0,                       this air fryer is great  i use it almost everyday  i have prepared several didferet types of fish  chicken  pork chops and vegetables  using almost no oil at all  the food comes out perfectly cooked every time  i have just purchased the accessories package  but have not used them yet      
2571,3.0,                       the initial  new plastic  odor was reduced with several pre heat and wash cycles   but a residual  plastic  odor is persistent and gets baked into the food   great cooking features  but the odor taste will limit its use until we decide it isn t worth the prime storage space      
2572,5.0,                       this air frier was a christmas gift and it is wonderful  we aren t deep frying ever again the food tastes great its easy to use  the kids love the food and are wanting to learn how to use it  we also got the accessories   it s easy and different and healthy   we love it      
2573,5.0,                       seriously the best air fryer ever   i ve gotten four people to buy this exact model because it s the perfect size and easy to clean  at first my roommates were hesitant but now we cannot go a day without using it    just make sure to give it a quick clean after every use and give a deep clean every couple of uses  honestly you will not be disappointed        
2574,4.0,                       there are only two types of people  those that have an air fryer   those are gonna get one  they are a game changer  this is the best one     
2575,2.0,                       mixed review   love the design  love the cooking abilities dislikes   it randomly pops open when cooking  and the bottom of the tray is bubbling after   month of use and it has been cleaned with a sponge and dawn      
2576,5.0,                       excellent product  very easy to use and the flavor of the food when done is great     
2577,5.0,                       i am having fun trying different ideas   we really like making potatoes in the air fryer   you can reheat pizza in minutes and it tastes even better than when we first brought it home because it is sizzling hot and not mushy      
2578,5.0,                       i searched so many air fryers and decided on this one  i am glad i did  i use it every day and never had any issues with it  i guess if you were making for a large family you d probably want to get a bigger size  but for myself it is perfect  it is very easy to use and looks nice on my counter  i would recommend this to anyone      
2579,3.0,                       it s great but the buttons are sooooooo hard to press       out of    times the buttons will work on the first push but they will take forever to push other times  i find myself just having to unplug it and plug it back in so many times until one of the buttons work    and when it finally does work  it s always the wrong button   food tastes great though     
2580,5.0,                       has better controls  better designed basket and results are better than the cheap air fryer i first bought  elsewhere       
2581,1.0,                       i used it to cook bacon  just like i did plenty of times with my old fryer  and this fryer just smokes up the house   it also continually drops the wifi signal so its almost impossible to use the smart features   i wouldn t recommend this air fryer it s cheaper ones on the market that work much better      
2582,1.0,                       great product but completely died a month and    days after buying it   i have a much cheaper air fryer that is still going strong but bought this more expensive one as an upgrade   i am very disappointed also  the link to get product support is broken   what a scam   and no ability to contact seller      
2583,5.0,                       i m now officially in love with air fryers  they cook everything perfectly and are so easy to use and clean  i ve made quite a few recipes and am looking forward to trying many more      
2584,5.0,                       i got this air fryer for the size and other reviews  not only was this fryer easy to use  but my goodness it fries foods without the grease and mess  wish i would have tried this years ago  the user friendly digital display will have you enjoying more healthy foods in no time      
2585,5.0,                       air fryer is easy to use and so easy to clean  works well with both fresh and frozen foods      
2586,5.0,                       it works from my phone  love it   and i use it all the time  the best feature is the preheat option from my bed with the touch of a button      
2587,5.0,                       the cosori airfryer exceed expectations  i have tried it for several dishes and i find the flavour amazing for no oil used at all  special recommendation for the support team at cosori who helped me get a replacement copy of recipe book when my original book was destroyed  all in all great experience  i will recommend this airfryer to all      
2588,5.0,                       i use my air frier  x times a week  i look forward to eating whatever i make it in it s really hard to mess stuff up with this thing bought an additional one for friends as a wedding gift  they regularly text me pictures of food that they make with it saying how much they love it     
2589,1.0,                       bought unit in august of      and basket handle broke off in march of      should have lasted longer than five months don t buy      
2590,5.0,                       pretty nice size and cooks food very fast  however the touch screen doesn t function very well  it is very hard to change the cooking time in the screen  have to keep pressing the button to get it work        other than that  it is very nice air fryer     
2591,5.0,                       this unit replaced my smaller af  i just love it  if you wonder what size to get   always go bigger  so much more flexibility      
2592,5.0,                       it s very easy to use   i have been looking online for different recipes   the recipe book that comes with the air fryer has a lot of recipes but most of them are for marinades   i would rather use dry rubs      
2593,5.0,                       i was skeptical at first  but i use it almost once a week now  it is also extremely easy to clean which is a super bonus  i m not sure what i did before    i would not hesitate to recommend this fryer to anyone      
2594,5.0,                       i bought this for my husband for christmas and we have been loving it  it cooks quickly and tastes great  we however have to keep reminding our selves that it makes things healthier than deep frying  although tastes as good  and doesn t make things healthy      
2595,1.0,                       the smell is horrible after trying to clean numerous times  customer service refuses to respond with a answer  stay away from this       
2596,5.0,                       i m trying to figure out why i didnt buy this sooner  i absolutely love this air fryer  its fast  easy to clean  and has so much room  i reheat almost everything in here  definitely worth every penny      
2597,5.0,                       this thing cooks so fast and so well  easy to clean  it doesn t get too hot on the back  plenty of space to cook a fat meal for one person or two normal meals     
2598,5.0,                       easiest way to have crispy fried party chicken wings the healthy way without oil and messy cleanup  i have also air fried pork chops which turned out to be juicy and delicious  air fryer makes cooking a snap      
2599,5.0,                       we received this as a gift for christmas and have used it to make fries  chicken tenders  and  grilled  steak tips so far  we love the ease of use and are amazed at how well our food comes out      
2600,5.0,                       easy to use and clean  square basket works so much better than round  so many features      
2601,5.0,                       love it  worst thing is i ve only been hand washing it and the non stick still isn t holding up very well  i always spray it before use and it still is getting harder to clean  but i still love it      
2602,5.0,                       i like the cosori because it s fast  easy and it s an easy clean up   i was never able to fry pork chops very well  but the cosori took all the stress out of it      
2603,5.0,                       my first fryer did not function as it should  a    minute phone call  an email submission of information and a replacement was on the way  no muss  no fuss just excellent customer support and service  the replacement work s flawlessly and i could not be happier      
2604,1.0,                       we tried it once and we couldn t taste the food we made because it all tasted like burned plastic  we cooked the food with the doors open and we had to put fans on to try to get rid of the smell  i returned this item because i was concern about the burned plastic smell was too strong      
2605,4.0,                       love it  but i wish there was also a booklet on cooking frozen foods   that s the bummer      
2606,5.0,                       simple to use  makes you want to cook with it  cleans quick and easy  love it      
2607,5.0,                       is easy to clean out the basket  the food tastes good coming out of this thing and pretty easy to set      
2608,5.0,                       i gave one of these to my son and daughter   they really like them      
2609,1.0,                       this thing is junk  i never write reviews but i had to share my experience with this thing  i bought it in december of      and used it maybe    times in   months  every time i use it  the door unlatches halfway through cooking  today i tried to use it and it won t even stay latched to turn on properly  i m contacting the manufacturer    not to ask for freebies  but to tell them what a junk product they produced      
2610,4.0,                       air fryer was given as a gift  i later learned when they used it the first few times  this fryer emitted a  skunk  odor  numerous washings finally lessened this  i was embarrassed this turned out to be a questionable gift  will mot buy this for our at home use      
2611,5.0,                       i love this air fryer   it has a lot of room and it makes baked potatoes with crunchy skin and frozen chicken tenders are so good and crispy   i wish i had   so i could cook   elements at the same time      
2612,4.0,                       it s worked perfectly  thus far  for what i purchased   however  i was saddened to see that there were no accessories included   every other brand i researched at this price point         came with a trivet for ease   unfortunately  cosori doesn t include any accessories but sells them separately      
2613,2.0,                       this is a nice looking coffee maker  but is really noisy when brewing the coffee   trying to decide if i need to return it or just live with the noise      
2614,5.0,                       we love ours  plenty big for everything we need  cooks fast and the best thing is you get the same great taste as frying without the oil      
2615,5.0,                       this is an amazing product  easy to use and very effective  i honestly urge you to get one and try it and i bet you won t be disappointed i used to stay away from fried food not because i don t like eating fried food but because it s not healthy but with cosori i can eat my cake and still have it  thank god      
2616,5.0,                       wish i wouldn t have waited so long   i love this appliance   attractive looking unit   super easy to use   i love the app   excellent results   great cookbook     
2617,1.0,                       buyer beware if you re going to buy this    don t  simply put there is absolutely no noticeable difference between oven cooked food and this air fryer  quite honestly my toaster is more useful than this appliance   after a month of use it malfunctioned and now the device only blows cold air  if i wanted that   i would ve bought a fan      
2618,5.0,                       we liked the air dryer so much we ordered another  have had them for going on two months and still learning how best to utilize them  cooking fish is so easy      
2619,5.0,                       gift for my daughter   she is very happy with it and uses several times per week      
2620,5.0,                       i love it  it s wonderful  no more messes and oil flashing over all me  the meat comes out awesome  i guess if i have to say something negative then it s bigger than i expected  not really a bad thing      
2621,5.0,                       love it  it s had become our most used kitchen appliance      
2622,5.0,                       these are just a great product   we have given them as gifts too   we find ourselves using this regularly   you can find all kinds of great recipes online too      
2623,5.0,                       this fryer has a large square basket rather than round which allows more food placement  i love the brushed exterior finish no fingerprints  cooks extremely fast  has the basket for shaking and auto restart when inserting basket back in to continue cooking   it also has keep warm setting most don t  i did my homework and am extremely pleased with my decision to purchase this one     
2624,5.0,                       we use often and are very happy with the results especially with meats   i highly recommend the cosori smart wifi air fryer      
2625,5.0,                       we have used it to cook several things and it works great      
2626,3.0,                       item works great  i love it but here s the big but the smell of plastic or metal been solder or melted  i m hoping it will go away soon  i can t stand it  i took it outside for now easy fix for now      
2627,5.0,                       this is an excellent addition to anyones home  it cooks food very thoroughly and quickly  it is not loud at all while it is cooking and it is exremely easy to clean  this air fryer doesnt take up alot of counter space either  when i recieved this product i was even surprised by the amount of room you have to actually cook  very good product would recommend to everyone      
2628,4.0,                       the screws for the inner basket continually loosen   one screw has been lost and i am unable to locate a replacement   the other two are always loose and need constant tightening      
2629,5.0,                       i bought one then gave one as a gift  it does a great job on everything from french fries to grilled fish to broccoli       
2630,5.0,                       why it took me this long to buy an air fryer is beyond me  this thing is great  so many settings and the food tastes great     
2631,5.0,                    estaba desde hace mucho buscando una air fryer y eleg  la perfecta  estoy encantada y fascinada         
2632,5.0,                       so far it is working great   we have cooked   things in it   much more convenient than heating up the entire oven just to make some nuggets or fries   they are more crispy than baking      
2633,5.0,                       best wings ever     because of the air fryer i have become a wing snob   i only like air fryer wings     they are absolutely delicious  so easy and easy clean up   have also made veggies and fish  so many options      
2634,5.0,                       this thing is wonderful  it cooks everything half the time and taste so good  the chicken stays moist for like a week      
2635,5.0,                       i ve never owned an air fryer before but this has got to be the best on the market   i absolutely love my new fryer  it s easy to set up and very easy to clean  it cooks chicken  fish and shrimp amazingly  i have not bought cooking oil and don t plan to  i look forward to cooking with this air fryer often being that it saves me so much time  i absolutely recommend buying this  you won t regret it      
2636,5.0,                       we ve used this product for appetizers  burgers  both frozen and raw  french fries  popcorn chicken  bacon wrapped hot dogs  roasted broccoli and roasted green beans  and even frozen uncooked shrimp  imagination is endless  all foods were excellent  still thinking up more dishes to make  easy to use  pretty easy to clean also  capacity is great for two adults  a little more difficult with more than two if creating meals  but amazing product  it s like a mini oven meets a microwave      
2637,2.0,                       fan became louder after using  x   the air fryer does cook nicely and the parts internally are easy to clean   may have to return this      
2638,1.0,                       loved this air fryer when i got it and for a few months after  now the door keeps popping open and searching online i don t see a fix  anyone recommend a good air fryer  this was my first and i am loving the food you can make but this one is done after only a few months      
2639,2.0,                       i personally did not like this product  the best way to explain is it s a small oven you have to clean every time you cook  i would double up on the time to cook cause things were not cooked or even crisp  i ended up returning the product      
2640,5.0,                       perfect for french fries and frozen chicken tenders  but i found the suggested times of frying to be too long      
2641,5.0,                       spend a few more   and get this one  i did for my wife and she loves it  easy to use and fast      
2642,5.0,                       great product   has a lot of space and it cooks your food really fast      
2643,5.0,                       worked so easily  spilt a little grease from basket when taking out but the chicken wings i made first turned out great per the directions included with the fryer  i d recommend this product      
2644,5.0,                       i use this almost daily  it is a lot easier than other methods of cooking and delivers a good result  i really don t have any negatives to say about it  sometimes the rack is a little hard to clean in the air vents  but i believe that is because i use it so often  sometimes twice a day      
2645,4.0,                       use this everyday  only issue is making sure drawer is locked in place so it doesn t pop out  other than that  i wouldn t change a thing  everything we ve cooked has been great      
2646,2.0,                       bought for a christmas present for my sister  she used it   times and now told me that she cant get the buttons to work  very disappointed      
2647,5.0,                       works amazingly well  fairly easy to understand and operate  large size works well for cooking for   servings      
2648,5.0,                       works really good  i got it for my mom for christmas and she uses it for chicken  weenies  fish and other items  she s been doing the keto diet so this helps out a lot with fast cooking and healthier fried foods      
2649,5.0,                       first time purchasing an air fryer and i am totally satisfied with this one  the size is perfect for my husband and i and it is easy to operate and make adjustments to time and temp needed  not as loud and i was expecting and is very easy to clean after each use  extra yr s warranty is great just for registering product online      
2650,5.0,                       we are loving the air fryer  we are finding great recipes and it is easy to use and easy to clean   would definitely recommend  only wish that it was a little bit bigger      
2651,5.0,                       cooks quickly and i usually use parchment paper inside so the clean up is very easy  it s very easy to use and there are lots of recipes online to choose from      
2652,5.0,                       what i like about this air fryer is   sleek design  look good on counter  light weight to move  really easy to clean  large capacity  and it cooks well      
2653,5.0,                       i was nervous about buying an air fryer  but very  happy i did and this one is amazing  had an issue a few weeks into owning it  emailed customer support and they fixed the issue quickly  have used it for several different items and its so easy to use and the food comes out tasting amazing  great product      
2654,5.0,                       love this   we got this product on recommendation of my fit coach  meat is always juice and fast  totally recommend this product        
2655,2.0,                       i love having an air fryer but for some reason this one smoke comes through the front when cooking something regardless of how much room i put behind the machine where the vent is  a little disappointed  can t even return because my return window closed      
2656,5.0,                       love that i didn t have to read directions to use this air fryer  i literally pulled it out of the box  rinsed it off  and started cooking  cooked my veggies   potatoes  carrots  onion and squash in    minutes  love this thing      
2657,5.0,                       this style of garlic toast  does not take long to cook in the air fryer  yet get crispy  goes well with my goulash though   basket size is awesome       
2658,1.0,                       i followed the directions succinctly   food came out burned and inedible   threw it down the trash chute at our condo     
2659,5.0,                       i love this bought it a few month ago and have been using it almost every day so easy to use with a nice clean look to it     
2660,1.0,                       it worked great for a month and then became useless after the tray stopped locking into place  it starts popping out midway through cooking  i never leave reviews but this product was the final straw      
2661,5.0,                       great air fryer easy to use  i have never used an air fryer before and i found this super easy with the app  so far i have made garlic fries  garlic broccoli  chicken tenders  and chicken legs it was awesome     
2662,5.0,                       our family loves this air fryer  food tastes great  getting the kids to eat healthier with the appliance is a breeze  we don t even use the microwave as much  i ve looked at many air dryers before purchasing this one  really really easy to use and clean  a    for us      
2663,1.0,                       was super excited to get this product but now i am very disappointed in the quality of food thats been made in it so far  my girlfriend has an air fryer purchased from costco and it cooks food so much better and was cheaper  the basket in mine is a horrible design and like i said the food comes out terrible  wishing i would have returned this before it was too late      
2664,5.0,                       love it  nothing to dislike  you definitely need to buy it     
2665,5.0,                       i use this everyday from cooking meats  to roasting veggies and to baking the perfect cookies    this thing does it all cooks food in half the time and with only a  spray of cooking oil  great for reheating meals too

2669,5.0,                       does a good job of cooking food  a little on the noisy side

2676,3.0,                       handle has broken for the second time   the company replaced the broken handle the first time  but i think i will now buy a different brand   the handle seems to be a weak link   the screws constantly come loose and the handle has broken twice     
2677,5.0,                       our air fryer arrived today and tried it right away  love that it is easy to clean  great result for our crispy pork belly  as a first try of the product   soo yummy and crunchy  so much better than our old method  will not go back to that     great product  we re so happy so far  highly recommended      
2678,5.0,                       stop reading reviews and just click buy  you won t be sorry

2680,5.0,                       i have been using this air fryer everyday for the last year  it is an amazing product  unfortunately the handle broke from normal wear and tear  and customer support was willing to send me a replacement basket immediately   no questions asked  i would definitely recommend the product for those wanting to cook foods in a healthier and more convenient manner  especially since the support is there when you need it      
2681,2.0,                       worked great  making a ratteling noise now  thinking maybe the fan   i tried customer support but the page is not up   seller let me know what to do      
2682,5.0,                       yes it s easy to clean  operation is a tad spotty  you real have to poke the touch screen to get a response  but the food is great  plenty of recipes out there  haven t used the wifi feature yet  not really interested in it      
2683,5.0,                       easy to use and easy to clean  perfect for chicken wings  no mess  and pizza  i was tempted to buy the smaller one but glad i bought the larger one  tortilla pizza fits perfect      
2684,5.0,                       i received as a gift  i had no idea how much i would love this item      
2685,5.0,                       my daughter wanted it for christmas now this is all she uses     
2686,2.0,                       i returned the grill because it was  oil splash  all airfryer  must  has  splatter lid     
2687,5.0,                       i bought this for my husband for christmas  and he loves it  he says the build quality is excellent and has great preset buttons  it circulates heat very well and cooks the food in a short amount of time  my husband says that the touch display seems a little cheap  overall  it s a great product      
2688,2.0,                       i loved my air fryer in the beginning  a few months in and for some reason when i preheat the entire basket comes flying out a minute or two into preheating  it has hit the floor and almost our cat  not sure why this is happening  it is in correctly and i m not sure what is going on  very disappointed      
2689,2.0,                       after one month of limited use the drawer would not stay closed sometimes  now a little more than a month and the drawer will not stay closed at all  otherwise functionality of the oven seems appropriate  i will return for new one to see if this one was a lemon      
2690,4.0,                       it works well  but i would have preferred individual buttons for temperature and time instead of a toggle switch  annoying feature      
2691,5.0,                       this air frier did not disappoint   if your interested in a frier  this one is interested in exploring      
2692,3.0,                    el t ctil de la pantalla no funciona  no recomiendo comprar esta versi n  de la  nica forma que trabaja  es manipulando desde el celular y solo acepta un dispositivo los alimentos quedan muy deliciosos        
2693,1.0,                       so bad  things come out tasting dry and raw  you don t want an air fryer  trust me      
2694,5.0,                       this is a replacement for a older one  more than pleased especially when cooking a whole chicken      
2695,5.0,                       i use seasoning i haven t used just to use them and the chicken is delicious  and if your watching your weight this is the way to go      
2696,5.0,                       i don t think i ve used my oven since i got this air fryer   worth every penny makes working from home and preparing various meals super easy

2698,4.0,                       great device  but not big enough for a family   we had to cook everything in shifts   planning on giving it to my son who just graduated from college   it will be perfect for him      
2699,5.0,                       this air fryer is easy to use easy to clean and does an excellent job of cooking  it leaves food crispy has a pre heat element with large spacious basket  couldn t be happier with my purchase     
2700,5.0,                       amazing product  food comes out better than imagined      
2701,5.0,                       i am unable to tolerate fried foods    this machine is awesome    i finally am able to have my onion rings       
2702,3.0,                       great airfryer  alexa works great with it the app not so much and the buttonless button doesn t always work n won t recognize my touches     
2703,5.0,                       i love this air fryer  all of its components work amazing  the touch screen as well as the wifi portion is great for having different options  i would recommend this to anyone  easy to use and easy to clean      
2704,5.0,                       one of the easiest and best air dryers to use  not to mention how nice it looks   i would highly recommend this product     
2705,5.0,                       super product  i ve used a few different air dryers and this one is my favorite  easy to clean  large cooking area  and metal outer layer also gives it clean look that s also easy to cleanup  highly recommended      
2706,2.0,                       the fryer has a very strong odor of over heated plastic even after   cooking cycles  seems like some wires were incorrectly placed in the heater air stream  the kitchen still has a strong odor  no mention of this in the instructions  is it safe   hope it goes away soon  also the unit is small  barely able to service two people      
2707,5.0,                       this is my first air fryer and its great  easy to use  clean up is kind of a hassle but its not too bad      
2708,5.0,                       a little louder than i expected but not unbearable  our microwave is louder  we use this thing frequently  easy to use and even easier to clean  our favorite thing is potatoes wedges   just slice up some potatoes drizzle a little oil over them add your favorite seasonings  this thing cooks to perfection     
2709,2.0,                       not easy to remove basket to shake or clean  basket is to small for french fries and such  cooks bacon well      
2710,5.0,                       we have just had this machine for two days and have made two awesome meals   don t know why we waited so long to buy one   this air fryer cooks so evenly and the food tastes amazing      
2711,5.0,                       this has been a life saver in the kitchen  i m constantly finding new things to air fry  it makes every food so much more delicious  plenty of room  easy to use  easy to clean  and has made dinner fun      
2712,5.0,                       great size  super easy to clean  great fryer but don t get too excited and try making a blooming onion   it turned into a mushy mess   just use it for normal things      
2713,1.0,                       the drawer basket is warped and will not stay closed for the selected cooking time  have to stay close by to close the drawer every time it s pops open  it s too much trouble to use for a quick convenience appliance  not happy with purchase      
2714,5.0,                       i purchased the fryer to eat healthier  goes great with my d cor   very satisfied      
2715,1.0,                       junk  the user interface is absolutely horrible  if not for the wifi option the damn buttons dont freaking work  useless     
2716,5.0,                       mine came with a small coating that came off  i reached out to cosori and their customer service was quick and very helpful  they are sending me a new basket free of charge  i am assured that the customer service will be great for the next   years with my warranty     
2717,5.0,                       this is an amazing air fryer  food turns out wonderful  would recommend highly      
2718,1.0,                       the drawer to the airfryer will not stay in the device  it spontaneously pops out during cooking  it often takes multiple tries for the drawer to stay in place      
2719,5.0,                       this is my first ever air fryer and i can t complain  i ve only had it for a couple days now and can already tell it s going to be one of my most used appliances  super easy to use and clean  makes delicious food  great purchase      
2720,5.0,                       i love this  it s great for quickly heating food up that should be crispy  not soggy  french fries are perfect  and i actually fit far more in the basket than what they recommend and it still works great  just turn them a few more times so they all get crispy      
2721,5.0,                       love it  great alternative to grease frying  makes good toasted cheese sandwiches too       
2722,5.0,                       glad i did some research and selected this cosori air fryer  it is so easy to use  easy to clean and cooks foods perfectly every time       
2723,5.0,                       i have read about air fryers for what seems like quite a long time now and never thought of owning one   now that i do  i would like to dump my stove   oven for this amazing little powerhouse   veggies  fish  meats  it can t seem to do wrong by me   i have recommended this unit to friends and family  so pleased      
2724,5.0,                       easy to use  i wish i could add more to it each time  a good healthy alternative  the machine has steam coming out the first few times you cook      
2725,5.0,                       this thing is amazing  i ve actually used this   times in one day  the basket is s little tricky to clean  but overall great quality and a plethora of recipes for it  truly has changed what my family eats      
2726,3.0,                    lo bueno  es f cil de usar y cocina muy bien los alimentos lo malo  un producto construido muy sencillo los materiales no pares en de buena calidad  para que comprar una freidora smart si no puedes poner a cocinar a distancia desde la aplicaci n las recetas s lo est n en ingl s         
2727,4.0,                       it s so amazing    me and the family cook so much stuff in here  it s not even funny  we cooked snacks to meal  breakfast  lunch  and dinner  it  a  in my book     
2728,5.0,                       i ve only used it twice since purchasing it  but it has performed perfectly  i fully intend to use it more often  it is still a learning process but i m getting better  i would highly recommend this product      
2729,5.0,                       this is a good way to step up your cooking  i have had other air fryers  but this one is superior  the cooking results are very tasty      
2730,1.0,                       the box was damaged and appeared that it had been opened  the tape to secure the openings and sides were not intact  once i opened the box there was a hair on the styrofoam surrounding the product  i did not use the product so i can t tell you how the actual air fryer worked      
2731,5.0,                       my husband uses this every day  the food is so tender  we have been very pleased with this product      
2732,5.0,                       hubby purchased this and he hasn t stopped using it  he uses it for everything  he has even done hard boiled  eggs in it  came out great      
2733,2.0,                       returning this for two reasons  first  the drawer pops out during the cooking cycle  my food ended up on the floor three times  second  the buttons are very difficult to push      
2734,5.0,                       unreal   crispy chicken patties not greasy at all   now i m deciding what accessories i m going to get     
2735,5.0,                       wow  love this and it s so healthy      
2736,5.0,                       this is one of the best investments i have made  we have drastically reduced frying and microwaving food with no difference in taste      
2737,2.0,                       the only reason i m giving it   stars is because of the basket isn t in all the way it still will power in  my basket was not completely pushed in all the way and during a pre heat it came flying out and hit the kitchen floor braking the front piece of the handle off  i m glad that no one was standing in its path aside from that it s a great air fryer  just make sure you have the basket all the way in      
2738,5.0,                       we ve had a few air dryers  this one cooks the best  the basket has a metal  clicker  so the basket hinge should last much longer than others  cooks food evenly      
2739,5.0,                       very great  screw comes loose often on handle     
2740,5.0,                       in general  this product is great   the only downside in he need to hit the start butt when a program is entered   the stat button looks like the other program buttons  so irt is sometimes forgotten      
2741,4.0,                       works great  cant believe how great the food turns out  one thing is the fan sometimes makes noises so i hope that isn t an indicator of it going out  i like the design of the basket and handle release   other than that its amazing    stars for the fan noises      
2742,5.0,                       this product was easy to set up and easy to use  it helps to cut down on cooking time and mess  it also provides a healthier cooking alternative  i love the color     
2743,5.0,                       i use the air fryer at least   times a week  vegetables cook great in it  i often cook frozen chicken tenders in it to put in a wrap for lunch at work  i have not been disappointed  there is no preheating which makes it very nice compared to an oven  great quality      
2744,5.0,                       i love this air fryer   period  so easy to use  so far every recipe in the cookbook provided is so great  i am very interested in healthy meals  and that is why i am so pleased with this air fryer      
2745,5.0,                       i like the taste of whatever i cooked from this fryer  the reviews was spot on  easy to use  preheating is the best  i recommend this to my family and friends      
2746,1.0,                       i m using it for the very first time and the touchpad doesn t work  only a couple buttons are functioning and i have to press super hard to get them to work  it make it impossible to use  very disappointing  do not recommend  i ll be returning      
2747,5.0,                       worked perfectly for cooking our quail bites  only thing we have used it for so far      
2748,5.0,                       my biggest concern was cleaning the fryer   and it cleans up quite easy   we use it several times a week   love it         
2749,5.0,                       i love this air fryer  it has pre set cook times and temperature for easy use  my food has come out amazing and so easy   i highly recommend this and i will probably be purchasing another one      
2750,5.0,                       i love my air fryer best investment i saved on gallons of oil that s one and second everything comes out perfect not greasy i make a lot of wings and fries and my house doesn t have that fried smell so convenient too press a couple buttons and for get about it       
2751,5.0,                       i was unsure about these then a friend bought one and convinced me to try it  well  it is amazing  it s fun to try different things fresh or frozen  reheated pizza is amazing  just like delivery       
2752,5.0,                       this was a present i sent to my son in the army and he said it was the easiest to use and his steaks turned out better then the restaurants   loves it      
2753,5.0,                       so far  this little machine has been super easy to use  the instructions are clear and the machine works very well  i love the look of it as well  it s very aesthetically pleasing  i hope it lasts a good while      
2754,1.0,                       inferior quality touchscreen  cheaply made  i couldn t get the screen to work on the first use out of the box  some buttons worked  others did not work  i returned it      
2755,5.0,                       it is very easy to use and clean   most of the things i ve cooked have been very good   if you are expecting guilt free fried food you will be disipointed   this is true for all  air fryers    it is very good micro baking oven      
2756,5.0,                       great product  i haven t used my phone with it yet but it s definitely better  faster and hotter then my last one      
2757,5.0,                       this is an awesome air fryer  love it so much      
2758,5.0,                       bought this for my husband and he can t shut up about it lol  he had brags to all of our friends about how great this thing is  we ve had it for a few weeks and he has cooked at least one thing in it every single day  it s suuuuper easy to clean  that s my favorite part      
2759,3.0,                       tried to cook fish in it  and after the timer was done it was still raw      
2760,5.0,                       i received this product last night around     pm and i used it today to cook supper  this air fryer is incredible  i m in love already  thank you        
2761,5.0,                       i love using my air fryer for chicken wings  but the basket is large enough to fit a   pound chicken  i love having the crispiness of fried food  without all the fat      
2762,5.0,                       i love it   super easy to use and beautiful       
2763,5.0,                       i love this air fryer  it holds a good bit of food and cooks it well  it s easy to clean  lots of settings for cooking various foods      
2764,5.0,                       received it as gift from my son and daughter in law  raved so much to my sister about it that i wanted for her to have one  send her one to puerto rico     
2765,5.0,                       i love this airfryer  i have been using it to cook all of my meats in this and it is amazing  normally i roast chicken breasts in the oven and they tend to come out dry  not with this  its made it so easy to focus on other things while i am cooking  its so effortless  and the clean up is easy      
2766,4.0,                       love the air fryer  hate that i missed the black friday sale price by one day  it s a nice air fryer for       it s awesome for          
2767,5.0,                       i ve finally found an airfryer that i love to cook with  it s large square cooking basket cooks so well and holds a lot more than my other airfryers  it s a breeze to clean and i ve been so pleased with what i ve cooked so far  on to the cheesecakes       
2768,1.0,                       broken out of the box   makes a beep when you plug it in and blue power light comes on  but screen is non responsive  unit won t turn on nor the menu displays at all   piece of junk  returning and will try a different brand with mechanical switches      
2769,5.0,                       we love this air fryer  my daughter recommended this cosori   i m so glad we followed her lead on this   it heats up quickly  is easy to clean   everything we ve cooked so far tastes great  i hesitated buying this as  i can just use my oven or toaster oven    but this is so convenient for making beautifully browned sandwiches  ckn  fries  waffles etc  i rarely even use any oil  thx for nice product      
2770,5.0,                       easy to clean  cooks everything perfectly        
2771,1.0,                       i received the air fryer  and the digital board turned on but did not work  i have talked to support  and they said it was a manufacturing order  after waiting for the cosori for a week  they stated to return it to get another in     business days  big let down      
2772,5.0,                       i  ve been trying out everything i can think of from appetizers  veggies  meats  grilled cheese   ham sandwich  it s still new  trial   errors  but i m not sorry i bought it    it s easy to use  results have been very good   clean up is easy  what s not to like       
2773,5.0,                       love this air fryer  easy to use and clean  the app is great to control it too      
2774,5.0,                       super happy w this purchase  this air fryer is everything i was hoping it would be and more  i also bought the accessories kit and i m equally as satisfied  yes      
2775,5.0,                       excellent product   easy to use and clean  makes preparing fried foods easy without soaking in unhealthy fats   the recipes we have tried  including potato wedges  chicken wings  thighs and drumsticks  have turned out delicious   just a light coating of olive oil and seasonings does the trick   the cosori air fryer has worked flawlessly so far      
2776,5.0,                       this is a plug and cook air fryer  read through the book and start cooking  love this air fryer it is the perfect size  bacon in   minutes      
2777,5.0,                       love this air fryer  i first ordered the     qt  fryer and loved it so much so i bought a larger one  i often use both at the same time  food cooks fast and is tender and delicious      
2778,5.0,                       cosori  airfryer is really great and we had few issues with the buttons  i contacted customer service through email and they understood the issue and quickly resolved it by replacing the air fryer i recommend this air fryer whoever wanted to eat healthy      
2779,5.0,                       just cooked a ny strip frozen solid  covered in olive oil and seasoning  took literally    minutes total and came out medium with the fat on the ends cooked to absolute crispy perfection just buy it      
2780,3.0,                       overall  i think this unit would be great  however  i think we have an issue with the buttons  we need to press them like    times to try to get them to work  this is mainly for the temp controlling buttons  the preset buttons are ok  but the up and down temp or timer  rarely work  it is incredibly frustrating  anyone else having this issue      
2781,5.0,                       we absolutely love this    so easy to use we love fries and they are so delicious  reccomend to everyone     
2782,5.0,                       just love it  the easiness of the cosori air fryer helps me love it even more  the added accessories is even a bigger reason i enjoy it so much       
2783,5.0,                       when i reviewed this product the main complaint people had was an odor   i ran it twice with some bread to absorb the odor of it being new  its worked great   no odor problems   we absolutely love it        
2784,5.0,                       i love my new air fryer   easy to use with    preset buttons   trust the timing  makes delicious fries burgers   salmon  you name it  easy to clean with non stick surfaces   dishwasher safe  very quiet      
2785,3.0,                       overall awesome  works great  looks great  only issue is the buttons don t always work  that is the only reason for a   star review cause that s how you control the darn thing  and often times you ll try to adjust time or temp and the buttons just don t work      
2786,5.0,                       this is my second cosori air fryer  the electrical panel went out after almost   years on the first one  i like this air fryer so much that i bought the same one again  it s easy to use  be sure to always support the bottom of basket when you take it out full of food or the basket handle will eventually break      
2787,1.0,                       great when it works  but as i ve seen in multiple other reviews  has a ton of electrical problems  shuts off halfway through pre heating  and if you can get it to pre heat it ll shut off halfway through cooking  tried multiple outlets  unplugged everything else on the electrical circuit to make sure there wasn t too much power  nothing works  don t waste your money      
2788,5.0,                       it takes some getting use to but with continued use i will like it better      
2789,5.0,                       i love it    have been using it everyday since it arrived  simply the best     
2790,3.0,                       after the first use the protective coating started to peel off on the basket  i ve had a lot more durable air fryers for far less  the app is rather convenient though  overall i think it s average for the price  not garbage but not great either      
2791,5.0,                       we use this several times a week to cook everything from fried chicken and shrimp to potatoes and zucchini fries   cooks fast and food comes out crispy and delicious      
2792,5.0,                       we love our new air fryer  i had wanted one for a while but didn t really have room for it  ended up getting it and it s totally worth it      
2793,5.0,                       i have used this so much  i mainly use it for bacon  salmon  veggies  sweet potato fries  and patties  the preprogrammed timers are perfect for each food item  i have never had to manually adjust it  it has the perfect timing  it s easy to clean as well  definitely got my penny s worth      
2794,5.0,                       we absolutely love this air fryer  i bought one for my father in law as well because it s so awesome      
2795,5.0,                       i haven t done alot of cooking in yet but every thing i have has turned out great   french fries are really good      
2796,5.0,                       this appliance was one of the best i have used  it is not noisy  just a a low hum  food came out nice and crisp  did fries and frozen foods  came out great  i would buy it again  you must remember to preheat for good results      
2797,5.0,                       i use it everyday  easy to use  kit when stays clean  i have barely used my stove or oven since i bought it  very easy to clean  food comes out perfectly      
2798,2.0,                       i ended up returning this air fryer  it had a weird odor to it and the basket was not very big  there is no way you can feed a family of   with this      
2799,5.0,                       very easy to use cooks well cleans up with ease     
2800,3.0,                       i returned air fryer  price was a bit high   i just didn t like it  but then i don t cook   maybe it was my fault  not sure      
2801,5.0,                       we love it  this is by far the most amazing and inexpensive airfryer we have ever purchased      
2802,1.0,                       bought july          the   screws that holds the inner tray to the outer tray fell out in oct unfortunately there is nothing to hold the screws  appears it was held by inside threading  so cannot be screwed in again  i have emailed the manufactor requesting a refund or replacement for a poorly constructed product awaiting response      
2803,5.0,                       gave as a gift and they absolutely love the air fryer      
2804,5.0,                       mades a non chef feel like a chef   it s easy to use and easy to clean  a few of the cooking presets are slightly off but it s easy to make changes to the temperature and cook time  the recipe book is a added bonus      
2805,5.0,                       a must ver happy with it s performance although it is my first experience with a fryer     
2806,5.0,                       absolutely the best item in my kitchen  since i ve opened the box  i use it literally every single day  wonderful air fryer    glad i went with this brand   size   cannot find any flaws     
2807,4.0,                       the device works great and makes cooking stuff like frozen foods super fast and easy  my only complaint is that after the first use  some of the led segments on the controls stopped working  so now the numbers on the timer are a little tricky to decipher at times      
2808,5.0,                       buy an air fryer now  best cooking purchase    love it

2810,5.0,                       this is a life saver for working parents  i can cook marinated chicken in fifteen to twenty minutes for my husband and daughter      
2811,5.0,                       fryer is a great value and the cooking basket is large   you can fit way more than the cheaper jink fryers   cooks great      
2812,5.0,                       this is probably one of the best purchases we have made love it      
2813,5.0,                       it cooks evenly and perfect  easy to clean  i don t really use the smart app to control it  but i use the receipts in the app      
2814,5.0,                       this was a gift for a family member  they absolutely love it  i was there for the unboxing and as soon as our old airfryer dies  we are buying this brand in the future      
2815,5.0,                       this is a wonderful air fryer  easy to use    for beginners  like me  especially   i love it and even my husband tells me to cook something in my new fryer      
2816,1.0,                       i purchased this corsari air fryer through amazon and immediately noticed that the buttons on the touch screen were not responsive at all  making it essentially useless  i had to control everything through the app on my phone in order to use it  i don t mind this at all  but the air fryer is useless for others in my household who don t have the app  buyer beware      
2817,3.0,                       too large for one person   perfect for a family or someone who entertains more than   people   returning for the smaller version      
2818,5.0,                       recommend by massage therapist and very pleased  i have not used it on vegetables bc they kill me  filet mignon is delicious      
2819,4.0,                       i do really like it  my only complaint it because i have cabinets above i can t push it back too far and feel safe  so when i open it i have to take the entire basket out and place it on my stove top  if i need to turn something over  it slides off if i don t      
2820,5.0,                    facil de utilizar y de buena calidad  funciona como establece el anuncio  recomendado        
2821,5.0,                       so easy  i wouldn t try cooking a whole small chicken  everything else i have tried came out great  especially wings

2823,5.0,                       easy to clean  love the big square basket and powerful      watts  so easy to use  this is the best air fryer on the market in my opinion      
2824,5.0,                       since purchasing this item i have prepared the most amazing dishes   my hot wings are better than any i have had at a restaurant   it cooks meat so perfectly retaining all the natural internal juices  while having the exterior perfectly browned   i almost never use my oven anymore   this is the best purchase i have made in the last year      
2825,5.0,                       still learning but it s been like dry meat  maybe the temperature to cook it on is wrong   but still learning all o give a              
2826,5.0,                       just got my air fryer   i cooked shrimp  salmon  wings  chicken breast  green beans  this air fryer is great and i can seeusing it more than my oven   every one should have one  there is a learning curve with cooking times but there are iairfryer cookbooks and pinterest that are a great help   best purchase from amazon ever      
2827,1.0,                       touch screen is horrible  and the basket continues to open even with the smallest amount of food  waited too long to return      
2828,5.0,                       bought this in october and now it doesn t work    tried to go to the website for support and the website is not found  so hit me up  and help me out update  i got ahold of the company and the they sent me a brand new one      
2829,5.0,                       this is the best air fryer  the basket is large enough to make multiple portions of food without having to cook in batches  the basket is easy to clean and the food comes out perfectly crispy and tender      
2830,5.0,                       why didn t i buy this sooner   super easy to use and you can make anything and it comes out great   user friendly machine thank you i love it      
2831,5.0,                       this is our  nd air fryer and we were looking for a larger size   we are happy with this one   we use it several times a week and a couple meals we use both the air fryers we have      
2832,1.0,                       after using it about    times i liked the food and everything  but it stop working  sucks cause it cost me a lot of money      
2833,2.0,                       i really wanted to love this product but every time we use it is smells like burnt plastic  it gives off a weird chemical smell that even the food smells like  very disappointed      
2834,5.0,                       easy to clean and love the large cooking surface     
2835,5.0,                       have tried some of the suggested dishes from the menu and they are easy to handles   like the result of steak and vegetables  tasty and fast in preparation   one of my favorites cooking gadgets      
2836,5.0,                       love the color  all the options  easy to clean  pre heat button  ease of use      
2837,5.0,                       love this    use it almost everyday      
2838,1.0,                       the flavor came out amazing and the usage was fairly simple  however  after only one use the paint is already chipping  it bubbled up and while i was hand washing it  it chipped off  not happy at all about this  cheap quality  no idea how to contact support or if i can get a new one etc      
2839,5.0,                       super easy to use  great alternative to a traditional deep fryer  between this and a sous vide  there s rarely a need to go out to eat for great food      
2840,5.0,                       i don t know how i went my life without this thing   i just made the best steak of my life   way excited to do more with this thing easy to use  makes great food  and it s easy to clean      
2841,5.0,                       sooo much better than my old phillips one and love the basket and the easier cleaning      
2842,5.0,                       this is a great product  i could not be more pleased  if on the fence   jump  jump  and jump  you will not be disappointed      
2843,5.0,                       i bought the cosori air fryer based on the high rating of their customer service  another feature i liked was the shape of the basket is square and fits more food   i chose the wi fi version because i like being to monitor and control it from my phone  the app let s you save your own favorite recipes with time and temps as well as access cosori s library of recipes      
2844,3.0,                       was trying to get away from deep frying  so i bought this air fryer   it works okay but just doesn t take the place of deep frying   i am disappointed but have learned my lesson   back to deep frying      
2845,5.0,                       right out of the package i was impressed  it had a very good manual  great cook book and great two year warranty  have used it several times now and so far it has performed well  cooking has never been easier       
2846,5.0,                       product definitely delivers   quick and easy to use and clean up      
2847,1.0,                       over priced and very difficult to use  i guess i will stick with my outdoor grill  waste of good money     
2848,5.0,                       i looove my airfryer   great purchase  easy to use and the kids love trying new meal ideas      
2849,5.0,                       i have four children so i knew that most of the smaller air fryers on the market would be useless for our family   we re really pleased with the capacity and have loved the crispy texture it gives things   easy to use and clean  would definitely purchase again   this and the instapot have been weeknight dinner game changers      
2850,5.0,                       love this product  great for a family  easy to clean and use  i have had to adjust times some so you do have to experiment with it  the fry button is not accurate and i have burnt a few batches of fries so i use the frozen food button and that works better  i have shared this product with friends      
2851,5.0,                       bought this for my wife and i for christmas   works perfect for our meals      
2852,5.0,                       i love my casarey i use it almost every day i make pork chops yummy french fries onion rings chicken muffins fish what s so great about it is you can make food as though it was fried but it s not oil free cooking     it s healthy not only is it healthy it is quite tasty full of flavor i m really happy with my cosori  air fryer bought one for my daughter and she loves it         
2853,5.0,                       i love this  cooks fast and crisp  im a vegetarian and it frys my tofu good     
2854,5.0,                       best investment i ve ever made  couldn t live without this thing definitely go for the     quart even if you only cook for    a ribeye steak fits well with not that much space left over  i m not sure if it would fit in the smaller one      
2855,5.0,                       easy to operate and clean  no issues   cooks anything you can cook on stove or in oven  my go to from now on    wish i had bought air fryer long ago       
2856,5.0,                       when i bought this i was concerned about where i d store it  not a problem  can t put the darn thing away  we use it almost every day  love it      
2857,5.0,                       we re having more fun cooking now and bought some sturdy aluminum cups and make muffins a couple times a week   everything is better except baked potatoes taste great but skins are tough  this     is a good size and fits in our small kitchen      
2858,5.0,                       it works great no problems with it cleans up easy and does what it is supposed to still learning but it is great i do recommend it     
2859,5.0,                       we hesitated buying an air fryer  looked up and researched many brands  we ended up with this one and we are so glad we did  it s amazing   it s also so easy to use and to clean      
2860,3.0,                       my foods came out pretty dry and not so good but maybe we just need to learn more who knows      
2861,5.0,                       easy to use   it is great you can control time and temperature  if you are looking at a toaster oven air fryer combo  get this one instead      
2862,5.0,                       i ve only used it a few times since christmas   but food comes out great  chicken wings could ve been left in a little longer to get them crispier  but still good  easy to operate   clean  highly recommend      
2863,5.0,                       i love this so much it works great     
2864,5.0,                       so easy to use and makes great fries  very crisp  nearest thing i have got to our fries in the uk  roasted vegetables which came out perfect  totally recommend     
2865,5.0,                       great product  air fried green beans and broccoli are fantastic      
2866,4.0,                       probably the best thing about this fryer is the wireless connection  it seemed like an added bonus at first  but the app is easier to use than the interface   the one on our particular unit isn t very responsive another selling feature was the capacity   we don t always use the full capacity  but i wouldn t want to go any smaller   i ve already recommended this air fryer to friends      
2867,5.0,                        easy to clean   easy to use  great   flavor      
2868,5.0,                       the cosiri air fryer is quite an incredible kitchen appliance that everyone must have  it is fast cooker and easy to clean  it does not take up much space in your kitchen since i got it  i have abandoned my nu wave oven  it is a must have in every kitchen      
2869,1.0,                       what a piece of crap you can only use this via a smartphone and an app   yet amazon does not state this on their website     
2870,4.0,                       i love the size and function of this air fryer  sometimes the buttons are hard to use but eventually you can get them to work      
2871,5.0,                       i have it already and decided i needed a  nd one   its that great       
2872,5.0,                       great for frying without oil  saving calories for other tasty things     
2873,1.0,                       before i keep it or use it  i need to know isn t there a manual that comes with it  and a recipe book it looks like that the one i received had been opened   it is not even in an  amazon prime box      
2874,5.0,                       i bought the smaller wiseusa model before  it lasted   months  broken and the non stick coating came off  the corsori is much much better  cooking heat  is very even especially french fries  very nice      
2875,5.0,                       i am still getting used to this air fryer  it made french fries well but chicken cutlets were dried out  i just need to check items more often and not go by manual s cook time     easy to clean     
2876,5.0,                       i use this air fryer almost everyday and sometimes multiple times a day  awesome facebook community that shares recipes as well      
2877,5.0,                       the size is fantastically larger compared to others we looked at   it s super easy to use  we finally figured out how to make chicken without grilling that wasn t chewy   dry  we love it      
2878,5.0,                       took me awhile  but i do like this air fryer   it has a learning curve  it s even faster than my convection oven  but i m getting it down      
2879,1.0,                       was working great at first  besides it can be tricky to clean  but now it won t get hot  the heating element seems to be broken with a couple months of purchase       
2880,5.0,                       born southern so love fried foods          this is so close to the old way of cookin             love it       
2881,5.0,                       actually the first time i buy this one and i can tell you is really good  easy to cook  conserves the flavor as well and for a     container fits really well in my kitchen  i recommend this      
2882,5.0,                       exactly as advertised   the only complaint that i have is that the main basket is hard to remove from the casing   it takes a bit of force   i m hoping that gets better with use   otherwise  i think it s a good air fryer   very large capacity   perhaps better for families with      would recommend      
2883,5.0,                       this airfryer is great  easy to figure out easy to cleanit cooks things very quickly and they come out looking great not soggy or all stuck together     
2884,5.0,                       so far everything i have made my family is happy with  easy to use and clean  my daughter got one after i used mine and she is happy too      
2885,5.0,                       we did lots of research abd chose this one  it works perfect  we tried fries and chicken wings  both quick and delicious  it can cook about    chicken wings at a time      
2886,4.0,                       other reviews said the corners  leak  steam as if poorly manufacture  they are correct  that is my only qualm with this air fryer      
2887,5.0,                       have one of my own and just bought one for my son daughter in law for christmas   they weren t sure they really wanted one  but i got it anyway   they absolutely love it    they were actually so excited about the next new thing to cook in it   so glad i used my  mom knows best  instinct and got it for them      
2888,5.0,                       love it  takes mins no oil smell in house for days   so easy to clean soak in hot water for    mins whipes right off   it s a must have      
2889,4.0,                       have enjoyed a variety of recipes   recipes are adaptable limited servings require extra preparation for larger families   i would not say this is necessarily a great investment  for families larger than   people      
2890,5.0,                       the first thing i cooked was pork chops   wonderful   then  i have cooked kabobs   those turned out pretty good although i need to experiment with timing a little more   i m sure i ll enjoy this unit      
2891,1.0,                       doesn t connect to wifi  hard to press buttons  burns food      
2892,1.0,                       their mobile app doesn t reflect the instructions in the manual when trying to connect the device to the wifi  in fact the images and workflow that shows up doesn t even reflect their instructional video either  do not buy unless you want to be extremely frustrated that you can t currently use the app      
2893,5.0,                       great product  we have enjoyed everything we have tried so far  wings are the best  also had an issue that was my fault and cosori customer service representatives were awesome and helped me with the issue  great company     
2894,5.0,                       love it  nice square basket  glad i purchased the larger size  can do entire meal for myself all at once  a little louder than the other brand i had but love the square shape and overall design  cook book is available for download also  great recipes i will actually use  be sure to check out the cosori air fryer and pressure cooker community on facebook  great for tips and recipes      
2895,5.0,                       easy to use  used every day and is more spacious than other models   if it wears out  will buy again      
2896,5.0,                       i love this    the square inside  fits more food     it s a dream to clean   i love the reminder to shake   i had the power air fryer that quit working after nine months so i bought this one and i like it so much better and it s not near as bulky  and it looks nicer on the counter      
2897,1.0,                       did not like it chicken wasn t cooked all the way didn t like at all     
2898,5.0,                       it s a great unit  it does a good job coming food  not too loud  easy to clean up it is a fingerprint magnet though      
2899,5.0,                       i ve used it for french fries corn dogs to name a few they turned out great  crispy and an easier clean up      
2900,1.0,                       the screws come off of the basket  difficult to clean     
2901,5.0,                       this is first air fryer and i have to be honest i was very skeptical of the fryer   first test run  was chicken wings and bit was i surprised   the wings were crispy and still juicy   the fryer does make a bit of noise  but nothing that breaks sounds barriers       
2902,5.0,                       ease of use  price  ease of cleaning were all excellent      
2903,4.0,                       this is great it makes food so fast  only issue i have is getting stuff in and out of it without burning yourself super fast  easy to use  it s basically a toaster oven with a fan      
2904,5.0,                       get you an air fryer  that s all i m gonna say     
2905,4.0,                       so many things to cook      
2906,5.0,                       cooks better than most stuff i had  the best fries  tots  chicken nuggets  cinnamon rolls u name it it cooks fast better tasting no oil hardly  easy to clean and operate     
2907,4.0,                       this is a good unit   square cook bin allows for   cooking quadrants   way better than the round ones  the square corners can be tougher to clean     there is a huge social media support page to answer any cooking question you would have   almost everyone has the         if you are deciding between the two  go with the      larger       
2908,5.0,                       i love this so much  i have it set up where i can turn on with alexa and it works like a charm and also works well from the phone  it makes good meats and i love the way i can make asparagus and zucchini really crispy  the baskets are very easy to clean  this was a great buy for me      
2909,5.0,                       i was not even sure i wanted this but it is great  made chicken wings last night and they were delish  clean up is a snap  no more deep frier      
2910,5.0,                       we have had the cosori air fryer for a month or so and use it pretty much every day   it is reliable and easy to clean   we previously did veggie like asparagus  cauliflower and broccoli on the grill  but they are just as good on the cosori air fryer and much easier   would definitely purchase this item again      
2911,5.0,                       wife still tells me how much she loves this really it s been months and months since she got it it s like i m mr fantastic again      
2912,5.0,                       very happy  i cook so much in this thing  it cooks fast and easy to use  i m learning what temps to adjust it too with times for other foods that are not on the pre programmed option but pinterest is very helpful      
2913,1.0,                       very strange  a few times the basket shoots out after preheat  tonight   minutes into preheat the basket shot out and landed on the floor breaking the part that clicks into the frame  too hot to pick up off wood floor  that was crazy  i think this is a defect because my children have the same one and they ve never experienced this  i will return it and exchange for a new one      
2914,5.0,                    funciona muy bien  excelente producto  muchas recetas de manera f cil  funciona desde aplicaci n muy bien         
2915,5.0,                       it arrived just fine but the buttons on the control pad wouldn t work  the next day i phoned and they only asked for some basic info and sent a new one  no other questions asked  i was able to get it to work once  with much difficulty  and the chicken was the best ever  i can t wait for the replacement to arrive  cosori rocks        
2916,5.0,                       i was skeptical about it at first  but after using it for a while  it s pretty awesome  fast cooking and warm up times  i wish i had this for the summer      
2917,5.0,                       we got a great deal during amazon prime days  we love this air fryer  my kids will now eat at home without a fuss  i love that the baskets can go in the dishwasher

2926,4.0,                       i bought this for when my children visit me in japan for the summer  unboxed and found a dent in the pan  i think over time it will develop a hotspot and may crack the metal  hope it holds upupdate   amazon recommended i contact the vendor and they were super eager to assist   got a replacement drawer and an accesory kit and i have not stopped using this since   extremely satisfied with the product  and the customer support was unlike anything ive experienced before   kudos to the cosori team      
2927,4.0,                       works as expected  i personally get a strange after taste with many foods and a bizarre cough at times     
2928,5.0,                       i m just starting my cosori air fryer experience  so far i love it  everything i ve tried has come out perfectly  the amount of support and information from the manufacturer is crazy good  i m not a kitchen gadget person  but this is an awesome appliance

2931,5.0,                       wish it came with accessories that fit this model instead of the smaller one  but overall this is a great air fryer  works great

2954,3.0,                       i love this air fryer but it has a flaw  the coating in the basket is coming off and i ve only used it a handful of times  i never used metal tools and always put it in the dishwasher on the top shelf so the pressure and temp weren t as great  disappointing since i really love everything else about it  i wouldn t purchase it again due to this defect

2962,2.0,                       bought the item as a gift  it hasn t been a year and the power button doesn t work  the person who received the gift thought it only worked through her phone app  we didn t realize it was a dud from the beginning until we had to try to get the wifi reconnected and the power button doesn t work      
2963,5.0,                       this air fryer is awesome     i should have bought one of these long ago  no more greasy foods in deep fryer  this cooks everything evenly and thorough

2965,1.0,                       so disappointed   fryer arrived  box beaten up   unboxed etc  went to press power    it would not do so   so after much research and anticipation   my experience was negative   i have reordered same product as i feel it is most likely an odd circumstance   here s to hoping the next one works

2970,1.0,                       this fryer releases an awful smell like chemical and artificial every time it runs and gave my wife a headache  hoping that its not something harmful  returned the product right away        
2971,5.0,                       gift for daughter in law and she picked out a larger model  so i got this one   didn t have room to store  but very glad it landed in my kitchen   expect years and years of use

2976,4.0,                       i love this air fryer  it is a must have in every kitchen  the  only reason i gave it a   star is because the basket had a deeper scratch on the outside when it arrived  i am hoping overtime it does not corrode      
2977,1.0,                       item would not turn on  returned for refund   weeks ago  never received acknowledgement or refund      
2978,4.0,                       love this thing    i have cooked about everything i can think of in it and it is very cool  i did have to tighten some screws  an the handle is not the best design

2986,5.0,                       does what it says  a lot less grease in food  be careful not to cook to long as i did first time  burgers got to dry  my fault     
2987,2.0,                       great for cooking most foods  but the handle that is supposed to snap in the basket  and to snap drawer  closed was loose  now it wont close  only   months of use       
2988,5.0,                       this product is a new staple in my kitchen   i use it nearly every day  and a few months after i ordered it  it randomly stopped turning on  so the cosori warranty team replaced it quickly and easily so i could get back to my air frying grind      
2989,3.0,                       sometimes a button will be very easy to use and others it will take me different types of pressure  hard  slight touch  tap    i believe there is just something wrong with the screen touch   frustrating to use the only two times i tried it      
2990,5.0,                       expensive but well worth it this product makes you wish you had bought this a long time ago     
2991,5.0,                       i bought this for my dad who is blind  the ease of using this is out of this world  customer service for cosori was also fantastic and answered questions with no problem that he had   he uses it everyday  so glad a bought this for him and i highly recommend this        
2992,4.0,                       so far i  like this gadget   i rarely use my stove anymore   it s a little difficult to clean   especially the inside  all in all i say it s a good investment for people with busy lives or just trying to eat healthier      
2993,5.0,                       we absolutely love our fryer  we have cooked shrimp  grill cheese sandwiches  chicken  vegetables and pork tenderloin  we use it everyday and also took it when we went glamping and made hot dogs wrapped in bacon  lots of recipes on you tube and soo easy to use  bought one for my son as well   just use parchment paper for biscuit wrapped items or it will stick to basket      
2994,5.0,                       works great  but remember that this takes a little oil and still requires some oil  nonetheless  great product  food is flavorful      
2995,5.0,                       good size  easy to use and clean   cooks salmon perfectly also does a good job with hot dogs and will reheat french fries and make the crispy again

2997,5.0,                       update          still working perfect  no issues this machine has changed my life  no exaggeration   works as described  no issues  cleaning the basket every day can get tedious as you have to get in between each groove but its absolutely bearable      
2998,5.0,                       i love this thing  it s large enough to make good quantities of things such as wings  fries  etc  easy to clean and makes typically unhealthy things slightly more healthy for you      
2999,5.0,                       this air fryer is super easy to use  all the controls are well marked  after use clean is fast   well worth the money

3001,5.0,                       i was hesitant to get this because i thought it might be hard to clean  but it s a breeze to clean it  just soak in hot soapy water for a while and wipe residue off      
3002,5.0,                       i ve used this product for french fries  roasted veggies  pork chops  steaks  bacon   so far everything has cooked as i like it  meat comes out tender  best crispy bacon ever   fries come out crispy but not over cooked   there s a little taste that i been hoping would go away with the usage but it still there   other than that i m really happy with this product  i use it almost every night for dinner   invest in a small brush   super easy to clean

3004,4.0,                       so far we have only used it a couple of times but it worked very nicely   we are excited to try some of the items in the cookbook   preheating is important and helps cook the food quickly      
3005,5.0,                       easy to use  large basket  and makes delicious food  my mom has had this same one for over a year and it s held up great  it is pretty big   bulky  but worth it for how versatile it is

3014,5.0,                       not a single complaint  have used it multiple times per day for the few days ive had it  it makes almost everything better than a standard oven or microwave does      
3015,3.0,                       works good for the most part but the touch screen gets a bit finicky every now and then     
3016,5.0,                       i always had my doubts if it would really be useful to buy the air fryer  but it exceeded my expectations      i highly recommend it

3022,4.0,                       seriously  my   year old is obsessed with putting the basket in  turning the machine on and starting one of the many easy presets  we keep it unplugged most of the time  great air fryer that lacks a child lock  if that matters to you      
3023,5.0,                       easy to use  heats up very quickly and cooks food as good as you would hope   i am very satisfied with this product

3034,5.0,                       now this is an air fryer  i didn t like mines so decided to buy this on because of the shape of the tray and positive reviews  it is easy to use and clean  the coating has lasted unlike my other one  this is a keeper     
3035,4.0,                       we have roasted broccoli and cauliflower  my son cooks mozzarella cheese sticks  and i did make cinnamon   sugar biscuits one evening

3053,5.0,                       i bought the airfryer after having my sister in law telling me how great it was   the first thing i made was an apple pie and it turned out great   i ve had to change my diet and the almost  fat free  recipes sound like what i need      
3054,5.0,                       this is a great product  we use it every single day and have not once been disappointed      
3055,5.0,                       have been using is quite a bit   easy to use and clean   cooks in less time than an oven      
3056,5.0,                       wish i had bought it sooner   it cooks my salmon perfectly and was amazed how great the sweet potato fries are      
3057,4.0,                       this is a great product  super fast and easy to use  my only negative is that the fan is quite loud  i don t have anything to compare it to so i don t know if this is normal  it s loud enough that i don t want to be anywhere near the kitchen while it s running  other than that  i love it      
3058,5.0,                       i received my air fryer about two weeks ago   i have cooked steak  hamburgers  pork chops  grilled cheese  salmon  shrimp and a whole chicken  i have not been disappointed in any of them   it makes cooking easy   my favorite was the whole chicken as it was crispy on the outside and very moist and juicy on the inside  i would highly recommend       
3059,5.0,                       love this air fryer  we are on a strict leto type diet and have been able to cook anything from parmesan meatballs to bacon to chicken nuggets  the food comes out great  we live it so much that we are going to purchase another for our daughter s dorm room   also  our first one didn t work but the company promptly sent us a new one  no hassle      
3060,1.0,                       air fryer craze is over  not as good as everyone said it is     
3061,5.0,                       i am extremely happy with the purchase of my new air fryer  not only is it easy to use  the food comes out so neatly cooked  wish i would of bought this sooner       
3062,5.0,                       bought as a gift      
3063,1.0,                       not liking this  had it for a while and still stinks plastic when using  even the taste of the food is tasting bad  very unhappy       
3064,1.0,                       worked twice then stopped heating up   very disappointing   don t bother      
3065,1.0,                       this air fryer worked great  but only for barely over a year  i was truly disappointed that at this price point it completely died in    months  i used it on average   times per week     minutes max cooking time  it did perform very well and had multiple preset settings     
3066,5.0,                       value for money     
3067,5.0,                       still  learning  but enjoying the products so far   french fries  onion rings  chicken tenders  chicken  have become some  quick favorites  in our house   finding it very easy to clean although the little plastic piece that releases the pan looks a bit flimsy and i would expect it to not last long      
3068,5.0,                       we love this air fryer  this gets a lot of use   teenagers use it almost daily   easy to use  easy to clean   unfortunately  it has started to shut down  think it overheats    cosori support is excellent and is sending a replacement   we re looking forward to getting back to air frying on almost a daily basis with our cosori      
3069,5.0,                       what a great invention  i have been experimenting with it since receiving and it works fabulous  not too much you cannot cook in this thing  finally  something to make the cooking of a meal fun      
3070,5.0,                       my fave product i ve bought in           
3071,1.0,                       i bought my air fryer in january of       i ve used it maybe once a month in the last    months and last night the display stopped working making the entire machine useless  when it worked i liked the performance  it appears steam got behind the display  when you press on the power button water comes out      
3072,5.0,                       i love cosori air fryer  food comes out perfectly every time  the cooking times in the recipe book provided with the air fryer are all good  i did have a little trouble cleaning the basket by and but when i throw it in the dishwasher it is all good      
3073,5.0,                       works very well  very consistent   i didn t give it   stars for taste  as it s different than deep frying  not bad  just different      
3074,3.0,                       i love it  it works great for the most part  i wish it was a little larger and had maybe a small rack to sit in the bucket  sometimes the beep for the shake warning doesnt go off but it will light up on the panel  if i could do it over i wouldve gone with a bigger one that had multiple racks      
3075,5.0,                       one of my favorite purchases this year  love this appliance  cooks chicken perfect each time  love the preset modes and the wattage on this is superior to other air fryers        
3076,5.0,                       after researching a lot of air dryers  i finally decided on this one for its larger capacity  and for its good ratings   i use it about  x a week  and it s worked great so far   i ve had it for about   months at the time of writing this review      
3077,5.0,                       love love love this air fryer  the size is great for us  family of    i ve cooked in this almost everyday since i got it      
3078,5.0,                       cooks food fast and clean up is super easy  holds so much more than i expected      
3079,5.0,                       i like the ease of cleanup after use   especially when i cook bacon  no longer do i have a mess on the stove      
3080,5.0,                       gave this to my parents as a christmas gift  we ve already experimented with a few different recipes and everything has been delicious  great  healthy alternative to deep fried foods without losing any flavor  love how much food you can fit in the frying chamber      
3081,5.0,                       everything is better out of the air fryer  pizza bites are better than the box  egg rolls are so delicious and crispy out of this thing melts grease away and makes food that usually gives me heartburn not  it s great      
3082,5.0,                       super easy to use  food comes out fantastic  easy clean up  large but compact doesn t take up too much of my counter space so we leave it out  highly recommend      
3083,1.0,                       did not work     
3084,5.0,                       what i ve used it for has been great still have a lot to try the only thing i really didn t care for was the steaks bbq is still much better  steaks have a much better flavor on a bbq      
3085,5.0,                       i m not fond of cooking   but this has been very helpful and easy to use      
3086,5.0,                       i kept saying it was a waste of money  boy  was i wrong  great meals in less than half the time  i use it for everything      
3087,5.0,                       i have been using cosori air fryer for a month now  i did fried chicken wings and nuggets during our family get together and now two among those placed order for their home

3089,5.0,                       good product     
3090,5.0,                       first time using an air fryer  this one is so easy and simple  its presets make cooking so much easier  there is even a recipe book that comes with this one  its been a week  i have already used this   times     
3091,5.0,                       so far i love this product   healthy way of cooking   haven t done fries yet  but will put that to the test   so far i have cooked chicken and fish it this product      
3092,4.0,                       hard to clean since the design has too many grooves  but it is simple to use  this air fryer is a good budget one but if you re looking to use it more often than   time a week i d definitely invest in something better     
3093,5.0,                       purchased the air fryer as a christmas present to the family   we absolutely love it   we probably use it   to   times per week now   it s way easier than standing outside in the cold trying to deep fry wings in a turkey fryer or grill some burgers   most meats cook in    minutes or less  a real time saver   easy to use  clean  and care for   even bought one for the in laws    they love it too      
3094,5.0,                       i hardly ever use the stove any more   it makes the most crispy and juicy fried chicken without the grease      
3095,5.0,                       this air fryer is super easy to use   i really appreciate that it stays cool to the touch on the outside  it s easy to move and doesn t take a lot of counter space  and if you line the lower basket with foil  clean up is a breeze      
3096,4.0,                       love this air fryer however if oil gets into the burners the fryer emits a lot of thick white smoke  so far this only happens when i cook bacon in it      
3097,5.0,                       love it and use it everyday   other brands do not compare      
3098,5.0,                       i m thrilled with this product   it s cool  clean and easy to use   i have used it nearly everyday since i received it   tho i hope i don t need to use it  i understand from others that cosori offers excellent customer service      
3099,5.0,                       we really like your air fryer   i chose your company because it was rated       i was not disappointed   we are still getting used how long to cook certain items but that s ok   it makes our prep time less   we really like that it does not use any oil so it is much healthier      
3100,5.0,                       great fryer  good recipes  so far  just one complaint it s a little bit loud  but i don t mind cause the food comes out great     
3101,5.0,                       i use it every day and like it very much  awesome air fryer      
3102,5.0,                       this thing is fantastic     it doesn t eliminate prep but but it does help make your favorite fried foods healthier      
3103,5.0,                       bought two of these at christmas gave one to my wife and one to my son  they have both been excellent      
3104,1.0,                       i bought it as a gift for my girlfriend  we were very excited to use this product    unfortunately the buttons were not very responsive  you have to press the buttons     x s  for them to do actually do anything   very inconsistent   i ultimately returned the item    needless to say  my girlfriend was not very happy  and i did not get laid that night   thanks cosori        
3105,5.0,                       this air cooker is awesome  cook s great  easy to use  and easy to clean      
3106,5.0,                       this thing is awesome  we have made every meal in it since we received it  i was skeptical about it at first  but it truly makes a delicious meal  very easy to use and clean  the quality of the machine is incredible for the price i paid      
3107,5.0,                       definitely one of the best appliances i have ever bought  i like it more than my instant pot which i absolutely love     
3108,5.0,                       a whole lot cleaner and easier to use then frying  tastes just as good  if not better then some  my kids a fries monsters  this device is big and allows a lot of fries to be made      
3109,4.0,                       so far we have only used this to make chicken wings and french fries  the wings were excellent  the fries ok  but both times we found the recommended cooking times to be far too long  it does take up a bit of counter space  but it is quiet and unobtrusive and easy to clean      
3110,5.0,                       i don t know how i lived without this thing  it s great   it even connects to alexa for voice commands and has a phone app      
3111,5.0,                       i ve had it since christmas  and i absolutely love it  i find it a little hard to clean  besides that it makes everything jimmie without the extra oil      
3112,5.0,                       very happy with my air fryer  it s very convenience to have one of this if you have a busy lifestyle  i can put it in the dishwasher

3114,5.0,                       i love this air fryer  so easy to use and easy to clean as well  not bulky  buy it  you won t regret it      
3115,4.0,                       it does give off a slight burning plastic smell but other than that  this thing is amazing   i ve gained   lbs so that s a side effect to it      
3116,4.0,                       still learning  but it does work well for some thing s      
3117,5.0,                       works fine     
3118,2.0,                       i initially liked it because of the large size  but the chemical plastic smell of the unit never fully disappeared  unfortunately  i am out of the return period  i will probably not buy the same unit next time      
3119,4.0,                       love it  but the basket is very hard to get out which makes cleaning difficult

3185,2.0,                       great concept  design needs improvement  my bin started popping open on the second use and completely failed in less than ten uses the latch that keeps the fryer closed is made of the same polymer the basket is  not having a button that releases the basket causes the latch to shave off quickly

3190,5.0,                       initially was skeptical to purchase  after reading review after review about this air fryer  i have had it for   months now and it s used several times a week  it has a   year warranty and if you register it soon after you receive it  they will give a second year warranty free      
3191,5.0,                       very easy  getting used to the difference from fat frying  but everything has turned out edible  plan on buying another for it seasonal home      
3192,2.0,                       i loved this when i first got it  i ve had it less than a year   half the buttons no longer work  the     button doesn t work  so i can t decrease the temperature from any standard settings and i cannot decrease time  i will be replacing it in the very near future

3195,3.0,                       everything i cook inside has a weird flavor i have washed the inside several times but the flavor doesn t go away

3207,4.0,                       i think its a great product to have the only issue i do have with it is taking the pan in and out it jams up when pulling it out which could splash hot grease on you so be careful when pulling the tray out     
3208,5.0,                       great product  easy to use   as long as u use the app  otherwise i d send it back the screen doesn t work well at all   not super easy to clean but that s not a big deal to me as long as i keep the food away from the edge of the basket   it s a learning curve   always cook ur food less time than prescribed then measure the temp

3224,4.0,                       didn t like  fried  chicken  one strong reason to buy   pizza not bad   great roasted veg   french fries not bad      
3225,4.0,                       very user friendly  it does give off a weird smell that i thought would go away after the first few uses  but this is my first air fryer  so maybe that s how they all are  we use it for everything though  homemade chicken wings are a new favorite      
3226,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                       f cil

3229,4.0,                       absolutely brilliant this air frier is   wi fi controlled so can monitor from work      
3230,1.0,                       the air fryer works great when it turns on  but i ve been having difficulty lately  i don t use it very often and after only   year the power button seemed to have stopped working      
3231,1.0,                       we have had nothing but problems with this unit      of the time  the touch panel does nothing  you have to push the button a ton of times to get it to register  it cooks fine when you finally get it working  its extremely irritating      
3232,5.0,                       i did my research on buying an air fryer  my friends owns one   i saw how easy it was to use  clean   cook with  hands down it is the best purchase ever      qt cooking space  i ve done pork roast  artichokes  sweet potatoes  wings  and more  cleans with ease   that is what other styles had issues with  worth every penny  fits perfectly on my counter      
3233,5.0,                       when we purchased this unit we thought we might use it once in a while but it has become a staple in our kitchen   once we got the hang of how long to cook items it has made a world of difference   items that usually took    minutes in the oven only take about   or    in the air fryer   definitely recommend this unit to anyone looking at purchasing one      
3234,5.0,                       is super easy to use     
3235,4.0,                       pretty easy to use as with all new products it takes a little tweaking   i have made fries and fried zucchini and both came out crunchy  saves a lot of time you don t have so many pans to wash  it cleans up very easy i would recommend it      
3236,5.0,                       best purchase ever     
3237,5.0,                       works perfectly   just like frying without the oil   i love the pre heat and keep warm features      
3238,5.0,                       easy to use     
3239,3.0,                       this thing is huge  if you plan to use it on the counter under kitchen cupboards there isn t enough clearance per directions  i had to return because there was no room for it      
3240,5.0,                       love making chicken wings in this air fryer  i m still learning about the temps and frozen food  it s best to set the time temp lower than the directions on the frozen food  i ve over cooked a couple of things      
3241,5.0,                       its nice work good      
3242,2.0,                       product works fine but produces such a high pitch noise when setting time and temp that our dog goes crazy   we can t even stand near the fryer without the dog whining   our dog has never reacted to anything like this   the sound is totally ear piercing to my dog      
3243,2.0,                       touch pad works only on occasion  when you can turn it on  with some struggling  it cooks fine  wifi doesn t want to connect  it s not necessary for some thing like this to have wi fi  i would prefer something that has a dial  would not recommend      
3244,5.0,                       works great  easy to operate and clean  no longer have to heat the whole house up with the stove  wife loves it  highly recommend      
3245,1.0,                       not very good quality the door will not stay shut while in the middle of frying and the machine keeps shutting off i do not recommend this air fryer to anybody      
3246,5.0,                       we looked at many options and decided on this one   and i m glad we did  it is very easy to use and even easier to clean  while it s not small i still found room in my cabinet for it easily  great product      
3247,5.0,                       this is a good product  purchased this product for a gift and the  re cip i ent was very happy      
3248,2.0,                       fryer looks well built and useful  however arrived not working so immediately returned it      
3249,5.0,                       this fryer is hands down the best one in the market from its grayish black finish that makes it look very high end to the ease of use and quality of finished product definitely have no complaints about this item and would recommend this to anyone     
3250,5.0,                       easy to used     
3251,5.0,                       i love this air fryer  i put off buying one for months because i thought it was another fad appliance  but was i wrong  i decided to buy the bigger size so i can cook in less batches and the food  turns out crisp  tasty and takes less time just as everyone says   i like the square basket of the cosori fryer that was a selling point for me

3253,5.0,                       we got defective item first but they sent us brand new replacement asap  super customer service    and  i am really satisfied with the new one  it cooks everything with a bit oil and its cleaning is very easy as well

3272,5.0,                       we used to have one other brand but not working anymore  this one is easy to use  with the high tech its much easier and more convenient to control  also this one has bigger volume  even brand new doesn t has that smell with the other one  the menu is so useful  it shows alot of different receipts      
3273,5.0,                       i love this air fryer if you want to stop cooking with grease this is something you should invest in

3276,5.0,                       now that i am used to the cooker i ejjoy cooking with it  cooked a pork chop last night and it came out crispy and with agreat flaver      
3277,1.0,                       i have a breathing problem and use   times it smells like burning plastic my kids would not even eat the seasoned frys from freezer i cooked the plastic smell was in the frys it is awfull smell up my house even the tea steeping on the stove i fixed taste like the smell from fryer

3280,3.0,                       i like the performance of this air fryer  there s a major problem with it though  the door may appear closed but it won t be completely closed  one of two things will happen    it will stop cooking    the pressure from the air pushes it out and if it s on a counter it will push your food on the floor  i had to witness my t bone steak fall on the floor      
3281,5.0,                       great product  intuitive to use  easy to clean  with a surprising amount of room

3284,3.0,                       i should give this product   stars  however after i used it for couple weeks and find out the inside of the machine get grease very easily and it looks like rusty  the basket very easy to clean  but every time it had watermark after washing  i am not really pleasant to use it  trying to buy a different brand      
3285,5.0,                       this thing made me fall in love with the frozen section again  it does things the microwave could only imagine  from french fries  potatoe skins  and coconut shrimp  best product ever     
3286,5.0,                       our cheap air fryer that i had ended up breaking so i decided to buy this after looking over the reviews  this is a great air fryer  the basket is substantially easier to clean than our old one and is easy to use in terms of setting time and temperature  very pleased with this purchase      
3287,5.0,                       wifey asked for one of these   i resisted for years   finally caved and now i use it more than she does   works like a champ      
3288,5.0,                       very easy to use  love being able to cook food in it without all the extra oil  well worth it      
3289,5.0,                       i love the air fryer  it works great  but mine came with no user manual  recipe book  nor registration info update  i was in contact with cosori and they are sending me a replacement manual and cookbook      
3290,1.0,                       do not buy   the bottoms did not work on the first unit i purchased so i returned it and had it replaced   the second unit worked the first time i tried it and never heated up again after that   this air fryer is complete garbage      
3291,2.0,                       this thing is amazing and cools food perfectly  the reason i gave it a low score is because the time and temp buttons are almost impossible to get to work  if it wasn t for that   stars      
3292,1.0,                       not even   months and it will not turn on  called amazon and warranty    days  called consori and they do not service via phone any longer  sent email  lets see if they respond     
3293,5.0,                       this is the best air fryer we have purchased so far  works better than the power xl fryer we had for   years

3299,5.0,                       i was quite skeptical about buying an air fryer before i got my hands on this one  i use it almost every other day for quick and healthy dinner prep s definitely recommend it to everyone who is giving it a thought

3302,5.0,                       this is super easy to use and clean  all of the presets are helpful and the included book of recipes was a nice touch as well  i think that this is also one of the largest air fryers i ve seen being sold  and it makes cooking larger dishes quantities much easier      
3303,5.0,                       absolutely awesome  i have a emerilairfryer     and this blows the     out of the water  we use this cosori     times a week with a family of      adults   year old    year old  and a   year old  sometimes we have to make two batches but is worth it when it s done  chicken  fish  sandwiches  fries  tater tots and more  love it

3338,2.0,                       unfortunately the touch option is not working on my cosori    i was really looking forward to using it  i have to only use the wifi app option and control from my phone  we recently moved into a new house and are waiting to get wifi tech to come out  due to the pandemic and i haven t been able to use my air fryer      
3339,2.0,                       it lasted about a year  now it just shuts off on its own during cooking  even unplugging it doesn t work  it just dies and won t even turn back on  so  if you wan something that works longer  get a different one

3411,3.0,                       it is really hard for people with nails to open  to remove the basket  it was frustrating to say the least      
3412,5.0,                       works great and i use it nearly every day  made the switch from a deep fryer  and while there are a few things that the deep fryer does better  fries  chicken strips  there are also a lot of things i m now cooking in the air fryer  fish  potatoes  carrots  that i no longer need to fire up the oven for

3425,5.0,                       i think that these folks that are saying their fryer leaves puddles or dont cook fries well are obviously doing something wrong or are having mechanical problems i have had no problems with either  great  addition to the kitchen      
3426,5.0,                       we really enjoy the ease of using this fryer  clean up is a snap along with clean cooking of any foods which may splatter  this unit outperformed a highly priced unit which quite entirely after   months  even the   replacements didn t last      
3427,1.0,                       i had high hopes for the cosori air fryer after seeing the raving reviews posted by others  unfortunately  within    days of receiving the air fryer it stopped working  i ve attempted to reset it multiple times as well  but that hasn t worked  do not buy from this manufacturer      
3428,4.0,                       this is great air fryer as long as your not looking for silence  the blower motor is louder than some but it s still a great fryer      
3429,5.0,                       this is my third air fryer  all different brands  this one cooks the best out of all three i have owned and has a much larger capacity  the other two only lasted about six months  hopefully this one will last a lot longer

3431,4.0,                       hasn t broken yet     
3432,1.0,                       the basket ejected by itself and shot across the room while it was cooking  it was hot  dangerous and food went everywhere      
3433,5.0,                       i am in love  i can t cook  but with the airfryer  i can prepare meals with ease  the airfryer is easy to use and comes with a super helpful cookbook  best purchase yet      
3434,5.0,                       love this air fryer   it makes cooking a pleasure   i mainly use if for buffalo wings and they come out better in here then if you deep fried them   i d def recommend this product

3440,5.0,                       makes everything crispy  love it for tatertots and fish sticks  i usually cook them a little longer than recommended  doesn t heat up the kitchen like using the oven  so easy to clean   so much easier to clean than the toaster convection oven      
3441,5.0,                       love it  is so easy i just tell alexa to turn it on and what temp love that  it even tells you when to flip the food everything i ve tried we love it s so easy

3448,5.0,                       my wife and i were discussing how we would rate the air fryer and we both said   stars  but then when we asked ourselves why it would get   stars we couldn t come up with any reasons  it s great very easy to clean warms up quickly  the only thing you have to get used to is the cooking times      
3449,5.0,                       we use ours all the time  love it  moving into an rv and taking it with us  not leaving it behind      
3450,3.0,                       i have to hold the top of the fryer to get the basket out  fortunately it is not hot  wish it was sturdier

3651,1.0,                       i barely used this thing and it stopped working  now it gives me some electronic code and it started ironically about   days after the year warranty was up  as if it was programmed  now it just stops after the  st minute of heating and gives me an error code each time

3712,1.0,                       missing user manual and the recipe book  and cosori refuses to send a printed version of both   highly unacceptable   one of the big reasons i had purchased this  was because of the recipe book that it comes with      
3713,5.0,                       perfect for   people or more  was hesitant with the basket not being big enough    pounds of chicken wings easily fits and still had room for more

3727,5.0,                       bought this as a gift and they love it  my father is blind so i love the   minute timer      
3728,4.0,                       i like the results but i have an odd issue with the buttons   the buttons do not respond when i touch them with my index finger but they will when i use my thumb  i will add a video to illustrate  otherwise i really liked how crispy my chicken wings turned out

3734,2.0,                       the settings seem to either over or undercook the food  it s better to use your own settings  it also lets out a burning plastic smell every time it s used that stinks up the house and makes it very unenjoyble to use      
3735,5.0,                       excellent product and excellent support  should you need to speak with them the recipe book is also very handy and includes unique and healthy selections for the air fryer

3818,5.0,                       cooks faster than it is supposed to but made great chips and fried chicken strips  and chicken wings love my air fryer     
3819,5.0,                       great for a working mom with limited time to cook  love making fresh tenders and hard  boiled  eggs that peel perfectly  easy screen display also      
3820,5.0,                       they need to address the parchment paper  beneath the basket today  oil and food crumbs  accumulated underneath  the oil went rancid and spoiled the taste   easy fix     
3821,2.0,                       this product did a great job cooking everything asked of it  but sadly it failed shortly after the warranty expired   too bad  we really liked it   i can t see buying another if i only get one year of service      
3822,5.0,                       the hot air fryer is doing a great job

3826,4.0,                       i pay for a cosori wi fi smart product  and i got the regular one with no wi fi capability at all   neither seen in the machine or in her original box   and  of course was unable to to work wi fi at all     
3827,4.0,                       overall  great items   made it easy to cook a lot of food fast  one reason i didn t give it   stars is the button to change temp and timer is not easy to use very slow      
3828,1.0,                       difficult to get the drawer back  in  no drawer stop  philips design is much better      
3829,4.0,                       great additional in the kitchen  we are able to eliminate the use of oil and no need to drain oil from fried foods  however  the fryer isn t that great with breaded foods      
3830,4.0,                       not well made    of the   basket screws came loose and fell out  one came out while cooking and got mixed in with my food  i almost swallowed it      
3831,5.0,                       love the new airfryer  better than the first one  but technology makes that so   juicy inside crispy outside   love that we just put in the dishwasher      
3832,1.0,                       after trying it     times  it started to trip the kitchen circuit breaker  usually it happened  when reaching to a certain temperature threshold  we tried multiple times and at different locations  but it was keep tripping the circuit breaker  seems like a manufacturing fault      
3833,5.0,                       love this fryer   easy to operate  and so easy to clean   delicious food   awesome wings  fries  fish     
3834,5.0,                       have only had ours for a couple of weeks so haven t used it a lot  but what i have cooked has been easy to cook and delicious  as it s still new  some of the food does have a very slight new appliance taste but i m sure that will go away the more i use it  on prime day  i ordered one for a wedding gift for a friend and had it sent to his home in indiana  couldn t resist the bargain      
3835,5.0,                       great product  still experimenting with different recipes to see it s limits      
3836,2.0,                       my only hesitation to suggesting this air fryer is that the touchscreen buttons are very hard to use and seem to glitch often  it s hard to set the time and temp when the touchscreen style buttons don t work      
3837,5.0,                       this is so great to cook with  we love it  easy to clean

3855,5.0,                       awesome product  i make literally everything in this air fryer       
3856,5.0,                       waited a minute to get one but sooo glad i did   can t wait to try more recipes      
3857,5.0,                       i did quite a bit of research before purchasing an air fryer and all i can say is buy it  it s amazing  it s easy to clean  easy to use  and cooks evenly   you won t regret it       
3858,1.0,                       this air fryer was good for cooking   but my air fryer got problem after   months from the day i got it   i tried to get product supports from cosori which amazon provided but cosori replied to talk to amazon   from amazon web site design  there is no way to make any complains      
3859,1.0,                       buttons are very hard to get the temp and time to change  going to buy a different air fryer      
3860,1.0,                       we got this item as a gift and the recipient tried to use it today and it won t even turn on    straight out of the box  it seems like it may have been used and returned because it s also missing items  but it s past the amazon return date so now we just have a broken air fryer      
3861,1.0,                       it started smoking   weeks after i bought it  and it was a gift for my mom  i have to call the manufacturer for help

3864,3.0,                       the only thing i disliked about this airfryer was it s basket design  it s hard to clean and it blocks airflow because the holes are so small  you better off getting an air fryer with either a removal basket base or a mesh basket base  or both      
3865,5.0,                       works great   is a little bigger than i thought it would be but it holds a lot of food

3874,5.0,                       lot of guess work on some items  but pot stickers are the best in this thing  hamburgers are good too  shrimp works great

3878,1.0,                       we tried to give this air fryer a chance  but we had to return it  the buttons were all but impossible tho push  and the basket would pop open after cooking for   minutes  it also had a burnt plastic smell while it was cooking

3913,1.0,                       never got a chance to use it  the button screen is unresponsive and defective  how did this leave the factory with such a major flaw  what a waste  will be returning this in the morning and buying a phillips air fryer     
3914,5.0,                       best buy in a long time    food tastes delicious      
3915,1.0,                       the preset buttons hardly work  the manual buttons do not work at all  i think that this is the first time i have been compelled to give a negative review on a purchase      
3916,3.0,                       it cooked great for about a year  recently it started turning on and off every few seconds  just beeping constantly like i was taking the basket in and out  today it finally kicked the bucket and won t even turn on at all      
3917,5.0,                       i read a lot of comments about the screws coming out  i personally haven t had that issue  i use it all the time  easy clean up and delicious everytime      
3918,1.0,                       only way to clean is to soak overnight  i had to rinse and repeat with dawn to make sure the bottom of the fryer was clean  as you cannot reach the flat bottom part of the fryer under the basket      
3919,5.0,                       love it  makes cooking so much quicker  takes some adjusting in time and temp to get things so they dont burn but once you master it things come out delicious      
3920,5.0,                       so easy to use  meats like steak is my favorite  comes out perfect every time vegetables are fabulous  too  cool briefly for soft  a bit longer for soft  and longer for delicious chips      
3921,3.0,                       sent back smelled the house

3923,5.0,                       so convince the to use  today my roommate cooked chicken breast with it  it was the best chicken breast i have ever tasted  no oil added  so healthy      
3924,5.0,                             would recommend  received it and the first thing we made were lemon pepper wings   the air fryer crisped the wings perfectly  we also made homemade french fries that the air fryer cooked to crispy perfection      
3925,4.0,                       i don t use it as much as i thought i would  i feel it s only ideal for a couple items      
3926,5.0,                       healthy and fast dinner love it

3930,3.0,                       update  i contacted customer service  they are great   satisfied with resolution he led touch screen hasnt worked right since i got it  very disappointed given it was an amazon choice      
3931,4.0,                       works great  takes some experimenting to get food cooked the way we want  great on wings       
3932,1.0,                       i do not recommend purchasing this thing unless you like to waste       minutes in meal prep time trying to get it to reconnect to the internet   my wifi signal is strong supporting over     connected devices    all except this hunk of crap   the app and the machine are garbage  don t purchase      
3933,5.0,                       i used it for the first time last night  i made garlic parm chicken wings and they came out really good  i m looking forward to trying a bunch of different things      
3934,5.0,                       i upgraded from a smaller air fryer to this one and i love it  it s big and really easy to clean      
3935,5.0,                    excelente producto  muy por encima de la ninja en cuanto a funciones y acabados est ticos  hecho en acero negro que se ve s per bien  no tiene nada de pl stico expuesto o algo que la haga verse  barata          
3936,2.0,                       so easy to use and works great but i ve used it only    days and the coating on the drip pan is already bubbling      
3937,5.0,                       works great love it     
3938,5.0,                       is as advertised and met or exceeded our expectations      
3939,4.0,                       i used it on  almost everything     
3940,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          does anyone notice the smell of plastic  i was nervous about the smell and the smoke     
3941,5.0,                       i will never cook bacon or burgers any other way  love it      
3942,3.0,                       i ve had this product for less than a year  and while it works  the screws ports where the front of the bottom tray is have broken on the inside  and the entire basket will not lock into place any longer  thus the whole thing has become unusable to me      
3943,1.0,                       panel did not work  only   button work  could not even turn it on manualy   the only way we could get it to work was with the wiifii option  really disappointed to pay so much for half the functions   i returned it      
3944,5.0,                       i am not a good cook but meat turns out fabulous in this air fryer much better than on the grill  i tend to dry things out on the grill   i have cooked venison  pork chops  salmon and chicken breast which have all turned out great      
3945,3.0,                       we bought this unit to replace our much smaller unit  i gave it a   rating as the unit is very loud when in use  to the point of annoying  i like to listen to music when i cook and have to turn the volume up considerably to hear it when using this unit

3970,4.0,                       usually need to cut down   min from any of the pre sets     unless you like it when half of your food to turns to ash  many health benefits to charcoal    whiter teeth  fresher breath  can aid digestion        
3971,5.0,                       bought it for our kids they love it     
3972,3.0,                       the buttons on this machine are horrible  most of the time you cannot adjust anything because you cannot get the buttons to work  more recently  i have had to unplug and plug back in to cook additional food or add more time      
3973,5.0,                       tater tots  onion rings  fries  pigs in a blanket  cookies taquitos  flautas  the list goes on    the best is reheated left over pizza    those of you with plastic taste must have left some packaging material in and heated the unit tough to fit both units in bottom of dishwasher

3983,2.0,                       steams a lot  but the worst part is the drawer flies open when using it  not all the time but even  x is too many  it s scary it can fly off the counter and burn the kids with oil      
3984,5.0,                       easy to use and clean  haven t tried any of the muffins or desserts yet but i love the way it does fried potatoes   with only a teaspoon of oil  and did a great job on pork chops and beer battered and regular fish

3995,2.0,                       the unit cooks well  i like the controls   but it sounds like it is falling apart  i have only used it one time and it rattles when running  i can t find anything loose   it must be a design flaw     
3996,5.0,                       i mostly use it to reheat food since microwaves leave everything soggy  perfect for my purposes and is very easy to clean if you use a paper liner

4001,4.0,                       easy to use  helpful recipe book included  only downside is manual and careful cleaning required  and it s big  you need a high clearance shelf to be able to put this away between uses

4026,3.0,                       when we finally opened and use the air fryer  the basket keeps ejecting and not staying closed  we think it was mishandled during shipping  hopefully we can get in contact with the seller or company

4179,1.0,                       over the past couple of weeks i have had two screws fall out of the top of the air fryer while it is in use   also  i frequently have to hit the buttons multiple times to get a temp time to select

4396,4.0,                       placing parchment paper between the basket and hopper as well as using foil each time dramatically mitigates cleanup post usage  takes a little practice getting temps and times just right for different foods  accompanying booklet with recommended temps and times helpful

4467,5.0,                       so i didn t buy an air fryer for the longest time because i seldom eat fried foods but this little gem is a mini convection oven so bake away  and it makes sweet potato wedges  i buy frozen cookie dough round ball  of yummy and bake at     for about    min  perfect      
4468,5.0,                       makes the best food and is full of the best features  i wish you could add shake to custom recipes but you can customize the fry setting each time you use it  and that setting uses a shake
