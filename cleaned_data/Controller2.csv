0,5.0,                       matte black looks great     
1,1.0,                       garbage  its defective and disconnects from the xbox every    seconds      
2,5.0,                       grandsons love them     
3,4.0,                       doesn t work with fosmon dual controller charger      
4,2.0,                       disconnects and reconnects very often despite the controller being within   feet direct line of sight from console      
5,5.0,                       awesome control  it includes    days free ultimate game pass   works with different cellphones and my mac      
6,1.0,                       i thought they fixed the triggers getting stuck down  nope     days and suddenly my right trigger is getting stuck  this is the quickest yet  unreal      
7,4.0,                       works fine only issue is you can t put one of the rechargable battery packs on it  doesn t fit so you ll have to always use double as with these     
8,1.0,                       i bought this to replace the controller that my roommate broke  i was happy with it for all of    minutes  i love the texturing  on this controller  it feels great in your hand  i also like the screenshot button now for the downside  it constantly disconnects while playing  i know it isn t something weird with my system as my other controller is doing just fine  also  it runs on batteries  there s no rechargeable pack  it can t even fit the rechargeable packs from my other controller because the shape of the controller is different  i expected more for paying like     more than my previous controller i ll be returning this      
9,3.0,                       main reason i m giving it   stars is it doesn t always pair and you need a usb c rather than a micro usb to plug it in     
10,3.0,                       i am a pc gamer and purchased this controller to play genshin impact  this is primarily due to poor support for the switch pro and dualsense   controllers  that being said  this controller does what it needs to do without the need for  rd party mapping software  and the rumble feature works fine that s basically it for all the positive aspects for this controller now for the cons  the buttons on this thing are uncomfortable and feels cheap  compared to sony and nintendo controllers  the travel distance for all the buttons  a b x y   d pad  are too far and feels cheap and plasticky  each button press generates an annoying and hollow plastic click  my thumb gets tired a lot quicker pressing the aforementioned buttons  if you own a sony or nintendo controller  do a side by side comparison and you ll see what i mean tl dr   great software support  horrendous build quality      
11,3.0,                       first thing i noticed right when i opened the box for this controller is that it s made in china  sad to say in the first two weeks of gameplay i ve noticed the joysticks already beginning to wobble  i imagine it ll get worse  i m sad because this controller feels so much better than the previous version  for context  i m not a pro or regular gamer  very casual on my part  and yet        
12,5.0,                       better than the standard xbox one controller that comes with the system  bought on sale      
13,1.0,                       will not stay connected via bluetooth or xbox wireless adapter  constantly disconnects  all drivers and firmware are up to date and it still happens      
14,5.0,                       best controller yet      
15,5.0,                       tis the real thing   works perfect      
16,5.0,                       exactly what i ordered  perfect condition      
17,4.0,                    the audio jack don t work  todo lo dem s funciona bien        
18,3.0,                       the design is sleek and smaller than the older models  however  it sucks at staying connected  randomly while playing the controller will disconnect for no reason whatsoever  nothing blocking or interfering with it which is unfortunate because it s rather expensive lol     
19,5.0,                       it worked perfectly and it s perfect for cod  red dead  and any other games where you might get into serious gun fights      
20,2.0,                       it s a good controller  but it feels like they took both a step forward and back from the xbox one controller  also  controls through bluetooth are jumbled up in some games pros   the xbox controller design and layout  it s still as great as ever   the redesigned d pad is easier to use   the controller is a tiny bit smaller and feels much better sized in my hands   they replaced the shiny black texture on the bumpers and triggers with a better matte texture   the menu buttons feel more clicky and are more responsive cons   controls are straight up broken in some games when the controller is connected through bluetooth  they get all jumbled up  like a becomes x  b becomes a  and rt becomes the start button  it works normally when connected through a cable or the xbox wireless adapter  i don t know what the problem is  but they need to fix this asap  it s been a while since release and there still has been no recognition of this problem   you need to update the firmware to use it on bluetooth  you need a cable or the xbox wireless adapter to update the firmware  the controller comes with neither   the grip textures are irritating on my hands  it feels like you re holding a man s bearded face  i don t understand why they had to ruin the controller like this  all they had to do was keep it smooth   the buttons  including the d pad  are significantly louder than the xbox one controller   the share button does nothing on pc i recommend holding off on this controller until they fix the bluetooth issue at least  the grip textures ruin the controller for me personally  the xbox one controller is still available and a much better option at this point  if you still have an xbox one controller  there is no reason for you to get this one      
21,5.0,                       i love the controller     
22,5.0,                       it fits well in my small hands and is very comfortable to use  the triggers feel amazing  the sticks nice and accurate  the d pad is fantastic  simply  i can t say enough good about this controller  just make sure to have some aa batteries if you want to use it wirelessly  but if you sit close to your pc and don t mind a wire  you can plug it in with usb c and it ll work like a dream      
23,5.0,                       the kids loved it     
24,1.0,                       i don t need to write a review  the pictures speak for themselves      
25,5.0,                       i frick n l ve it  i haven t owned a game system since        i m enjoying the feel of the controller in my hands  its very comfortable  now i m wondering why i haven t purchased an xbox before  next up is the elite  oh    and  thanx for being fairly priced      
26,5.0,                       this was a   stars     
27,2.0,                       works great until you try to use it for a pc game cause the inputs are all whack and the triggers don t even have an input     
28,1.0,                       i ordered first controller and it was delivered broken  second controller was good but would not work with cod mobile when it said it would work  i then broke controller into pieces and took the     loss  i do not recommend this controller to anybody or this seller i do not know what s going on but i am furious and i guess i am out of the money i spent  it is what it is  life goes on      
29,1.0,                       does not vibrate during game play  it vibrates quickly when i plug in the c port cord but that s it      
30,3.0,                       it might be a bad controller but it disconnects sometimes and the voice chat cuts out returned it     
31,5.0,                       i grabbed this on sale for     to upgrade from using xbox one controllers for pc gaming   yes  the d pad is definitely better with this model   but  i can totally envision someone being disappointed with buying this if they already use an xbox one controller for pc gaming don t get me wrong  this is a great gaming controller and you will be happy with it if you buy it   just don t expect it to be a huge improvement over existing stuff      
32,5.0,                       the new textures feel great  feels smaller than it looks      
33,5.0,                       i bought this for my xbox one x  it feels great  i can take a snap shot of in game on the fly  the triggers are non slip  it feels like a pro controller without the pro price      
34,4.0,                       pretty good overall i like the way it feels and how it has a lot of grip only downside is that i always hit the clip button because it s right next to the start button     
35,5.0,                       my son loves the grip on this controller        
36,5.0,                       smooth  feels good works great  running it on my computer  so far no complaints would buy again      
37,1.0,                       microsoft makes some of the worst controllers ever  my elite controller started falling apart after a few months of use and this one proved itself to be unusable during the very first play session  the right trigger is sticking to the point of unusability and it frequently will turn itself off lose connection  ridiculous  i ll never buy another ms made controller ever again  terrible quality control      
38,5.0,                       my grandson loves it      
39,1.0,                       there s an issue with this controller and the official xbox wireless adapter   the controller disconnects frequently  every minute or so      
40,5.0,                       my daughter bought this for her dad it works like expected     
41,5.0,                       as advertised    great item  fast shipping  a        
42,5.0,                       perfect and just what i needed to replace my old controller     
43,5.0,                       great all around     
44,2.0,                       at first the controller was fine then it randomly gave me controller drift and not messes me up in every game  i can t even play my games right without it not working or drifting for no reason if i could get a replacement that would be nice but idk if that will happen      
45,1.0,                       i bought it for xbox one and it turns off all the time i do not understand how it got high ratings i did try to replace it but it does the same thing      
46,2.0,                       i got this used and the first one i got would disconnect multiple times per hour   i returned it and got a replacement  the replacement stayed connected  but the buttons were very sticky and slow to pop back up  it felt like syrup or something gummy was in the controller and this made games unplayable because the buttons would stay down i wound up returning the second controller and just buying a new one      
47,4.0,                       its a great product but came later than expected wich was a little disappointing      
48,5.0,                       i bought this as a replacement   it works well   my son said he really likes it   there is a different feel and texture compared to the older ones      
49,5.0,                       about the same of the older controller but it seems to be more comfortable in my hand     
50,5.0,                       it s great  it works just like any other controller  i like the screenshot button a lot  good grips and quiet buttons      
51,4.0,                       solid controller  only thing i noticed is the paint comes off waayyy to easy  scuffs easily  nice beefy grip texture around the handle and triggers      
52,2.0,                       i play rocket league daily and use my right bumper consistently  wearing out controllers in about     months  however  this controller lasted not even a full   months    it has been the quickest to break so far on me and i have been playing less as well so i m a bit disappointed  kind of cheaply put together imo  i wouldn t pay more than     for a controller like this  going to purchase the original controllers instead one star for each month it lasted  and i m being generous     
53,2.0,                       constantly disconnects and will eventually brick itself and stop working altogether   it s unfortunate because when it works it s good  but after a while it just stops working altogether  becomes unrecognizable on any platform  don t waste your money on this if you plan to use it for pc      
54,1.0,                       for the price i did not expect to get a wireless controller that runs on batteries  i was expecting a charging cable  something that comes standard at this price point with ps  controllers silly me i thought xbox microsoft  windows    microsoft   should play nice together right  no  it pairs easily enough but is dead as a doornail with regard to games that support the xbox controller hopefully i can find an affordable usb c cable and then maybe it will work but im doubtful also even without the batteries this controller is way heavier than the ps  controller i just have just purchased a third party cheapo instead of this over priced thing      
55,5.0,                       excellent quality  new controller in sealed box     stars     
56,5.0,                       new xbox series controller can be used on xbox one consoles  however  it may randomly disconnect for the first few weeks of use  it happened to me and it happened to a few friends  the controller is not defective  its just not designed for the older consoles      
57,5.0,                       i like the new controllers     
58,5.0,                       i loved the feel and weight of my old xbox     remote   so i was disappointed with the initial xbox one controller  i ve owned my     controller for a decade without any issues  but my xbox one controller started having stick drift issues within the first   years of ownership  after it officially became unusable  i purchased the xbox core controller  what an upgrade  the xbox core controller feels much more balanced  with added weight and finger grips around the back and trigger buttons  i recommend this controller over the originally provided one  hands down      
59,1.0,                       this deserves   stars  i paid for an xbox series x carbon black controller and was sent a regular xbox controller that was used  the company put a used and destroyed controller in a series x box  the inside of the controller looked like batteries exploded inside then it was attempted to clean it  becareful with whos selling the product because a lot of scamming is going on      
60,5.0,                       great quality     
61,5.0,                       only had a couple of days  but enjoying it so far  sold my xbox one controller with my console  and using it primarily for pc  like the xbox one controller it gets detected fine in windows steam  actually as a xbox one controller   the usb c port is a nice new touch instead of micro usb  textured grips  triggers  and bumpers feel really good all buttons feel responsive and good  kind of lackluster share button for pc and i wish there was an easy way to rebind this d pad feels really great and tactile and all buttons have a nice click activation feel  however the big issue with the d pad is the noise  it s so clicky and loud  considering it feels good to use and time might wear out the volume a bit it s not a huge deal to me but i do miss the less annoying d pad of the controller this replaced last thing to note is it actually feels a bit better in hand than the xbox one controller for smaller hands  not sure what they changed but it s more comfortable for me time will tell on durability  volume of buttons  and build quality  first impressions are positive though  not much different than the standard xbox one s x controllers  but the small changes to things like d pad  textured triggers  usb c  and other minor changes are a positive in my book      
62,1.0,                       absolutely nothing wrong with this controller    days ago i bought this at full price  they are now on sale for    dollars reached out to amazon support for a credit and they refused to give me one  will be looking at other retailers in the future when buying electrons        
63,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          disconnects constantly on pc  i had zero connectivity issues ever with my xbox one controller  but i got tired of resyncing between xbox and pc when i wanted to swap platforms  so i bought this to be a dedicated pc controller and i m very disappointed so far  internet searches reveal this to be a common issue  and if it doesn t get addressed soon this thing is going back  i ve had it for two days and the disconnections started immediately   i will edit this review if a solution is found edit  i think i found a fix  but time will tell  i updated the controller s firmware  didn t fix it   updated an  optional  bluetooth driver in windows  didn t fix it   then i got mad and went scorched earth and unpaired the device entirely  went into device manager and deleted the device and drivers for the windows default xbox     controller  then when i went to repair the controller it popped up a very specific xbox wireless controller with a series of numbers after it and not just xbox wireless controller and it seems to be working now  i just played for like a half an hour with zero disconnections  i will be editing my   star review to   stars at this time  because the controller feels good  analog sticks and triggers are great   but i can t give it higher because of the inherent connectivity issues      
64,3.0,                       the battery cover that came with my charging station does not fit this device  both devices were made by microsoft  but the battery cover is not compatible  since i have to remove the battery cover every time i want to charge my controller  there is a good chance that i will lose it      
65,1.0,                       this isn t not product that was advertised  i ordered a used core controller  the vendor gave me this   a xbox one controller  yes it s completely compatible with the new and older xbox generation  however it s not the product i ordered  absolutely garbage in my opinion      
66,2.0,                       the controller overall  feels  high quality but in actuality it isn t  i dropped the controller from   feet   m  once and now the rb button doesn t work      of the time  the older controllers were straight up better made as this controller hasn t lasted   year ps  i have carpet floors     
67,5.0,                       a fine remote     
68,5.0,                       i bought this after the controller that came with my xbox started drifting pretty badly  and it felt like a new system   haha   the d pad is a little cooler looking and it s usb c  so make sure you have one of those as well  buy it if you need it      
69,5.0,                       i like all the changes they made to the new controller  this review is by a pc gamer  i ve never actually had an xbox  the triggers are a matte hard rubber black texture with small bumps  they are much easier to press down and the texture feels way better  the one x had weird slippery plastic bumpers and triggers that made games that use the bumpers a lot  for example  dark souls  a bit less comfortable than a ps controller  the bumper feedback is much more of a deep bump than the plasticy click of the old controller and i like it  the grips have a micro texture as well which makes that controller less slippery in that aspect as well  the circular directional pad with raised arrows are very clicky  much louder than the one x directional cross  most games just use the directional buttons for activating items  menus  etc  however i am not much of a fighting game player so i would read other reviews who might have stronger feelings about this change  type c cable instead of micro usb  that means faster charging if you buy the optional rechargeable battery pack  the controller is a tiny bit heavier  and feels solid  my old one x controller squeeks and crackles a little bit if i squeeze the controller  the series x makes no audible noise from strongly squeezing the grips  i would say the build quality got an upgrade  but we will have to see if that lasts with age use so yeah  i d say it s a straight upgrade  but it s not so different that you need to rush out and buy a new one right away     weird note  for whatever reason the controller had all kinds of small dust particles on the outside  fresh from the sealed box  i don t know why that was  but it came right off so it might just be a warehouse thing      
70,2.0,                       controller is nice but rechargeable battery pack from old xbox one controller won t fit in this one  why is that  did i miss it in the description        
71,1.0,                       terrible product  was a gift  not used until   months after purchase because it was for xmas  broke in   weeks  missed the return window  now  stuck with a     defective item      
72,5.0,                    pues me gusto mucho el control y no tengo ning n problema asta horita lo recomiendo          
73,3.0,                       overall the controller feels a bit more sturdy than previous controllers but time will tell  every other xbox controller has failed me after a year or so and of course they don t replace them under warranty my reason for     stars is because most of the buttons are unnecessarily loud  yxba buttons and the d pad are just really annoying  i don t understand why they would do this  the feedback is good but all the clicking is just a huge turnoff  playing rdr  for example  when you have to constantly tap a to ride your horse gets old after a while and it s even worse with a loud button i may end up returning it but it might be fine for driving games where you re using the triggers a lot more than the other buttons  really disappointing      
74,1.0,                       i got carbon black and it came in with an xbox series x box  but to my surprise  there was no series x controller  i was given an xbox one controller instead of a series x and i m pissed  the only reason i haven t returned it is because i needed this controller to play rdr  and returning things are scary      
75,5.0,                       this is a good remote  exactly what you would expect  no issues     
76,5.0,                       this is a great controller  so much better than the original xbox one controllers  and they work together on the same adapter  now my girlfriend is going to get one  great purchase and upgrade  lighter but feels better  responsiveness is top notch  i will be getting another one      
77,5.0,                       my son loves  loves  loves this controller  he is   yrs old but still a little kid at heart      
78,5.0,                       awesome durable well built controller   all the controls work fantastic      
79,5.0,                       excellent  beat controller they ve made outside of the elite series warning  this controller is noticeably smaller in the hand  if you were using a     one controller due to the size  it ll throw you off for a while      
80,1.0,                       do not buy this controller for pc  bluethoot connection drops every   minutes for no apparent reason  tried with   different xbox series x controllers  all showed the same problem and it seems the only solution is to get a wireless adapter sold separetely for      avoid for pc  get another brand and save your money      
81,5.0,                       picked this controller on cyber monday for      worth every penny  very light controller  lighter then the standard xbox one controller  nd generation  very nice feel  very good rubberized grip as well  recommend this      
82,2.0,                       bought a new controller and everything works it looks like someone messed with it dirt or skin on it and has scuff damage on it      
83,5.0,                       super comfortable and worked great     
84,1.0,                       this controller is part of a gift  i was very annoyed to find that such an expensive controller would arrive in a beat up and ripped box  how embarrassing to present this as a gift      
85,5.0,                       first thing to do as you get the controller make sure that you update the controller s firmware through the xbox accessories app from the microsoft store so you can install the latest firmware update for the controller  once done  it will work better on your pc especially when using the steam client  when you have the latest update installed  just remove the xbox wireless controller device from the bluetooth devices menu on your pc and then pair it back to get it up and running now to the review as i opened the box and held the controller into my hands for the first time i was already hooked  the older xbox controllers were great  but they added a few improvements that makes the series x s controller better the controller feels much better in the hands since it s a tiny bit smaller than it s predecessors  there s now a share button that gives you the option to record gameplay and take screenshots with just a single button press  the hybrid directional pad fells so nice when you press on it due to it s louder clicky sounds that it makes while gaming  i just love the strong feedback that it gives which you can hear and feel  the textured grips along the controller s side handles and triggers makes the experience just even better  this is just a fantastic comfortable controller to hold while your playing games on your tv screen  computer monitor  or phone screen with a gaming clip as your playing thru the xbox game pass application overall  the new xbox series x s controller is a nice improvement than it s older counterparts without microsoft ruining anything from it  but has added some tweaks to the controller that the user would love        
86,5.0,                       two months later and i m still happy with the quality of this controller      
87,1.0,                       a great feeling controller but for some reason it will randomly turn off and on which negatively effects my experience by either cutting out game audio or party chat audio on my wired headset  maybe i got a faulty one because i ve never had this issue in the past      
88,5.0,                    excelente producto buena calidad          
89,5.0,                       this controller is amazing  the grip  everything  it s so smooth and it feels amazing  doesn t feel cheap at all  though it can be a little hard to hook up  but over all           
90,5.0,                       works as expected  only complaint is how it was shipped to me  in a flimsy bubble wrap envelope instead of a small box  luckily it wasn t mishandled in shipping      
91,4.0,                       works great  only issue is the directional pad isn t sensitive enough and have to really tap it to make it work  at least i m not getting any drift with it  this is only my  th xbox controller in about    years that doesn t have that issue  no major complaints     
92,5.0,                       have had them about   weeks with bo issues      
93,3.0,                       maybe my expectations are high because i ve been using my elite   controller a lot lately  but even this controller feels cheap and plasticky compared to my two white xbox one s controllers and my black xbox one x controller  it feels a lot more like the cheap original xbox one controller  however  it makes up for this with a slightly better d pad  share button  textured grip and triggers  and suppposedly lower latency  however  i personally don t think this is worth the extra money unless you absolutely need an extra controller  which i don t  i m contemplating on returning it      
94,1.0,                       so i bought this controller  i was super excited   when i got it the box was damaged  but no biggie  as long that the product is good  right   when i opened the box tje controller was dirty  it looked used   the battery compartment had battery marks and the triggers had dirt as if it was used for a time    that s not cool      
95,5.0,                       good     
96,5.0,                       excellent product  excellent price      
97,1.0,                       the trigger button broke on the first day of use     
98,3.0,                       so far so meh    controller keeps disconnecting randomly while i play  looks like i m not the only one with that issue and microsoft is aware of that  also looks like that s microsoft s way to sell their crappy     adapters  will update if i ll find a solution  without an adapter       
99,5.0,                       looks great and feels good to hold  no problems out the box so far  very similar to the regular xbox one controller  the textured grip feels nice  it also comes with a   week gamepass ultimate code      
100,5.0,                    estoy muy contento con este mando llaque mis dedos son muy peque os y antes ten a un poco de molestia con el mando de la xbox one s la sensaci n es bastante buena de muy buena calidad le dar    estreyas porque selomerese         
101,5.0,                       this controller is definitely a step up compared to the old xbox controllers  have excellent grip and smooth feedback  i haven t had any calibration issues with it that i normally get with the old controllers  excellent product      
102,5.0,                       great product     
103,5.0,                       my husband loves this  the grip for the back part is his favorite      
104,1.0,                       don t try to use bluetooth  it constantly disconnects and since i play co op i end up messing up a lot  use it wired  it s fine  the buttons feel cheap and the analogue sticks are way too sensitive making aiming annoying i don t recommend unless you re ok with an official substandard product that doesn t function as well as their own past devices  sometimes i wonder if this is even an official microsoft product      
105,4.0,                       i ve had this for   months now and the analog sticks haven t worn at all  seems a little better than the previous model      
106,2.0,                       the placement of the new share button is incredibly annoying  it will constantly try to upload game video clips from accidental button presses  this is on top of the controllers overall smaller size being slightly too small for full grown hands the new share button being dead center between and slightly below the old start and select buttons means it keeps getting accidentally pressed if you have larger hands  when this happens the controller automatically tries to upload a game clip to xbox live  this is incredibly annoying and there is no way to disable this function to keep the controller from trying to upload video clips when the share button is pressed  you can make the function a short or a long press in the controller app but that does not disable accidental uploads you can also disable uploads in your xbox settings menu  but this does not stop the controller itself from trying to upload video clips  you will simply get a pop up notification in the middle of your game that the video clip upload failed  over and over and over and over again you will see this message pop up in the middle of your game because of accidental share button presses this new controller is a step down from the old design      
107,5.0,                       very goon controller     
108,2.0,                       this controller keeps saying disconnected from the xbox  turns off by itself alot  we ve replaced the batteries with brand new ones each time thinking it was the batteries  sometimes it works flawlessly  but when it keeps disconnecting  it s annoying  it is synced  fresh batteries  brand new bought for christmas present  when it works  it s a nice controller and it works great  it s a hit or miss if it s going to act up every time we turn it on      
109,3.0,                       it s alright  but the rt tends to stick alittle     
110,5.0,                       the controller itself is great  seems a bit of a step up from the previous model  xbox one   it isn t a knock on the item itself  but keep in mind that if you are upgrading from a rechargeable set up on an xbox one controller that the battery cover with the charging slot is not interchangeable between old a new controllers  you will need a series x type battery cover      
111,2.0,                       i purchased the xbox one controller because i ve recently purchased a new windows    pc and needed a decent controller to game with  the reviews for the xbox one controller were decent on pc mag so i decided to purchase it  after reading the description of the product  per my screenshot  you can see it states that this controller is compatible with windows    pcs  unfortunately  after trying to sync the controller to my pc i realized it won t connect unless you have xbox wireless setup on your pc or you own the wireless adapter  which is ridiculous considering they don t state that in the description  i thought there might be some bluetooth capabilities with this controller  but still no connection if you re looking to purchase this controller to hook up with your windows pc  don t do it another issue  looking at the packaging you can obviously tell someone tried to put a seal where the seal should be  when i opened the package  the controller was moved around and all the pages weren t together  some were above the controller  others were under  it looks like this was used overall  i m very disappointed  if it wasn t for the fact that the xbox controllers were so ergonomic  i would have made the product rating one star      
112,1.0,                       aux port doesn t work  emailed seller twice about an exchange with no reply      
113,2.0,                       this controller constantly  disconnects   i get the notification about every five minutes to reconnect   i ve tried changing the batteries numerous times      
114,5.0,                       great controller     
115,2.0,                       i bought one of the new generation controllers for my xbox one  it was great at first but i ve only had the controller for two months and i m already experiencing sticky triggers  the right trigger on my controller sticks when pressing on it with force  something you usually see after a year or two of usage  really annoying and a disadvantage for any competitive player    i ve seen numerous complaints about this online with absolutely no response from microsoft  unacceptable      
116,5.0,                    sirve perfecto para xbox one        
117,1.0,                       update          dropping this review down to one star  still disconnects even two feet from the usb bluetooth device  i ve updated the bluetooth driver  windows     and controller firmware  none of it appears to work i bought this controller to play games on the pc  connecting the controller initially wirelessly was a breeze but it kept disconnecting  so i disabled my onboard bluetooth and switched to a pluggable closer to where i was sitting  that worked better but it still sporadically disconnects pros  it works well with the pc  games picks it up a lot easier than other controller s  it uses standard aa batteries which i personally really like because it means i don t have to keep it charged at all times  rechargeable aa batteries are cheap and plentiful plus batteries eventually die so it means longer life cons  compared to the nintendo switch pro controller the plastic feels cheaper  both controller s use hard plastic but the xbox controller definitely feels cheaper  as i mentioned above  bluetooth connection seems weak      
118,1.0,                       already on my  nd one and both disconnect constantly from xbox one      
119,5.0,                       its good     
120,1.0,                       the bluetooth for the controller does not work  plus the controller came as a used package  marks everywhere  i got this while it was on sale and had to return  but i would definitely not recommend this at the full price      
121,1.0,                       the controller was working fine up until the close return deadline  now the controller seems to be deactivated and will not sinc up to my xbox  what a coincidence  not  i didnt spend     dollars for just   months  the product is extremely misleading dont buy  unless ur prepared to buy another i would recommend getting one from an actual game store      
122,1.0,                       two controllers in a row  right trigger sticks same day of delivery  might be looking to switch to ps if this is the direction the controllers are going      
123,5.0,                       although there s been a lot of buzz  and rightfully so  around the new dualsense ps  controller  microsoft decided to take a very different approach from sony  meaningful  iterative improvements to an already solid base  the first version i ever used  model       was the best controller i had ever used up to that point  it was the primary reason i switched from my xb     as i was unable to pair it with the console  but the controller was too good to go back  clicky  responsive buttons  lighter weight  easily accessible battery door  good battery life  solid accuracy and excellent haptic feedback in the triggers made me fall in love  jump to the next model  the       and all those things remained  but there was a different finish and now the awesome addition of bluetooth  this has been the controller i ve used on console and pc for the better part of   straight years  i ve even tried to pair it with a couple sony systems to experience some of the better games exclusive to that platform  i was unsuccessful btw   now  introduce this model  the       and i feel like it s   steps forward and a step backwards  the d pad is outrageously good and responsive  the trigger texturing gives a more involved feel  the matte finish makes it less vulnerable to oils or greases making it slippery and the battery door redesign is a very slight but meaningful touch  even the added feature of showing the battery level on pc is a tiny detail that shows the thoughtfulness that went into crafting this  the only reason this is not a   is the connectivity  full disclosure  this is primarily used with a pc in this use case  and as such  you will need the xbox accessories app  as i needed to apply an update fresh out the box  the bluetooth connection on my      literally never dropped out in my entire memory of use  extremely strong  very dependable and no lag to speak of  the       not so much  there s been no observable lag  and when it works  it s easily better  but the connection is very spotty  as mentioned  an update was necessary right out of the box  and performance marginally improved  but as it stands  during a   hr play session last night it lost connection at least    times  with the xbox light blinking a few times and going solid again roughly every    mins or so  i tried multiple games  including very tight shooters and it s the same thing  excellent performance when it s working  a temporary drop for no more than   seconds  then back to working as if nothing happened  i ve already gone the driver route of making sure everything is updated correctly  but this seems to be more a      problem  as the      has never had this problem with a console or   different pcs with   different bluetooth adapters  funny though  a wireless adapter is available  and is touted as the primary way to connect without a usb cable  the usb cable does work flawlessly btw   of course  there is a fee for this adapter  which makes me feel like this is the classic create a problem  sell the solution sort of scenario  which has soured my experience greatly here  this is a relatively new device  having only been on the market for a little over a month at the time of this writing  so it s definitely possible for this issue to be resolved  but there s currently no discount for this unit  so you re being asked the complete price for an incomplete experience for the time being  once  if  this issue is resolved  i will absolutely change this to a    but right now  with the drops  it s a mediocre purchase at best  with the      currently being a better option  and at a lesser price  best of luck edit  in order to have the update applied  you must first connect to the pc with your usb c and use the xbox accessories app to update  then  most importantly  you must unpair the controller if it was previously paired  if it s the first time pairing  it won t be an issue  but if you previously were paired before the update  it will not apply  after following these steps  i can confidently report all connection issues have been fixed  and there have been no bluetooth drops to speak of  this is now a   star device      
124,1.0,                       the controller s right thumb stick did not work properly  so i unfortunately had to return it      
125,5.0,                       bought this for my son  we use android phones and have tried other controllers this one works great      
126,5.0,                       i have tested this controller using w    no issues at all  i suggest to download  xbox accessories  to remap buttons in case it is necessary also this works in an android tv box to browse through folders  as well this works on retroarch for gaming  i had to remap buttons      
127,2.0,                       barley different from the xbox one controllers i ve already gotten stuck drift a few mouths into playing as well as loud buttons and a stick home button from day   definitely save your money and get the xbox one controller     
128,3.0,                       controller feels great but compatibility with windows    is lacking  even after updating the controller firmware and the os      
129,1.0,                       fake xbox one controller  can t use charger to charge it  a piece of plastic blocking input changer of the controller  the photos comparison of both controller labels are different too      
130,5.0,                       came dusty even though it was sealed   maybe it is cardboard particles  controller works great  i highly recommend updating it  if you are only using it on pc and ios like i am  then download the xbox accessories app on the pc  then connect a usb c cable to controller   pc  easy enough and fixes laggy input from the original firmware the controller feels great and is much more comfortable than the ds  i switched from thanks for reading      
131,2.0,                       ordered black showed up blue  no biggie  have had this controller about a month left trigger already sticks pretty bad  has trouble staying connected to the console and even turns my xbox off randomly sometimes  also dose not seem to be compatible with my turtle beach audio voicechat mixer   volume works mixer does not  never buying core again     
132,4.0,                       it s compatible with xbox one and overall way better the only flaw here is the packaging came in a paper bag and the box of the controller was badly damaged     
133,2.0,                       mainly it s just an ordinary controller but cheaper controller feels hollow  like the typical controllerthe share button  which can not be disabled   extremely annoying when your accidentally hitting the button and captures   screen shots go wild also it does not come with a usb c cable also having trouble with the audio adapter connected to the controller  all sound will randomly cut out for nearly    sec  maybe the adapter but never had that problem before     i waited nearly a month for this         
134,5.0,                       works great on steam games and other applications wired  also the new feel of the controller is amazing  i ve never liked xbox controllers before but this one is amazing in feelings and fit  it would be   stars if the bluetooth worked  its responsive but the lt and rt don t register in bluetooth  when that gets fixed with drivers or updates easy   star edit  as i said once they did the updates it would be   stars  they did it pretty quickly like it was out before i even noticed     
135,5.0,                       got what expect     
136,2.0,                       controller keeps disconnecting from xbox losing all button function and audio through the headset  buttons work fine the rest is trash and i am within   feet of my console      
137,2.0,                       my controller is not charging and not turning on  im not satisfied with this outcome     
138,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i bought this new controller and it s already messed up     
139,3.0,                       the controller feels great   my biggest complaint is the non standard design of the battery cover   i bought a dual power station that came with   batteries that are attached to the cover   the batteries fit perfectly into the controller that comes with the xbox one  but with this one having a non standard size cover  it will not fit so thus i m stuck with trying to find another solution      
140,4.0,                       xbox controllers are always good feeling in the hand but this one lacks and feels cheap  it works and is a upgrade to the one i was using but random low batteries disconnects and cheap feeling plastic makes me want to buy a older model  if it didnt work and or was a upgrade i would rate this less  the usb type c is a nice option      
141,1.0,                       microsoft changed the design to limit  rd party accessories from working with it  they moved the contact points for battery packs so all older designs no longer work  am considering returning it and getting a pair of  rd party controllers   had the original controller swiped  i am again disappointed with microsoft      
142,3.0,                       it is a great controller    but expect it to come   days late     
143,4.0,                       controller is quality unit  but it is not compatible with some of the accessories so do your research      
144,1.0,                       the bluetooth just doesnt work  i tried on several devices  garbage controller  also  it takes batteries but atleast they are included      
145,5.0,                       it s incredibly responsive  being to fluidly be connected from my pc to my xbox in a matter of moments with the new design and texture helping out alot     
146,1.0,                       box came damaged and the controller disn t work     
147,1.0,                       controller constantly randomly disconnects     
148,5.0,                       a gift for my brother  shipped very quickly and does what it is supposed to do      
149,2.0,                       older xbox controllers are better     
150,1.0,                       battery cover is different than xbox one controller so your rechargeable battery  does not fit with a cover on it unless you use a dremel and  modify  the cover for this one to fit rechargeable batterys  next    it keeps disconnecting  not powering off  just disconnecting temporarily   from xbox one randomly unless it s pointed right at the device   super annoying   all in all the compatibility with xb  sucks      
151,1.0,                        cons  what a great paperweight  it s      who the f wants batteries to be the norm  disconnect issues  compatibility issues need i say more  pros  perfect grip for throwing  sleek black design is hardly noticeable sitting in the shadows of the damaged controller box      
152,1.0,                       i ordered two of these both of them are messed upthey both have something weird with the bluetooth connection    the black one just always randomly starts blinking while i am playing trying to connect so i can t move and i die  the white one is the same issue it would randomly just disconnect or act like i was pushing a bunch of buttons when i was only pushing a or b not every button at once  now it just blinks and never connects at all it s just barely past the return window super dumb in my opinion these controllers are whack     i d give no stars if i could     
153,1.0,                       the first controller had a trigger sticking after one month  the second controller had the left bumper fail after   months  i like the design but the quality on this is horrible  the first one i was able to return but this next one i might not be able to return  i am playing on pc and i had been using an old wii u controller i had laying around the house  and it still works after all these years  what s the deal with this controller  isn t this basically the same design as the xbox one controller  microsoft you should have figured out the quality by now      
154,4.0,                       box was already opened and slightly damaged  looks like refurbished item  sender is not microsoft controller seems fine and was delivered with batteries haven t tired controller yet but the controller looks good      
155,5.0,                       the controller feels great in the hands  it s very sturdy with an awesome grip feeling  the texture along the handles definitely adds a more firm feel to it  with the windows update and controller firmware update it connects to bluetooth and functions properly      
156,4.0,                       i bought this for pc gaming  due to it having native bluetooth support it feels a lot like the previous xbox controller  with some differences  the d pad feels more clicky and tactile  and the shoulders bumpers have a dotted texture  the shoulders  bumpers  and d pad are no longer glossy but are matte  which i appreciate  everything else feels the same as the previous one  possibly the perfect controller the only reason i m giving this   stars and not   is because the bluetooth compatibility is still kinda wonky  at the time of writing this review  this controller does not work with the steam link device over bluetooth  only through wired usb connection  it also has some issues when connecting to a windows pc over bluetooth  it ll work with some games  and not with others  it works fine with a wired connection though      
157,2.0,                       controller came on time but it was opened  package was compromised somewhere along the way  they took the batteries out   well the picture says it all     
158,5.0,                       very smooth transaction       
159,1.0,                       like the controller but continues to shut off while i m playing  not sure why  i tried switching the battery pack and nothing changed  very disappointing     
160,1.0,                       luckily my son got a controller from a grandparent cause the controller we received from here the controller joystick was broken  so we needed to return      
161,2.0,                       i had this controller delivered in mid november of       it is now february  nd of      and both of my control sticks drift upward sharply  non stop input  and if you play smite  picture your camera panning up to your character s butt facing the sky within   seconds of you not actively controlling it  while also struggling to recall because your character keeps moving until you finagle the stick into true neutral  the cause of this  i dropped the controller one single time  it was about a foot and a half onto carpet  landing on its side  it didn t even land on the face of the controller  that one single miniscule impact fall now has both of my control sticks permanently out of alignment and a nonstop nuisance also  as other reviews have stated  bluetooth on these controllers is complete junk  it s annoying to set up  including needing to be wired in the first place to do that  so good luck if your controller didn t come with an adequate cable  and doesn t work properly  my controller reads every main face button  a b x y  as an input of two different buttons and no amount of configuration in the accessories app could fix it  in addition to the control stick reading a constant diagonal movement that leads to my character in smite or fighting games constantly spinning in a circle  i had to use a bluetooth adapter dongle my brother gave me to make the controller behave  and then the small drop happened and it s now useless for fighting games and a nuisance on smite anyway this controller lasted me less than   months and required a purchase of additional hardware to use  do not buy it if you re not specifically in need of one for use with the series x  the only reason i m not giving it a   star is because the controller itself feels like an improvement over the previous xbox controller due to increased weight  a better gripped back surface  and a significant improvement on the directional pad      
162,5.0,                       this pretty good  it s well designed and of good quality definitely better than the last model      
163,5.0,                       incredible  as always  the texture of the grips make this   stars by itself     
164,1.0,                       after a week of playing the controller has stick drift complete waste of money     
165,5.0,                       didn t realize there was a newer model with a share button   this is pretty cool      
166,2.0,                       ordered this from amazon as i had a white remote didn t suit my color scheme for my pc so i m using that for an xbox  got it today package was clearly not great ok i can deal  open it and this dust wth    not happy do better      
167,5.0,                       as described and arrived on time      
168,5.0,                       best controller their is  that s why they won awards lol     
169,2.0,                       left stick drift after   months      
170,5.0,                       i really like this controller  it just fits to your hand  it has stippled grips on the back so it does not fall out of your hands easily  joysticks also are very nice      
171,1.0,                       when you are able to connect by bluetooth the controller dose not work properly     
172,4.0,                       very solid  can handle a lot of gaming      
173,3.0,                       big improvement from original model  works with phone and pc  packaging came damaged but looks like controller is fine     
174,5.0,                       works amazing     
175,2.0,                       it is damaged     
176,5.0,                       new controller  functions just as it should     
177,1.0,                       what a total waste of money   this controller almost makes me want to trash anything i have that has microsoft and switch over to sony   absolute garbage is the best and only way to describe this controller   i am much more reluctant to get the new xbox now if this is how the controllers are going to be      
178,5.0,                       works like oem controller     
179,5.0,                       i love this controller grip feels better  feels slightly more compact and heavier than the last controller  buttons are slightly clicky  but less so than say  a nintendo joycon i ran into one issue initially  when connecting via bluetooth  windows only recognized it as a  d input  controller  and the triggers didn t respond  i applied the firmware update  still nothing i saw it was recommended to update to the newest version of windows     the   h  update  once i did  the controller shows as an x input controller not sure if it is just my imagination  but this thing is fast  i could usually perceive the slightest input lag with bluetooth controllers  now it also feels like it s responding a millisecond before i even complete the button press      
180,1.0,                       hurts finger   analogs have no cushion  stuck left trigger and today my aux input quit working  its   months old and i made it my mission to never drop it      
181,1.0,                       terrible controller  buttons are stuck  not even had it   weeks  poor craftmanship      
182,5.0,                       arrived on time  the box was a little dented but nothing to major and the controller works exactly as it should looks almost brand new and it s cheaper then the one s controllers it s a steal  i will be buying from this company again     
183,5.0,                       the controller was a big upgrade it feels nice     
184,5.0,                       there s nothing i would change about this controller  it performs well whether i m playing a first person shooter or an rpg  it s not too small or too large  and the textured grip on the back is great      
185,2.0,                       i love the new size of this controller and the bluetooth compatibility with windows    worked great  however  the textured grip is aggressive and off putting  the sticks feel cheap and like i m rubbing the plastic off the controller when using them  and the rumble feedback sounds feels like a massive  cheap step backwards  i can now see why everyone has been saying they prefer the new ps  controller over this cheap feeling thing for a controller i had been waiting to get my hands on  i am massively disappointed  guess i ll just keep using my xbox one controller      
186,1.0,                       the remote has the same functionality as my previous ones   got it on december   st  yesterday i noticed a small hairline crack in controller s shell and today it keeps getting bigger  a brand new remote      
187,5.0,                       the controller works great with pc  however  out of the box the bluetooth feature does not play well with steam  in order to get it to work  there are a few steps you ll have to do    download the xbox accessory app on the microsoft store    connect the controller with a usb c cable   update the controller   pair with windows bluetooth devices   start steam and it should recognize it as xbox series x one controller   a   if you paired it before doing these steps  like me   follow steps      then go to  bluetooth devices  remove the device and repair it  then it should work with no issue build  the controller itself is very sturdy and has nice textured grips on the back as well as the triggers  size is pretty similar to previous xbox controllers battery  i can t really comment on battery life since i just got it but i would imagine many of you will have some form of rechargeable battery wireless  i haven t had any issues since pairing it nor experience any types of interference with my other wireless peripherals  the range seems good  i m roughly   ft away from my tv desktop overall  it s a much better controller then my ps  controller  it plays well with windows    as one would hope and once setup with steam the buttons are automatically mapped      
188,5.0,                       works good     
189,5.0,                       this was so much better than expected  my son was super impressed  i was expecting the basic xbox controller out xbox one but apparently it s the newer version  and he was ranting about the updated style and buttons  and how much smoother it worked  it connected effortlessly with our system      
190,5.0,                       i bought this item for my son and it works perfectly  he loves it      
191,1.0,                       needed a new controller for my computer  so naturally i go for an xbox controller  my new controller that i ordered  has joystick drift right out of the box  no amount of calibration will fix it  honestly i m super disappointed in this new controller model  gonna have to try and get it replaced      
192,1.0,                       controller disconnects about every       minutes      
193,1.0,                       controller fell asleep randomly  and didn t work properly     
194,5.0,                       thank so much  i was so tired of using a wired controller  it feels great in my hands and works great      
195,1.0,                       do not buy     stars doesn t stay connected  so forced to stay hardwired  so now i ve got a battery pack i can t use  and i ve got to stay tethered to my console like it s       console update and controller update didn t help  it s actually gotten worse since then oh  and then amazon immediately put it on a huge sale right after the rest of us paid full price pre ordering something that doesn t even work properly  awesome      
196,5.0,                       as expected     
197,5.0,                    sin quejas  muy comodo  se adapta perfectamente a la mano y es bastante mejor la calidad que la generacion anterior         
198,5.0,                       love the refinements   just make sure to clean the controller at least once a week since the textured surface make crevices for dirt and dead skin and whatever else to get into      
199,4.0,                       a bit pricey for what it is  a standard xbox controller  no bells  no whistles  it just works can only imagine these are churned out by the thousands in a chinese factory at minimal cost  lets pass those savings on microsoft      
200,2.0,                       controller worked perfectly for the first    days  then the left analog stick lost all sensitivity  will only register as being pushed forward approximately     of the time   never dropped the controller and light use during the period i had it      
201,5.0,                       best controller microsoft has ever made     
202,5.0,                       product delivered on time exactly what i bought     
203,4.0,                       i purchased this controller because i bought a gaming laptop but wanted to be able to use a controller when i was traveling to make things a bit easier  i bought this controller for that purpose and was excited that it could be used via bluetooth on pc  i was able to get the controller connected to my pc via bluetooth but proceeded to have issues with games recognizing it as a controller  the main one being warzone  i have given this product   stars because while it does connect to pc it s use is limited without the xbox one wireless adapter for pc which is another      once i received the adapter and paired them together the games i was having issues with will now recognize the controller if you intent to use this on pc i would highly suggest that you get the adapter regardless in order to prevent the same frustration as well as have improved reaction time the wireless adapter has over bluetooth      
204,5.0,                       bought this for ace combat   on the pc  just installed the xbox accessories app and updated the device    all the controls work perfect except for the vibration  but i read somewhere that is the game s fault      
205,5.0,                       as expected arrived on time and just what we wanted for the xbox     
206,5.0,                       i love it     
207,1.0,                       bluetooth mode keeps going in and out  package was a disaster when it came in as well      
208,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i ll start this off with what i don t like  it s design does not support rechargeable extended battery packs  why  because there are two holes at top of controller where the battery packs have tabs that help it click in that do not line up correctly  rechargeable battery packs are useless on this  controller  even if you are able to click the battery pack in place  as i tweaked mine to do  the controller won t even turn on  the terminals do not connect  i ve tried   different rechargeable battery packs and same issue with all of them  the battery packs work great on standard xbox controllers  such as the ones from microsoft or the ones that came with the xbox  but do not work on this controller which is incredibly annoying  i don t like using batteries  i have rechargeable battery packs for a reason as so many others do as well who will also find this controller useless  so  unless you don t care to use the rechargeable battery packs you ll be good with standard batteries  but if your like me  you ll be left frustrated   highly disappointed because other than that the controller seems to be made well   feels great in the hand    stars    that s what this controller gets    almost a   star    very disappointed      
209,3.0,                       great controller  but the drifting in the joysticks is awful  every two weeks i have to do a hard reset of all my hardware to make the controller do its job  i had a      xbox controller see weekly use for   years before it needed to be replaced  i see myself replacing this controller in the next year shame      
210,4.0,                       should always come with a usb type c cord as it is needed for the controller  controller itself is good no complaints      
211,1.0,                       this lasted   months  waste of money  the right bumper will not work anymore  got it for my son for christmas      
212,4.0,                       i bought this extra controller for my kid s xbox gaming exploits so that she may share the joy of gaming with her sister  it works like a charm  her specific commentary did mention that the  buttons are loud   and the batteries die quickly  i purchased separately some rechargeable batteries so as to help lessen her impact on the environment      
213,1.0,                       headphone jack stopped working a month after i got it      
214,1.0,                       smh   controller was not ready to ship when they did so the firmware is outdated and does not work in windows      now i have to order a cable in order to hook it up to xbox accessory app and upgrade the firmware  just to be able to use it wirelessly in a microsoft o s   so stupid   steam is already lit up with complaints also does not work with existing battery backs   the battery cover is slightly different than the xbox series s controllers   my series s works in win   just fine still  but the left analog stick is as sloppy as a loose tooth      
215,5.0,                       grandson  says this works great  packing should have been better  box was crushed but it still works      
216,5.0,                       it s a controller     
217,3.0,                       it works but it doesn t bluetooth to the cell phone which was one of the main reasons i bought it other than that it works good      
218,5.0,                       it s a remote for xbox one  it works      
219,1.0,                       the controller came  looked good  but it doesn t work  total waste     
220,5.0,                       good value     
221,4.0,                       i love this controller it feels nice in your hands we like the screenshot button but of course every time they upgrade a gaming system or phone they change the plugs the battery packs and everything else so it is not interchangeable with any charging system or battery packs we already have for the rest of our controllers for xbox one so we had to go out and buy all special charging cables and new battery packs and controller backs for this one controller i honestly wish i just would ve bought another xbox one controller     
222,5.0,                       works fine        
223,1.0,                       this is a great product  however  can not play mindcraft on the iphone with it  the reason we bought it     
224,1.0,                       disconnects from the console      
225,3.0,                       if you don t have a usb c cable don t bother  i also recommend you get a chargable battery with this as well  i don t recommend you pay extra usb c that comes with this  overall though controller feels great in my hands alougth the bumper buttons feel a bit stiff and the d pad really ain t great for classic games      
226,1.0,                       x button broke within a week of normal use overall its a good controller but that one problem ruined it     
227,5.0,                    le gust  mucho a mi hijo y abuen precio m s barato que entiendas de video juegos        
228,3.0,                       this controller is absolutely awesome   i love the xbox elite features that they infused into the regular xbox controller  very well done  however  when i received the package  it was obviously opened  in the picture with the tape  the tape is only scotch tape  it was actually  sealed  when i got it  i was very disappointed with this part of the order  the product is amazing  though      
229,1.0,                         stars based on inaccurate description   i was under the impression that i was purchasing a new item but instead received a product that has clearly been opened and used      
230,5.0,                       great      
231,5.0,                       requires xbox one x style rechargeable batteries   they are of different design from bone one controller   good otherise     
232,5.0,                       good     
233,5.0,                       works well  our original one lasted for   yrs with constant daily play      
234,2.0,                       box came destroyed had no fragile labels or anything indicating there s a breakable item inside i just received it so lets hope it even works correctly i hope i didn t get used item when i paid for it new     
235,4.0,                       got it on time but the tape looked tempered with and the inside was unorganized and dusty     
236,5.0,                       controller works great  like the rubberized grip underneath feels good on the hands      
237,5.0,                       great     
238,3.0,                       cant use mobile roblox when i connect to the controller      
239,5.0,                       the controller works good even for my xbox one x smaller controller feels pretty comfortable would recommend if looking for new puddle      
240,5.0,                       that s all folks  cmon man  its xbox controller is the best controller ever      
241,5.0,                       i love the updates they ve made to this from the classic  the texturing is in all the right places  the stouter shoulder buttons make trigger finger less of a issue and the paddle d pad has super tactile and audible response  this is by far the best controller i ve ever held  it s got a lot of the features of the      pro controller at half the price      
242,5.0,                       great product makes pc feel like an xbox one     
243,5.0,                       ok     
244,2.0,                       box arrived all beat up and in bad condition not really happy because it was for a christmas present      
245,2.0,                       be aware  the new xbox core controller  every type  has a severe issue with triggers sticking  especially after a good amount of use  this makes games with precision trigger action absolutely impossible  ridiculous problem to have on such an expensive controller  i ve now owned two from two different stores and returned both of them      
246,4.0,                       the controller requires a day one update    did they really just reuse the xbone stuff      
247,1.0,                       why in the world microsoft and xbox one batteries arent compatible is beyond me  now i have a fortune in worthless rechargeable batteries that do fit all the other xbox one controllers      
248,5.0,                       bought this controller on launch day   at first  was only able to get the controller to work in windows    with steam using a usb c cable   i downloaded the xbox accessories app from the windows store and updated the controller firmware   then  i fully updated windows     rebooted my laptop  and removed and re added the controller via bluetooth   bluetooth works fine now in windows    and steam   i like the matte finish of the controller   also  i like the textured triggers   button clicks are a little loud   would have been nice to have a usb c cable included but i have a few cables laying around   after a little struggle with the setup  i like the feel of this controller      
249,5.0,                       works great     
250,5.0,                       feels great and works awesome      
251,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          garbage  will not take any rechargeable battery in uts battery casing  not a brand new rechargeable battery  not any rechargeable battery from other controllers  the battery area is too small for any known rechargeable battery pack i own including the new ones i bought  its not the batteries      the new ones fit all other xbox controllers in this house     
252,5.0,                       it works great looks great just as expected  thank you     
253,2.0,                       started randomly power cycling after only a couple weeks  new d pad is great but otherwise you might be better off with an older xbox one controller      
254,3.0,                       it was easy to set up  but disconnects randomly and repeatedly while using      
255,2.0,                       xbox controlleritdoes not work after two monthsvery upset      
256,5.0,                       nice     
257,3.0,                       it feel like it was made with cheap parts  i ve been using an xbox controller since     on pc  compared to my last controller xbox one controller  i don t see anything new other than a new share button      
258,5.0,                       works perfect with my xbox   feels nice in hand     
259,5.0,                       love it      
260,3.0,                       at first the controller was nice and tight  but as all xbox controllers within a week it already is drifting  i thought microsoft was fixing this issue after their lawsuit because of their controllers doing exactly this  guess if you want one that lasts more then a week you need to buy a playstation  to bad you need a sub par system to have a good controller     
261,5.0,                       buttons a little louder than last year  no big deal     
262,4.0,                       i love the feel of the controller  and most everything about it  but  y button had a couple of dead spots  and was unresponsive tapping it quickly  also  the right d pad button made a funny noise when pressed  will have to send it back  and hopefully get a better one  will gladly give this a   star review if the replacement works well      
263,5.0,                       it s awesome     
264,5.0,                       as a picky pc gamer i absolutely recommend this controller for anyone considering getting one for general gaming  first person shooters  yes  i know theres a keyboard and mouse  and  d platforming  i m no pro fighting game guy so can t say if i d recommend for that but i don t see why it wouldn t be a good optioni see the battery compartment as a big plus as this prevents long term head aches changing a li ion battery  if you are into recharging that way you can get the replaceable li ion battery plus   foot cable and you are set bluetooth connectivity and wired are super easy to set up and have great latency either way  the only downside is if you want to use wired headphones through your controller you have to use the windows wireless adapterthe texturized grip feels great and really does help with sweaty hands for example in intense multiplayer action or when trying to beat a particullarly tough foe in sekiro for example feel in hand is premium  there is no plastic play and squeaky sounds if you grip it hard like in previous models  it feels solid the dpad  front facing buttons and shoulder buttons are very tactile and give an audible feedback  wether or not you are into that is personal prefierence  for me its quite satisfying  i ve heard of cases where the y button is not very responsive but so far i have no such issues and thoroughly tested itoverall an excellent  stylish  comfortable  versatile controller  very easy to set up and with great compatibility around the board  that s why i give it a   out of       
265,2.0,                       the controller works  but the cover for the battery area isn t the correct one and will not close  if i could get a replacement  that would be great  but i seem to have no way to contact the seller to ask for this      
266,2.0,                       item worked great for the first    days   then all of the sudden for no reason  buttons stopped working        
267,1.0,                       i paid for an official microsoft device because i thought it would avoid flakiness unfortunately  this has not turned out to be true  i ve tried the controller on bluetooth  on multiple computers  i ve tried it with a new microsoft xbox wireless dongle  again on multiple computers  in all cases i ve been sitting within a few feet of the computer  so distance should not be a problem but  on bluetooth or xbox dongle  i ve found the same thing  the controller connection has drop outs   as evidenced by the controller indicator going into  flashing  mode for    seconds or so  this consistently happens every few minutes  which makes it painful to keep playing with it there seems to be no reasonable cause for  this  i use other bluetooth devices  e g   headsets  on the same computers at the same time  and do not experience drop outs with them      
268,1.0,                       if you just this controller with headphones plugged in  expect it to work fine for about   minutes  and then suddenly stop  fresh batteries  light still on  still says it s connected  but all the buttons and joysticks still stop working  the only solution is to turn it off and back on  or don t use headphones      
269,1.0,                       i bought this intending it to take the place of my no longer usable controller  upon opening  the controller itself was dusty  did not look new whatsoever  and once connected to xbox  after    minutes of setting up the bluetooth doesnt work  very dissapointed     
270,2.0,                       if you have rechargeable battery packs they will not fit  different design from other controllers      
271,5.0,                       exactly as advertised     
272,4.0,                       works really well as a controller  no complaints there  however  the bluetooth with it is really finnicky and sometimes just doesn t connect at all   i ve taken to using it wired to my pc  i have seen ways to supposedly fix the bluetooth for the controller  but haven t bothered trying anything out myself      
273,5.0,                       this is the only xbox controller i ll ever recommend at the moment  since it s the only one you ll need whether you re gaming on a xbox one   xbox series  pc or even a phone  this controller is literally plug and play and if you re using this on a pc or a phone you can connect it via bluetooth  it also includes battery      
274,5.0,                       my son loves this controller  he said that i have upped his xbox game since i hot it for him  he likes how lightweight it is compared to the traditionally controller and he like the grippers on it      
275,5.0,                       great up grade  thicker than original  might not fit your charging cradle if your cradle charges from the top of controller  was able to modify my charging cradle to widen it      
276,5.0,                       thanks fornthe controller  i was so necessary to have a new one  and i love it  xbox and amazon are the best     
277,5.0,                       just like the factory controller that came with the series x     
278,1.0,                       doesnt work at all box was damaged i paid for a new controller and it doesn t even work very mad     
279,5.0,                       love it      
280,3.0,                       it works  but after purchasing rechargeable batteries and a charging stand i was disappointed that the battery packs for the x box one s controllers do not fit this controller so i m reduced to one controller with  a rechargeable battery and this one     with aa batteries      
281,5.0,                       really nice controller  it has great grip for when you play a long time  would definitely buy again      
282,5.0,                       great controller love the texture on the grips   keeps the feel comfortable      
283,4.0,                       the battery compartment is shaped differently than previous versions so you won t be able to use the same rechargeable packs you will have to order a different set for the newer model   all in all its a good controller   it is sensitive to some cell phone signals and they can cause disruption and make your controller glitch  if you want better control i suggest a pro controller      
284,5.0,                       i order this item and when i saw the smile on my grandson face i know i did the right thing      
285,5.0,                       just a refresh of the xbox one s controller really  feels a little more comfortable and easier to wrap my hands around  buttons seem more pronounced  the tac grip is a nice touch especially on the triggers  i ll keep using my elite   but no guests will complain when i hand this one to them  used with windows    android      
286,3.0,                       this controller keeps disconnecting in the middle of a game      
287,5.0,                       bought this controller for my son for christmas  it s great quality and works perfectly with his xbox one  he loves it  would definitely buy another from here in the future      
288,2.0,                       just know this does not come with a cord     
289,1.0,                       the controller keeps disconnecting     
290,3.0,                       some controllers aim assist is bad on cold war     
291,1.0,                       stopped working after   months  cannot come to xbox anymore even after a full reset      
292,5.0,                       it works great my   yr old son is every happy with it    thanks so much     
293,1.0,                       this controller is great product and works just fine the problem is before i ordered it  it said it would be delivered before christmas and immediately after i placed the order it said it wouldn t get here until after christmas and it was supposed to be a christmas gift     
294,5.0,                       comfortable     
295,1.0,                       works for about    minutes then disconnects constantly every     seconds      
296,1.0,                       came with the box completely destroyed and the controller chipped and covered in dust  i payed        for this and demand a refund  ridiculous      
297,5.0,                       as advertised     
298,1.0,                       controller disconnects bought two of these type   tried update console and controller  new batteries     
299,4.0,                       what can i say  it works like it s supposed to  came with an xbox subscription promo    brand name copper and black batteries  and some terrible instructions  satisfactory packaging  though my box was slightly dented  there was zero damage to the contents    stars because i feel like the standard price of these products are inflated and predatory      
300,1.0,                       stop working after   months     
301,2.0,                       it appears to me that this controller has a slightly different battery box fit and it won t charge on older chargers   also  it doesn t work on my xbox s machine      
302,1.0,                       junk   constantly disconnects from xbox one   and i mean like every   seconds   no exaggeration      
303,1.0,                       this controller just stopped working     
304,5.0,                       perfect     
305,5.0,                                 
306,5.0,                       very happy  and pleased  with the product  was exactly what i was looking for  i give it    star rating      
307,5.0,                       shipping was a little slow but otherwise great  no issues this far  mine shipped from canada which shocked me  i live in wisconsin     
308,1.0,                       i bought the xsx version of this controller about a month ago and the left stick has horrible drift already  it s essentially unplayable  i never drop my controllers since i just leave them on my desk when i am done using them  i don t rage  i don t have death grip  i don t eat while playing  basically i have no idea what could have caused it  i am returning it later and ordering another one  hopefully it s not awful as well  i m not one to leave bad reviews  but   month  seriously  kind of makes me want a ps       
309,5.0,                       texturing of controler hand grips and triggers make a big difference  loved the new d pad  joy sticks are more strategically located  very nice updated controller      
310,1.0,                       the one star is only because of amazon s atrocious packing ability  the controller is somehow usable after the constant attack from a large box  the controller is a five star  this thing is probably the most durable controller on earth  it was pre bashed and survived  so all you gamer families out there  it s indestructible and toddlers can t beat the    pound box that body slammed this poor controller      
311,1.0,                       the controller worked for   days and quit working     
312,5.0,                       never go with the knock offs  buy the name brand  xbox anything is a very good product     
313,3.0,                       straight forward controller  it works and is comfortable   however  if you intend to use a previously bought rechargeable battery  you will need a new usb c cable   the controller doesn t accept the typical usb power cable and does not come with the new type of cord   it should      
314,4.0,                       the texture is great  i have always used a skin or grips  and until recently  those were all garbage  imo  except for dragon skinz iinm   i like that the charging port is now usb c  as i can now toss that basket full of micro usb cables  i don t care about the share button  but someone probably loves that  dpad definitely feels better  but i don t use it much in gameplay mainly  i m happy to have a working controller  and i m content with this one because of the preorder pricing  quick delivery  and i was able to get a refund for the defective controller i bought a few weeks back  take one of those factors out of the equation  and it s a lot less attractive purchase      
315,5.0,                       more dimples for grip on the sides and triggers  improved d pad  when i quit accidentally hitting the new center screen capture button all will be great      
316,5.0,                       good price  good buynothing bad to report     
317,1.0,                       control randomly disconnects and has poor build quality      
318,3.0,                       only had this controller for two months and the joy stick is already drifting  making it very hard to play anything      
319,5.0,                       super fast free delivery  great product what else is there to say      
320,5.0,                       honestly skeptical of controllers on amazon but this is great      
321,5.0,                       ok     
322,5.0,                       if it is not broken do not fix it      
323,2.0,                       it worked but it had a couple scratch when i got it  deep      
324,3.0,                       the letter buttons aren t very reliable when connected with bluetooth  when you hold one down  it only registers briefly  very frustrating  otherwise it s great      
325,5.0,                       good      
326,4.0,                       it works great for a used and resold controller couldnt be happier especially because the price was right     
327,5.0,                    funciona muy bien        
328,1.0,                       constantly disconnects from my windows    pc over bluetooth   makes it unusable   yes  i have updated the controller firmware and my bluetooth receiver is brand new and only  a couple feet away with direct line of sight  not having this issue with any other bluetooth devices      
329,5.0,                       so  it was a little dusty  probably from being in a warehouse buuut  its definitely new given how tight the buttons and joysticks are and the screenshot button in the middle is very much a nice addition     
330,3.0,                       hopefully it still works  box was damaged      
331,5.0,                       it s easy to say that this is probably the most comfortable controller i ve held yet  the form factor is very similar to its predecessor  there are slight  welcomed tweaks  the controller has a very responsive tactile clicky ness to it as well as a nice weight  the grip texture is back and better than before  there is a matte finish on the body  triggers and bumpers that feels so much better  especially with the addition of texture l and r triggers i m into microsoft s  if it ain t broke  don t fix it  approach with this one  no  it s not fancy  but it gets the job done  if you want fancy  there s a brand for that  the elite line of controllers but for us casuals  this is it right here stop reading  start gaming      
332,5.0,                       great controller  works great  looks good  and would recommend to anyone      
333,5.0,                       work properly connect easy     
334,4.0,                       not much to say really  it s an xbox controller  it feels good in your hands and does it s job  i ve only had it for probably a month and i m having issues with the headphone jack when i plug in my headphones      
335,5.0,                       i switch to this from my ps  controller and i don t regret it nice smooth analog sticks and i love the new d pad style the controller itself has some weight to it and i love that the texture on the back is way better then the original xbox one controller nice and easy to grip especially if you have big hands      
336,5.0,                       i don t use it personally  but i will say that my nephew loves it  i bought it as a gift to replace his wired controller  he has nothing but great things to say and i have yet to see him more excited about a gift      
337,5.0,                       this is also another great item love using it     
338,5.0,                       he spend all christmas day using the gamer     
339,5.0,                       works great and connects directly to my computer s bluetooth without adapter  also love the texture  size and grip  sam old take with upgraded comfort      
340,3.0,                       i received my delivery yesterday and used this controller for a few hours   i m satisfied with it thus far and i really like the texturing on the body and triggers   i am only using it on the xbox one s so i cant speak to anything related to pc compatibility but it works just as it should for me  the only problem i have is that i also bought rechargeable battery packs and i found out the hard way that   for whatever reason  the slots that the battery cover slide into are lined up differently from standard controllers to this one   it makes absolutely no sense to me  and renders my other purchase effectively useless   i didn t see anything in the description mentioning this and am very disappointed and it put a bad taste in my mouth  other than that it seems like a good controller      
341,2.0,                       awful controller constantly disconnects on my xbox   i regret buying this and i use my old controller still unless i m doing   player  makes a loud scratching noise so i had to turn off vibration also      
342,1.0,                       i was excited to receive my new controller as my prior one was broken  the controller arrived but then i found out it didnt ship with a cover for the batteries on the back of the controller  very disappointing and now a hassle to try to get a replacement controller or a refund      
343,5.0,                       my son is happy with the performance      
344,4.0,                       totally cool with its shape and handling specs but was bummed i can t use my rechargeable battery pack  the one that has a dual controller charger on stand  because the battery holder can t fit into the back of this controller  otherwise all good and came on time      
345,1.0,                       product is a knock off cannot use the rechargeable battery pack clips don t line up     
346,5.0,                       paired it over bluetooth to my pc  and games are much easier than keyboard   i suspect this will work with my android tv as well      
347,5.0,                       great for shooter games  it helps control recoil from guns in games  the texture helps soooooooo much  definitely worth the money and great quality too  i bought this for my xbox one x and it wasn t connecting at first but it s because i had to connect it to the cable it comes with to the xbox so your xbox recognize it and updates it  don t give scared if it doesn t pair at first  but overall the controller is very good  it s original from xbox and it s worth the money      
348,5.0,                       brand new controller looks great havint tried it yet hopefully it makes me play better lol      
349,1.0,                       used controller  was sold as new  box had blemishes and looked worn  controller appeared to be wiped down with fibers all over it  dont let the microsoft name fool you  this merchant is selling used items as new  do not buy from them      
350,5.0,                       finally a controller that feels smooth and hopefully won t break every   months like the original xbox one controllers did      
351,1.0,                       complete garbage  absolutely minimal volume from the headset jack  totally useless if you use a headset  wtf       
352,3.0,                       controller is great  love the way it feels especially the textured triggers and bumpers  the only thing i have a problem with is that the  please reconnect controller  message keeps popping up while playing even though my battery is fully charged      
353,5.0,                       good gamepad  works fine      
354,1.0,                       do not buy  the controller was shutting off and turning on during cod matches during waiting time  i have downloaded and updated the controller and did not fix the issue  one match  i drifted to the left and could not move at all      
355,5.0,                       control works great  came with   batteries and    day game pass      
356,5.0,                       works much better than old one as described     
357,3.0,                       the controller works fine  it s disconnected from the xbox a few times randomly which is annoying  it feels a little cheap  it s fine but not great      
358,2.0,                       disconnects from the system all the time  can t even play one of my games because it disconnects every   seconds
