0,1.0,                       not a real hanes shirt   i can t believe this  i wear a lot of t shirt as soon as i open it i knew right away it s fake  it also doesn t feel like hanes t shirt     
1,3.0,                       i ve brought many products by this manufacture before  and they tend to run large  for for some reason this product initially fit nicely  but once it was washed it size reduced to be uncomfortable      
2,5.0,                       i generally wouldn t bother writing a review for plain  white t shirts but i was pleasantly surprised that these were a bit thicker and nicer material than i was expecting   we have other versions of this t shirt bought at a box store and the material isn t the same   so here i am writing a review for plain  white t shirts   these are nice   not sure why they would be different  but they are      
3,5.0,                       the last few years  i ve been disappointed with the hanes t shirts i bought  apparently  due to increased price of cotton  so they thinned down the fabric  and also painted the label on  what the heck is wrong with a standard label   it shows me instantly which side of the t shirt i have    but these latest t shirts are great  thicker fabric  fits fine  regular old label again      
4,5.0,                       i purchased these t shirts with the hope of a comfortable fitting t  shirt  no advertising or messaging  these stylish t shirts are exactly what i was looking for at a very reasonable price  i will undoubtedly purchase more of these tees in the future      
5,1.0,                       super weird fit  i bought these for the gym and i got xl so i can reach above head without uncovering my out of shape belly  well if you re looking for a square fit with arms that are cut way too low and taper weird  then you might like these  the sleeves start so low on the side and taper in a way that makes all this extra material bunch up under my arm  right in the sweaty part  it s bizarre  also  they are square after they shrink  def not long enough for how wide they are  not to mention that as soon as i start to sweat  they get all saggy and look terrible  i don t write reviews that often  but these were so bad  i felt compelled to      
6,3.0,                       not the original comfortsoft line  but still good      cotton shirts  made in haiti  tear away tag is a non issue  despite former shirts being tagless  they do attract some lint  but nothing substantial  there is nothing wrong with them  especially considering the price  they appear to be genuine hanes   i found them here after seeing stores near me no longer carried them  perhaps this is why      
7,4.0,                       my husband needed black undershirts and they re cheaper online than in stores  my husband always wears hanes white undershirts the only problem with these shirts is they re really thick   i would want my undershirt to be thinner since it s an undershirt   i didn t want layers to keep my husband balmy at work   other than that  they re fine      
8,5.0,                       here in new england  wearing layers of clothing is essential  but white t shirts stand out and  in my opinion  look unsightly under an open necked shirt   these shirts by haynes are perfect  they fit good  give extra warmth  and look terrific   they are a deep  rich  stylish dark grey which go nicely with every color   they complement what you re wearing   there s a tag in the back which doesn t bother me in the least  but i hear some people don t like tags   i really don t see how you could go wrong with these t shirts  they re ideal      
9,5.0,                       i am currently in nursing school and needed shirts that matched my scrubs   these were perfect   my favorite part about these shirts is the fact that they breathe and don t overheat me   i tend to get hotter faster than others  but these kept me cool as a cucumber for my   hour clinical rotations      
10,5.0,                       shirt is the right size  i did go one size larger than normal  but i think all shirts are that way now   comfortable and look nice     
11,1.0,                       these t shirts arrived in a clear plastic bag  the tags were not hanes official logo  and hanes t shirts do not have a tag on the inside bottom of there t shirts  do not waste your time buying  don t why amazon doesn t believe there are a lot of cheater and scammers in this world      
12,5.0,                       the shirts are very durable and fit great  i am about        lbs and they fit perfect  not too tight or too loose  i wouldn t say they are  really soft  they have a more durable feel  most shirts that are really soft usually feel cheaply made  these do not  definitely recommend if you are just looking for a simple black shirt      
13,1.0,                       these shirts are either not comfort soft products or the comfort soft brand is now junk  these do not have the packaging or the tags that you receive in a store and are not the same quality  not even close  they are rough and not comfortable at all  only explanation is that they are knock off products and not actually being sold by hanes     
14,2.0,                       quality is sufficiently good  but they are way too small for  large  tee shirts  in other brands i always order large and the fit is perfect  but large with these hanes tee shirts is too small  like  muscle  shirts  also too tight under the arms      
15,1.0,                       purchased these for my fiance for work     they definitely were not hanes  were not cotton  shirt says made in the dominican republic and      cotton  have purchased the same type in store and the fabric is way different and softer  also  it stated  tagless  and came with tags  had to rip them off    so many red flags that these were not hanes brand shirts  will not be purchasing again     
16,5.0,                       everything is great at this price  sizing  color choices  quality of the stitching and guess what  they all fit the same  nuff said      
17,3.0,                       there was nothing really wrong but the medium was larger than expected while the large was smaller they are are course material  but i feel like that is the standard feel for new cotton it was also stranger how all the shirts were made in different countries and after seeing other reviews i decided to return them prior to washing      
18,1.0,                       very rough  not cotton  the details of the product on the website  doesn t match the real product  i ordered a pack of   black ones  they come with a plastic hanes tag  no any description about the fabric  doesn t feel like cotton  i  was planning to  return but the location to return the product is far so am i make a donation to a charity      
19,5.0,                       bought some t shirts  non name brand that were too short and too thin   i was happy to receive these which were just perfect   nice quality and excellent fit   laundered with no shrinkage  too      
20,2.0,                       i needed a bunch of new shirts for a new job and for the price  the quality of the shirts are sadly what you get  the quality is bad and just gets worse with each wear and wash  but given how price  i feel i can t really complain  just know what you are getting into with the price  something that will last for a short quick fix  but shouldn t be sought as a long time fix to a work shirt issue  honestly for the price though  i can see myself going back to get more once mine are done      
21,5.0,                       i get these to sleep in  so  i get the extra large shirts  i m      and the are about mid thigh   a little shrinkage when washed  would purchase more when needed  i m a   yo lady and comfort is everything      
22,4.0,                       update   i learned a valuable lesson from my first purchase   if the t shirts are      cotton  you should go up one size   they are going to shrink down a size in the dryer even at the lowest setting   i had to get rid of all my      cotton mediums and buy a large   if the shirts are a cotton poly mix  they won t shrink as much and you ll probably be ok with your regular size   i hope this info helps  i like hanes t shirts in general and decided to give these a shot   no name packaging was a little suspect  but the t shirts appeared to be decent quality  not too thin or too thick   i wash all my tees and underwear first before wearing   what i ve learned over the years is not to machine dry these t shirts if you want them to maintain their shape and especially length   i wash them  gently pull them length wise and hang dry them   works like a charm   if you must dry them  you must use the lowest possible setting which i believe the delicate option and not for too long either   hope that info helps      
23,1.0,                       the shirts will work but they are scratchy even after   or   washings   i know for sure what haines t s are supposed to be like and these aren t them   you can tell right away by the very lightly printed inside brand stamp that something is wrong   perhaps you will get the proper product when you order  but check when they arrive and return if not right      
24,4.0,                       if tag free is important to you  then make sure to read the description on each item before you purchase  i clicked through multiple sizes colors and noticed some are described as  tag free  and others are described as  tear away tag   not sure why they aren t all the same  but i like the shirt none the less  cheap and comfortable      
25,2.0,                       another shirt meant for fat short people  you all know what i mean  this isn t the brand for you unless you re         lbs  sad how many shirts are designed and cater to only short fat people  keep looking this isn t what you want      
26,1.0,                       not as advertised  how can this possibly have as many stars for this product as claimed   i do not believe this listing is the actual brand or product advertised  there is a tag  which would not be found on a  comfort soft  hands t shirt  the material is not  soft  and it was not in hanes packaging when it arrived  unfortunately this is not the first time this has happened on amazon  shame on me for ordering from amazon again        
27,1.0,                       these are not authentic hane s comfortsoft t shirts  they arrived in a clear plastic bag with no branding  the tag on the shirt has no mention of comfortsoft  i have purchased comfortsoft before and the tag says comfortsoft  also  these shirts are rough  thick and not the correct size  returning      
28,3.0,                       my husband is always nagging for more basic shirts to wear around the house  i figured these would be great   especially for the price  they were almost perfect    the arms fit soooooo big  it fits great elsewhere and if we sized down it wouldn t look as good  i mnot sure what the deal is with the arms for you could fit multiple arms in one opening      
29,3.0,                       first time i bought these shirts was in october       quality was great  fitment great  and was very happy  however  this is the  nd time i ordered  june       and the shirts are completely different  they are cheap feeling  thinner materials and stitching not nearly as nice  the fitment also is funky  much tighter around collar and arms  too bad      
30,3.0,                       i am a little disappointed in the fabric  i asked before purchasing if this was a light weight shirt i have haines cottonsoft tshirts  i was looking to replace them with identical these are much heavier than expected they don t make them like they once did they will be a bed time shirt for the kiddo      
31,1.0,                       shirt rides up on the front of the neck  the tag absolutely drives me crazy  yes i said tag  even though the description says tagless it has a tag  this is not the shirt i ordered  it s nothing like my previous shirts that i really like  the picture shown is the same shirt i have bought previously and really like  but zoom in and you ll see no tag is shown these shirts have tags if i hadn t cut out the tag and washed the shirt i would return them  i have only worn one shirt  guess i ll give the others to someone this is for the white shirt      
32,2.0,                       i ordered  xl  packages arrived indicating  xl but shirts are tagged  xl and the fit as expected is smaller than needed   not impressed   putting a sticker on them to say  xl while manufactured as  xl isn t fooling anyone especially when they fit like  xl      
33,2.0,                       these t shirts were purchased for my son  they look good and fit nicely but he says they are itchy and uncomfortable to wear despite having been washed five times  these shirts have tags and it seems he may have been confused when we bought them as the hanes shirts he had previously were tag less and soft and he really liked those      
34,1.0,                       i washed these beige t shirts upon receiving them and the color faded noticeably on the sleeves to a yellowish tint   washed them a second time and the discoloration was noticeable on the main portion of the shirts   i didn t use any type of bleach  chlorine or non chlorine  when i washed them   because of the very obvious and ugly discoloration  they are unsuitable to wear except for when i clean the yard   what a waste of money      
35,5.0,                       seems like very good quality shirts   they fit as expected and are quite thick   might not be great in hot summer weather  but better for colder seasons   will order again when price is right      
36,5.0,                       i been buying this grey t shirts for work for   years one set each year getting ready to buy a set now i wash them separate with no other cloths  in cold water and use downy softener and hang on line to air dry dont put them in the dry or they will shrink  and in the winter its a pain but i hang them in the bathroom over the shower doors or in the house  and let the house heater dry them keeps the shirts from shrinking and keeps the neck from loosening or widening     
37,4.0,                       this is my third time ordering this product  my husband loves them and wears them every day under his uniform   asi i stated before these t shirts are durable  wash well and are soft to the touch   i will definitely continue to order this brand since they wear so well      
38,4.0,                       these are just plain  regular t shirts which is what i wanted  i don t think these feel scratchy like other reviews mentioned  they re just cotton shirts  however  since they are called  comfortsoft  i did expect them to have a softer feel and that is why i rated   stars      
39,1.0,                       this review is not a relfection on the quality of the t shirts   it is a reflection on the inaccurate product description and or fulfillment of the order   the product clearly describes it as containing four colored t shirts   when the package arrived  it included   colored t shirts and   white one   i returned it and asked for a replacement   the replacement also came with   colored t shirts and one white t shirt   i have asked for a refund      
40,1.0,                             if you are a small or medium expect a loose fit with short sleeves and a wide torso  if you re tall look elsewhere unless you are a xxl waist  idk how the large is but these are unnaturally wide for most slim or athletic guys  they shrink a ton too and not in the right areas  i cant sit without feeling my back exposed  uneven length  these are lower quality than the ones i got in a retail store  not as comfortable at all      
41,1.0,                       i feel like these shirts were made in complete darkness by a four year old  these shirts came in the same pack yet none of them fit the same  the collars on some of the shirts are all stretched out and the sleeves come to a point making you look like a triangle  out of all the shirts in the pack only one of them fit sort of okay and even then it still looked ridiculous     
42,1.0,                       these are awful shirts  they are very small and when washed on cold and hung to dry  they shrunk to the point i couldn t put it over my head  it also has tags and are ridiculously thick  don t buy these  i didn t send them back because our post office is crowded  also  they weren t even what i ordered  i m just not that picky so i thought i d just wear them  that s not possible  these are the worst shirts      
43,3.0,                       the tags on the neck are annoying why have them when so many brands print the info directly on the fabric the neck is just a hole and does not feel comfortable the best way to describe this shirt is a sack with arm and neck holes      
44,5.0,                       these are great  i wear them underneath to work underneath my scrubs on a daily basis  i ll be buying more in the future  very lightweight  they don t shrink  i wash them with cold water and let them air dry  this was my first time purchasing hanes clothes so i have no previous experience to compare with  but i was not disappointed  some reviews are daunting to be honest  but these are not bad at all  i live in venezuela and its hot all the time and these keep me cool  can t wait to finish my internship and wear them to the gym      
45,4.0,                       i used to buy expensive clothes until i found out about hanes  clothes are very simple and good quality for a very reasonable price  no apparent logo is a plus for a minimalist guy like me who doesn t like walking around feeling like a walking ad simplicity is the new chic      
46,3.0,                       these are really comfortable  but within just a few wearings  started to get  pilly   thin and one already has a hole in the armpit  they were not worn for heavy work  just casual wear      
47,1.0,                       do not waste your money  these are not as described  i have the comfort blend ones from target an they are soft an great  i wanted more so i checked amazon  big mistake  got these    not in a hans bag  but in a plastic rewrapped bag  the material isn t soft at all  it s thick an rough  these are not as described  i really wish amazon would pay attention to fake merch an sellers      
48,2.0,                         stars because these tee s were described as hanes  comfort soft  tee s and what was delivered was      not the comfort soft style  what i got were very basic hanes white tee s  nothing more       
49,5.0,                       made uniforms for son s wiffleball league   wash first as the red will bleed the first wash great price and fun for the kids to wear   perfect for iron on logos   got large for       year olds to be loose      
50,5.0,                       i love these shirts  i m tall and big  so i like to get my shirts at a  xl size and these are one of the few large shirts i found were the quality is really nice  washing them doesn t destroy them or stretch them out like other cheap shirts and the look and fit is perfect      
51,1.0,                       i have worn hanes comfort soft medium for years   these are nothing like the ones i have worn   the name  size  material  etc is not inked into the shirt as it has been for years rather just the name  hanes  is printed on a thin paper like tag sewn on the collar with no size or material description  nor does it say country of origin as the law requires   plus it shrinks after one washing      
52,3.0,                       i m honestly pretty disappointed with these shirts  i ordered them thinking they d be softer and looser  for a men s medium these shirts are really small  i purposely bought men s shirts because i like a looser fit  but these shirts definitely aren t as loose as i thought they d be  i think they ll probably shrink  ugh  i can t really recommend these  i definitely wouldn t buy again      
53,1.0,                       when i saw this was   comfort soft   i naively assumed these shirts were comfortable  largely due to softness  well  joke s on me  they are neither  stiff  uncomfortable and built blocky  good for short stocky  not for thin   even the   tagless  label is thick paint that is scratchy and uncomfortable   i have many hanes products that i really like  but these fell short   wish walmart would stock their george t shirts agan      
54,4.0,                       i ordered the same size as the other tee shirts i have  but these are a big snugger   no  i have not gained weight  i have actually lost some   also  they are not the color i ordered   i ordered ice blue and these are definitely just plain old light blue  not the color pictured   they wash and dry okay and they are fine for my purposes   i would order them again      
55,5.0,                       i bought this for my son s first job  they wash and wear well  they havent faded  but did shrink just a little upon the first wash  totally expected         would buy again      
56,1.0,                       i ordered a pack of small  medium  large  and xl for a screen printing project  the mediums and larges were true hanes brand products  but the smalls and xls were obvious knock offs with very scratchy material and horrible paper like tags  they shrunk a bunch and the smalls are even too tight for me   and i am a female  they fit more like an xs now  i guess you get what you pay for at around       shirt lol      
57,2.0,                       i have bought other hanes products with good results  not sure what s up with these  but not very good   i got the grey for sleeping and spare shirts to knock around   they are not soft  rough and scratchy   after wearing  washing for only a few months have holes under the arm pits  so not good quality   it does not actually say  hanes  inside on the back of the shirt  so perhaps they are not genuine  which would explain the poor quality      
58,2.0,                       medium is tight and after shrinkage unbearably tight   the photo of before and after washing in cold water showing the magnitude of shrinkage is totally accurate  i suspect every size shrinks to the next size down  the material is not soft but likely acceptable to most  this set will be passed onto someone who is size small      
59,4.0,                       i like the size and feel  the only issue is that i immediately put them in the wash and they fell apart  there was lint all over my washing mashing  the dryer vent was filled  i stupidly washed them with other things so everything was covered in lint      
60,4.0,                       i bought these hoping that the neck would be tight enough to choke me a little because i like that kind of thing and these shirts did the trick  however the seams remind me of when i was in  th grade geometry and i sat behind that girl with the pretty hair   always up no matter how hard i try to push them it back down and i sure don t want to stand up and solve a problem in front of the class like that      
61,1.0,                       these were definitely not a genuine hanes product  there was a tear off hanes tag in the shirts  on a tagless shirt  came in a clear bag  and say made in honduras  not the dominican republic that true hanes products say  i m a wiz at washing clothes and these shrunk  after several washes they still feel stiff  and i m so disappointed that my first review on a product i bought is a   star review  i went to walmart and bought what i was supposed to get from this supplier and the only similarity is they re both white  tsktsk shame on you     
62,2.0,                       so i ordered the   pack about a year ago and they ve been great  i wear them almost everyday so it was time for a refresh  went into my orders  searched for hanes and hit buy again the shirts i received this time are not the same shirts  i can understand them costing more and even expect that but the material is thinner    even more so than the year old shirts are today  the stitching and fabric quality are substandard  i m not even sure these are really a hanes product  for their sake  i hope they re fake they shrunk     inches in all directions  they were washed in cold water and dried on low heat  horribly disappointed with this purchase      
63,2.0,                       it shrank  so disappointed   hanes shirts don t usually shrink  now they are too short and a little tight for my husband   he wears a solid medium is  ft tall     lbs  he s long waisted  so shrinking is unacceptable      
64,5.0,                       if you are looking for the perfect  heavy yet soft t shirt  this is it  fits as expected  my son is       and     lbs  and we ordered the large t shirts  they are a tiny bit big on him  but shrink a little over time  they are dark black  not charcoal  the seams are well constructed  and the length is just right  a few inches below his waistline   thank you hanes      
65,4.0,                       they aren t the softest shirts but the color is pretty  my husband has an actually worn them yet but i did wash them and so far they are good     
66,1.0,                       not soft at all  also definitely not a small  i ve seen some other reviewers say it shrinks  so it may very well shrink down to a small but out of the package it is much larger than an average small  either way  i didn t want to take the chance to see by washing because the material is uncomfortable  doesn t feel like genuine hanes  sent back      
67,1.0,                       unwearable  bought the charcoal grey in xl to sleep in  other reviewers mentioned shrinkage   which is in the       range after cold water wash and low heat dryer  the real issue is that these are not soft  even with fabric softener  this is probably due to the fact that they are a       cotton poly blend  be very careful with the color you choose if you want      cotton      
68,4.0,                       i got these to wear around the house  i don t like the texture  it feels scratchy and the shirt is stiff  no room in the stomach area if you have a belly  the sleeves are an inch longer than normal t s  i thought these were the extreme soft ones since they said comfortsoft but they are not soft at all  not the sellers fault  good quality and they are holding up well  would buy a different type of shirt from same company next time  i m just not a huge fan of this shirt      
69,5.0,                       i love these t shirts i bought a  x for my grandson that is     and about    lbs  he usually wears a  x to  x in shirts and these fit his great  will definitely buy these again and again     
70,1.0,                       i have these shirts that i bought from a local department store and i ended up really liking these shirts  so i wanted to get some more as i try to do minimalism where i wear the same shirt every day  i went back to the original store but they didn t have them anymore so i thought i would try amazon since amazon has everything  i ordered these as their description matches the shirts i have exactly  but the shirts i received are completely different    the feel of the fabric sucks on the shirts i received    the shirts i received had tags on them  even though the description says tagless    the fit of the shirts was not the same  chest was looser  arms were looser  etc i went ahead and bought the correct shirts from hanes com as i didn t want to deal with this anymore  i would advise anyone trying to find good hanes shirts to go in store or order from hanes com     
71,5.0,                       if you are like me  you probably grab a three pack of tee shirts when you are shopping at a walmart  for years those tees were reliable and cheap  they fit the bill  well  have you seen them lately  what on earth has happened to the quality of tee shirts  they have become so thin and they shrink after the first wash  that disappointment led me to the hanes men s comfortsoft short sleeve t shirt  these hanes tees are a good mid weight cotton and they did not shrink after washing  the color selection is fabulous and to my surprise  the dark grey tees i purchased did not fade too badly  after the fourth wash they are still quite vibrant   this is probably more than you need to know about me and tee shirts  but i was so pleased to find good quality shirts again that i wanted to share      
72,2.0,                       just for reference  i am a      woman who normally gets a petite x small or small in women s clothing  so i purchased a small in these  after washing in cool water and air fluff dry  i could barely get the shirt over my head   i do not have an especially large head   the neck was chokingly tight  the length too short  and i could not freely move my arms  i threw the shirts in my rag bin  they will be fine for cleaning  i will add one other thing  i was looking for a men s t shirt made out of the very soft men s undershirt material i remember from years ago  this is not it  it is quite stiff  with little stretch or give  if you are looking for that  and want to buy these  i would suggest sizing up      
73,4.0,                       this wasn t the first time buying this shirt so i know what to expect  the first one i bought was way back in      and i still wear it till this day  this one barely shows any wear and tear although wearing at least one a week i bought it for everyday use and it is great  i won t say it s an undershirt cuz its a bit thick but you can wear a vest under it if you so desire     
74,1.0,                       product number on packaging appears to be correct  but tags indicate       cotton polyester  not as advertised  disappointed      returning     
75,3.0,                       these are below the normal quality  either they changed something or they sell different quality levels under the same brand  this purchase made me move on  found better stuff and won t be buying hanes shirts again  ever  not worth the huge possibility of getting bad fitting ones     
76,4.0,                       my husband appreciated the t shirts in the dark colors with pockets   they fit well and seem durable   a great brand   they do shrink in length some when laundered      
77,1.0,                       this isn t what i expected at all   with the number of positive reviews i expected a decent product   these are not soft at all   smaller than expected and just plain not comfortable at all   the material is almost stiff  scratchy and very uncomfortable   they will make great rags      
78,5.0,                       theyre okay  they came at about         each  if you remove the tag youll have a hard time at first figuring out which way is front  thats my only complaint  but not really even a complaint      
79,2.0,                       the fit is alright  too short for an undershirt but decent length for a standard t shit  but the feel is pretty awful  the stitching inside the shirt is very uncomfortable      
80,4.0,                       while the color is inaccurate  the quality of the shirts are thick and soft  bought them to comfortably wear at home and as pjs  the only thing is that i bought the color gold and they were more russet than gold  more brown than orange gold as shown in the picture  but i am liking the weightiness of the material so will keep as the true color is not that bad either      
81,3.0,                       was very disappointed i could not dry them even on medium setting the shirts shrink  my son needed them for work a green t have to buy more in a larger size      
82,1.0,                       no way are these legit  the comfort soft shirts i ve purchased in the past were soft and comfortable  these are the opposite and have a weird fit at the armpits  plus  real hanes prints their logo on the fabric  these knockoffs came with a generic hanes tag attached  stay away from this counterfeit  amazon should have better quality control      
83,3.0,                       other than receiving a bright blue instead i of the teal  these were as expected  the color really ruined what i wanted to do with these though      
84,1.0,                       these are not comfortable nor soft  not sure what i purchased here but i could substitute these with some    grit sandpaper to smooth out my weathered deck boards  they came loose in the bag  not packaged like normal i specifically searched out hanes t shirts because i have some beautifully worn hanes shirts and wanted to get more  this is not the same  do not buy unless you like being uncomfortable or need some micro dermabrasion on you back chest and upper arms      
85,4.0,                       good and comfortable  but a little bulky   the neckline was a little high in the front on me  and the sleeves are fractionally too long in newer polo shirts  which have such short sleeves themselves   the tee shirt sleeves stick out unless i bunch them up    what do the polo shirt makers expect to be worn under them   wife be ters  excellent quality  but their neckline is higher than a normal crew neck      
86,5.0,                       my husband is forever stretching out the neck of his tees by pulling them over his head by the neckline  these tees do not seem to be stretching  i ll keep trying to train my man to remove his tees properly  you keep making his replacement tees      
87,1.0,                       these are cheap poly blend shirts with a fake hanes tag   i have many real hanes comfortsoft shirts and these aren t even close  they are shirt   everything else in the description is a lie   the counterfeit quality is laughable   plus hanes went tagless years ago  these shirts have a single tag with a poor hanes logo  no size  no washing instructions  no nation of origin  how does amazon allow such counterfeiting on prime items  this is literally criminal  clean up your mess amazon   your wasting my time   makes me hesitant to buy cloths through amazon      
88,5.0,                       i don t know what the people saying these aren t soft are crying about  they re definitely soft and comfortable  they re also a bit thicker heavier than other  cheap  t shirts  i bought these just to wear to work  they ll do just fine      
89,5.0,                       the black shirts i received are tagless and      cotton  they are a little bit rough but other than that they are fine  manufactured in the dominican republic     
90,5.0,                       some fit smaller then other  it s just like anything there all different in size fit  you always have to try each one on to see how the fit  i have some the fits perfect and then others that fits different      
91,5.0,                       buy them for my son birthday  he likes  the fix on him they are comfortable and they came early he is happy with them thank you amazon       
92,2.0,                       the problem is that although this is marked a comfort t shirt  it s the  heavyweight  version  which is more of a ruff material and the sleeve circumference is larger  the comfort t that i ordered several weeks before this was what i was expecting  they are soft and fit better imo  this review is for the ones ordered from   under moments  and the soft comfortable ones were ordered from   wonder discounts   both are advertised as the same exact shirt and are both prime eligible  i kept them because they were on sale      
93,2.0,                       i typically wear a  x shirt as i am      and have a couple extra pounds   i ordered these as shirts to wear around the house or doing yard work   they are even a bit larger than i expected  but not in length  the length was very disappointing  it seems like shirt manufacturers don t take length into consideration   while a bit disappointing  they will still serve much of their intended  casual around the house  purposes      
94,2.0,                       i really like the hanes comfortsoft t shirts i bought at local retailers   they re      cotton  very thin and lightweight and perfect for wearing and working in a hot climate   since local stores are often out of stock   i ordered these from amazon  and received two packages of tees that have a red hanes tag  my others were always tagless   and no description of the materials used or any style name   just  hanes  and made in el salvador   they re thicker than i wanted  but most importantly  they re cut tight and obviously have a lot of spandex in them   they re stretchy and clingy   really uncomfortable   not at all what i ordered      
95,3.0,                       the shirt pack is nice  they are comfortable  however when it comes to value for money they just fail  i always wash new clothes before the first wear  so had it washed and ironed  wore this shirt for the first time ever and the day after a hole developed  which is unfortunate  if the rest of the pack doesn t fail like this did  i will reconsider my rating      
96,5.0,                       love the dark mustard color  soft material yet thicker      
97,2.0,                       cheap quality shirts made in haiti  definitely not      cotton  in fact the material they re made from is not even listed on the tags  which btw  are annoyingly scratchy at the base of your neck  fit is ok  but that s the best i can say about them  i do wear them but they re not worth the money spent  surprising that hanes is willing to put its name on such low quality clothing  i ll stick with fotl from now on      
98,2.0,                       the only reason for my   star review is this   i put on one of the t shirts right out of the package and within about     hours i developed a terrible rash on my chest and neck   i had not been outside or around anything like poison ivy   i have no allergies   i took off the t shirt after figuring that it must be the problem and the rash is slowly going away   wash these before wearing them  other than that  the t shirts appear well made and are of a durable material   but this rash really itches      
99,3.0,                       one of shirts had a hole  didnt feel like returning so i had to see it  red large  and i feel the measurements are inaccurate or run small in refrence to the large  ive boight my son all the same size in multiple other shirts and this one runs small  also one of the shirts  blue   xlarge  has horrible stitching as you can see in conparison to one of the shirts with a good stitch to the one that was crap  it s all rippled and looks like someone who doesnt know how to sew did it     
100,1.0,                       these are  not  hanes comfortsoft shirts  the real ones are soft and stretchy with a grey tagless stamp at the neck  these are thick  coarse  scratchy  with minimal stretch and a bogus red tag at the neck that is more scratchy than the shirt itself  the real ones have the comfortsoft trademark and are tagless  found those from another seller and they were genuine  shipped in actual hanes packaging  these arrived shrink wrapped in thick cellophane with no markings  fake     
101,5.0,                       my son likes these shirts as he s always work a t shirt and when i started ordering him some in different colors he s been asking for more of these  and i m definitely saving a lot of money on shirts as the normal shirts he wears are an average of           so these are definitely worth the money and are his favorites      
102,5.0,                       i think this falls in line with what hanes usually are and it s a pretty good product  i love how it looks and feels and black tees are so versatile i love that its thick enough to not just be an undershirt i also did not have any issues with shrinking in the wash  warm   cold  the only complaint i have  which might be my dryer  is the sleeves always still come out damp or at least wrinkly   i am also short so i wish i did have shrinking haha  but i got a size up anyway  medium  and it s been good to me      
103,5.0,                       i have several      and  x shirts and all of them are very very thick   these are just right   thick enough to feel durable and well made but not so thick that they are itchy and uncomfortable   best shirts for undershirts or just wearing as a comfortable t      
104,1.0,                       thin material  and rips easily   absolute garbage   two day shipping actually means   day shipping      
105,1.0,                       these are not hanes  these shirts are not tagless and hanes hasn t made a tagged shirt in a long time  actually these have double the tags  one on the neck and one by the waist  they also were not in a hanes package  they came piled together with some tape around them  amazon should remove these imposters from their site      
106,4.0,                       hanes must be making their  large  tshirts for a different culture than america  i m        tall and weigh     pounds  i could barely squeeze into these shirts so i returned them for x large which fit much better  i know this is a trend in the clothing business  so don t take it personally   it s just their way of trying to save money   i now purchase all clothing products like swim trunks or board shirts in x large and my waist size is a healthy      so do not buy the large but the x large   otherwise the shirts are made of good quality cotton fiber and were nice and black         
107,1.0,                       i ordered these shirts to replace ones i ve bought in the past   the ones i bought in the past were way more comfortable than these ones   the ones i was sent are      cotton  even though the ones i ordered were supposed to be some percentage polyester mix   my old ones are     polyester     cotton   maybe it s possible i got sent some kind of knock off   these are not only less comfortable  they are sized slightly small   i m returning the ones i bought      
108,5.0,                       my shirt fits amazingly well  i m a slightly muscular slightly chubby     pounds   ft tall and my waist is about       inches  this shirts fit amazingly  if youve got gyno it doesnt show  its heavy enough for that to happen  confortable  i have washed them a couple of times and they have not gotten dirty  just be carefull with bar deodorant cause it may stain for the day the shirt  great value      
109,1.0,                       the fabric is rough on the skin and a for new t shirt to scratch like emory cloth is really disappointing  improves a little bit with first and second wash  but overall a total letdown  do not recommend      
110,5.0,                       these are amazing quality t shirts  they are on the thicker side so not something you would wear under a man s dress shirt  these are more of something you wear solo  great for bumming around the house  god knows we have done a lot of that the past   months  good quality  good price      
111,5.0,                       the shirt ran a little large on my figure they also became  half wash  after several washes the neckline stretched  ok shirts i would maybe use them as an undershirt      
112,4.0,                       they didn t come in a package  they were just loose in the package which was a little off putting  but they are fine  they run a little large but i m sure they ll shrink in the wash so it ll be fine     
113,4.0,                       for the most part  these ts provided what i was expecting  i typically order medium t shirts because large tends to feel too big  for these  however  they either run a bit smaller or there was a bit of shrinkage after washing them  which i did before wearing them the first time  overall  i found the quality to be good  i gave it four stars because of the surprise i found with the fit      
114,1.0,                       unfortunately i discovered this after the return window closed  after i washed the shirts i thought they looked small and the fabric wasn t as nice  but its the same brand and size  i always buy for my hubby so didn t think alot of it  after he started wearing them and they were extremely uncomfortable  not as breathable and they shrunk to almost a midriff status  he asked me what brand they were  i told him hanes but then looked at the shirts and they have no label  not even the usual printed one  the worst  don t purchase      
115,2.0,                       i bought these crew neck  black t shirts from hanes for my son to wear with his under armour gym shorts  to work out in and also to hang out in  maybe go to a movie   the under armour shorts are really nice  but  sadly  and to my disappointment  there was no way he was wearing them anywhere except under sweatshirts and hoodies  they are so thin they are see through  the collar stretched out after a couple of washes  so he couldn t wear them under the right button down  the hem on the sleeves and at the waist was crooked and the seams were poorly sewn  no joke  it s that bad  i ve always gotten hanes for my boys but we re going with jockey now  or something else   i hate to even think of him wearing those t shirts at all  even under his hoodies  i want him to toss them  forget even giving them to goodwill or jesus s house  that would be terrible  however  one redeeming factor  they were delivered pronto via prime        
116,5.0,                       i am a woman  and i absolutely love these shirts and highly recommend  i bought them to wear with jeans around the house  but they are easily dressed up with a necklace and a cardigan  i am buying more in different colors  perfect basic shirt  for reference  i am      and    lbs  i ordered these in a medium and they re perfect      
117,5.0,                       these are obvious counterfeit shirts  they came in a sealed transparent bag with no branding at all  and there is no branding printed on the shirts either  the shirts have a small paper tag that says hanes but these are almost comically easy to rip and take off  something that honestly i really appreciated  the shirts themselves are really nicely put together made with a thick but very soft fabric  i m honestly really happy with these      
118,2.0,                       agree with other who have commented on the terrible quality control here  i ve bought the same comfortsoft shirts  and yes there are several different sub varieties of these  adding to the confusion  several times  and each time  the fit is entirely different and inconsistent  the latest batch  in medium  are far too long  snug around the waste  and absurdly broad around the shoulders and chest  but each individual one in the same package varies just a bit i used to buy hanes shirts because they were cheap and comfortable  and although they ve never been super high quality  they were reliably consistent  not any more  time to move on      
119,3.0,                       needed some plain black tees as the ones i had were getting washed out  these are black tees can t say they are listed wrong took off stars because    runs extremely baggy  i m  ft         lbs athletic build ordered a size large and outside of the arm head hole i m sure a  nd one of me could fit in this  it s loose all around from chest all the way down to waist     main reason  the stitching on these was obviously not well done  there were several loose threads around the neck and waist area straight out of packaging that i had to cut and pull out if i could do it over again i would probably get a medium but that doesn t excuse the stitching at all  if you re looking for a form fitting shirt this is not the one      
120,5.0,                       great shirts  love the purple color  i wear a medium and bought large because most shirts shrink  washed   dried to a perfect medium like i needed  hated that these have tags but they re easy to tear off without damaging the shirt   the white shirts are not too thin so that s great for us women      
121,1.0,                       i have ordered these on multiple occassions and received a great shirts  those were tagless and made in dominican republic  it stated clearly that they were       cotton  these are made in honduras and have tags  in addition no where on the packaging does it state that these are     cotton  and they sure dont feel like it  feels like i m wearing a bag filled with sweat  dont breathe at all      
122,4.0,                       these are thinner than i expected from james and after reading the description beware  different colors also have different types of fabric  i was really disappointed when these showed up and were     polyester  they feel thin and cheap but my husband says he ll still use them  the fit is good      
123,4.0,                       the only issue i have with these is that they are not really as comfy as i thought  comfortsoft  would be  i got a handful of old navy shirts that were being clearanced out and they are softer than a pillow  so i was looking for something like that  these aren t anywhere near as soft  but they are still far softer than your standard pack of shirts so it s not at total loss      
124,2.0,                       calling these shirts  comfortsoft  is a cruel joke  the material is bulky  rough and stiff   highly uncomfortable  i ve kept them as backups  and only wear them when everything else is dirty and i want to put off laundry day  sort of feels like wearing a burlap sack with armholes      
125,4.0,                       these shirts are decent for the price  i use them for working out and doing work around the yard  they run big  they do shrink a bit in the wash  but they re still larger than most other shirts in the same size  i attached some photos that show an unwashed shirt compared to a wash shirt to show the shrinkage  i also have a photo comparing it to what an average shirt looks like in the same size  the hanes shirt is grey      
126,1.0,                       put it on as soon as it arrived  i work for a few hours and then it started feeling rough against my skin and i had to take it off  i don t know if these are fakes but when you hold the material up to light you could see cross patterns that you can look through like a a cheesecloth  not so accurate but only thing i can think of that would remind people of the pattern in other words not a very tight weave and definitely not soft i think these are fakes  do not buy      
127,3.0,                       this shirt is decent   i was hoping for a shirt that was softer and more light weight   i also wanted it to be a little baggier throughout   i wanted a comfortable shirt to go for walks and hang mount at home   the  xl was a better fit except it was  of course  a bit on the long side and the neck is a little big      
128,5.0,                       this shirt was produced in dominican republic  and seems to be a decent shirt   i compared it to one i received at christmas  that on easy manufactured in malaysia   i think the previous red tag was a bit softer   both are nice this a     and the previous    i have a    chest but medium bones  these large fit perfect after shrinking a bit      
129,1.0,                       when i first wore these they were actually a bit baggy which i m fine with  after washing  on cold water  then drying  on low heat for about    minutes  they shrunk to the point where they barely fit over my head if you do buy these  make sure that you buy one or even two sizes larger unbelievable      
130,4.0,                       we had hoped these would be the same as the comfortsoft shirts we bought years ago  they fit the same  but the material is thicker  which wasn t a plus because we wanted the thinner material  and the the neck was definitely tighter than the old ones  it is possible that hanes no longer makes whatever t shirt my husband bought    years ago and we are not comparing the exact same shirts  the labels in the old t shirts were too faded to read  but it definitely said something with the word  comfort  in it  nice t shirt overall  just not what we were expecting      
131,3.0,                       these t shirts will shrink bad  i am including a picture of my   month old t shirts  same brand  black  vs  brand new white ones  they re tagless and all  very comfortable and won t fade much  but the shrinking factor might be of your concern especially if you order  l   mine are  s  and now they fit like a slim fit t shirt which is fine for me but for some this may be relevant      
132,3.0,                       it s the standard  rough cotton   not like those super soft cotton shirts that you find once then spend the rest of your life searching for again   also it s quite thin   good thing i bought the black ones otherwise my nipples would shine right through like headlight high beams   that all being said  it cost me       usd for a   pack  is a shirt  and is shaped like a t      
133,3.0,                       these shirts are not tagless   i assumed they would be as most are now  also  they were not in hanes packaging   i received four shirts folded into a  shipping bag   they were to be part of a gift so i don t know how they fit but they do not feel soft they have more of a scratchy feel and i will not be giving them to anyone   the only reason i gave three stars is because i got what i ordered  four white shirts and they were shipped timely  not good quality      
134,1.0,                       bought these for my grandson  first noticed that the cotton was far from soft before and after washing  once washed they were totally too small for him to wear  super not happy with this purchase and would like to send them back for refund      
135,5.0,                       ok read all the negative stuff bought with skepticism but as luck would have it i am pleasantly surprised and the shirts are very comfortable and fit me great  i normally wear medium but lately mediums are not really the same as before so i washed the large in hot water and had minimal shrinkage now a perfect fit just in between a medium and a large  i would say a cold wash there would probably be little to no shrinkage as i first washed in cold  they have tags which doesn t bother me but makes identification easier in my mishmesh stack of black t shirts  over all very satisfied just ordered   more on amazon prime wardrobe  good luck        
136,5.0,                       i m a female and i bought these tshirts to sleep in because they are      cotton and they sleep alot cooler than any other cotton blend tshirt i could find for women   they are just thick enough to feel great and i ve been sleeping noticeably cooler  i liked then so much i bought another   pack      
137,1.0,                       do not buy  if you are buying this shirt  make sure you buy   sizes larger as they shrink alot  i washed it once and now cannot wear them as they do not fit anymore  the tag is very annoying and would need to be cut off with scissors  i will have to donate them to the salvation army because they do not fit after   wash  waste of money  they arent soft either and very thin      
138,1.0,                       ordered   different colors and got   different styles even thought stickers all said style      black was tagless  comfortsoft heavyweight and      cottonlight steel was tagged  not comfortsoftcharcoal heather was tagged  not comfortsoft and was a       blend      
139,2.0,                       i have worn hanes comfortsoft tees for years and these are not them  first off  these have tags and comfortsoft are all tagless  the shirts are well made and of a good quality material  but they aren t the soft  combed cotton like material of a comfortsoft shirt  they arrived in a clear plastic  unmarked bag  inside the amazon shipping bag of course   with no indication on the bags or shirt tags that these are comfortsoft  i wish they were softer  but i will keep them as they fit well and are of a sturdy material  i thought the price was too good to be true for comfortsoft shirts  guess i was right      
140,2.0,                       i m       athletic fit  wear a    x     in jeans   i m usually a medium in banana republic   i got the large and medium in these shirts and both fit wrong   the large is massively big in the chest   definitely closer to       huge length in arms and waist  and short   the medium fits well in the neck and arms and waist  but chest is closer to the      making it tight in the chest and then the length is super short   above the belt   the fabric is not soft either   i won t be buying hanes again      
141,3.0,                       absolutely not  comfortsoft   just regular old t shirt material  i have autism and these are scratchy  i have wasted so much money on shirts that say they are super soft and aren t even softer than the cheap    ones from walmart  very disappointing      
142,1.0,                       most uncomfortable hanes shirt i ever felt  in fact i have complained to hanes and will be sending short to them directly to verify if this is a true hanes product came in plastic wrap with no hanes packaging  it is so stiff and itchy even after washing  i m not sure what this is but the manufacture has discovered a new species of cotton fiber and it is horrible      
143,1.0,                       ordered some hanes comfort soft boxer briefs and a pack of these at the same time  they both appear to be knock offs or made with cheaper materials  upon original opening of the package  the threading is already unraveling along the neck band  these are also not tagless like we thought they were supposed to be and the tag is very rough on the neckline  we are not impressed  but it is not really worth sending back and waiting for more either  overall not pleased with purchase      
144,1.0,                       i just got these in the mail and i went to wash them before wearing them  the hem is already coming undone  i didnt know hanes was this low quality      
145,1.0,                       hanes used to be a good brand  i loved their comfortsoft shirts and wanted more so i ordered these and they feel like      plastic  they cling to everything  are itchy  and too tight in the shoulders and huge at my waste  the shoulder seem is way too long for a large and the overall quality is absolutely terrible  apparently these are real hanes shirts  if that s the case  i m never buying thier clothes again      
146,3.0,                       i bought xl size expecting to be able to wash and dry them and have them shrink quite a bit  and get them to what a large is before washing drying  because the large size i got from walmart shrunk down to a medium   well  these are way bigger than i expected  and the fit is different it s funny because most people in the reviews are complaining about the shrink  when that s what i was looking for   if you need an xl and expect a big shirt  these are definitely big   they ll shrink  but not too much if you need a better fit  get the comfortsoft hane s shirts from walmart      
147,1.0,                       i don t write many reviews but i want to save someone from wasting their money on these  i actually do not believe they are legitimate hanes shirts      they are like cardboard with zero stretch   they have a  generic  hanes logo tag with no info on the tag   they came in a bag and not packaging   they are trash and are resigned to the garage before i wore all   shirts     
148,3.0,                       these shirts are of good quality but are heavier    thicker     than i would have liked   it takes many  many  many washings to get them feeling right for me      
149,3.0,                       i am used to pairing hanes with  highest quality  and  great   as opposed to  good   but these were a let down  they arrived feeling stiff and smelling a little chemically  did not have much stretch to them  i washed them before having my fiance try them on  big mistake  so i can t return them  they did shrink a little too  the quality only improved a small bit after the wash amazon essentials has better quality black shirts     
150,3.0,                       i bought a four pack of maroon because i needed the color  took two out and washes  one is still on hanger and other worn four times and washes three  the seam behind right shoulder gave way and separated about     inches  i do not have that color thread  may bring it to cleaners to sew for a few bucks  also  not very soft for  comfortsoft       
151,3.0,                       these weren t the cpmfort soft tshirts  they were a stiffer cotton  the shirts themselves are okay  but i m very disappointed at the false advertising  since i was specifically looking for the comfortsoft hanes shirts      
152,5.0,                       i get these for normal wear as undershirts and around the house  i don t expect perfection  a couple seem like they might be a tad bigger than usual  but after a couple washes and drying properly the shirts seem great  no issues here  i appreciate there are no tags  and the fit seems about right for my size  no complaints      
153,2.0,                       so there is a certain brand hanes makes that fits perfectly  it is loose around the shoulders and the belly  the ones i bought are  no longer available    so now i have to find something comparable  why does every manufactured make shirts tight across the back and shoulder  it is uncomfortable  the ones i like say our most comfortable with    cotton and    spandex  why you know make these loose tee shirts anymore  i m not buying    different packs just to find one type that i like      
154,4.0,                       in june       i bought a set of four white hanes t shirts from this seller and was happy with them  so now in june       i decided to order more in a different color   the pretty colors are quite a bit more expensive and my needs are more for casual activities around the house or yard work or casual errands in the car  so was looking for colors comparable in price to the white t s and wound up ordering the light blue ones   they seem pretty much the same  with the exception that the light blue shirts were made in haiti and the white ones were made in the dominican republic   both are      cotton   both colors came with really cheap annoying plastic tags on the back of the neck     the good news is that they are really easy just to tear or pull off   i washed them in mild warm water in my washer and then dried them in a  warm but not hot setting  in the dryer and they shrunk about   or   inches in length and a couple inches around the waist and chest   i am      tall and weigh     lbs   i bought xl and before washing  they came down to my mid thighs  maybe   or   inches below my waist     after washing and drying  they shrunk to around   to   inches below my waist   all in all  they seem to fit my body type as well as to be expected      
155,3.0,                       shirts are fine and as advertised  but mine look like the bag was resealed improperly and plastic is stuck to one of the shirts  i m keeping only because my car is in the shop and i don t want to deal with an hour bus ride to the nearest town with ups drop off   wish i could return via usps  the shirts are fine  but watch out for amazon s lackadaisical quality control     
156,5.0,                       i like these tees a lot  perfect fit and the material is a step up from the thin material that you usually find in tees in this price range  i was concerned about the size as i have recently lost about    lbs and wasn t sure how far down from the   x i should go  turns out i guessed right  so if you are around      tall and weigh in the neighborhood of     lbs  these should do the trick      
157,5.0,                       these shirts fit great and very comfortable and great quality  excellent seller  arrived early     
158,4.0,                       too many shirts these days seem to be made for very short people  so when i ve ordered shirts just large enough to fit my   foot and large frame  xl fits my chest and shoulders   i have been stuck with shirts that left me with a bare midriff or came untucked with only the slightest movement these shirts  though  are longer than some of the others i ve had  they fit me nicely in all areas and tuck in well  even while working out on machines or on projects around the house where i ve had to reach high over my head  these shirts have stayed tucked in i plan to buy more of these now that i know how they fit      
159,5.0,                       great shirt or undershirt if you choose i have a longer torso so length is usually an issue  with these they fit just a bit below the belt line  can easily reach up and grab something without showing the world my stomach      
160,3.0,                       i have bought hanes comfortsoft t shirts several times previously for comparison  these xxls are way larger than the xxls i already have      
161,1.0,                       just received this pack of   shirts  outside package was fine but once i opened that the inner clear plastic sleeve around the shirts i saw moisture in the bag   taking the shirts out they were all extremely wet  no idea why very gross   immediately put them in the washer   hoping for the best when they are done      
162,1.0,                       comfortably fitting shirt  hand washed as i didn t want to put through a whole wash for one shirt  color fast and dries quickly   after washing by hand not machine pills  small balls of material  began appearing on the front of the shirt  next time i will stick with      cotton shirts     
163,4.0,                       hey these shirts are great but there is one thing wrong never wash them if you do you start out with a xl and end up with a xs  so as long as you never wash them  your ok if your ok with that plus they do not hold up good at all mine already has small holes in them and all i ve done is wash them     
164,5.0,                       we ordered this item with   shirts in a package   we love the price but also its quality   the real     percent cotton made   after several washes  we are sure it does not fade and it does not give any red tint out to other clothes washed in the same cycle since it is so comfortable and with a right amount material but without the bulkiness unsuitable for summer  it has become our two in one   both underwear and t shirt in one we recommend this item  it is a green conscious buy with a great price      
165,2.0,                       i don t understand why they are called comfort soft  they aren t soft at all  they are probably the least soft of all the shirts i own the white is very thin and see through  mine also had a tag  you are much better if with gildan     
166,3.0,                       i tend to like to use shirts like this as a light undershirt or on hot days just to wear around the house or out doors  these shirts are bulkier and not as soft as expected      
167,5.0,                       i usually order these shirts for undershirts but i guess they have changed the material  it s a great change  they are a little thicker now so i can actually wear them as a shirt     
168,4.0,                       last review  great t shirts for the price and comfort this is still true   i think  this time i ordered the t shirts  white  and not sure if they were the  comfortsoft  style  didn t see the choice when ordering   this batch came with an annoying tag  that i easily ripped out   i remember quite a while ago michael jordan  and other celebrities  selling hanes t shirts that were tag less   it was a new product design at the time   why put the tag back into production  unless its an inferior  sub par design   we ll see how this one holds up over time      
169,2.0,                       i can t comment about shrinkage or how long these will last but my husband wears a medium in all his other tshirts  plain solids for work or any brand of graphic t  and these were way too narrow  ordered medium black      
170,3.0,                       bought l but should bought xl due to wash shrinkage  shirts are pretty short in length compared to other hanes tees   these hit me just below my belt   cotton is medium weight  not the best shirts for summer temps  will have do as winter undershirts      
171,1.0,                       i ordered these assuming that the assortment of colors would be the ones shown  i got white  very light gray  gray  and black  very disappointed because i bought them for farm work shirts  i thought the colors were all dark  don t buy if you think this picture is what you re getting  and the all white one came with a small stain on it  so it s not even wearable around  very disappointed     
172,1.0,                       although there was a paper tag sewn in the neck that read hanes  the tagless print has no company  just the size  which is smaller than shown  and country it was manufactured in these are much thicker heavier and rougher than hanes comfortsoft tees  very disappointing i have donated them so they won t be wasted      
173,2.0,                       these shirts fit really well until i washed them   i washed i  cold water   dry setting medium and shirts went from fitting good to shrinking sleeves and waist   i now were them and they sit almost right belowy belly button and above waste   feel really uncomfortable wearing them to the gym or out  so i guess i bought a set of cleaning rags   disappointed     
174,3.0,                       i purchased several color of these shirts and the only one that seems like it is actually comfort soft is the dark gray  the light blue  royal blue  and light green are all quite stiff and a bit scratchy  not what i was expecting but they fit nicely and i m happy with them overall      
175,5.0,                       i forgot i bought men s shirts and accidentally got large so like that s why they fit big but like overall they are good quality but they did have a funky smell when i got them to just wash them before wearing     
176,4.0,                       i bought three colors of these shirts  all listed as being      cotton  to my surprise it turns out that the heathered charcoal is actually     cotton and     polyester  i double checked and verified that nowhere in the description does it show a product that is        that being said  this color is much softer than the      cotton black and deep royal blue shirts  i will say that this listing is very confusing with so many of the  same  shirt having so many variations  the black is tagless  the blue and charcoal have  tear off tags   we will have to see how well that works   with all the shirts being the  same  it s not possible to leave separate reviews for each color  my husband goes through work shirts very quickly  so i was happy with the price      
177,1.0,                       i literally bought these because i see hanes as a trusted brand  i m not even sure i m convinced these are hanes  they are not tagless it doesn t come in a branded bag and despite the bag saying  maroon  which i ordered i got white which i absolutely did not want      
178,5.0,                       i m happy with the shirts  gave it to a friend as a gift  he put it in the dryer  which i stopped doing long ago  and the shirts shrank up significantly  he s a regular fit guy and it looks a little short  i m very happy with my hang dried shirts  soft  strong  and reasonably priced      
179,2.0,                       definitely not the same comfortsoft i ve bought in the past  material is scratchy and rough  these shirts also fit odd  i always wear a medium with no issues  but these shirts and too wide and a little short  would not recommend      
180,2.0,                       feels like gildan   definitely is not hanes comfortsoft shirts   buy a pack from walmart and you will see the difference   these are like wearing cardboard  not soft at all  size is correct  but the fitting is incorrect  don t waste your money  just buy the real ones from a physical store   i now have some expensive rags      
181,1.0,                       my husband won t wear these  big waste of my money   i was sure they were soft cotton that i had bought before  these were very stiff not at all soft  even when i tried to soften them  no luck  trash     
182,1.0,                       these shirts feel like sandpaper and are incredibly uncomfortable  i thought that washing them might make them more comfortable but it had no effect  i would really recommend not buying these shirts  other shirts like from h m or even uniqlo are much more comfortable      
183,1.0,                       i don t believe these are genuine hanes shirts at all  in one of the photos used fo the product  it even states the famous hanes tagless collar  these are not tagless and ill fitting  and thick  the neck collar is wide  i bought whit and charcoal  the charcoal ones have washing instructions printed inside the back and a stiff scratchy white tag  the white tees have two tags  very stiff and scratchy  one has hanes on it and the other washing instructions  these are far too heavy for hanes shirt  knockoff copies  i have bought many hanes t shirts and none are like this  hanes trademark is tagless collars  tagless  these are not hanes shirts      
184,5.0,                       i went up a size  due to the many reviews suggesting this   but the charcoal heather shirts are made of a cotton poly blend  so they are true to size   the shirts were huge when i got them  and after many washings they are still pretty big   but they are holding up well the info printed on the shirt is black on gray  so i can t determine if the cotton poly blend is               etc   the shirts are comfy  just a bit scratchy if i ordered them again  i would get then in      cotton  so it would be some other color   in which case going up a size would probably still be a good idea      
185,5.0,                       check out gramps in his hanes men s comfortsoft t shirt   he s rockin it and grandma s loving it   grandpa is shown wearing a medium these are some manly  soft  nicely fitting t shirts   i used this   pack to fit   different guys and i can say they fit as expected  perhaps a little small   i had pre washed them and then put iron on vinyl and tie dyed them   no major shrinkage in the wash  no fading or bleeding since they ve been tie dyed   they are great these shirts arrived as expected they are reasonably soft  about a   on the scale nice round necklinemanly regular fitcrisp clean color no off white yellow color i d order them again      
186,1.0,                       definitely not soft and definitely not comfortable  i bought this for my dad who s in his   s and has shrunk considerably in size  so i bought mediums  but still too tight  would not recommend  if you do need to buy them  by two sizes larger  however there s nothing much to be done for the rough feel of the fabric  definite buyer beware here      
187,5.0,                       i m    lbs and wearing a d size bra and got a medium  i love men s shirts for some reason  wear these with nice pair or pants tights and a necklace  perfect for chill days and running errands not to waste other clothing     
188,2.0,                       shirts arrived in good time  looked good  the material appears very thin  as i usually do with new garments i was going to wash them  one of the shirts had a hole in it  brand new never worn or washed  poor quality from hanes not happy      
189,5.0,                       excellent cotton shirt  i should have just bought the black shirts by themselves  paid double to get black and grey but the grey was a different shade than i expected  great shirts though      
190,5.0,                       fit just how i would like  it s a little loose and needed to be washed with warm water and afterwards fit perfect for my build           lbs wearing xl      
191,5.0,                       i love them  i purchased the shirts for myself because women s shirts are too form fitting and in the summer i like clothes that are breathable  i highly recommend the shirts for women  they are very comfortable      
192,2.0,                       these  comfortsoft  tee s are anything but comfortable and more specifically  soft  the material used is a scratchy course material  even after washing and treating with clothes softener they are still the same tried ironing and still rough feeling  it makes me wonder if i received a product not actually produced by hanes or hanes is using a cheaper material i will not buy again      
193,5.0,                       i love a shirt that does not hike up when you sit down and feels good on my skin  i will definitely order these again  my only caveat is that the colour that i wanted was     plus a day longer shipping  if it cost you all that much more to make shirts in a certain color off them in batches of three instead of four and that would offset your costs  an idea      
194,1.0,                       do not buy  not real hanes quality  not cheap either  thin and have shrunk after  st wash  bought at store and same product i bought before  since my husband wears tshirts to work i need real hanes quality  will not this from amazon again      
195,5.0,                       hanes products always hit the mark  i buy them for gifts and everyone appreciates receiving them  the are soft  comfortable and wash well  they come out of the dryer ready to be worn again      
196,1.0,                       i only received   shirts  i thought i was to get   shirts  the pic shows   shirts and the description says   shirts  there is no way to correct this problem unless they send me   more shirts  so i am very disappointed  amazon needs to call me and refund half the money  i got half the order  thanks every body for letting me vent  take care and be safe        
197,3.0,                       i purchased these shirts as something to wear under my smock at work  i am a dog groomer    just looking for something lightweight soft and comfortable   the shirts seemed stiff even after washing and using dryer sheets   not comfortable at all      
198,4.0,                       i found them to fit a little too loose out of the package but fit is ok after a wash the sleeves are a little wider than i typically like  but the length is good overall  good shirts  i wear them mostly as an under layer or by itself when i work out      
199,5.0,                       my son and grandsons have always worn hanes t shirts and probably always will  so  when i needed to get some to keep here when my eldest grandson comes for the weekend  it was a no brainer  always superior quality and fit  you just can t beat them for the price and quality      
200,3.0,                       these shirts are nice and roomy and the fabric is thick  but scratchy  not the best match for my needs since i bought them to wear to sleep  i ll be sending these back      
201,2.0,                       bought   packages of   tee shirts  expecting them to look like previous hanes shirts i ve ordered online a few years back   these shirts  made in the dr and in singapore  don t have the usual hanes info inside collar  and these have little white tags that say hanes     older shirts had hanes name printed right on the shirt  tagless    along with with fabric contents   just got them  so no idea how they will feel after laundering  but from reviews i just read  am expecting significant shrinkage   wish i had read qs and as before purchasing     i naively trusted the hanes brand        
202,4.0,                       not sure about the fit because i ordered large but the quality is pretty good  soft  thick material  hasn t faded too much after   washes  i like that there weren t tags inside     
203,2.0,                       had these before  great tees   rewrite   the ones he had were great but theses had tags    we reordered the same item  the description says tagless  they had tags and printed on fabric also  i cut them off as best i could  if they still bother my husband after washing again i will be returning them      
204,4.0,                       these t shirts are what i was looking for  mostly   the fit  color  and most of all price are all great  i  like some of the other reviewers  have a suspicion that these are not truly hanes comfortsoft t shirts  they are not nearly as soft as the other comfortsoft shirts i have  purchased at a brick and mortar store   did not come in typical store packaging  not necessarily a sure sign that they are counterfeit   and most of all  these colors do not seem to appear on the hanes amazon store or on the hanes website  but hey  i like all the color options   even if they are not actually made by hanes  i like the t shirt and think the quality is very good for the price  my only complaint is that they are not quite as soft as i was hoping  but that is not a deal breaker for me      
205,3.0,                       i had several black hanes tees from years ago that i finally wore out  they were soft and very comfortable   this new version is very thick and almost canvasy   not nearly as comfortable  and kind of itchy  and that s even after washing and wearing them several times      
206,5.0,                       very nice  soft comfortable non restrictive great work shirt easy to wear  better than the white t shirts in the package  they cost a little more but they are worth it  happy with my purchase      
207,5.0,                       sizing is good  i wear a medium shirt but buy large tee shirts  i don t like a tight fit  i m not putting them in the dryer and they are maintaining their size      
208,3.0,                       this is one of      packs  of t shirts advertised as moisture wicking micro fiber all ordered from the same line   just different colors   one was exactly what was described  not this one    one was a cotton blend that was not what was ordered  but still really nice  this one    and one was plain      heavy cotton  not this one    i will wear all three   so i kept them   but for someone looking for the very nice soft microfiber moisture wicking t shirt described   this ain t it      
209,5.0,                       i will be reordering in different colors true to fit in width and length   i ve found many  less expensive  shirts run a little short in the length but these fit great fairly heavy t shirt that doesn t seem to shrink much at all can t beat the price for a good quality t if your fit normally runs between sizes i suggest ordering the larger size then washing in warm water if needed      
210,1.0,                       the tags on these shirts very clearly say     cotton      polyester  i m returning them  so stupid  these sellers should be taken down immediately from amazon and fined or something      
211,1.0,                       i should have read the other reviews  these are possibly counterfeit and have no similarity to any other official hanes t shirt i ve purchased from amazon or any other retail store  the material is thicker than the standard comfortsoft shirt and it has tags instead of the tagless design      
212,5.0,                       great deal  great feel  nice   long to tuck in  comfortable around neck     
213,5.0,                       i like the way these shirts are made  they have good material  and fit just right  they aren t too short  or with short sleeves  for an inexpensive shirt  they re great  no pocket  but just nice to put on a clean  new shirt  i go through tshirts in about a month  no matter how expensive they may be  so these are perfect for me      
214,2.0,                       states      cotton on the tag  but this is the scratchiest  worst      cotton i ve ever felt  i was surprised it wasn t at least     polyester  poor quality  very disappointed  hanes is usually pretty reliable   or at least they were  we got the sapphire color  it seems from the reviews different colors have different quality      
215,2.0,                       these aren t bad for the price  but they aren t comfortsoft   i wonder if they are even legit hanes  i ordered   packs for tie dye  the s and m came as expected in hanes packaging  and the fabric felt correct  the tagless label said comfortsoft  but on this pack of large  the fabric was not as soft  the tags don t say comfortsoft  and it they came in an unlabeled clear plastic package  they worked for tie dye but i didn t get what i paid for  the tie dye project was last night  so i had no time to return them      
216,1.0,                       i ordered a xl size which fits fine at the shoulders and the length was ok   however  the t shirt doesn t doesn t taper at the torso   resulting in a wide  loose fitting look  this would be fine for sleeping in  if not for the rough material      
217,1.0,                       these are not hanes comfortsoft shirts i wear hanes comfortsoft shirts on a daily basis and have purchased from many retailers online and in store  hanes comfortsoft shirts are mid weight  soft  and do not have a tag  the logo  size  and care instructions are printed on the inside of the shirt  these shirts are heavy weight  course  and have a tag  printed on the inside is the size and  made in el salvador   no care instructions furthermore  i always take a size medium  these shirts say medium  but are comically huge  like an xl  hanes sizing is consistent  come on      
218,1.0,                       these are not hanes products  but some imitation  using a cheap  sewn in tag   the shirts are itchy  and do not fit to size   i would return them  but washed them  cold water  to minimize shrink   so will now donate them i do not recommend buying from this seller      
219,1.0,                       so rough  no way  no how this is considered soft  i really just wanted t shirts to sleep in but these fail miserably  they shrunk in a funny way  now they are shortand wide  size l   i just wanted to replace the really soft hanes t shirt that was about    years old until my wife tore it      
220,3.0,                       ordered black xl as i did all other brand even other haines products  to small really tight at chest  so i ordered   xl  gray way too large  so  xl ash should be a fit  ordered and received but  too big   wonder if this is a knock off  just saying      
221,2.0,                       the fit is not great and the material is on the rough side   doesn t fit the name  comfortsoft    the color is also quite a bit brighter than the picture   more of a bright turquoise   even a couple of washes  they have not softened      
222,5.0,                       i m a  x gal  i mainly bought these shirts for my son so no big loss  but i had hoped to wear the  x on me and have him be able to have his portion a bit large on him   i can wear these  but they re a bit tight   i am an ample girl though so it could be body shape  i m pear shaped but more towards an edra than a typical pear   the son though gets some lovely shirts that fit him well and i m not out anything because i had a back up plan       the burgundy color looks really good  and it doesn t seem to run on first washing reviewed                
223,5.0,                       i love these shirts and i like the color to  after washing they shrunk a little bit but that s what i wanted  i m happy with the purchase and will buy more      
224,2.0,                       not a bad value  but hanes has slipped  the neck is like a boat  the length is like a dress  the cotton isn t bad  but not as high quality as hanes built their reputation on  these will not last as long as hanes shirts used to  if you are okay with replacing them earlier  and the shirt not having that stellar shape and detailing you ve come to expect  then they cost effective  pretty evident that hanes has gone for price over quality      
225,1.0,                       after a single wash  my large t shirts shrank to the size of a small  probably the most extreme shrinkage i have ever experienced  by comparison  a similar pack of fruit of the loom t shirts i bought a few years back didn t shrink at all  so i am guessing hanes uses some kind of truly inferior cotton in this product  in any case  i can t wear them after one wash  another goodwill donation i guess      
226,1.0,                       i used to like hanes brand in the past  but their quality is just under decline in the past few years  this t shirt is simply dreadful  and i should thought twice when i saw the price tag  for those who are looking for a comfort t shirt that does not  scratch  your skin  you should avoid hanes in any possible way  the t shirt does not feel like      cotton at all    more like polyester  i compared that with all my other      cotton t shirt  this one is just not feeling right at all      
227,5.0,                       i got a pack of these grey hounds and let me tell ya  i like em  with hanes you can t go wrong with the soft quality  the shirts fit well and for a sweaty betty like me it s an extra plus that with their comfort comes breathability  i would recommend these for those summer walks or when you re in need of an undershirt but don t want to look like you just hopped out of the shower as a consequence        shirts      
228,1.0,                       product is nothing like advertised or expected  colors were supposed to be grey  navy  black and a green color    i received   black and   grey  quality is also lacking  i buy hanes tshirts for my husband regularly and although these came in hanes packaging  they are coarse and stiff and the neckline is completely different  don t bother      
229,2.0,                       i was really disappointed in these t shirts  in the past i always considered hanes to be a company that sold good quality underwear but i guess like everything else that s no longer true  the third time i wore one of these t shirts a hole developed in the armpit area  also i don t mind a label on the collar but this also has an annoying label on the side near the waist as well  too much and definitely not necessary  i doubt i ll buy anymore clothing site unseen again      
230,5.0,                          lbs       fits me nice as a nice thick undershirt  i like to use these to exercise as it soaks up a lot of sweat  protects my black shirts from the stains my antiperspirant gives when i wear them under my work shirts  also an excellent value when i bought them  around      best part is that the collar seems to be holding up  usually undershirts stretch way out and wrinkle but these are looking fairly professional so far about a month in with heavy use   constant cleaning  i feel a slight wrinkle on the one i m wearing now but it s still right on my neck which is what i want  got to cover up my chest hair at all costs for a professional look      
231,1.0,                       i am not sure why amazon allows counterfeit items to be sold  these are completely fake  for one thing  they smell horrible  one of the shirts is already unraveling  thankfully i am able to send them back  i ve noticed lately that i have been getting a lot of fake items on amazon and i am now starting to shop with their competitors as a result     
232,3.0,                       i am disappointed with the shirts  they were a little big when i tried them on prior to washing  i figured that they might shrink a bit once washed  thought they are not supposed to   sadly  they shrunk more so than expected and are now a tight fit      
233,2.0,                       the reviews are unfortunately true  i read many reviews that the shirts didn t seem authentic since they came in a simple clear bag  with no brand logo  etc   i thought maybe those customers purchased from unauthorized sellers selling inauthentic items so i was      to purchase from the  amazon com  seller my shirts still arrived in a simple clear plastic bag  no brand  no logo  nothing   picture    the shirts themselves are very thin  you can see right through them in picture    this picture has no zoom of any kind  just nothing but bright light on the other side  the shirts are also not  super comfortable    they just feel like plain  old  regular tee shirts   nothing extra soft or special about them lastly  the material content on the shirts are completely different than the amazon listing  the listing showed       cotton   which is why i bought them  unfortunately  the shirts are actually     cotton     polyester   last picture  if you want a regular  rough tee that is cheap  this is your shirt   for those of you looking for something more substantial  this isn t the tee for you      
234,4.0,                       i bought these shirts before and these are not the same   they are scratchy  yes i washed them  and fit really tight   i put one of my old ones in and it is night and day very disappointed   the tag looks fake to me  they probably are hanes  but i question   last time i buy these  nothing comfort or soft about them      
235,5.0,                       i was apprehensive about buying these because they have the tag on them  but hanes must use special thread because the tags don t scratch at all  i most appreciate that these t shirts have no polyester or other synthetics in them  they re also a very thick  quality weave  since i wear a t shirt for one day before tossing it in the laundry  these have already gotten quite a few washes  dry wrings  and  usually  line dries  they ve held up very nicely  there s no piling yet  not even in the high friction underarms region  and they re so comfortable i leave them on when i get home from work until bedtime i didn t used to pay attention to the fabric mix of my t shirts until  annoyed  i realized i kept having to replace them often  sure enough  they were either mixed  poly cotton  or even all poly  never again   another benefit of pure cotton is it washes very easily and releases dirt quickly  poly mix t shirts  at least mine  never come out fully clean these hanes t shirts have earned their way into our household staples and i m sure i ll be buying quite a lot more  especially given the unbeatable price      
236,4.0,                       i don t know what to say    the large are too big   the mediums are too tight  depending on if you want tight or very loose  they re good shirts  i cut off the sleeves  will do for now  i can never find a happy in between      
237,1.0,                       i ordered from these guys   months ago and a few days ago with the only difference being from a size m to l and i got entirely different pack that doesn t even come in hanes packaging and it has a tag unlike the previous order  poor quality cotton  itchy and very firm to the point where your body doesn t look normal in it because of its straightness and unwillingness to conform to the movment of the body  this was also the case for the first purchase from then when i bought the medium pack but it came really tight and going from medium to large feels like going up     sizes  terrible buy  definitely going to return it      
238,4.0,                       i like the look and feel of the shirts   i chose black to wear under a sweater or casual shirt because my white tees seem to go grey fairly quickly  perhaps due to hard water      
239,1.0,                       these tee shirts are unacceptable   they were supposed to be hanes tees  i received   off brand t shirts that are as rough and stiff as a board even after two washings in a perfectly good washing machine and tumbled on gentle in a dryer with soften sheets   the tees bore no tags or imprint in the back neck as all good products do especially hanes who are only first quality   i advise anyone contemplating buying tee shirts on amazon to be aware and make sure the tee shirts you order are brand name and a known product   very disappointed   my man will not wear them   i hope amazon can intervene and take the seller off the sales list on site  i d hate for others to be disappointed as i am      
240,3.0,                       i ve bought hanes tees many times over the years  these aren t as soft as those  in fact they re a little scratchy  i like the length  longer than most size small tees i ve gotten recently  that s a definite plus  but again  not super soft  lastly  i can t remember the last time i bought a hanes tee with a tag in it  makes one wonder if they re actually hanes tees      
241,1.0,                       i ve been ordering comfortsoft from hane s for a few years  the fit and tagless nature of the shirts always made them great undershirts for typical day to day  my recent order came today to cycle out some of my older  worn shirts  unfortunately  this review will echo the other bad reviews  the shirts that arrives had the  tear away  tag on poor quality fabric  it s a shame  the hunt for a new undershirt begins      
242,1.0,                       nothing close to  comfortsoft  at all as stated  even after several washes and dry  these shirts are still itchy and uncomfortable and if you are wearing it during warm days you will sweat in them and it will become itchy on your skin  i wear this as my undershirt for work while wearing my uniform issued short sleeve button down shirt and i m already sweating within minutes  i had   older versions of hanes comfortsoft ts  just like these ones before and they were very soft and not itchy to wear  the material was perfect and not too thick or too thin  these newer ones here are just ridiculously too thick and itchy      
243,3.0,                       as other reviewers have stated  these do not say  comfortsoft  and are not tagless  they may be hane s and they may be      cotton  but they are just low quality t shirts  i ordered this item in early      and they were tagless  said  comfortsoft   and were fairly comfortable for a t shirt  the last   times ordering  i received shirts with tags that said  hane s   but did not say  comfortsoft  and were not quite as comfortable  regarding cotton content   there are different grades of cotton  an item could be      cotton and still be scratchy or it could be a very high quality cotton fiber and be silky smooth  these are just cheap  basic t shirts  i need them for work and i am not expecting them to last forever anyway  last package of   lasted about   months and that package was supplementing the other   i already had   my speculation is that this is a t shirt made by hanes in bulk for amazon to hit a certain price point  about       each retail   amazon does need to modify the description if they are not comfortsoft else we are wading into false advertising territory      
244,1.0,                       this is more about the listing than the shirts  i bought three different colors and each was different  one was thick       cotton  second was thin      cotton  while the third was     cotton      polyester  even though the banner in the middle of the page says       cotton   and from reading reviews  even with the same color  the shirts you receive may be different depending on where they are sourced  this is ridiculous and amazon should put a stop to it      
245,1.0,                       purchased navy blue   pack  did not notice  no pocket  washed on warm  dried warm and run small  every other tshirt i own is xtra large for a perfect fit  these after a cool wash and dry are tight like large not xtra large  most likely make overseas where people are like beanpoles  very rough feeling materials for     cotton  used fabric softener and dryer sheets and still feel like foreign non cotton material  returning for refund      
246,4.0,                       great shirts for the price  thin but very sturdy  not see through  hemming is loose and wide but hasn t caused problems yet  one came with strings hanging off the hem  but it didnt unravel  texture is medium  not soft but comfortable enough for an autistic person  some shrinkage on the first wash  but not enough to take it down a size  i m very satisfied with the color  maroon  and fit  large       
247,1.0,                       i was looking for the  perfect fit t  that hanes used to make  their medium fit me  well  perfectly  i am           cm  and around    lb  generally medium shirts fit me well  however thse shirts are at least a full size larger than i would expect a medium fit  also the cut of these shirts is fairly boxy and the fabric has no stretch to it so if you re looking for something that fits like a trash bag  this might be for you  otherwise look elsewhere      
248,4.0,                       shirt does come with tag  not quite as soft as i would expect from hanes   prob not a true hanes shirt  it did soften up after washing tho  but they work for me and what i need them for  undershirts for chef coat  it did shrink some when washed  but i was kind of hoping for that when i first tried it on  i m woman and ordered size m   normally size l xl in lady shirts   usually a size m l in tshirts     
249,3.0,                       i thought these shirts would be soft  i remember buying a pair from the store a while back and it was soft  and stretchy  this is more like rough and basic  and for     for pack of four seems like they re swindling us for these basic shirts      
250,1.0,                       these are definitely not comfort soft as advertised  my husband has been getting hanes for years and we made the mistake of ordering them here because we found a good deal  well  you get what you pay for  these must be a knock off or something  they were rough and itch even after a wash  when we got them we realized there was no way they were true hanes shirts  we submitted a return request but the seller was going to charge a     restocking fee and we had to pay for shipping so beware prior to buying  we tried washing a couple times to see if they would get any better but no luck  so we are now using as cleaning rags  so if you re okay with low quality itchy and rough undershirts  then buy these      
251,3.0,                       this is the end my friend     of me buying hanes products  what do they coat the shirt with itching powder  looks good  then you put it on and slowly but surely you start itching  don t be fooled by its good looks  comes in    beautiful colors of itch  excuse me  i need to go get my back scratcher  update  goes away after washing  must be a chemical  wrinkle easily  good colors  ok     
252,5.0,                       these are my favorite so far of your  big brand  bulk tshirts  they fit great and are very comfortable  i don t do anything special or use any special detergent and these have stayed black and the same size after   washes  when you order them from amazon they will ship in economy style packaging which equates to   shirts  loosely laid together in one unmarked thin plastic bag which is a okay with me  i m sure it cuts cost and lowers price  very good buy here  i will likely buy more when these do finally start to fade or wear      
253,4.0,                       my husband bought both large and medium   he is      and slim figured  he typically wears a large  but at first when he tried them on the large size it looked too big for him  he looked a little frumpy and disproportion  then he tried on the medium size one and it was just a tad to tight on him making it uncomfortable to wear  we then figured it out that the length of the large t shirt was the problem for the large sized one   it was about       inches too long  he liked the material and the fit of the t shirt  so i had them sewn up to match his regular preferred length   he sprayed his own decal on them and enjoys wearing them now  they did not shrink after i washed them and dried them on high heat  the material is thicker  old school  than the new modern type t shirts
