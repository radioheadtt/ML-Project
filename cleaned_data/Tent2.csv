0,2.0,                       while the tent is well made and easy to assemble  it more realistically holds about   people at max  the most disappointing thing was that it clearly says this comes with   horses  see the attached picture   i only received the tent  no ponies      
1,5.0,                       my girlfriend and i just got back from electric forest  it was my first time using this tent  it was super windy and was raining buckets to the point where there were inches of standing water outside the tent  see photo   without even treating it with campdry or any sealant  we were bone dry and cozy in this tent for five days  and we only had the rain fly on and a tarp that covered about half the tent  it is a freaking tank  been camping my whole life and never had a tent this waterproof  it s also super breathable even with the rain fly and a tarp  the little vent near the bottom is a great feature  do yourself a favor and get this tent and a big tarp to go over it  and maybe a drop cloth to protect the bottom  and i promise you ll be dry in any storm  plus  bonus points for being super easy to set up  and tall enough to stand in  can t wait to use this tent again  it s better than any of the more expensive tents i ve ever used tip for getting it back in the bag fold in half longways  then fold in thirds longways  then roll    rain fly just folded a few times and rolled and had no problems getting it all back in the bag      
2,5.0,                       my tent just arrived yesterday  i struggled on what to give this tent for a rating because i just got it   i was thinking about giving it a   for average which seemed fair to start with   but after seeing how it handled the wind without breaking or tearing  i decided to give it a   because it surpassed my expectations   i plan on using this tent quite a bit this summer so i will update my rating and review as i go   i found the assembly instructions to be very basic but adequate   anyone who has put up a tent like this before will have no problem   it took me about    minutes   anyway  i set my tent up in my back yard yesterday to see how it looked and how it took on the elements   my first test was wind   i have a weather station and the average wind speed was   to   mph with gusts up to    mph   the back of the tent was torward the wind and when the gusts would come  the back of the tent would bow it quite a bit   i have read the reviews some people have written and see some have had problems with the poles breaking   this is what i was afraid of as i watched the back of the tent bow in   i wish i had taken a picture because it was substantial   anyway  the poles did not break and the tent returned to it s original form when the gust passed every time   i have seen the video on amazon of the testing process coleman puts their tents through   not sure how much wind this tent is rated for but i m pretty sure    mph is close to it s max   the tent looks to be made very well for the price i paid for it   there are only two guidelines that come off the rain fly on the sides of the tent   the tent is staked down on all four corners of the floor plus a floor vent in the back of the tent   in all  there are only   stake down points that i could see  i feel if the tent had some guidelines higher up on each of the four corners of the main body of the tent it could withstand more wind   the stakes are ok but bend fairly easily if the ground is too hard or you hit a rock when pounding them in   i will be buying some better ones before i go camping   i left the tent up over night and checked on it this morning   it held up very well and only one of the stakes for the rain fly guidelines had twisted in the ground causing the guideline to come loose   i left the tent up because it was going to rain today   i need to know if i have any leaks before i take it out camping   it has been raining lightly for two hours now and my weather station says i m getting     inches of rain an hour with a light steady wind of   to   mph   far from what i would consider a hard rain but it s still rain   i went out and looked at just the outside and the water seems to be beading up and running off the rain fly and tent very well   it is supposed to rain until   or    o clock tonight so i will check for water on the inside in the morning   i m hoping not to see any with such a light rain   if there is  i will definitely be spraying the tent down with a waterproofing spray before i take it out camping   now for the pro s and con s pro s     great tent for the price   if your on a fixed budget or are looking for a good starter tent you will not beat this one     very roomy inside   i plan on using this for two people  a shepherd and  all our gear     there is an eyelet at the top of the tent so you can attach a lantern and two side pockets for stowing smaller needed items like a headlamp  cell phone  keys and  so on     there is a small zipper in the bottom front left side of the tent for running wires   see my picture   it is covered by a little yellow strip of material to protect the zipper from the rain   you do not see this feature on most tents   i plan on using it with my solar panel so i can charge my power core  headlamp  cell phone and  other gear from inside the tent out of direct sunlight     i was surprised at how much give the tent had at    mph gusts and did not break any poles or tear  it bounced right back to it s original form con s     you may want to consider buying stronger tent stakes     i wish there was a high point on each of the four corners for attaching extra guidelines   although it handled    mph gusts very well the tent did bow in quite a bit   if i had to guess  the tent was reduce by almost half it s size  if i was inside the tent i know i would have been annoyed being hit by it every time a gust came  i really don t feel the tent as is  could handle much more then that   i m thinking about how to attach extra guidelines in the corners without effecting the structural stability and elasticity of the tent   make sure you pitch this tent in a sheltered area out of the wind if your expecting bad weather update         i went out the next morning after the light rain and the inside was dry   the following day saw more rain showers with substantially more rain   checked the tent again today and it is still dry   after reading some of the reviews i really thought this tent would leak  because this tent has preformed better then expected i have changed my rating to a five   i am going to seal the seams and spray waterproofing on the tent anyway because i would rather be safe then sorry   for the size and price of this tent you will not find a better deal   just remember to pitch your tent in a sheltered area in you are expecting winds and you will not be disappointed   i think i have figured out a way to put up extra guidelines on each of the four corners so the tent will preform better with heavy gusts of wind   i will test it out and take pictures  more to come that is all for now and there will be more updates coming      
3,5.0,                       great tent  i set it up in my backyard  to give it a trial run  and seam seal  before taking it out camping  there are pros and cons   pros carry bag   the tent comes neatly packed in a carry bag  with tent  poles  rain fly  ground stakes  door mat  and instructions setup   easy  set up by myself  with rain fly  in under    minutes  didn t have to look at the directions  only suggestion would be to put the word  front  somewhere on the rain fly to indicate which way it goes  however  a quick glance at the packaging will tell you materials   the tent material seems to be of good quality  and should hold up well when taken care of  the zippers are not heavy duty  but i see no issues with them  the floor is heavy duty tarp material screens   the tent has large screen panels on the  ceiling   which makes for a great view when the rain fly is not on  there is an additional window  and screen on the door for extra viewing and airflow floor vent   there is a vent near the rear of the tent  which allows for additional airflow cord access   there is a small zippered panel in the front corner  that let s you run an extension cord into the tent other  pros  i got the navy grey tent  and the colors are cool  got some compliments from the neighbors on it  i like that the rain fly comes with the guy lines already attached  the interior gear pockets are fine  good for holding your phone  wouldn t stuff them with anything heavy  there is a little  ring  at the center of the ceiling  to hang a small light  while you could technically fit   queen air mattresses  i would not  it leaves no floor space for gear  i will put in one mattress  and leave the other half of the tent for my kids pack n  play  and gear  it will fit the   of us comfortably  however  unless you intend to get cozy  i wouldn t advise this for   adults  but it could be done  cons stakes   the stakes are just ok   they are the generic skinny steel ones  i would recommend spending an extra     bucks and buy some good ones footprint   the tent doesn t come with a footprint  though i imagine this helps keep the cost so low  not a big deal  i use a tarp anyways door screen   the upper half of the door can be unzipped to reveal the screen window  i really would have liked if the entire door could be screen  not just the top half i also purchased some coleman seam sealer  and sealed all the seams inside the tent  and the rain fly  some of the seams are taped  but it s just good practice to spend the time to do this  no matter what brand cost etc tent you have  it saves headache down the road overall  i m very pleased with the tent  and the cost  it will work well for short camping trips with a small family  couple  or individual      
4,4.0,                       to start  this is a fantastic tent to take the family out for the weekend during warm weather  it is spacious  has plenty of headroom  has an awesome full tarp liner for the bottom  i still recommend placing another ground tarp down before setting up the tent to avoid any rips or tears in the tents bottom  let the cheaper replaceable ground tarp take that beating  if you are going for a multi day float trip this tent couldn t be better  or if you are camping where your car is accessible and weight is not so much of an issue this tent is awesome  and as far as my comment about the weight  its a   person tent  so i cant really complain that much  i acknowledge my bias  i prefer  lb  man tents  thought not nearly as spacious or user friendly  i got this tent because i knew i wanted more room for the dog and to get my girlfriend to actually enjoy camping  but i didn t expect this tent to be this huge  we had more than enough room for the two of us and my dog  lab pointer mix  with plenty of room for our packs this tent will keep you dry  i took this tent on a multi day float trip from missouri down into arkansas  during which time i got rained on and the river even came up to one corner of the tent bottom and not a drop came into the tent if you are an average camper who isn t so much into the long distance backpacking this tent is awesome  seriously  you should just buy it now if you fit in that category now here are my critiques  and my comments for those more adventurous people looking for a tent this is not a cold weather tent  this is also the reason i didn t give it the full   stars  i took this tent out for a trip to the spanish peaks in colorado and camped out multiple nights  it was mid may and we camped at   k ft  the night dropped down to the low    s f and we were freezing  the gusts of wind would run right through this tent  this tent has a big mesh ceiling  a tall ceiling  and a large breathable mesh hole on the back wall  all of this is great for warm environments  however  it does not hold in heat  it expels it  it is too breathable for cold or windy environments for those looking for a winter tent  i am not saying that you want a tent that is totally sealed up  tents that are totally sealed up cause you to sweat and holds in the moisture  moisture is your enemy in below freezing condition  you want something breathable  but you also want to keep in the heat  look for something with a lower ceiling and a rain fly that runs all the way to the ground  including covering up the doors  people use that area for their boots usually   tents that have those types of rain fly s will have slots cut out that you can open to get a small amount of breathability out of the rain fly  with the addition of a rain fly like that i would say that this tent would fully fall into that  rd season they advertise  but without a beefed up rain fly i would argue that this tent is more compatible for summer camping only  this rain fly keeps out the rain exceptionally well  but not so much the wind   i would also advise any backpackers  to take a wool blanket to set as a floor mat  then lay your sleeping pads on that  you will be much warmer and happier      
5,5.0,                       our first tent was an enormous montana   person tent that used   poles and took    minutes to set up properly   our second tent was an instant double hub dome tent that had permanent poles that kept flipping upside down making it impossible to set up    we returned that one    this tent  however  is no nonsense   two poles to put the tent up   one extra pole to hold the rainfly up   we put the tent up in a florida thunderstorm in less than   minutes  we took another   minutes to set the   guy lines   i didn t get the opportunity to spray and seam seal the tent since it was raining  but it did not leak through some very powerful florida rainstorms  except for a few drops around the electrical port zipper   seal that part especially   the tent moved around and shook through some rough ocean wind  but remained intact   the tent is tall enough to stand up in   ft tall  with room for a queen sized air mattress and tons of space for your stuff   we had a cooler  a big box fan  and two pieces of luggage in there with room to spare   i would say it s perfect for   people  comfortable with    claustrophobic with    and you d have to be desperate to fit   or     there is a port for your electrical cord   two pockets are attached inside  and a welcome mat was included taking the tent down was just as simple   just fold in half twice  then fold into thirds and roll up   it fit right into the bag with no problems   easiest tent i ve ever dealt with i d recommend a   x   tarp to go under the tent and a   x   tarp to go over it   there are two huge mesh panels on the top of the tent  which is great for ventilation  but bad for sideways rain that can sneak under the rainfly   i put the tarp longways over these vents and it kept out the sideways rain but there was still plenty of ventilation there is a hook at the top to attach an led light fan it was fantastic for warm hot weather camping   might be too much ventilation for late fall camping  though  unless i can figure out a way of blocking those mesh panels best tent i ve ever owned      
6,5.0,                       i purchased this tent as a last minute replacement when i discovered all our previous tents had problems that were not things i could immediate fix  so since i ve only used this for a weekend camping trip so far  and in ideal weather  i can t answer a lot but here are my opinions on it   how many can fit   kids could probably fit  if you re an experienced camper then you obviously already knew this wouldn t fit   adults  or even teens  but i just feel the need to specify this  realistically though if you re using camping mats that aren t larger than a sleeping and are adults you could squeeze   with room for bags at your feet  cot wise i was using a tenton sports adventurer so with using that as a reference i would say you could squeeze a maximum of   in there with no real aisle space on either side  maybe a leg width    this is assuming you use the end point to enter and leave as well as storing underneath the cots  if you want more elbow room then i wouldn t put more than   in of that size  you could definitely put   of the xxl version of tenton s cot as well and have space for an aisle between in which case with larger cots you could probably fit   couples comfortably if there aren t a million bags to deal with   is set up easy as someone who has grown up camping this is pretty much your standard tent design in terms of set up  i ended up at the campsite well after dark and had a veteran camper along with a friend who doesn t tent camp often for helping me set it up to which it took us less than   minutes to put up  super easy and does not require instructions if you ve ever put up a tent like it before   how is break down last day of the camp out i ended up having to break down the tent alone so it took me maybe more like    minutes but with help it shouldn t take that long at all  i even managed to get it into the bag with space to spare     i folded in half then into  rds and it fit without any struggle with everything rolled up in the tent  still shocked it fit that easily after years of struggling with other tents to fit back into their bags   is there headroom to stand yes  plenty of head room and probably the roomiest tent i have owned to date  i m      and even with a small hanging light i got for the top of the tent i still had an arms reach above worth of room  closer to the walls obviously it s a bit shorter but i did not feel the slightest bit restricted like a normal small tent has   is it warm on a sunny day with it entirely closed it got a tad warm when i checked in on it but with all the ventilation it has built in already it really doesn t get scorching like some tents do if you don t have any windows open  the first night with this tent it actually got pretty chilly and the tent was assuredly not meant for colder nights  with a better sleeping bag rated for colder weather you should be fine though    mine just was very old and not great against the cold anymore   does it hold up to rain i camped in sunny weather  so i cannot personally review it from experience  but i would say this is not a tent that i would knowingly take on a camping trip that will have rain  the only real reason i say this is because the back has this little vent to let air in around head level if you re sleeping on the ground which is great for summer warm weather but as someone that has been in a flooded tent before it just seems like a horrible feature if you re going up against a storm  some reviews claimed this wasn t a problem though so perhaps it isn t as big of an issue as it just appears to be from my perspective at least overall i love this tent  wish it retained heat a bit more  but definitely look forward to using it again on the next camping trip  feel free to ask any further questions i ll try my best to keep on top of replies      
7,5.0,                       good gosh folks   i bought this   man tent due to the low price and the high scoring reviews here at amazon and the reviews are spot on   i had my eye on quite a few other tents at      to      but i have to say this one caught my eye early on because of the reviews   i said   wtf  order it and see how it performs and if it was all a big lie then i m out a measly      note  on the advice of lots of folks here i purchased a small   oz bottle of  coleman seam sealer   available here or at wal mart    the day the tent arrived i set it up outside on my back deck and sealed all the seams and let it dry for about   hours before folding it back up and putting it away pros  this tent is inexpensive  light weight  easy to erect  and does it s job quite well  it assembles in about   to   minutes  if you ve done it once or twice   the instructions are a perfect guide if you cannot remember the   easy steps camping in the rain   so i went on my first camping trip with it this past weekend and i was caught in an off and on torrential downpour from    pm at night through   am the next morning and guess what   i stayed completely dry and slept very well  i did forget to zip the small electrical cord opening shut for the first few hours and the sideways rain got a few drops in there until i realized it and zipped it tight  i left the vent windows open during the entire storm and had zero issues with water tip  be sure to bring a couple of large black trash bags to put the tent into if you have to break camp while it is still raining  that prevented a huge wet mess inside the car when i departed the camp site time will tell if this is a durable product     but so far so good   like      
8,1.0,                       i am vowing to never buy another coleman product  i purchased the   person sun dome tent in       the tent has been used   times  stored in the house so extreme heat has not compromised the integrity  while taking down the tent the shock cord from one support pole broke  leaving the tent useless  i contacted coleman requesting a replacement pole  they refused to replace pole or even offer for me to buy one replacement pole  they recommend i find help at rei     i did so  they also were unable to repair  the tent now is useless as well as coleman customer service  rei commented they have had many complaints of coleman products and customer service  i have spent thousands of dollars throughout my family s camping years  never again  i will search other brands and suggest others do the same  one tent pole would have made one happy camper      
9,1.0,                       i have used this tent twice in the last   months  pros  set up is super fast and easy  and it has a good amount of space  i fit a queen mattress in there with plenty of room for bags  it also has a lot of little features that are useful  doormat  phone holders  zipper in corner to run cables through if you happen to have electric at your site  cons  the first time i used it was for a   night trip where there was light rain once     min  sprinkle  and i didn t notice any leaking  however  this last weekend  the second time i ve used it and it was for   nights  we were hit with heavier rain  no thunder or lightening but on and off heavy rain for about       min intervals  and this tent could not withstand them  water was leaking through the seams and coming through the tent causing it to pool in the corners and got my bed and some of my stuff all wet  my friends and i were also sitting in the tent when it was raining and were getting sprinkled on  i have attached pictures to show how much water was coming through  zoom in to see how much water pooled in the corner   it was definitely coming from the seams which makes me think this might have been a defective tent since other reviews said there s withstood storms  but alas the one i received did not  super disappointed since i really liked the tent for the price  but i guess you get what you pay for and i will probably not use it again in fear of water leaking through      
10,1.0,                       i bought this item on august  and got it within   days  i then set it up at home  its easy to set it up and my kid loves it  one monthly later  i used that tent in one family campout event in our city park  on that camping night  it has thunderstorms   i thought that tent would be water proof and my family could be safe inside that tent  unfortunately  that tent got a lot of rain water inside and my air mattress and sleep bags got wet  its so bad since my kids are still young  and we had to move to the park office in the midnight since we couldn t sleep in that tent anymore  its really a big messy  that produce video showed it could resist storm water and strong wind  but i should realize that that video was tested for water only or wind only  it didn t test wind   rain  which is a normal thunder storm weather  i was so disappointed at this tent      
11,3.0,                       did a beta test in the yard moderate winds last weekend   reinforced with coughlan abs pegs  set up   shenandoah state park yesterday        site along the shenandoah river   around    or so wind would gust  then around       gust then a snap  tent collapsed and blowing in gust  no one hurt  just packed up a went home  blown away  see attached pic of broken rod     
12,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i bought this tent with the intentions of using it as a single and would say is the perfect size for one person and all your gear with some room to spare two people could def fit comfortably  although it would be better to go up a size with gear   i felt this was of solid quality    especially for     with tax and shipping  the floor seemed durable and all seams were well sealed  my number one concern is keeping bugs out and not once did an ant or spider find its way in the whole trip the interior has two pockets and two zipped vented windows  the white material inside reflects light well when your lantern is directed towards it  on either side of the interior of the rain fly  there is a picture of a lantern encouraging you to direct your light to center for the best light distribution  at top center there is a small plastic ring held by a sewn piece of fabric that is to hold your light or string a line to hold gear  this is good if your light has an actual hook  but i feel they failed by not making it larger or more pouch like and easier to hold more the door of the tent is my greatest complaint  it is d shaped and i prefer one where the d has the straight flat part parallel to the ground that allows you to open center arch and step in this door would open and fall into the tent and require it be opened more than i would like as i would scurry in  at night trying not to allow bugs  beyond that it would awkwardly hang folded and into the tent when open requiring you to roll it and secure with attached external tassels the included tent stakes are out right crap  i bent most of them with less force than expected  i will be buying better and suggest you do in advance set up and break down was easy  took about ten minutes and could be done alone  be careful when putting together tent poles as i stripped frayed the end of one when not lined up perfectly all in all a good tent for         
13,5.0,                       i m not a know it all camper or anything like that  i just like to go a few times every summer and get away with my dog  this tent is perfect  i live in oregon  so you can never be      certain when it will rain  ever since i woke up in a puddle in an old tent  i make sure to only buy tents with this  bathtub  design i just got this tent and set it up by myself in my living room and it took me probably less than    minutes  there was definitely enough room for   people  however  whoever sleeps on the inside backside of the tent  next to the window  will definitely struggle to get out of the tent without waking bothering the other person  this is an awesome tent though and i can t wait to try it soon also  i was able to repackage this tent back into it s carry bag with ease  there was no struggle at all  in fact  there s still enough room that i can toss a small hammer in for the tent stakes  and a small brush to dust off the tent before packing  however  the bag is expandable if you need more room to carry stuff  just remove the tag band on the bottom of the bag  and you ll have more storage room  which is genius in my opinion  especially after i ve really had to stuff some tents to get them back in their bags  barely       
14,1.0,                       this tent is not good in rain  in fact  it is terrible  while camping this past weekend  we had a  surprise rain with about    hours of drizzle and a few good downpours  the tent leaked at the little zipper in the corner where an electrical corn could be inserted through  i woke up to a clothing bag very wet and a puddle   there is no flap material to zip closed to cover the ventilation screening material  consequently  condensation moisture made its way under the fly and into the tent through the side and dome vent screens   everything was slightly moist   top of sleeping bag  top of pillows  coats  etc  also  the grey material  some kind very of thin plastic coating   applied on the inside of the floor was scraping of in tiny patches by the entry   i had a   layer tarp under the tent and a little bath mat to catch dirt and wet  there should not have been any damage to the floor  be aware  this is a summer only tent  do not expect to stay dry inside in rain or heavy mist   i am very disappointed      
15,5.0,                       first of all let me say that i was very sceptical when i bought this tent  i only got it because i needed it last minute and just hoped that it would last long enough for a week s worth of camping   i was happily surprised at the build quality and the ease of use  here are some pros and cons pros   easy to set up  comes with detailed instructions  but if you ve ever put up a tent before you will figure it out even without those   includes everything you need to make it waterproof and guard against wind and mosquitoes pests  plenty of places to hang a light inside  more than enough room for   average size adults   i m       lbs  i could have fit   times comfortably with an air mattress  thankfully i didn t need to but just so you are aware it s perfect for     easy to disassemble and pack   literally takes   person about   minutes to break down and pack for travel  also comes with a carrying pouch   last but not least the price  less than    dollars including expedited shipping  in the picture above you can see my friend s tent on the left  that is also a   person tent but cost him nearly     dollars and what he got for that was a tent that does pack smaller and is lighter  but fitting   people in it is not easy  i tried the first night lol  never again cons   i had trouble actually finding one but if i had one it would be the weight  and even that i think could have been attributed to my decision to get a   person rather than a     it is heavier than a more expensive tent and you will feel it if you are backpacking  which we were    one more con  the pouch  nothing wrong with having one but once you unpack the tent good luck getting it back into the included pouch  a good idea  however poorly executedbottom line  if you are looking for a cheap but durable and backpackable tent this is the one  although if you are thinking of saving weight i d suggest a   person  this one will give you a good workout though and i was fine     we were backpacking on isle royale btw for   days so i packed and unpacked and set this up every time we stopped to camp  and had no issues  fantastic build quality for the price and well worth it in my opinion      
16,5.0,                       i have camped in this tent two and a half times  and i love it   i say two and a half  because my third trip in the tent  i was forced out of it in the middle of tropical depression nate up in big meadows campground in shenandoah national park this past october          it was holding its own for most of it  but eventually the rings came lose from the tent stakes and one tent stake came up out of the ground  and i had to flee my humble abode and dive into my parents  van   i didn t have the stakes driving all the way into the ground  because i wasn t expecting a freaking tropical storm  plus we were in high elevation   i think it would have held its own if i had driven the stakes all the way down   as soon as i got out of it  within   minutes  the thing turned into a kite and sailed right into my parents  van   lol   the first camping trip in this tent  may        it withstood a severe thunderstorm at fall creek falls  tn  and i stayed dry   there was a tiny puddle of water around that small zipper hole in the bottom corner  but i didn t have it zipped closed  so that could be why   the second camping trip  september       at panther creek state park  tn was perfect weather  and the tent was marvelous   i especially love the little zipper in the bottom corner where you can run an electrical cord through it   i like being able to hang a camping light in the top of the tent   during the camping trip with tropical depression nate  my rain fly got ripped pretty badly   i think i ll be able to patch it   i hate to throw away a perfectly good tent because i can t buy a replacement rainfly   this tent is so easy to set up  too   if you have two people  it goes quickly   if you set it up alone  it s mildly cumbersome  but easily doable   a queen sized air mattress will fit in here  but it takes up all the space   you can store some very small things along the sides  but no suitcases or anything   since i m always in mine alone  i use a twin air mattress  and that leaves plenty of room for stuff and to step in and out of the tent   i will say that  once again  the tent bag is too small   i thought i rolled that tent up tight  but not tight enough   the bag split when i tried to zip it   i think those little green ties they include might have been helpful to keep the rolled tent from expanding   but they could make a slightly bigger bag  too   it s forever a problem with tents   i have included pictures with the queen sized and twin sized air mattresses      
17,1.0,                       ok so pay attention to this before you buy  this tent only has   full walls that close  the other   sides are full on mesh that have no way to be shut  the rainfly covers them but they remain open at all times  so be fully aware before you buy  had i realized this i would have never made this purchase  but because i took it camping now i won t be returning it  i mean seriously think about how limiting this feature is  no cold weather  no dust or sand  no wind  no rain   on and on  everything will fly into your tent    this has got to be the most bizarre tent i have ever seen or ever used  i took it out on a trip and it got to    overnight  needless to say it was a few very cold nights with only   sides to your tent  just unbelievable   and the locking pin assembly is ridiculous  most tents have little pockets that you put the poles into to keep the poles steady and rigid and add stability and strength to the bottom of the tent  this tent is a waste of money     
18,5.0,                       great tent  i m a relatively experienced camper  it took me and a friend about    minutes to get it setup   super easy  loved that even my friend that is about      could easily stand up in the center of the tent  after checking mine out he decided to get one too  however  i doubt you can fit   queen sized blowup mattresses in there though  we had one double high queen mattress and a single twin one  not much room between the mattresses but we had at least     feet from the end of our mattresses to the door so there was room for our bags and such  liked that there   pockets   one on each side to hold your headlamp  phone  or whatever you need to have close by while sleeping      
19,5.0,                       i have never been camping before  but bought this to take to a music festival   i chose this one based on prior reviews  as rain was in the forecast   it did not let me down   it rained heavily on saturday night and throughout sunday  and everything inside stayed perfectly dry   it was also very simple to set up and tear down by myself   i fit a queen size air mattress inside with room to spare  but i think this would be a tight fit for   people      
20,1.0,                       the very first time we used this tent was to go camping for memorial day weekend  on the first night the zipper got stuck  in order to get it unstuck  force was needed  from that point on the zipper kept malfunctioning  at one point to get out of the tent force was needed to move it and the entire zipper ripped  from then on the zipper was useless and the rest of the tent began to rip  so the tent did not last the first night on mount greylock in the berkshires in massachusetts  luckily for us  it was very windy  cold  and raining for the rest of the three day weekend  this tent was poorly made  and i am waiting to hear back from them about a refund      
21,2.0,                       i am reminded today  upon erecting this tent for the first time  why it is such a gamble to shop for bulky  expensive to return  items online  the photo for this coleman tent is very misleading  you think you are buying a four sided tent with two windows  a door and a rainfly when  instead  with the rainfly removed it becomes apparent that it is a two wall tent with two of the four sides comprised only of mesh  while this may be ideal for summer ventilation  it s not good for privacy as there is a gap between the rainfly and the bottom edge of the  windows   without that rainfly in place  there is no remaining privacy in the tent to speak of thanks to the  open sided  design my goal was to purchase a tent that could work in emergency situations  such as the aftermath of an earthquake  where people do not feel safe  or their home isn t safe  to reenter   alas  i was reminded  after the recent     and     july   holiday weekend earthquakes here in california  that access to a quick form of shelter is a big part of emergency preparedness  where i live  rain is rarely the issue as much as wind  this tent design is likely to take on a lot of blowing dust because two out of the four sides can t be zipped up   coleman has given no option to close either  window    a drop down window shade would have been nice even if the only means of securing them was an option to tie them to the sidewalls    meanwhile  because the rainfly is a bit too small  wind  and possibly rain  can enter the tent even when it the rainfly is in place  what s more  the presence of the two largely opened sides means that the tent will feel drafty in cooler weather   for summer camping this may not be a deal breaker but for emergency use   when you can t pick your weather or your season   it could be a  big  problem  i spent hours shopping for a tent yet was unprepared for what i would receive despite comparing reviews on numerous tents in the four to six person size range  in hindsight  i can only speculate that this tent is well reviewed because many reviewers live areas where summer storms are more common than they are here in california   in which case keeping the rainfly on with each and every use is to be expected  ideally  however  use of the rainfly would have been optional and tent privacy would not have been the worse for having left it off   a related drawback to this design is that if the rainfly is damaged  the tent will provide no real protection from the elements because there is no way to close the windows from the interior of the tent   what s more  in the course of my research  i learned that coleman doesn t offer much in the way of replaceable parts for tents under       so if the rainfly rips or a pole breaks  it s essentially scrap heap time if you intend to use this tent only for summer camping and don t mind gaps between the rainfly and the  windows  because you camp predominately in isolated  private secluded  areas  this tent might be for you  however  if you want the option to close up the mesh  windows   sides  to improve privacy or cut down dust and drafts   or you re simply concerned that wind blown rain may enter the tent from beneath the rainfly   then my suggestion to you is to keep on looking      
22,5.0,                       the key to loving the coleman sundome   person tent is to understand what you are buying   for around        you are getting a great tent used for the occasional weekend camping trips with your kids or family   i purchased   of these tents to use for backyard campouts sleepouts that my kids want to have with their friends   for the price  they are great for that   i will also use one of the tents with my son for weekend cub scout campouts   again  this is the perfect tent to use during a summer fall weekend campouts where you are not carrying the tent a long distance what this tent is not is a backpacking tent or a tent to be used often or in very cold weather   i have a kelty trail ridge   tent that i use for backpacking or when the weather is supposed to be under    degrees f overnight   it has better poles  is lighter and much smaller  making it about half the weight of the coleman sundome    again  this tent is not perfect for all activities   the fiberglass poles are not suited for heavy winds or very frequent use   the rain fly only covers the top half of the tent meaning in a heavy rain wind  you are likely to get wet   the stakes are the cheap tin one that bend after only a few uses   so if you intention is to campout for several weeks at a time or go backpacking  look elsewhere   but for    bucks  this tent is a great value for the accessional family campout for a long weekend a few other notes    this is the same   pole dome tent that coleman has been making for a long time   however this sundome   has a few revision i like   the rainfly has   sets of velcro attachments that connect it to each of the main tent cross poles   in previous version there was only one attachment per side    also  this version has a small loop in the center of the tent to allow you to hang a small light   i recommend this one as a cheap and lightweight tent light         pack sanniu portable led lantern tent light bulb for camping hiking fishing emergency light  battery powered camping equipment gear gadgets lamp for outdoor   indoor blue                            lastly this version has a small ground vent that allows air to come in from the bottom of the tent to help reduce condensation   also  there is a small zippered section in the front left corner that would allow you to bring an extension cord into the tent away from the door  where it is a tripping hazard  if you need a tent to use during the warm nights and for     days at a time  this is a great inexpensive option      
23,1.0,                       this tent has two sides that are all mesh  they can be covered with the rain fly  mine didn t have the rain fly in the box which w didn t discover until we were at the island we were camping on  we had to sleep in this tent in    degree weather with the mesh sides open  we were freezing  it was windy and cold      
24,5.0,                       love this tent  we re not big  outdoors  people  i needed a tent that s easy to set up and comfortably fits a queen size air mattress   this tent exceeded my expectations  the last time i set up a tent was in the    s  and the tent was from the    s    this is a dream to set up  i put the tent together in our backyard by myself and inflated the air mattress within the tent  i also hung a little led lantern from the center inside the tent  we had some extra room along the side of the mattress  but i wouldn t recommend this tent for more than two adults  enjoyed our night under the stars with one adult  one   year old and a french bulldog  breaking everything down was a breeze too      
25,1.0,                       did not stand up to   mph wind   the tent ripped apart   i am a long term coleman customer  with      nights of tent camping   i will not buy their products again      
26,5.0,                       i did a ton of research and read a lot of reviews here on amazon before finally deciding that this was the tent i was going to purchase   i was looking for a decently priced  easy to set up  portable tent for one person   i wanted to use it for backpacking as well as other campsite adventures   i just used it for the first time this weekend so i don t have experienced feedback yet i suppose  but thought i would share my findings so far while they re fresh this tent was great for my needs   i have camped several times before so i am not new to it  however this was my first time where i would be sleeping in a tent alone  therefore transporting  setting up and taking down the tent myself   i took it on a up north camping trip in the woods this weekend in northern michigan with some friends   extremely easy to set up   you really can do it in minutes   i took my time with it while having a beer though  so maybe       minutes for me   everything you need to set up comes with it i did not use the rainfly because there was no rain in the forecast but i m sure it works great  this  awning  type is what you want   i also didn t put it on because i wanted to be able to look up at the stars at night  and let me tell you  that was amazing   such a clear night and in the woods of northern michigan you can see an insane amount of stars  along with the milky way   that was just too cool to be able to look at them through my tent ceiling   the windows of the tent were great too   i ll see if i can post a photo of my awesome spot in the photos section although it did not rain at all  yay   there was still a ton of moisture from the air dew   so much that if you left your sleeping bag out  like my friend did  in the open for an hour or two  it will literally become wet like it did rain   my sleeping bag that i put in the tent right away still got some moisture on it  but there is nothing you can do about that if there is that much moisture in the air   may have been better if i closed the windows and put the rainfly on but it really was no big deal at all as for the actual sleeping space inside  it was totally fine for me   i am a little over      and i would say medium weight  not fat but not skinny   it was exactly what i was looking for  just enough space for me to sleep and my backpack   i would not recommend this as a two person tent though unless you are using it with a sig  other and want to cuddle all night and look at the stars   in my opinion  it was the perfect amount of space for one   two adults would probably be tight   also  i used one of those self inflating sleeping pads  regular size  and that fit well in there too although my walk to this particular site was not long at all  only      minutes  i would definitely use it for backpacking    that was what i had in mind when i first purchased it    you would need a backpacking backpack  it won t fit inside a regular sized backpack   i m sure you could strap it on the outside of a regular one though   doesn t come with straps but the bag has handles so you could strap it on by putting a rope or whatever through those hope that helps   i tried to think of everything i was looking for when i begun my search      
27,5.0,                       set it up in the back yard with impending week of heavy rain   heavy  downpours  wind  for   days   the main problem was getting in and out during a storm   due to the small overhang of the rain fly  and the angle of the door  water would come in when entering and exiting also the flaps that cover the zipper would blow over and expose the zipper  then rain would come through the zipper   mind you this was extreme weather and   days of it   no other leaks except the zipper  held up great and i consider it a great tent for the money i like how open and airy it is with the rain fly off   using it at the beach in a week   going to enjoy the sea breezing coming though the tent      
28,1.0,                       i wasn t expecting much for the price but i used this tent once on clear  flat terrain and by the end of the trip  i noticed a hole in the bottom tarp lining  we made sure to clear any rocks and sticks before putting the tent down  so this was particularly surprising   there was nothing sharp on the inside of the tend  no shoes  nothing   just an air mattress and some clothes  so it definitely wasn t user error that was what confirmed my decision to return the tent  but it wasn t the only reason   the tent poles are flimsy and bough out when you first prop it up   the rain fly  once strapped down  provides a little extra support   the tent poles don t bough out as far once it s on   with that said  i could easily see myself breaking a pole   or   uses down the road   again  i wasn t expecting much given the price of the tent  but i at least thought it would last the season   if you go camping with any regularity  this is not the tent for you      
29,5.0,                       i camp often  think about half of each month in the spring  summer and fall  i ve had many tents over the years but this one takes the cake  it s incredibly easy to set up  two people can have it up in less than    minutes once you do it one time  or have used other tents in this style before  the head room is great  i m   feet tall and can stand and move comfortably in this tent which is a blessing  my favourite thing about this tent though   and i mean absolute favourite   is that it stays dry  i camped on the coast of maine for   weeks over the summer  where every morning a thick fog would roll through the woods  it also rained frequently  this tent got not a drop of water in it  i ve never had a tent that stayed so dry  there s also a vent near the floor of one side which helps keep inside condensation to a minimum  if you ve ever camped and ended up with that  damp blanket  feeling  this is a great tent to try to eliminate that      
30,4.0,                       been camping for the past    years and have had many tents  both very expensive and cheap and affordable   if you buy an affordable tent like the coleman  we love coleman  be sure to seam seal it and spray with water resistant spray for tents   that will make it just as waterproof as a really expensive tent for a fraction of the cost   also  keep in mind  that no matter if the tent is expensive or affordable  you have to go up in size   a two person tent will just about fit one person   i bought this   person for me and two small dogs and i know it will be tight if i put in a queen sized blow up bed   for my grandson and son  i bought the   person which i know will be good for just the two of them   if you take care of your tent it will last a long time   i have a very  very large old coleman tent that still works as long as i seam seal it every year and spray it with water resistant spray for tents   it is harder to put up so i bought this   person and the   person because we need to get it up easily for a long car trip  otherwise i would use the old coleman tent      
31,5.0,                       just bought this tent and used for the first time camping this past week  the tent is really spacious and we were able to easily fit a queen size inflatable mattress  an xl dog bed    suitcases and a bunch of bags and still had room to move around  this worked great for   adults and a med large dog plus all of our stuff  it went up in under ten minutes the tent served us well through the week but the real test came during a late night storm  we only had the corners staked and tied because the weather was nice but we got a surprise storm and even with the sides not tied down  the tent held up  we were able to get the sides staked and tied quickly which was great because it turned into incredibly strong winds  rain  and lighting  not only did the tent protect us from the wind and rain  it also stayed bone dry through everything due to the great rainfly coverage and bathtub bottom  this tent is made of very high quality materials and we were very happy with the purchase      
32,4.0,                       bought this tent right before a road trip to accommodate my nephew  who cancelled  plenty of space for    i m used to backpacking tents  and this will sleep   just don t expect the space of a hotel    we traveled to   national parks over spring break       guadalupe mountain np  carlsbad cavern np  and big bend np  these parks are in dessert  so i didn t expect any rain  i was wrong  apparently rain dances follow you because i haven t seen more fog  misting and rain in my life  this tent stayed bone dry inside  the tie out points for the navy grey model are wrong as my tent lacks corner tie outs  it does have the middle tie out on the short side as pictured  be aware of this as the directions tell you to point the short side into the wind  time will tell how important the tie out are  my experience in badlands np winds can change direction an important feature this tent has that caused me to buy it over other tents is the rear window  most of the tents i saw lack a rear window  which means you lack control of any cross wind  during my trip i kept the tent closed up  but the warmest night we had them open to allow air circulation proskept me dryrear windowconslacks corner tie outs     
33,5.0,                       perfect for two people camping over a weekend  we fit a queen air mattress and a rubbermaid storage bin in it with no problem a note on performance in terrible weather  our first outing with this tent was cut a day short by a severe  thunderstorm in southern wisconsin that absolutely soaked the insides of two other tents in our party  one was a coleman montana that didn t have its weather shield entirely fitted properly   we pulled up stakes  and water didn t enter the tent until we pulled the weather sheet off we reset the tent up in our basement for a day to fully dry it out  with no issues and no mildew smell the next time we used it two items of concern  i worry about long term durability  as the pressure points where the tent pole clips connect to the tent hint at signs of eventual wear  also  at a campground with about    other campsites visible  at least   other people had the exact same tent     still  for the money  a very dependable occasional use tent      
34,5.0,                       i felt this tent was worth trying for the nominal     i paid for it   it goes up in less than    minutes and perhaps   minutes with   people and some practice so far i have only given it a cursory pitch in the living room to check it out on the day it arrived followed by a backyard pitch the following weekend   it did well in the back yard on a gusty day with winds i would estimate       mph   the tent was staked only at the points provided with the tent and it stayed firmly in place though it was completely empty inside   from the inside it seems to be well ventilated even with the rain fly attached while up in the back yard for a dry weekend  i did hit all of the seems with a spray on sealer but this tent has yet to encounter a single drop of rain   we will be taking it on a weekend camping trip in a few weeks and i will try to amend this review once that trip is completed update   on an overnight trip this past weekend  two of us pitched and staked out this tent in under    minutes   we got a nice thunderstorm in middle of the night complete with gusty winds and heavy rain for about    minutes   this tent did well and did not leak or lose integrity   during or immediately after the storm i counted   campers in our area that left in the middle of the night presumably due to the weather but not us   this tent was definitely well worth the cost update            i still own this tent and it is still in great working order   i ve never experience a leak anytime using it during rainy weather however  i do re seal the seems once per year   i like the durability and ease of use enough that i just bought a  nd sundome   person tent   we will be using both on our next camping trip      
35,5.0,                       great get up and go tent   i originally purchased this tent because i had never camped before and thought it would be a once or twice a year thing  at most   however  i caught camping fever for the first time in my life and have since upgraded on the size of the tent that my wife and i choose to use about us   we are    and    years old   i am     tall and    lbs   she is     and well  i hope my wife doesn t read this or i could perhaps lose the ability to write another review  ever again   she has a few extra lbs  as well   that s not bad  honey we fit in this tent comfortably when sitting or laying down on our queen sized air mattress   with that being said  if you are over a few feet tall  don t expect to be standing up and changing clothes and or moving around in this tent   we had just enough space to stash our duffel bags and dirty shoes at the end  and that was all pros tent is great for easy and fast set up   no over reaching involved here tent would be great for kids tent is a great second tent to own if you don t feel like dragging out the big tent  and or  if you choose to camp with someone who may not have their own this is just a theory  but the low profile of the tent as well as the overall shape leads me to believe this would be a good all weather tent that would withstand higher winds and minor storms better than towering tents with large walls waterproofing   tent is small and easy to waterproof   a single can of waterproofing was more than enough   fingers back won t get tired from holding the trigger and bending over for too long    less is more   save       our larger tent took two cans and kinked my back cramped my hand up pretty bad cons probably smaller than you will ultimately want  should you camp on a frequent basisoverall   this is a great tent as a back up tent or a tent for children   as you can see  i knew the tent was small when i purchased it  so it by no means affected the overall rating      
36,3.0,                       i bought this tent as a last minute replacement for a tent i own that had a damaged rainfly  unfortunately i didn t have the time to do much research into the tent before i bought it  it may be the right tent for someone  but it just didn t work well for us   the tent has a nice compact storage bag  it is very easy to set up and take down  plenty of room inside to stand up  store gear  etc  the bad part seemed to be the large ventilation windows on the side  they are huge  unfortunately they do not have a closeable zip up window flap to cover them  this means that you absolutely need to use the rainfly to keep out rain but also because large gusts of wind would be really bad too  also you would just feel too exposed not having any way to cover them up  it would be like having glass walls in your house  this leads to the real problem  where we were camping it got pretty hot during the day and very cold at night  during the day the rainfly seemed to block out most of the breeze keeping it pretty sweltering in the tent  at night i had a family who was miserably cold  i tried to fire up the mr  buddy tent heater for a bit to take the bite out of the cold but the huge ventilation holes just were not able to hold in any of the heat  essentially the tent was no good for when it was either too hot or when it was too cold  if there were a regular zip shut window flap on the sides i would have likely given it   stars  too bad  i really wanted to love this tent but when your kids are crying instead of sleeping you can t really do that      
37,1.0,                       this tent is very roomy and i was able to pitch it by myself in less than    minutes  that s the positive  also  for its size it was very inexpensive  on the flipside it s a coleman tent and other than their iconic gas powered lights  which are now pretty much obsolete  coleman used to mean quality but now makes cheap sh t   i didn t think it would matter because we were doing car camping  the tent arrived with a hole in it  either give yourself enough time to send the first one back and hope that the second one passed quality control  or spend a little bit more and get something of higher quality   there is another issue that  bears consideration  the tent has huge windows and without the fly there is great ventilation  however unlike every other tent i ve ever seen these  windows  cannot be closed  they are simply huge expanses of no see em netting  unless exhibitionism is your thing  the lack of privacy is quite problematic  the only solution is to put up the fly which covers the  windows  and provides privacy  the problem is that on a warm summer night the fly covers the windows which were providing ventilation and it will get quite hot  from my point of view this is a significant design flaw and combined with the lack of quality control makes it imperative to look elsewhere      
38,1.0,                       the tent seems fine  one major flaw  the tent did not come with poles  i unfortunately didn t check for this after buying and we didn t go camping until this fall so too late to return or complain  i also didn t double check before we actually went camping and had take an hour  driving out of our short camping trip to buy a new tent from another store  i wish i would have checked before  obviously not my smartest move  but i wasn t expecting such a huge problem  tent with no poles basically   no tent and out of       the expansion area on the bottom was also already ripped open so i wonder if maybe someone had opened and returned it and they didn t check it before sending it out it looked fine on the floor and i didn t notice any other things missing  tent was there  stakes were there  so we re      moral of the story  check your tent after you buy and definitely before you go camping  i would love a tent that i could actually use      
39,3.0,                       background  car camping trip in mid october  i set up the   person tent around    noon on saturday and took it down around    am on sunday  it was a one night car camping trip in a shenandoah mountains camp ground  temperature was       the whole time  here s my experience rain  it was wet the most of the time i was there  i would say we had about three hours or zero rain  it was drizzling with a mix of full downpour  water did begin to get into the tent around   am on sunday  there was a thin layer of water on the walls of the tent  water would also drip down from the seams and zippers  if it was a   day trip i believe water would have ruined the trip  i would not recommend this for camping in the rain  no water entered from the bottom wind  we had light winds and could feel the wind get under the tents cover  this dropped the temperature a bit  the top of this tent is mostly mesh and the  rain cover  did little to keep the wind out  if the rain cover was larger and would reach further down the tent it would have helped greatly  i ended up putting an outdoor tarp between the tent and the rain cover to cover the mesh roof  this helped the heat from escaping  helped keep wind out  and added a bit of waterproof ness set up was easy with two people interior space  two people slept well  comfortable to sleep in and some space for gear  blankets and backpack of clothes  tent was not tall enough to stand in  basically it was  good enough  and nothing more overall  i m going to try to waterproof the seams and walls and rain fly  i will try using it again  i am a bit upset it was not waterproof  that and the wind were the biggest issues  probably will be a good tent for a warm and dry day  would not recommend for cold windy rainy days      
40,3.0,                       for camping out of a vehicle  the tent packs up nicely   the set up  with one person  is very easy   this tent is also roomy   additionally  the floor to this tent comes up a few inches off the ground before joining to the walls   this helps to ensure the seams are above the ground  preventing water from coming through the seams   that is about where the the good points stop i set this tent up  alone  in about   mph winds while out on a hunting trip   i managed to set the tent up solo  so no complaints   now  keep in mind  i am in southern arizona with ground harder than concrete   after set up  i properly staked the tent  and set up the rain fly   during the night  the winds kicked up in excess of   mph  at first  one corner came unstaked due to the wind   this tent is like a parachute in the wind  by the way   i restaked the corner at about midnight   a little later  another corner came unstaked  again due to the high winds   again  i restaked the corner   wouldn t you know it  less than an hour later  both corners  the front corners  came unstaked and the front of the tent lifted up due to the high winds and enormous size of this tent   i found myself           lbs  inside this tent trying to keep it from blowing away with the door completely above my head  it was a disaster of a night to say the least   i ended up throwing this tent in my jeep and sleeping in the jeep for the night   for the rest of the hunt  i slept in my two person north face tent  which is made to handle high winds and adverse weather now  if you are camping from a vehicle in good weather  this is your tent  if the winds pick up  you re in for a bad night   this tent is too big and not secure enough to be in windy weather   i will say that i have not been in this tent in the rain   however  i am still bringing this tent on my next hunt in a few weeks   i will be in northern arizona surrounded by trees  which help to block wind  nevertheless  based on my last experience  i am bringing my north face tent in the even this tent does not hold up to the weather up north   i will update this review if needed the reason i went with this tent  even though i own a great two person north face  is the size   when i am out hunting for a week at a time and i have my vehicle near by  i like to bring an air mattress and have room to actually stand up and move around   having a central place to camp is great for big tents like this coleman  if you can set up a tent in one spot for a few days  a big tent is a welcoming comfort      
41,5.0,                       we used the tent for the first time this past weekend   i love this tent   i m a single mom with two boys   this fit the three of us quite well   i used a full size and a twin size air bed and there was room in between for a soft side cooler   this tent goes up and comes down very easy  unless there is a wind  then the top was a bit hard to get on without it blowing wherever    i know i looked forever for what size air beds would fit  so i wanted to share it here in case anyone else is looking to know      
42,5.0,                       wonderful tent  nice and spacious  large enough for a queen bed and two large men plus their stuff  my buddy did trip over the opening a couple of times saying it was higher than a tent he owns  i went up easy and looked great in the desert landscape  we accidentally setup right in the center of a red ant burrow  did notice till we took the tent down two days later  and did not get infested with ants  so it was sealed up nice and tight  the dark one was nice because it absorbed a little more of the morning light than the white and green tent would have  the storage pockets on the side were really nice for keeping essentials like water and flashlight handy and easy to find  overall great tent and great value  my buddy has camped quite a bit and was impressed by it      
43,1.0,                       cheap junk  i bought this tent since it s was the same model i had  and used for   years  my older version wore out  this newer model is junk  cheap and flimsy  i have never even used this tent  thankfully   during test set up all the bungie shock cords pulled out of the rods  all the bungie cords in the rods are broken   coleman obviously found another made in china contractor to increase profit margins and take a crap on quality   every aspect of this tent is lighter  cheaper and just plain tacky  i would expect this quality from the dollar general store  not coleman  when compared side by side with the same model but older version the rods are     thinner  the connection sleeves are markedly thinner metal  and the rods are now about   inches shorter   if you are looking at this tent because you have the older version of this model and wanted another quality tent don t be a fool like i was  stay away              
44,5.0,                       after years of camping in a collective tent with my family  about      all crammed in once space  it was time to buy a smaller tent for myself and possibly a partner  did my research  and living on a college budget  i knew i couldn t afford to drop       on a nice backpacking tent  at least not right away  however  i finally managed to put it through it s paces this weekend  and i ll admit  it s a pretty decent product  with only a few cons first  the travel bag it comes in is not meant for backpacking  at all  this is standard walmart esk canvas bag that is heavy  cumbersome  and square  however i ve had absolutely no problems getting the tent in and out of the bag  the tent isn t an odd shape  and it rolls up really well  however  if you re going to go backpacking  you ll need to buy a separate bag second  assembly is a dream  i could probably do it with my eyes closed if i had to  two poles  same length  lightweight and pretty sturdy  had no problems getting it set up  in fact i had my partner set it up  with supervision  who had never set up a tent before  the only thing of note is that the rain tarp  or whatever you locally call it  has a pole that you slip in horizontally across the bow of the tent that can be tricky  more simply put  the pole extends from back to front with only a little velcro pouch to hold it in  thus it is easily missed the first time you try and set it up  once you know where it is  it s easy third  the room  while my partner and i fit rather well with little to no effort in putting pads  blankets  and sleeping bags in  i will note that it was a tight fit  at least  our packs did not fit easily inside  in fact they pretty much didn t  but it was slated to rain rather hard that night  so it was our only option  to be fair  we had an ungodly amount of padding and blankets we were laying on  and ultimately would probably had enough room for at least one pack if we hadn t had so much padding  had to use old fashioned couch like cushions at the time   overall definitely roomy enough for one person and their gear   but a tight fit for two grown adults and their gear fourth  and possibly the most important but also easily fixable  it leaked  not gratuitously  but enough to leave just a little water on the bottom of the pads  however  this was after a night of  very  heavy rainfall and wind  i was curious to see if the factory seal would be enough to make it waterproof  and i can t say i m surprised that it didn t  however  i will be resealing it myself  which is easy enough for people to do  so don t think too poorly of it s water abilities another note  it doesn t come with a footprint  so i would invest in one  in fact  screw the traditional heavy canvas  and invest in some tyvek     r kitemaking material  it s super lightweight  it s kitemaking material   waterproof  and comes recommended by pretty much every backpacker out there  worked like a charm  and it so thin and lightweight that it fits in the crappy square tent bag with everything else all in all  this is a damn good tent for the price  and you should probably buy it      
45,5.0,                       i went camping at gennie springs in florida for the first time this past weekend  i bought this tent a couple weeks prior to ensure i had everything ready to go  it arrived within   days thanks to amazon prime  once it arrived i set it up in my living room to see if it had any defects  non were detected  i commend this tent for it s ease of setup  i was able to set it up by myself in under   minutes  when i set it up at the camp site with the help of my girlfriend it took us barely a couple minutes  the tent itself is just big enough to fit a   person  queen  inflatable mattress from walmart  however  you have to make sure to inflate the mattress inside as it will not fit through the door fully inflated   learned this the hard way  the tent kept the water out at night  it was a nice weekend with the lows around     there was great ventialation in the tent to the point where i had to cover myself extra well in the middle of the night as it was getting chilly  overall i think this tent is excellent for two people and especially for the price point  a tent of similar size was being sold at walmart but marketed as a   person tent   talk about being cramped  highly recommend      
46,5.0,                       we ve owned the sundown   for   years and in that time  we have camped for over    nights in a variety of conditions   over one summer alone  we travelled for   weeks across    states and   provinces  camping the entire way here are the pros and cons we discovered along the way    it held up through some massive rain storms   for the record  we always spray our tents  and especially the seams  with silicone at the start of a camping season   additionally  we managed to squeeze   queen sized air mattresses into the tent  and then shared that space between   people   we just fit in width  but it was naturally difficult to keep all blankets  pillows and even the corner of the mattress out of contact with the side wall   experienced campers know that contact leaks in a rain   despite these constraints  the tent kept us dry throughout some intense and long rains  with no more than     cup worth of water pooling in a corner where we have contact issues   in fact  our sundown   kept my husband and son dry on a group trip where many others had to bail because their expensive tents were leaking extensively    it sets up and take down fairly easily   if at least two corners of the tent are staked before lifting the poles  a single person can set it up   on our road trip we were constantly setting up and taking down our tent  and it didn t become cumbersome at all    in hot climates the tent is very airy  however the mesh roof makes for cold nights when sleeping in cold environments  aka yellowstone in july    i do not like how low the mesh roof comes down on two sides of the tent   if the rain fly is staked our tightly  then neighbors from the side can see in  a little bit  through the mesh   think of the small gap between rainfly and mesh as similar to an awkwardly placed gap in a public bathroom stall door   one can t see much but it s enough to make a person standing or sitting to get changed a little uncomfortable   that means that i had to lay down to get changed   it was also enough for my pesky son to threaten his sister that he might peek in   siblings    the tent has held up in some fairly windy weather   however  all guys lines do attach to the rain fly  so it can make stargazing in windy weather difficult   we opted to sleep sans rain fly in badlands national park   the wind battered the sides of the tent  which simultaneously battered me   if you like to sleep under the stars  be prepared to make your own guy lines     it actually folds into the bag   a couple half folds and a triple fold before rolling  fold it right and there is even a little room to spare     it has held up under a lot of activity without replacing any parts   however  year     which might be equivalent to year    for once a year campers  and the zipper is starting to split at the top   not bad for the price of the tent we plan to camp around the nw this summer for another   weeks and have decided to go with a larger   x   tent to actually fit those   queen mattresses   but we have stashed this tent under the floor in our van just in case   many national park sites can t guarantee more than a   x   pad  and this tent folds up small enough to be a back up   with a   x   footprint  it can go anywhere      
47,5.0,                       easy to set up  easy to pack up  i haven t tent camped in over    years but found this tent to be great for getting back into the swing of things  we camped in northern idaho  in march  but were hit with a huge combo of weather  rain  sleet  snow  graupel     mph wind gusts coming off lake coeur d alene  daytime temps in the upper    s  f  and low    s  f   nighttime temps getting down to around    f  and the tent handled it all like a champ if you re going to do very much cold weather camping  i would suggest another tent  because     of the tent s dome is mesh netting with no way to seal from the wind  it does have a rain fly that helped  but when guided out created a funnel for the wind to breeze right through the tent despite mother nature throwing the book at us  this tent stayed completely dry  other than the water than got in while setting it up in the rain  i am impressed with this tent and look forward to a lot of mild to warm weather camping with it      
48,5.0,                       i bought this tent to take on my first camping trip in years  in essence  i m a  beginning level  camper at best   that being said  this product was incredibly easy to set up  tear down  and fit back into its original bag  i did not test it in rainy conditions  but it seems to be made of quality material and i liked the cover  the price was hard to beat  and it was shipped to me almost immediately after i ordered  very impressed      
49,5.0,                       this is one great tent     i am able to put it up by myself in about five minutes    it s plenty roomy inside  and very sturdy   a major stoem passed through destroying many campsites  but not mine  the only thing i would recommend is to buy better tent stakes  i bought the big metal stakes with orange plastic heads  drove them into the ground next to the corners of my tent and tied  the corners on with heavy duty parachute cord  my tent went no where      this is an awesome tent for the money        
50,1.0,                       bleh i thought i was getting a good deal  but this tent broke the first time it was set up   the seam broke as seen in the picture   thank god it wasn t windy when camping      
51,5.0,                       this tent is perfect and everything i could have wanted for a camping trip   the interior mesh pockets are great for holding flashlights or your phone   the rain fly comes down a bit low in the front  but i guess you d want that if it was actually raining   mine also came with a rectangular piece of tarp like material and i couldn t figure out what it was for and then it hit me   it s a tent doormat   how awesome is that    it even has a loop on each side for staking it into the ground so it doesn t move or blow away and they give you enough stakes to do it   the set up was a snap and take down was easy too   the bag it comes in expands  pull on a tab once you remove the box  so that you don t have to try to stuff all the materials back in the box  you can put it directly in the bag with room to spare   it made things so much easier   i haven t tried it in the rain yet  so when i do  i ll update my review      
52,3.0,                       we bought this tent and immediately went camping the next weekend  the setup was easy and tent interior was fine   our problem came when we were taking the tent down and the elastic in both set of poles snapped   these poles can be used without the elastic  but it is certainly more convenient to have the poles linked   i was a little frustrated to have the product break so soon after purchase but i figured i would at least try contacting customer service to see what could be done   i received no reply for a week and when i did they asked for my tent model and said they would sent new poles   several days later i received three tent pole repair kits for a different tent model than mine   i was able to use the elastic out of the kits to repair my poles  but it was a bit of a hassle   now i have three kits full of poles and pieces that don t match my tent in conclusion  it s concerning that my tent poles would break after one use   it was also concerning that instead of sending me new poles  or just elastic band  i got the wrong kits   this is a cheap tent  so i was expecting some long term quality issues  i just figured it wouldn t be a problem so soon   if i was to do it again i would probably just spend more and get a better tent      
53,1.0,                       very disappointed  i purchased this tent for a two week summer camping vacation in cape cod  massachusetts  although it served me well for the two weeks  upon taking it down  the stretch cording inside one set of the main structure s poles broke totally unexpectedly  upon inspecting the cord  it was obvious that it is very poor quality  for the cording to rip in half is disappointing  i had only assembled  and disassembled  twice  the first time  to practice setting it up  and seam seal it    and  the second time to actually use it looking to see if i could get a refund from this shop  it was  beyond    days  since my purchase  it was   months  as  i had purchased it a month earlier than my trip so a refund could not be given  what a waste of money  i really am disappointed in the quality of this tent s stretch cord  pole s interior structure  i should have listened to the reviews regarding this flaw  so it is really my own fault  if you buy this tent and the structure breaks  you ve been forewarned  i can t even buy replacement parts as i ve called everywhere  i have to purchase cording and re cord this set of poles back together  i wouldn t even want to chance it because i m assuming that other stretch cords might just snap unexpectedly  not worth redoing them all don t waste your money  if it had been a bad coastal storm   as i have encountered many times camping on the beach coast in the last    years   there is a good chance that that tent would ve snapped and my family and i would ve been left basically shelterless  not cool  pass this one by      
54,5.0,                       this tent is very easy to set up  i did it practically by myself   there are instructions on the bag  but i didn t find them necessary at all  pretty straightforward setup  really  it holds up well  i spent a week in this tent through a few days  long blizzard  multiple of my teammates  tents collapsed under the snow or broke and let in snow water that soaked everyone s gear  but mine stayed standing the whole time  the floor does in fact stay dry  as does the rest of the tent  the rainfly worked quite well  even when weighted down with snow  the pockets on the walls are useful for storing small items  the small ring on the ceiling of the tent worked nicely for hanging a lantern from as well  the stakes that the tent came with are your usual cheap ones  so i bought the msr stakes to make up for it  i still use the stakes that came with the tent for secondary things like the rainfly and tarp  though  so they re still useful  the tent is quite spacious  although that may have been because i was alone in the tent  taking the tent down was very easy as well  i was able to do it alone despite having sustained a concussion less than    hours before i left the campsite  so being easy to work with even with a non functioning brain was a major plus i m doing this trip again every year for the next three years  ideally with significantly less concussions or blizzards  hopefully the tent continues to exceed my expectations every year  will update this review after next year s trip         
55,4.0,                       i have bought many of these tents  last year  in colorado the rain was so heavy i had a three inch puddle surround this tent and the water stayed out  plastic tub like bottom is how  my only complaint is the tarp pole end caps are no longer glued on and will now come off  my tarp  first trip now has a   inch tear from trying to slide the tent pole in  bought a repair kit from amazon      
56,1.0,                       this is such a poorly made product  it arrived in time for my camping trip and i checked to make sure that all of the components were include  poles  spikes  etc   unfortunately what i did not check was that the tent was actually sewn together and that the pole inserts were attached to the tent  well they were not  two were dangling from the tent by a single piece of frayed thread which made the tent useless     couldn t even manage a  workaround  to get through the night since i was on a beach with some wind and anything would have been too flimsy   for me this is the final straw with coleman since i have noticed a decline in the past several years  i think one is better of with  ozark trails  from walmart  totally ruined a weekend which had to be carefully planned due to covid     would love to give negative stars if possible      
57,5.0,                       great tent for general camping   given the quality of the materials and finished product  this is a great value first use was in    degree f and     humidity   the tent handled those conditions no problem   the air flow can be controlled somewhat and felt just right without tying anything closed or otherwise trying to stop the natural air flow within the tent   obviously  the tent itself has no insulation  but the temperature inside was very comfortable given the above mentioned conditions   i can see going down another       degrees f and being totally fine with this tent and standard sleeping bags   below that you will probably need additional tarps to put over it to block air flow and warmer than standard sleeping bags i cannot attest to the rain resistance of the tent  however  it looks like it will handle light to medium showers with relative ease   the floor is tarp material with a fair amount of water resistance  and makes up the lower     inches of the walls   from there up is standard tent material you would find on many other tents at this price point   the mesh makes up a great deal of the upper portion of the tent  and all of that is covered by the rain fly when it is on   the rain fly itself is the same material as the tent walls   air flows between the rain fly and the mesh sections   you can close that up to some degree to control the air flow   additionally  there is a vent on the back wall near the floor  but high enough to not be a splashing water during rain problem   there is also a very tiny zippered opening on the front wall to bring in an extension cord   there are also two zippered  large windows   one on the back wall  one on the door itself   the d door is well thought out  and features a flap to keep rain out on the lower half setup is a breeze  even for the novice   it is very intuitive and straightforward   you have three poles to assemble  two for the tent and one for the rain fly   slide them through  clip  and plug in at the ends   thats pretty much it   there are some little velcro straps here and there to further secure the poles to the tent and rain fly   put the third pole in the rain fly and then attached to the tent with the straps with clips   tie down as needed  and you are done   there is also a floor mat for the entrance in the bag   this tent will stand on its own and does not absolutely need to be staked or tied to something   its optional   recommend you buy some additional parachute cord and maybe some heavier duty stakes  as is pretty much always the case with every single tent on the market pack up is also a breeze   with minimal effort i was able to get it all in the box it came in and then into the carry bag   you do not have to use that box  and you can discard it and just use the carry bag   i like the squarish dimensions  so i kept the box   otherwise  it will be more of a gym bag when packed   at any rate  plenty of room in there for additional stakes  parachute cord   if you manage to pack it tight  you could even fit a floor tarp in there  not included    people is actually possible with this tent  but not with gear   maybe some backpacks  but thats about it   you can fit two full size air mattresses  or a queen plus a twin   it will be tight either way  and double stack air mattress will make it even tougher   but  it is possible   a full plus twin is more realistic  and there will be some room for gear   we just use a full and have tons of room for gear  coolers  etc overall  fantastic tent at this price   love the navy color scheme  and worth the extra couple bucks   i would not call this a hiking tent  as it weighs over    pounds   more if you buy heavier stakes  additional floor tarp  etc   but  you could make it work for hiking if you share the loads   for the occasional camper  this is perfect      
58,5.0,                       i really didn t expect much for a tent this inexpensive  wow was i surprised  i bought it for a one off camping trip so i didn t want to spend a lot  this tent survived the ultimate test  a new mexico mountain monsoon storm with    mph winds and driving rain  the tent did not leak one drop even though i could see a literal stream flowing under it at the height of the storm which lasted about   hours  since i had a lot of time to gaze up into it and look at every detail while waiting out the storm  i was quite impressed by the way it was designed with reinforcement at tension points and how well sewn it was  also  the way it s designed with a mesh top and rain fly over that means condensation was not a problem it says it s a   person tent uh  not really  my queen size air mattress took up nearly the whole tent  maybe   small children it s very easy to set up and take down and coleman sewed the directions into the carrying bag so they will never be lost super impressed with this high quality tent at a fantastic price      
59,5.0,                       update  finally took the tent out on a   night trip to lake kissimmee state park  in fl  i can say the tent ventilation was good  it was hot and humid with a bit of a breeze  the breeze was definitely welcome when in the tent  i also used a fan in the tent  just to keep some cool air flowing overnight the second day out  we had heavy thunderstorms come through  we had   storms that day and rain throughout the night  the tent was dry and never leaked  i completely forgot about the zipper in the corner for running power through  since i never expect to use it  and it never leaked in all that rain  if you re familiar with florida s hurricane season  you understand the storms i went through overall i recommend this tent  it may be heavier than the more expensive tents  but it s solid i set this tent up in my backyard to test it out and make sure i liked it  it does have some weight to it  but i m a newbie to camping  so i can t compare it to anything  i can say  i am happily surprised with the quality of the tent  it was bigger than i thought it would be and roomy on the inside  i feel like maybe i would have been happier with a   person tent  but i guess i can stretch out more now    from the start  the carrying bag is good quality  it has a tear away at the bottom  to expand the bag  if needed  instructions are stitched into the bags interior    i think i ll upgrade the poles to aluminum eventually  the poles that come with it are just metal and plastic pieces    the tent comes with a foot pad to place in front of the door  which i think is a nice touch    the material of the tent and rain fly seems like a good quality  especially for the price    the rain fly is reinforced where the poles go into it and seems well stitched as well    the zipper seems like good quality  i had no issues with it at all    it fit back into it s packaging without an issue  i didn t get it perfect  but i didn t have to expand the bag      
60,5.0,                       i ve had a lot of experience with tents and this one is fantastic  i don t do as much camping lately  but i needed to replace an old tent with one that would fit my husband and i  and our two young girls  i also wanted them to be able to play in it in the back yard  we ve had a very stormy summer in western pennsylvania with record rains  this tent stayed up thru two giant thunderstorms dumping record rain fall  after the first storm it was      dry inside  i checked thoroughly  the second let a little water in  possibly blowing up under the rain fly  and as anyone who has camped in a tent before knows  some of that you can t avoid the tent has really nice interior windows zipper blinds  a must for me  i like to be able to see out and control privacy and ventilation without taking the rain fly on and off  it also has a lower vent in the back as part of the rain fly  nice and private allowing for ventilation  the front also has one of those power ports  i haven t used them too much but i feel like those would be so fun and useful  especially if camping during a road trip at koa s or something  you re able to run an extension cord into the tent without tripping over it in the door or allowing water in during rain  it has two nice tent pockets but only one hook from the peak of the ceiling  that s kind of a bummer  but you could easily sew an extra hook on and attach hanging cup holders  pockets  or those new  entertainment lofts  to hold ipads or tablets to watch movies on  i think those are a great and fun idea so the lack of extra hooks  lofts and pockets is the only downside overall it was way bigger and roomier than expected  i m      and could almost stand up inside  plenty of room for me and my girls or a slumber party or a road trip and duffle bags and gear  whatever      
61,5.0,                       the husband and i spent a few days considering many tents to add to our  bug out  bag  basically  we wanted a light enough one to work with just a pair of backpacks and some base supplies  after narrowing it to two  we finally went with this one because of the brand  year after year  coleman seems to out perform most camping equipment  we just returned from our first grab and go trip  and this tent was perfect  it fits two adults wonderfully  the air flow of it was plenty satisfactory  and it was so light weight  i d absolutely recommend this tent to anyone looking for an easy carry shelter  and size wise for those tall folks wondering  my husband is      and had no trouble fitting  so don t be discouraged by it s small size and weight      
62,4.0,                       i am not much of a camper  or at all really  but i am very pleased with purchasing this tent for a school camp out trip  was very easy to set up  i did a trial run at home before leaving to check parts and work out  kinks  in my process  took me about    minutes the first time to put up  when i set it up at camp took about     based on other reviews  i did do a coating of the water proofing spray on the seams  however we didn t have rain on our trip so not sure if that was necessary or useful  only   negative  note   instead of   star  the support poles for the canopy had broken elastic upon arrival  however i was able to just cut the elastic  to get it out of the way  and put the pole pieces together and it worked like a champ  even though it worked  i feel i have to knock   star off for having  broken  pieces on a brand new item  the tent comes with information to contact for replacement parts  but i haven t gotten to that part yet  momlife     if i do i will update my review with how that process went  i like the bag it comes in   there is a pull strip that you can remove that makes the bag open a bit further for easier re packing i appreciated that detail  overall very happy with my purchase and would recommend      
63,5.0,                       i travel on the road a lot  i had the tent for about   months still going strong this has been on a long road trip  up the northern coast of california and all through oregon it has seen the woods and the coast it has gone through mild winds short periods of rain not one leak or any problems  i bought this tent because of its size easy to get in tight spaces when stealth camping  for one person and two packs a    l and both    liter pack i was comfortable with the space inside  i love the fact that this tent has two windows for ventilation and to interview out there is not many tense these days with that feature  i was able to create a outer lean to and protective cover for the tent     
64,5.0,                       this tent is a champ   i ve used it on   campouts already  and it s held up to some beatings   i use my tents hard   i don t use one then wait a year  i use them almost monthly  and they tend to get a bit abused due to the places i go  and mode of transportation i use     enchanted rock outside of fredericksburg  tx  got to freezing and windy as heck   easy setup  tough break down because of wind     camp bovay boy scout camp close to texas a m   gorgeous hill country  great weather  easy setup and take down     buffalo river  ar    nights on the river  and submerged once in the water and dried out very quickly with opening it up and flipping over   got below freezing  but kept me dry this is a great price for a tent of this quality   like most tents  sides will get damp in super cold weather  and ice forms and makes it moist  but overall  the bowl style bottom repels water nicely  and if using a decent ground cover  you won t get wet i couldn t recommend this tent more   picture was on first night of   campout in this tent just a week ago      
65,5.0,                       can t beat this tent for the money  easy set up  walls nice and tight  fly a little marginal  but it ll do  perfect for a single sleeper with lots of gear inside  my use is for car camping   love the small footprint in my trunk  haven t tested in rain  but i will spray it down with sealer before actual use  that should take care of any  minor problems  again   great tent for the money  just buy one      
66,4.0,                       i bought the   person version of this tent  with the intention of using it for solo or pair camping comfortably while having loads of extra room for gear  i m tall  and a lot of smaller tents are made for people under   feet  this tent performed amazingly    it can fit a queen mattress with plenty of room to spare for gear  i didn t do any waterproofing ahead of time  but even with a good amount of rain on its first weekend trip  it didn t leak at all  the tall  tarp skirt  at the bottom is a nice bonus compared to other tents i ve used in the past  which could leech water through the thin fabric if wet grass was touching the sides or if rain was heavy enough  setup and tear down was very easy even for one user  though definitely would be even easier with two this tent kept me perfectly comfortable in    degree overnight temps  however there are two big vents and one floor vent that can t be closed up  just staked down as close as possible to the tent   so i m not sure how comfortable this would be in colder temps with strong winds  on the plus side  this should be amazingly comfortable in hot summers if you can position it with even a slight cross breeze now for the downside  one of the straps which clips the tent wall to the poles started to rip at the seam when i tried to connect it  i left that strap unconnected and i still had no leak issue at all  i ll be contacting coleman since this tent is less than a month old  but i suspect that with some seam grip  a half an hour of stitching  and some tenacious tape  i d still get at least a decade of service from this tent      
67,5.0,                       update   my two kids and i used this tent for a scout camp this past weekend   the first night was torrential rains and heavy winds for at least   hours   i sat awake wondering when the rain would start getting into the tent  waiting for my rain cover to blow off or for water to start accumulating   in the morning our tent was in one piece and completely dry inside   i didn t use a ground cover or tarp   just the tent   we had not one drop of water in our tent   the other families that were in tents all had rain in their tents   one family had at least an inch of water   this tent was fantastic and i was so happy to wake up in a dry tent   please note i did buy and use better tent stakes  i upgraded from the stakes that were included   i would highly recommend better tent stakes   but with better tent stakes i highly recommend this tent if you think you are going to be in rainy conditions i researched a lot of tents prior to purchase   i needed something easy to set up on my own   i wanted a tent that could withstand heavy rain   i also wanted a tent that could comfortably sleep      kids   adults    this tent met all these requirements   i was able to set up almost the entire tent on my own and quickly   the tent itself was no problem but i m only      so struggled with the rainfly but i was able to get it with help from my   year old   the size of this tent is perfect   i used it with just one queen air mattress and there was so much room   i was able to set up a little table  just a bin and play mat inside the tent for my kids  on night   it downpoured and we were kept completely dry   i could easily stand up in the tent   but again i m fairly short this would be an excellent tent for warm weather camping   i would not use for cold weather   i live in minnesota and took this tent camping this past weekend   i thought i d be ok temp wise  the temperature both nights dropped to    degrees and due to all the ventilation the tent got pretty cold  however this was my error in using this tent in cold weather   the tent itself is great   perfect for warm weather  i just would caution about using in colder temps   i look forward to using this spring and summer      
68,5.0,                       bought this tent for my first ever camping trip  and it did not disappoint  my boyfriend and i both fit in it very comfortably with just enough room for some space if we needed it  we thought we d have a difficult time setting it up since neither one of us had ever set up a tent  but it literally took like   minutes  and the directions are easy to follow  it rained pretty hard the first night we were out there  and i wasn t sure if the tent would actually keep us dry  but it shockingly did  this is such good value for the price  is a perfect size for two people to sleep comfortably  and the little inside hanging pockets are a nice touch  we were able to store flashlights  wipes  and our phones in a nice spot  the only thing i disliked about this tent was that the zipper kind of gets caught in the fabric when you re trying to close the tent  but that s such a minor issue and probably happens with lots of tents  i would highly recommend this      
69,5.0,                       it s probably too heavy for a backpacking camper  but this little tent is perfect for my needs  since i don t have to carry it far  it sets up and comes down very easily    i m an out of shape old woman and i did it by myself  it exactly fits my  full  sized futon mattress  which means that yes  it will fit two people     but they d better be pretty friendly this tent has withstood snow  sleet  and  rain without a leak  i did have to poke at the rain fly before i got up on the morning after a sleety  winter mix  of precipitation  the fly was heavy with icy snow that would have all gone down my back  and probably into the tent door as well   if i hadn t reached out through the top of the door only  to jiggle the roof and make that stuff fall before i got out there is a small risk of rain getting inside when you enter or exit during a storm  as the fly doesn t protect the bottom of the door  and if the door itself falls inward  as it tends to do   it will drip all over inside  but that s easily avoided when you know the risk  and it s really the only problem i ve had with this tent no condensation inside  no leaks  on clear nights i ve slept without the rain fly  so i could see the stars through the generous screened areas  the rain fly is easy to remove and replace  though i wouldn t want to have to replace it in a big quick hurry if it started raining during the night  so i do check the weather forecast before i take it off both of the  windows  that are less well covered by the rain fly have zip up covers in case it s raining sideways  or  i suppose  if the wind is just too much inside   there s a nice vent at the back of the tent near the floor  so there s excellent air exchange inside even when there s little or no wind overall i m completely satisfied with this tent and recommend it to anyone who just wants a good tent and doesn t need it to be extremely light weight      
70,2.0,                       we got this   person tent from amazon and used it for a   day camping trip in the beginning of august  during our stay  a short lived period of chilly weather dropped the night temperatures into the mid   s  with light occasional drizzling rain through the day  then it got hot again  this way  we could test the tent in different summer weather conditions   setting up the tent was easy  it has a  classic    pole design  two poles go at    degrees to each other across the tent  and one shorter pole supports the rain fly  assembly instructions are printed on a cloth like  sheet  sawn to the carrying bag  the instructions are not super clear  so it may take a few minutes to figure out where the poles go through  but ultimately  it is not a difficult task  the   person tent requires two people to set up  set up time can easily be    minutes or less   the poles are quite long  so one needs a fair amount of room around the tent for the assembly   the tent is quite roomy  i am      and i can almost stand in the middle  the size of a   person tent is great for car camping of   people  with good amount of room between the sleeping bags to store some clothes  i cannot judge how well   people can fit in it  although i have strong doubts that it can be comfortable the tent is poorly equipped when it comes to organization of your items  there are two tiny pockets on the sides  am i the only one who thinks that it is not enough for a tent rated for up to   people   and a hook at the top to attach an led lantern  there is a mesh window in the door  which you can close or open  and a similar size window across the door  which also can be opened and closed for ventilation  zipper in the door worked well through the   days of use   ventilation of this tent  or rather lack of adjustability of ventilation  turned out to be a significant problem  a good tent allows one to adjust it as one pleases   close it on cold nights to keep the tent warm  or open it up to see the stars and let air and breeze in  this is way outside the range available with this tent  at least  in public areas  to begin with  two side walls  starting from the knee level to the top  are see through mesh  if you are on a public campground and decide to remove the fly on a warm clear night  it will be a joke of the privacy   the whole campground will see you in the tent and everything that you store in the tent  i attached a picture to illustrate this point  the rain fly covers the mesh  but barely  it overhangs it by     inches  and there is a     inches gap between the fly and the mesh  in addition to that  the fly does not overlap much with the sides of the tent on the front and back  so air can flow into the tent not only from the sides through the gap between the sides of the tent and the fly  but also through the gap between the fly and the sides of the tent  consequently  you would feel any breeze  no matter from which direction it comes from  in your tent  to add to it  there is a vent in the bottom of the back panel  right next to the head of the person sleeping in the middle  which cannot be zipped   this may all be welcome and nice features on a warm steamy night  except the fact that there is absolutely no way how one would remove the fly as it totally sacrifices any privacy  unless you camp in the woods with no other people around   however  on a relatively chilly summer night my wife was freezing  wrapped towels around her head  and was blaming me for picking a bad tent   just for the record  we camp every summer  but until now  used a smaller    person   more advanced tent from a different brand  never had any of problems described above    if this were the only issue with this tent  i would say it is a fine tent for camping during warm days  for those nights when one can sleep in a hammock  it would be a fine one season tent  but there is more issues with it the fly is supported by a pole which runs along the length of the tent  from front to back  it ends more or less at my eyes level  in the   person tent  every time i would get into the tent  i had a feeling that this pole is going to poke me in the eye   the quality of the tent failed to impress  sewing around one of the hooks which attaches tent to the poles has almost failed completely after a single trip  floor of the tent started showing signs of tear  white spots  with coating scraped off   even though we put tarp under the tent and were not walking in shoes inside   and this is after just   days  by the way  the cheapest tarp from harbor freight tools which was under the tent showed much better durability and was in pristine condition after   nights  i was wondering  how cheap is the floor material in this tent  if the lowest end and cheapest tarp that i know of turned out to be order of magnitude better quality   my only explanation how such poorly designed and poorly made tent could get such good ratings on amazon is that perhaps a   or   person version has different proportions between the sizes of mesh walls and sold walls  maybe it has a larger fly  and maybe smaller tents lack that non closeable vent by the floor  which we had to close with another piece of tarp and had to put a carton from camp oven on top of it  to keep it shut during the last night  my review applies only to   person tent   the bottom line is  it may seem to be a good deal  but you get what you paid for      
71,3.0,                       i bought this to replace my previous tent and saw it said in the description  fits a queen size mattress   what they actually mean is that the footprint of the tent is the exact dimension of a queen sized air mattress  maybe even a tad smaller as they are relying on the walls to pooch out a bit  and to fill it up you have to lay underneath the mattress and you still won t be able to fill it up all the way if you re using an inflater  i was really disappointed by this and i would have returned this tent if i had known it before i used it  i ll probably get a different tent after this because it was really annoying that i couldn t fill up my air mattress all the way given the limitations of the tent  if you have a twin sized air mattress or camping mats  then this tent is fine for two people  it s cramped and doesn t have much space for your things  but it ll work and the rest of the features of the tent are as expected      
72,5.0,                       i ve used this tent only once and can t speak to its weather resistance   it didn t rain when i used it   it does seem to be solid quality  and the bottom seems to be weather proof   the bottom is essentially a tarp attached to the tent sides with that said  i got the   person size  and it was for just me with a camping cot  which wouldn t fit front to back  and barely fit side to side   if you aren t using a cot  it would be fine as a   person tent with gear  but   people would start to feel cramped  never mind   it s also not a tall tent   i m      and the next tent i buy will be one i can fully stand in  or at the very least only have to slightly duck   can t blame the product for my own personal preferences though when it comes to the cot and my size   if i wanted more room  i should have gotten a bigger tent  right the tent sets up easy and is pretty self explanatory    lay it out   stake the corners   insert the poles  arch and attach at the plug fitting  then clip to the tent   inset the rain fly pole  anchor the rain fly to the tent  stake the rain fly on the sidesit took me about    minutes to set up  and it stayed tight all weekend overall  i trust the coleman brand   it s solid quality at prices you can afford   i got a nice deal on this tent and got it for about     below the normal pricing  so what s not to like about that      
73,1.0,                       i am a camping enthusiast and marine corps veteran with years of experiences with tents and camping  below i outline the deficiencies of this coleman tent i recently purchased the coleman sundome tent to upgrade capacity from my ll bean acadia   due to a growing family  maybe i was spoiled my the quality of ll bean  but this coleman tent is poor quality during initial setup i discovered  one of the pole a s was broken  upon further investigation i found that the nylon cord inside the pole had frayed and snapped  i called coleman customer service and they offered to send a new pole out  they said it would take over a week to arrive  it never came so i repaired it myself using some ballistic cord i had available  it was a good quick fix i arrived at the campsite and set up the tent  we had some light rain and i noticed that some rain was entering the tent  i used my light to discover several tears in the tent  i was completely dissappinted in the quality of the tent  it had ripped from light wind or maybe arrived torn i was unhappy with coleman s customer service and their qualify overall  they have gone down hill  their tents won t last a weekend  i would recommend that you all spend a few extra bucks and buy a durable tent to take your family on adventures with and one that will last for many years      
74,1.0,                       overall the tent design is nice  it has the basic features of a modern tent  with the more tarp like bottom of car tents  unfortunately  the seam of the tarp bottom and the polyester tent leak  it is interesting that it does not appear to leak everywhere  but instead only on the corner with the port for power cables  i tested this a few different ways to confirm it was the seam and not the port  furthermore i ordered a second tent to see if mine was  faulty  and both have the same flaw  i will be returning both and shopping around for another brand  probably from rei which tends to stock better gear  though i was hoping for a cheap tent that didn t leak and i wouldn t have to worry about getting damaged at festival and other lighter trips events      
75,5.0,                       this thing is gigantic   absolutely easy to put up and is big enough to fit   adults and a     pound dog and still have room  the description says it has a      center height but i stand at     and have an inch when standing flat foot inside  amazing tent  no issues  no regrets of buyin this tent   you know when you re laying in bed thinking about life and how cozy your bedroom feels    well this tent feels like you re own personal bedroom but in the woods  it s perfect      
76,4.0,                       husbands review  first off this is a pretty good tent for the price  it s nothing i would be backpacking with but i would take it on short trips or car camping  i m a scout leader and have a very active scout troop  we camp in all conditions  i plan to take this tent out on many adventures to see if it holds up  i ll update my review in a few months with fall and winter camping reviews out of the box  the tent is exactly what i thought it would be   good  it s not too of the line but it looks of good quality  the tub of the tent is thicker than most i have slept in and that is a huge plus for me  here s my eval so far pluses good pricequality materialstitching is well donezipper flaps cover a wide areatub inside goes high up on the wallsrainfly pole slot is well stitchedcorner pins are sewn into the rings and allows stronger connectionplenty of velcro straps to attach to side poles and rainflyperfect size for an adult with gear to tentdeltas cheap tent pegs that just need to be upgradedwhen spread out and pins down  door zipper does not smoothly shut  needed to have a lot of slack in spread to close door  see pics poles seem to bow out too far like they re about   inches too big  they work but seems to bow   see pics a bit heavy for backpacking but great for overall camping more updated reviews as i take it out this fall and winter   standby      
77,5.0,                       i read the reviews before purchasing  also the tent was featured on my phone   google news  report as top tents for       so it solidified my decision  i must say skepticism played a part initially  when i went on a road trip last weekend and chose a campsite  the delivery came the same day  my boyfriend opened the shipment and assembled  i will say it takes two people to setup  trust me  i had my dog in hand and still helped with the setup  it is true to size four people can fit in this tent  i am a thick chick with hips and butt and i must say this product exceeded my expectations  my first camping experience as an adult  since a kid in girl scout  the setup wasn t hard  read the directions  take your time  do not rush  i really liked this tent  it rained at the campground  from saturday to sunday  the tent fly   really works  no leakage  no holes  great ventilation   really observe this tent  no lights included  however  it is a beauty  great purchase  i will have a second attempt tomorrow at a different campsite in my hometown  to do another chance in experiencing  and will submit a second review  bless up  thank you wal mart and coleman  great service and product      
78,5.0,                       here s what i love about this tent    i m a    year old woman and i can set it up and take it down all by myself    after figuring out the details the first time i used it  i was able to get it set up in less than    minutes the second time    the back window and door window both have zippered flaps so you can keep them open  even when the fly is on    i was able to get the tent back in the carrying case on the first try   no problem  here s the trick     lay out the fly inside the tent before you start to fold it up  leave the window and door unzipped so it doesn t trap air as you re trying to fold it  use the length of the poles as the guide for how wide the folded tent should be in order to make sure it will fit into the carrying case  once you ve folded the tent lengthwise to be no wider than the poles  lay the poles down on the edge of the tent and start rolling the tent  tightly  around the polls  before putting it in the carrying case  tie the tent very tightly once it s rolled upgreat tent   have fun      
79,4.0,                       i bought this tent last summer for a cross country road trip to california  spending half the trip camping in yellowstone  the price was right and coleman branded products have never done me wrong  i didn t test it out before i hit the road due to time constraints  it doesn t take up very much room at all when packed  it actually packs smaller than my sleeping bag  the first stop was yellowstone and the weather forecast was calling for light rain  so i figured it would be the perfect test for this tent  the setup was very fast and simple  especially with   people  i think we set it up in approximately    minutes or less without directions  it looked identical to the product photo in the amazon description  a queen size mattress fit perfectly in this tent  with over a foot to spare on one side  it did indeed rain the first night and the tent held up like a champ  at first  i was worried about the rain fly not being big enough to cover the window screens  but it made it through the night without letting in a single drop of rain  the only complaint i have about this tent is the lack of ventilation  it could definitely use bigger window screens for more of breeze on those hot summer nights      
80,5.0,                       we took this on a   day camping trip  both rustic and modern sites  it performed beyond my expectations as far as ease of setup and take down  durability  and rain protection     minutes to put up and take down is about right  though with one person i found it took a few minutes longer  i was able to put it up by myself but it s much easier with two of course  it rained for three nights on our trip  one night relatively heavily  and the rain fly did its job keeping the water out  one night our blanket did get wet in the corner where it was against the tent but i m pretty sure it was from condensation instead of a leak  it got a little windy as well and the tent seemed solid the whole time  the zippers functioned well and the netting worked keeping the bugs out  there was plenty of space for the two of us and the queen air mattress fit fine with enough room for our bags on the side  really hard to flip it over inside the tent though once inflated so if you need to inflate upside down like ours and turn over  i d inflate it outside the tent if possible  i wouldn t try to fit more than two people in here unless they were small children or you re pretty comfortable sleeping almost on top of each other  for the price this is an awesome value overall and i m very pleased with my purchase      
81,5.0,                       i bought this tent in may      for a    day camping trip    adult     small boys  that took us from california to utah  wyoming  montana  washington  oregon and back to southern california   i broke this baby down and packed it back up almost nightly since we only doubled our nights in oregon   tent is set up in less than    minutes even when staking into the tough or rocky ground can be troublesome     the stakes are weak but the ones usually issued with a tent are so do yourself a favor and invest in some heavy duty stakes right away         also buy yourself a rubber mallet for staking ease    i fit the new stakes and mallet directly into the tent bag so it s always ready since the      purchase this tent has also seen several other campgrounds including arizona        and the most recent trip to zion a few days ago        i believe this tent has a lot more life to it and i am very happy with my purchase      
82,5.0,                       this is for the   man tent it s pros   waterproof  weatherproof  i only experienced a light drizzle but nothing got in and it was well built  easy to assemble and reassemble  i m a camping noob and i got it in less than    minsmixed   space  it is really only a   man   tent if you literally just have the room to sleep  i had a bag  lunch box  and sleeping bag and i had to take half the tent for me  half for the other stuff  i couldn t imagine having an equal sized full grown man in it  however  this makes it lightweight and easy to use for a single campercons   stakes feel cheap  most recommend an upgrade  height is about     feet at most  you will be crouching in and out of this tent  this is just due to the design being short and lightweightif you re desperately needing a tent and this is the only available before your next impromptu trip  this is a good one  if you can spring for it  chop off about   person for each  size  of the tent     
83,5.0,                       these tents are amazing   we have used them on two trips now and are very happy   we purchased the exact same   person tent for ourselves and two of these smaller ones for our older children   the kids love having their own tent   above all though we were in rangeley  me this weekend and had two torrential down pours for several hours and not one drop of water in the tent   these tents are very easy to put up      
84,2.0,                       this tent is definitely not big enough for   queen beds  my husband  son and i have been camping in this for a year now  it withstands weather aka rain but that s about it  you can t fit   queen beds  not sure what they re smoking  you can t stand up  you can t move around freely  this tent heats up very quick  like there s no ventilation and the zipper is already breaking  i m pissed  and i am telling the truth here  oh fyi we can only fit a queen for my husband and i  and a twin for our   year old son  we barely fit  don t waste your money please just for a name brand      
85,2.0,                       in the product description  it says  stands up to winds     not the case  we really love this tent  it s a great size  easy to assemble and pretty much water proof  however  our first time out in it we had a rainstorm with some wind rip through our campsite which broke both fiberglass poles  the only thing they sell are  repair kits  where you can rework and replace sections of the pole  which won t work for us  because the fiberglass splintered in many places  we need entirely new poles  we are going to try and salvage the tent by buying aluminum poles  which are far sturdier  if you re trying to get into camping  buy a tent with aluminum poles or don t bother   i m honestly mad it didn t work out   i say  mostly waterproof  because when the wind flattened our tent  water got in through the side netting  normally covered by the rain fly   but then again a tent isn t supposed to stand sideways  is it  not sturdy at all  to give you an idea  we were asleep when the storm started  and woke up with wind pressing the top of the tent down on our faces  we had to hold it up with our hands until the storm subsided  also  there are small holes in the corners where the waterproof bottom is sown to the top  random  zippered holes  water gets through here  can t figure out for the life of me what that feature s for  but rain gets through  thoroughly pissed      
86,5.0,                       love this tent  my partner and i spent weeks researching a good   person tent to take camping in the southern colorado rockies  and we found it  this tent is extremely spacious  the reason we bought such a large tent is because we have   dogs and we were all able to have our own space and be totally comfortable  this tent is perfect for people with dogs because it s heavy duty   when we went camping  it withstood the power of their little claws   didn t rip   even when they jumped up on the sides to try and look out the windows  it was an extremely easy setup and breakdown   took us    minutes at most  this tent is also completely waterproof  we went camping in august   the middle of southern colorado s monsoon season   and we got hit suddenly by a pretty bad storm  not only did our tent stay completely dry inside  but it also stayed in place as we braced   mph wind gusts  i would recommend this tent to anyone looking for a stress free camping trip      
87,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          we got this tent for   people  because we mostly go camping by car and we like to have more space in the tent for luggage and other stuff pros   small when packaged and light  extremely easy to install   take down  my wife did it easily by herself   no tears  materials seem high quality  very good ventilation  entry mat  tarp   very nice shape  the price is ridiculously small for such a nice tent cons  or rather room for improvement    zipper gets caught in the zipper cover  but if you do it slow  it s all good   there was a second night when temps dropped to    and there was no way to cover the bottom air vent and a lot of cold air came in near our heads  we were just to lazy to change position so we just buried ourselves under the sleeping bags   so far  we really like it  we re yet to test in the rain  but i m hopeful there will be no problems     
88,5.0,                       well  i just went camping and there was a serious rain and wind storm the blew tents and canopies all around except for this tent   it stayed put and the wind blew very hard and the top went up and back down where the poles stretched and i have to say that it s the best tent that i ve ever owned and we appreciate who made it because it kept us dry and safe  there were actually tents that rolled over the tent and it never ripped nor got damaged  it actually protected us not just from the rain and wind but from the other tents and canopies  love it and i need another one so bad because i want to get one for my buddy that i went camping with   he was dumbfounded as i was and he wants one now      
89,5.0,                       coleman is well known for the quality of its products  this didn t disappoint  i bought this for burning man  which was my mistake  i thought the top of the tent was sealed  but it s not   there is a portion of the top of the dome that is mesh  which is nice if you want ventilation and to have a view of the sky  there s also a rain fly to put over the top to cover the mesh in case it does rain  however  if you re going to the desert where there s sandstorms or similar weather  it s not the best suited as sand dirt easily flies around the rain cover to get into the tent  this was no fault of coleman s though   just my ignorance and i hope it helps some of you better prepare by determining if this is the right tent model for your adventures  good for outdoors  good for the rain  not so good for sandstorms  aside from that  the tent was sturdy and i was able to put it together by myself in about       minutes  there are side pockets on the inside  and there s placement to hang a lantern from the center on the inside for light at night  the description says its a   person tent  and it probably could fit four  average  sized people tightly together without luggage  but it s good sizing for a couple with luggage  and maybe a third depending on how tall big you all are  for me by myself  it was great having the extra room to have my belongings out  i would highly recommend      
90,4.0,                       it s a coleman   great entry level tent that s easy to put up  even for a    year old   love the bathtub floor  i sure wish tents had that feature when i was a kid  it would have saved me many nights of gear getting soaking wet    i also love that the pole sleeves are as small as possible and that it relies on pole clips for most of the length of the poles   that makes getting the poles in and up so much easier than a full length sleeve   i wouldn t exactly call them snag proof but they re a notable improvement over full length sleeves i like the fly on this model  it has one pole that goes front to back and does not require much bending   similar coleman models have a smaller fly pole that you have to bend into a u shape  putting tremendous tension on the fiberglass and subjecting it to splintering   this model s fly pole is thicker and only has a slight bend so i expect it to last longer biggest complaint is the zipper gets caught in the  zipper cover  all the time and for kids who don t know any better  they just keep pulling until it s completely jammed   this is not a great design and needs to be revisited as with all tents on the market     person  means   people sleeping right up on each other with no room for gear   so this is really a tent for   people at most   we ve slept   in it comfortably    adult   kids    adults   kid  although we did start to run short on room for gear at some point      
91,4.0,                       first time buying and using a tent to go camping  in my infinite wisdom  i decided to purchase a summer tent to camp in the winter  this is definitely a summer tent  it was extremely easy to set up and included just about everything in the bag except for a mallet to hammer the stakes into the ground  the stakes are pretty flimsy but do the job well  i bent one stake when i was hammering it into a rock underneath the soil  maybe buy some better ones set up took me about   or   minutes taking my time  the bottom of the tent is noticeably thicker then the rest of the tent but i still used a tarp underneath it to protect it  my issue was that i went camping in february when it was extremely cold  the sides of the tent have mesh screen windows that you cannot zip up  they are covered from the outside like an awning so you can t see through them but a lot of air still gets in  on another side there is a zip up window cover  which i had zipped up  on the fourth side is a large door and the door also has another window you can unzip if you want  i am       and was unable to stand up in this but i had maybe   or   ft inside during the night i went camping it got probably around    degrees fahrenheit  i was very cold inside this tent even layered up  which is more my fault than anything  but everyone should be aware that this is definitely not a tent you take in the winter  the tent  however  did hold up well to the wind that i experienced  like i said  it was just cold inside you can probably fit a queen size inflatable mattress inside this  i used a tall twin mattress and had plenty of room  i wouldn t say that you can fit four people comfortably in this but this is more like a couple s tent i would say maximum two people if you value a little personal space at the end of my trip  takedown was super simple and i was able to roll it up and fit everything back in the original bag which some people stated that they were not able to do  just roll tightly other than that this is a awesome tent that i will continue to use and make use out of in the summertime when it is warmer  i have no complaints about it and at the price point it is perfect      
92,4.0,                       purchased this tent in a rush for a boy scout trip with my son  trusted the coleman name as my family used their products during my childhood with good results  overall  i am pleased with this tent  it is roomy  but i d say any more than three people and it s too crowded for my taste  one thing to not is i do not recommend this tent for fall winter camping  they put the word  sun  in the name for a reason  this trip was on a cold night in october and the temps fell to about    with rain overnight  we were well protected from the rain  but there was little protection from the wind that kept blowing in  even with the flaps closed  i used an indoor heater to keep us warm so not a huge issue  another point i ll bring up is i don t recommend putting it together with one person if you can avoid it  my son is    so unfortunately was not much help with this baby  took me a solid    minutes to get it set up the first time  none of these items are dealbreakers and i will be taking this tent camping againpros good quality constructionkeeps you dry during light moderate rainspacious for up to   peoplecons can t block out strong windnot for colder tempshard to put up with one person if inexperienced     
93,1.0,                       shock cord in two of the three poles broke    before i could put it up the second time  before we went camping  i set it up  which was easy  i aired it out and used coleman seam sealer as suggested in several reviews  giving it time to dry  i took it down the next morning friday on labor day weekend  i went to put it up  and the shock cord simply unraveled on one pole    broke  undaunted i was going to figure out something  as i began to straighten the other long pole  same thing happened in the same way  at this point i was rather daunted fortunately  we were not camping far from home  i have two older tents in the garage    much older  i was able to find two poles of about the same length and diameter  i was able to put up this new tent that way  it s not quite perfect  but it saved the weekend  to recap  i used poles from a tent that was over    years old  and the shock cord was still elastic enough and in good enough condition  only the second time i tried to put of the new tent  the shock cord failed it rained twice that weekend  once it rained two hours straight without let up  the next time it rained off and on for several hours  there were no leaks at all  i cannot say if it would have without the seam sealer  one note  a good wind will blow in rain underneath the rain fly  the mesh makes up nearly all of two of the walls  and the rain fly only extends a few inches below  i suppose adjusting the guy lines or stakes might help keep out rain in a strong wind  but i can assure you the wind will blow in rain if it hits hard enough and from a certain direction  beware this is definitely not a cold weather tent    not even a mid to late fall tent  further  with the rain fly on and tightly secured  there is not that much air flow  and it did get it pretty warm  hot  inside  adjusting the rain fly without completely removing it is possible and not too much of a headache in conclusion  my experience with this tent leaves me giving it a one star  because that s all i can do  in fact  it s a negative five stars because it was broken and thus didn t work  rarely throwing anything out saved me this time  it s past the return window  so i m not entirely sure where to go from here  i suppose i can get two new poles somehow  but i m not excited about paying to return the broken ones  which i assume they would want  as that will probably cost me around     dollars  assuming the poles did work  the tent would have been fine  i m not sure it was what we really needed  but that is on me for not better researching i suppose      
94,3.0,                       the purchase of this tent was predicated on reviews i read online  most important to me was its waterproofing feature which i found not to be so great  i did a practice setup in my backyard and with an impending rain shower due to a cold front passage it was a good opportunity to test its waterproofing feature  it rained during the early morning   not heavily but a constant  drizzle for sometime  in the morning i opened the tent to find water in every corner on the inside  it was most in the corner where there is a small zipper to allow passage of an extension cord  i had passed through an extension cord a zippered up the best i can  i investigated and found that about     inches of seam away from each corner had pin holes associated with the stitching  had i stretched those areas too much when i installed the pegs  who knows  in any case i acquired a tube of a tent sealant and ran it generously in those areas that seemed compromised  i will follow up with a test after a few days   other than that i am pleased with this tent so far update  so i applied a product   tent seal   which is a liquid   along the seams  of the problem areas   the corners  i applied inside as well as outside about    inches or so away from each corner  it drizzled again for an hour or so and all corners except the corner with the through hole for an extension cord was dry  this time though i did not have an extension cord passing through and the zipper was closed all the way  well this area  corner  had a puddle of water on the floor  there was water in the seam where the upper fabric meets the lower tarp part  so water had to be coming in from that location   i also found the entire zipper to be wet even though the outer flap had covered it i will wait for that area to dry out and then retreat with  the tent sealant  i will report back update number    so i applied tent sealant in the zip area where one can pass through an extension cord  it rained heavily last night and when i checked for water on the inside there only a few drops  so that is much better  the zipper still got wet so i am thinking of adding somehow a layer of waterproof fabric in that area to reduce or eliminate the entrance of water  having said that i see in the product description that this tent is now water resistance as opposed to waterproof      
95,4.0,                       overall  this is a safe bet for   people that don t mind getting cozy  if a heavy rain is in the forecast  bring an extra tarp  or more towels pros   setup is fairly easy and quick  if you ve set up a tent before ever in your life  you ll understand how to set this one up   great views at night if you choose to sleep without the rainfly  due to a generously sized screened roof   the addition of the small doormat type tarp is thoughtful  even more effective if you buy an inexpensive rug to go on top of that to remove sand and debris from your feet before entering   relatively lightweight  could serve as a hiking tent for overnight trips cons   have a heavy duty ground tarp  i used this tent fresh out of the box with a ground tarp and still ended up with  damage to the floor  we had steady rainfall for       hours  and water came in at all   corners where the nylon joins to the tub  being brand new  i didn t think i would need to seal the seams  apparently  i was wrong   like most tents  this was hot and muggy with the rainfly on  so either be ok with that  or bring a fan   if you use this without a rainfly  be aware of who s around if you sleep in the nude or plan to change your clothes  you will give someone a show if you re not careful   definitely only fits   adults who like each other  or maybe   small  uncommonly cooperative children  it says it would fit a queen size air mattress  i don t know how  with a single cot and air mattress topper  i was out of space   comes with the standard cheap wire stakes  toss those and get something a little more substantial  like a heavy plastic stake or yard nails      
96,5.0,                       edit   we ve taken this tent camping in several weather conditions now   we ve been camping in    degree heat  temps in the    s at night  and heavy rain and wind   we stayed dry in the rain and wind  it vents really well in the heat  and it does reasonably well in cold temps   i am pleasantly surprised   i have never owned a coleman tent before but i m pretty impressed so far this review is after our first   night camping trip  we bought the   person tent  this is a nice tent for the price if you consider what it s made for and what it s not made for   i recommend this for   people  and   dogs  or a small family  the tent is half mesh so this tent is great for warm weather  not so great for cold weather  it is very breathable though so condensation is not a problem   we put a queen mattress inside and there is just enough room on the sides to walk bent over or for some gear   the temperature got down into the mid    s at night and we were plenty warm enough with our good sleeping bags  the third day was about    degrees in the daytime and the tent vented as well as any tent would  you could remove the rain fly if you wanted but i prefer the privacy  it s really easy to set up  really easy  it took us less than    minutes to set up  the tent pegs are just the standard cheap tent pegs that any tent comes with  we have nicer tent pegs that we always use  always put a tarp down underneath the tent as a ground cover  we would not take this tent if the weather forecast called for rain or wind or freezing temps  we have a much more expensive tent if we are going to be camping in extreme conditions  i wouldn t call this a   season tent  i would call this a summer tent  i like it for its simplicity and convenience  the little zippered corner to run an extension cord through is a nice touch  so  i recommend this for light duty camping  i would take a different tent for more extreme conditions      
97,4.0,                       finally been able to test it last weekend  as much as i was disappointed with overall camping experience   pouring rain and wind for two nights in a row   and some rain in between  the more i liked quality of the tent  i was the only person in a group of ten people whose tent did not leak  granted  by the end of the camping event the walls were soaking wet but the tent was still dry inside it is quite spacious and fits two queen size inflatable mattresses side by side  but with no space in between  and then there is about two feet wide space left  by one side of the tent for storage there are two windows with a zippered flap and one side of the tent is a mesh with no flap  which i disliked since the wind would blow water from under the rain cover into that window   also  there is a protective sleeve covering a door zipper which would constantly get caught into a zipper and require some jiggling in the middle of the night which was not an optimal timing if you catch my drift overall  i do like the design and quality with just minor flaws      
98,4.0,                       i ordered this tent to do some disperse summer time camping and amazon was offering a good deal on it  i m really pleased with it so far  had it set up with some help from my friend in about    minutes and was able to break it down myself in about      minutes i had read reviews about how waterproof it is  but decided to spray the tent and seams with some alsko waterproofing tent spray i had and let it cure for    hours while set up in my backyard  this baby is extremely waterproof now  surviving a summer thunderstorm  staying completely dry the bottom of the tent is made of tarp like material but i  highly  recommend using a tent footprint to keep it from ripping and ensuring the bottom stays dry  i just use a tarp i picked up at harbor freight for a few bucks and stake it into the ground with the tent i did not bother using the tent stakes that came with the tent  instead i used heavy duty metal tent stakes i already own  the ones they send are kinda janky and may not hold the tent well when there s a lot of wind gusts there s a lot of ventilation in this tent making it perfect for camping during the summer  air moves very well  especially when you have the entrance and window unzipped  sorta wish the screen covered the entire entrance but that s ok the rainfly is easy to put on  using just one pole and covers the tent well  use the guylines on it to stake into ground to keep the tent more stable in windy weather  it s also really nice that you can leave it off if there s no rain forecasted so you can look up into the night sky and enjoy the stars it does have a ring for hanging a lantern but it s not very heavy duty so i just used it to hold a small collapsible solar lantern  has two pockets  one on each side to hold lighter objects like a phone or small flashlight  it has a flap to run an extension cord into the tent  which is cool  if you re mostly doing car camping  this is a solid choice  it takes up very little room  only weighs a couple pounds and is super easy to set up break down  i would not recommend this for backpacking tho i definitely agree with others that this is a summer tent  there s so much ventilation in it that it would probably be uncomfortable to camp in lower temperatures  i do a majority of my camping in the southeast so it ll be fine for me in the spring and early to mid fall but if you re in colder climates definitely keep this one for summer use only overall  i m satisfied with my purchase and it meets the requirements i need it for  seriously  if you re looking for an inexpensive tent to do some weekend camping here and there  this would be a great choice  i did purchase the   person tent  even tho i mostly camp alone  so if a friend decided to join me there s adequate room  easily fits   adults with some room for gear  when i m alone  i can fit my sleeping bag and all my gear comfortably  it is  ftx ft      
99,5.0,                       i have used this tent a few times a year for the past few years and i have to say that i am pretty pleased after looking into purchasing other types of tents  it s very lightweight and compact  and it s simple to setup by yourself  i have  in fact  squeezed four grown men into this for a single night  yes  it was tight  but it was not intolerable  four on the floor with small backpacks and it was just fine  normally i like to use this tent for just myself a cot  it gets really tight with two cots  as far as the waterproofing  i have spent at least one night in heavy downpours and multiple nights with moderate rain and i have never seen a single drop get inside  i have taken this down river in a canoe and it has even been blown into a thorn bush  i got lucky there was no major damage   i would definitely recommend this tent for someone in search of an all around reliable tent  it s reasonably priced and it has done me very well      
100,5.0,                       so far i m very impressed for this price  my husband and i read the instructions and had no problem figuring it out  i was a bit scared we wouldn t be able to roll it and fit it back in the bag but we did first time trying  make sure all air gets rolled out as you go along and it fits  everything seems sturdy as long as the winds stay below    or so  i don t know about being rainproof as i haven t used it outdoors yet  nice pouches inside for holding things like car keys  holds both of us ok  i would use one larger air mattress instead of two if using those  otherwise two sleeping bags will fit fine  photos showing it put up and in case next to kitten for size reference      
101,1.0,                       the worst experience  coleman this days is just name  coleman not at all what it use to be just four days after first use in a very simple and relaxed weather one of the post was broken in   different points and some of the fabric disjointed  also the electric inflator came without an adaptor  also a lamp broken anyway  i was overseas and wrote them  to ask for a new stick for the same tent  the very same stick     post   what they send  me paying the post of course  was a bunch of little sticks  needles  cord    with different sizes  made in china  with instructions for an engineer very bad and frustrating experience  it damaged the vacations  twice      
102,5.0,                       our   year old daughter had been asking for a tent  which was a little weird since we ve never gone camping with her   being that i ve been trying to get my wife to commit to a short camping weekend for years  it made my day regardless  i was happy to look for a basic tent that could hold   people comfortably  and   in a pinch   i needed something easy for one person to put up  since if when we go camping  she d be dealing with the kids while i set up the site  and the kids  helping  me wouldn t do much until they get a little older    i also didn t want something pricey  since there was no guarantee that it would get used a second time this tent looked to be a good fit for our admittedly basic needs   though we got it for her as a holiday present  we didn t use it until memorial day  albeit in the backyard   setup was a breeze  though it s a bit annoying when putting the poles through as they ll catch from time to time on the fabric  she helped feed the poles through though which did made a difference   plenty of room for two  four would be snug   zippers were easy for her to use  doesn t seem like a big thing  but some tents have crappy zippers   but you do need to pay attention so as to not catch the fabric in the teeth taking it down was easy  it helped that i could just throw the deconstructed tent over the swingset to dry out  from the dew  of course   i did like that the bag was big enough to easily fit the tent after folding rolling it up once it dried   i ve had a couple tents where you had to really struggle to get it back in all in all i m really happy with this purchase   it s much better quality than i was expecting given the price  and the bells and whistles that some more expensive tents come with shouldn t be an expectation here   it hits the sweetspot of good quality and good price  and most importantly  it s given my daughter and i a nice bonding experience  my father s day present from her is another backyard campout       
103,3.0,                       it s a cheap tent  this cuts both ways of course  so far my only problem is that the material on the base of the tent has developed a couple small  head of a pin  sized holes after only a few times camping  i ve put a tarp under it every time expecting some crappy material here  but this wasn t enough to avoid the holes and scuffing interior is holding up well   seams are all right  cords and pulls aren t pulling loose or breaking  overall a great sized tent that i can share with my two boys very comfortably and  at      stand up in with no problems  the bag is a bit strange imo as it features a tear away sash  with the sash in place the tent barely fits back in the bag after careful preparation  after it s torn away the bag is huge with lots of extra space so the tent doesn t hold a good shape and makes kind of a lumpy loaf that doesn t balance or pack well      
104,5.0,                       let me qualify this review by saying i ve never been camping and haven t slept in the tent yet  nonetheless  the tent is cute and super easy to set up  the instructions are inside the bag and easy to follow  took me about    minutes to set up  the tent is very spacious  too  i think it could comfortably fit   adults who love each other and maybe     small kids  if you don t mind being cramped  i could see   children easily sleeping in this   i ll update the review after my camping trip next weekend          
105,5.0,                       since most stuff has been closed or off limits since covid  we pitched this tent in our backyard and have been doing some sleep outs on warmer nights  the kids love  love  love it and i do too  reminds me of times i spent in the countryside of sw wisconsin  material is sturdy  design good and there is enough room for   average size adults  took about      minutes to set up once we figured out what all the parts do and where they go  i guess my only gripe with this tent is the stakes  they should be at least     inches longer  we left our tent out a few weeks ago when chicago had     mph winds and came home to it blown over  not the tent s fault  the stakes were deep in the ground but the wind must have been so strong to have pulled them out      
106,5.0,                       my husband and i used a coleman cabin tent for many years but now  planning a trip to the san juan islands  it was time to see what else was available   this is our first dome tent  we set it up at home to practice and i m glad we did  once we figured it out we were able to set up and take down easily  we bought the   person tent which is comfortable for two adults  we would have felt cramped with a third except possibly a small child  got a little worried setting up the tent in washington s moran state park  the entire top and part of the sides are covered with a mesh and it started to rain  then we figured out how the rain flap worked  and it does work  this little tent stood up to pouring rain and high winds for two days and nights without leaking at all  kind of funny   we saw someone with the same tent and rain flap who put a tarp over the whole thing  didn t need it to stay dry but maybe it provides extra warmth  i think we ll try it next time  we just bought a second sundome tent for future trips with the family      
107,4.0,                       i purchased this to be able to quickly pop up a tent from car truck and not backpacking with it taking up as least space as possible  the tent is packaged in a box inside the carrying bag  once the tent is out of the box  the carrying bag has a way of expanding to be larger than what is shown on the photo  making it bigger than what you may think  the tent goes up easy and is somewhat self explanatory  the instructions are permanently part of the storage bag and easy to read  it comes with metal loop spikes and a rain cover  which may be the most challenging part of putting the tent together   hammer to pound in loop spikes into ground not included i didn t have any issues with the zippers getting stuck while opening and closing the access panel  might just be luck  i ve always had issues with every tent with zippers getting stuck haven t been in rain yet      
108,5.0,                       i ve have bought   of these for myself and grandkids in both the   and   person size and have been super impressed with them  we ve x ski snow camped in minus    f degrees from montana  to high altitude wilderness afternoon mountain downpours  to the hot gale force winds of southern utah desert canyons  no leaks  no tears zero problems  even though they are not the ultra lightest tents on the market for backpacking or bikepacking  it s my go to every time for comfort and dependability  i will say it s harder to sleep in with the green version over the blue as the rising sun radiates through it  the green seems to stay cooler than the blue in the afternoon sun however when you are ready for a little after lunch nap at base camp  the only modification i have made is to ditch the tent stakes and tie on a fewish feet of     cord to secure it to rocks trees whatever  it s lighter and more secure  enjoy      
109,5.0,                       i had to go back to my purchase history and add a review for this tent after a recent camping trip   due to poor location choice next to a a barn  all of the barn roof runoff collected into a    deep puddle around this tent   nothing seeped into it  but there was maybe     cup of water to clean out the next morning as the screen was mostly open due to the heat   i remember camping    years ago and any water on the ground came right into the tent  things sure have improved      
110,5.0,                       i waited to write this review until i had a few trips with it under my belt  after spending four nights in it during two separate trips  i m pleased to report this tent is awesome it was super easy to put together  setup was about    minutes and didn t even require directions to figure out the durability seems to be good  however  i feel this is something i won t be able to provide feedback on until i see how it holds up over the next few trips what i think is the most important thing to mention  and why i felt so strongly to give   stars is how well it held up during two nights of thunderstorms on my most recent trip  first i was nervous to freeze because the temps were in the   s and i didn t have anything special for a sleeping blanket  somehow with all the windows zipped up  it stayed pretty toasty in the tent  on top of staying warm  we stayed completely dry  there were no leaks or drips anywhere  on the second night  our blankets that were pressed between the side of the tent and our air mattresses became a little damp but that could ve been from condensation because there was no visible water in the tent i paid right around      for the   person tent and it had far exceeded my expectations so far      
111,3.0,                       setup     sturdiness     size as advertised     this was a nice little tent for the price but the size description is extremely misleading the product description specified that this tent can hold a queen air mattress  what it failed to mention was that the mattress would fill the entire floor space and there would be no room for anything else  luckily  we purchased a full size air mattress  since the store was out of queen  so we had a sliver of floor space to maneuver around in  getting the air mattress inflated in the tent was fun as you can t pump the air mattress up inside but you also can t comfortably try to fill it from the outside  the entryway itself was not wide enough to fit the mattress through either what took the cake was trying to to get out of the tent without rolling over your sleeping mate as there was no room to maneuver except for on the mattress itself  and if you ve ever slept on the air mattress  you will surely remember the motion transfer that happens when moving  imagine being in a giant bouncy house and you ll experience our two days in this tent  we had many moments of laughter when someone tried to exit  if you want somewhere to put your bags or your feet  either buy a larger tent to truly accommodate a queen mattress or purchase a twin so you have room to walk around  if you don t need want an air mattress  then this would be a great tent      
112,3.0,                       we needed an extra tent for my daughter and her husband for our camping trip  i bought this tent because the description and measurements listed said it was a   person tent and seemed that it would be big enough  the description also said it would fit a queen size air mattress  this is not a   person tent    children may fit in it but not   adults  once we put in the queen mattress it took the entire floor space and there was no room to walk around it nor to put a fan in there  you had to climb in to the bed from the door opening and crawl across the bed to lay down  we are average size  everyone is under  ft  and you can t stand up in the tent  they only slept in it one night because they couldn t put in a fan and it was too hot  if you want a little tent for youths or teens with bed rolls this is fine  it didn t rain so i can t say if it was weather proof water tight  it was easy to put up and take down  wish i hadn t bought it as i have no use for it      
113,5.0,                       this is a great tent   i bought two of these for my boys to attend the boy scouts   the inside was much bigger than i expected   my boys are    and     they were able to set up and break down the tents with minimal to no assist from me   the design is very easy to assemble and very straight forward   the fly was also easy to put in place   my    year old is a little shorter than average and did need a little assistance placing this when the tent was set up  myself     year old and   year old little girl had plenty of room and could have placed some equipment inside   at   ft by   ft the boys should not out grow these compact size was another bonus when rolled up    this could easily be carried on a backpack or motorcycle is camping that way this was a great purchase looking forward to many years of use   i did buy seam sealer because its better to be over kill on some things      
114,4.0,                       i bought this tent about   years ago  i probably camp about    to    nights a year  this has held up incredibly well  all the stitching is still fine  i sealed the seams before i used it and i did not do one of the corners which then leaked the first time i went out  so i would definitely say if you re going to be in the rain cover with a tarp or seam seal  i can t speak to multiple wet nights because when i have been in heavy downpours anticipated i ve covered it with a tarp   easy enough to do for peace of mind  although really that first downpour everywhere that was sealed held well  for the price it s been a phenomenal little tent for car camping  very easy to put up  well ventilated but i ve even camped in    degrees and been fine      
115,4.0,                       i read a bunch of reviews on a bunch of different tents   every tent  a few people in the reviews complain about theirs leaking  even the expensive ones   so i got this one i tested it s effectiveness in being waterproof with a hose  this is not a good simulation of rain drops  which would be separate and spaced out   but     of the seams it did not leak  but in the places water droplets came through  i could see the sun lighting up the yellow thread at the inverted seams  that were not in the inverted seam   so it is easy to find   i will seam seal these locations  i am outside the return period on the tent  i did have a huge leak problem at the zipper   i m not sure why water is coming through yet   i am going to use waterproofing spray on the yellow flap that covers the zipper   if that doesn t work  i will literally use wide  clear tape on the yellow flap  or cut out tarp slightly larger and glue that on with a waterproof glue  i really shouldn t have to  i don t think they treated the yellow flap that covers the zipper it is described as waterproof  but it is only for light rain   glad other people got a really good version of this tent and stayed bone dry   more people said it was fully waterproof than less   i was unlucky      
116,5.0,                       literally   minute tent setup  only complaint would be the length of the poles  once extended and connected  makes it a bit of a hassle to slide through as needed for setup  but overall  easy peasy   this is a summer tent  meaning that you will get alot of exposure  even with the cover tarp on  you will still get some exposure  this is a good thing for airflow etc  if your expecting tons of privacy and possible usage for winter type conditions  this is not for that   overall  it holds up well  it easily accomodates   adult w  queen air mattress and some gear     person tent  not adults  maybe kids  but can be accomodating w    people w o air mattresses and gear  yes possible  i did not get any chance to see how it does in rain etc  but my other coleman tents i have have held up fantastic  so i d expect and hope for nothign less from this tent as well   i do wish teh tent door had a pole for some rigidity to open close like a door like some of the other coleman tents have  this is zipper up and floppy  but not a complaint  just a wish   the bag and items are all self contained and small like a duffle bag in size once your roll everything back up  not too heavy  but not exaclty light either  assuming your carrying other gear of course    it s a good one  and i m glad we got it  i expect years of usage out of it   great product      
117,5.0,                       great quality  capacity and easy set up with   ppl  slightly more challenging with   person  but still doable   ordering this tent for the second time had our first one for over   years  we generally camp       nights every summer  quite honestly  i think if we took better care of it  like completely dried it off after each camping trip and sprayed waterproofing on every year in the beginning of camping season  we could have used it for a another year or two  but the old one got a bit moldy and smelly and the roof started leaking a bit  so we decided to order a new one for upcoming road trip  looked into some other brands for a few days to see if there s a decent competition for the sundome  and came to a conclusion that it is still the best deal for the price  tarp floor material that comes up onto the walls of the tent is a game changer if you get caught in seriousrain  the big side windows are amazing for ventilation and stargazing in dry weather  the rain cover protects very well even in toughest rain  although i still recommend applying a fresh coat of weatherproofing to the roof and walls yearly  i will make sure to take better care of this one  and hopefully we won t need a new tent for about     years      
118,5.0,                       here we are in the summer of  stuck at home  and i had to get out of the house   i m used to traveling all summer so not being able to escape from the good ol  us of a this year was killing me   i decided to venture out on some solo camping trips in my little fiat    x   this tent is just perfect   easy up and easy down   it folds nice and compact to fit in my camping tub  it has kept the drizzle out on the oregon coast  and kept the heat in during below freezing night time temps at lassen national park   a regular height cot definitely fits snug  but a lower to the ground one was perfect   i ve got   more camping trips planned for the summer and can t wait to sleep in this tent under the stars      
119,1.0,                       this took   grown adults to hold and put together because the instructions were horrendous and within trying to hold it and trying to not get whipped by the metal sticks and break it   it was just a mess  unfortunately i lost my money on this because i waited too long to return it   my fault on that one  but this was horrible   if you need an amazing tent please see the following link  https   www amazon com dp b   gn      coliid i zkz xhyisxr  colid  tv  fmq kotu psc   ref  lv ov lig dp itworth every penny  you literally just drop it down and boom     opens up for you  no fuss  no mess  no tedious insertions of metal or hooks   if you go camping   trust me on this          
120,5.0,                       i bought this tent in      when i saw it on sale for        without any intention of using it anytime soon but having one just in case  due to everything going on this year  i was going nuts being stuck inside so i finally took the plunge and started using it for camping adventures in the rocky mountains  so far  so good  i ve used this tent   separate times now and about   nights of sleeping so far  my first trip was a solo one and i had never pitched a tent before by myself  the instructions on the bag tag didn t make the most sense but after about    minutes i figured it out on my own  now i can setup or take down the tent by myself in      minutes  even less if i have some help the included rain fly is very nice for that purpose as well as providing shade over the mesh openings if you re trying to sleep in a little in the mornings  there are two side windows you can open up for a nice breeze and viewing  everything zips up nice and easy  however i would advise using both hands when zipping or unzipping the main door  it does have a tendency to catch fabric in the zipper if you re not careful i have only slept in the tent by myself so far using a    memory foam mattress  plenty of room for     people  a family of     could probably fit comfortably in here with sleeping bags and small children  i don t think   adults could sleep too comfortably unless everyone was very cozy with each other the included tent stakes are pretty weak  i ve already bent almost half of them  so anticipate buying a new set of them at some point  not a big deal  i had to use rocks to secure my tent better after some high wind gusts blew it around a little bit overall the quality of this tent is very nice and i would buy it again  especially at the price i paid  i see now the price is        which is probably still a fair price but in that range i would recommend doing some research and seeing if there is a better buy but even at full price this is a good quality tent  so far the coldest i ve slept in it was around     weather with some light rains and i stayed warm with just a couple blankets  no sleeping bag  i don t know if this would be a good tent for winter camping but i think it would hold up just fine for some late fall snowfall and cold temps when the off season has begun      
121,5.0,                       i got my first sundome back in     ish   it died last year   i own the  x   x  and  x   i live in so fla and we get very heavy rain in the  winter  when front come through   i use and extra set of tent poles as extra cross member for fly  and this gives you a spare if you break one of you poles   the bat tub come up on the sides and is like plastic tarp material   this keeps the splash from serious rain from wetting the edge of the    the fly is taped  underneath on the seams but i still seam seal all the seams not under the fly  i also seam seal an area of about    square on the top of the fly  where all the seams cross because often there are low spots that will hold water on the top of fly   especially on the corners where the rings are for the stakes   the vent on the back really does work   i use a same usb fan to circulate the air to cool the tent while the air temp goes down   the little flap for a power cord is a super nice addition to me no other tent in its price range even comes close      
122,5.0,                       tent camping has come a long way   this tent is extremely reasonably priced and is working great   i bought this tent because my boyfriend is a bit of a tent camper   i grew up in a camper trailer so my experience with tents are pretty limited my first experience with a tent was    years ago   i was in a old different tent with two other teens and it rained and flooded out our tent   one of the ladies had brought a full mattress which took up much of the floor and it was soaking wet for the rest of the week with this experience in mind  i set off on this tent s maiden voyage with great trepidation   of course   the worst happened   it poured rain and blew wind all night   i was dry in the morning and the tent was still standing   i was impressed   there was no way that the tent i had my first tenting adventured in would have faired so well i love this tent   i ve used it   times now   the only qualm i have is the bag zipper broke   but seriously  for the price  this has been a great tent   super easy to assemble      
123,5.0,                       i had not been camping and thus devoid of experience with tents for well over    years   with that in mind  i bought two of these and headed out for   nights of camping   i was pleasantly surprised when i unpacked them and was able to assemble them both in a matter of minutes without looking at the instructions   you don t have to be a engineer to figure out what to do   as a matter of fact  it may help not being an engineer  because engineers can screw up a one man parade   but that s the biggest reason i took the vacation  to get away from the engineers at my job anyway  we experienced some good days and some rainy days  and these held up without any issues   we had two small adults in one tent  and two adults  a small child  and a dog in the other tent   i was expecting the second one to be a bit cramped  but it was actually fine   our experience led us to buy a camper but that was not due to any fault of the tents   i will probably keep them in the camper just in case someone pisses me off and i can make them sleep outside without feeling guilty      
124,4.0,                       so i bought this for a camping trip this summer up by the coast  it was fine during the day but at night the wind blew right in and cold seeped into this tent  i was sleeping with a lot of blankets  a big comforter  flannel sheets and another person on a tall air matress elevated from the ground and it was still freezing  would only recommend for any place that doesn t get below    at night  i didn t realize when i bought the tent that the big   mesh windows  were always windows  as in there is no zipper flap to cover the mesh with a more solid fabric so they are always open  which also means without the rain fly you would have no privacy  it didn t really rain while we were camping but it did get moist on a few of the days and the rain fly did keep the water out  it does say in the description that it s good for warm weather but also makes it sound like it can withstand some mildly cold weather by stating that it can withstand winds and rain and i feel like a paid a lot for a tent that is neither that big nor good for any weather that isn t    or above      
125,5.0,                       best little tent ever  room for a twin mattress and all my stuff for   nights withstood the worst windstorm  with the addition of heavy rocks placed on the stakes  my only complaint is the upper mesh sides with no cover flap  at night it was below    so i covered them with the webbed side of a vinyl tablecloth  still  this tent cost half the price of one night in a cheap moab motel  get one      
126,5.0,                       inexpensive  capacious  big bathtub style floors  i seam sealed the tent before using it  it made it through one big rain storm  one of the fiberglass tent pole sections splintered at the joint  duct tape fixed it and it s still holding up three years later  can be difficult to set up alone  easier with a helper  not a lot of ventilation  so the tent can get hot  lack of ventilation leads to lots of condensation in the morning  i ve had good results in wind without having to use every guy line this tent has to offer  very private with the rainfly in place  big enough for queen mattress and a sitting area  all inside  great to be able to stand and dress  or shelter a group of four comfortably standing during rain storms      
127,5.0,                       for the     i paid for it  this is a fantastic little tent   it goes up easy  comes down easy  and if you don t do it horribly wrong  you can even get it back into the bag on a repeatable basis   the tent floor is the waterproof tarp material  pretty durable   we put coleman cots in it when we camp  and have not had any issues with the cot feet damaging the floor   per the usual  the  four person  rating is always a bit of a stretch   this will exactly hold   coleman cots  or probably   people on the ground on pads     kids  maybe   we ve camped in it in the rain  wind  and snow and it has held up just fine   i really do not have any complaints or concerns about it  especially for the price   the only thing i d recommend is to really stake it down  don t skimp on that  you ll see the best form and interior space if you properly stake it down      
128,5.0,                       we have owned tons of tents and this is the most perfect tent for florida car camping   it is very sturdy   held up way better than all of our friends tents in the rain as the bottom folds up and keeps the floods out   the rain fly works wonderfully   but the best thing about this tent is how well air circulates   i would not use this tent in cold weather   i would not use this tent for back packing hiking   i have hiked lots of the at    however  for car camping  in warm weather  this tent can t be beat   seriously awesome   very roomy  we take our queen size bed and still have tons of room for gear  clothes  etc         
129,4.0,                       i used this tent for the first time last weekend with my   year old twin boys for boy scouts camp out  it is a great looking tent and easy to set up and take down  it took us maybe    minutes  i got the full experience in just    hours  we set up in hot and dry conditions   at first glance it looked like it was well constructed and  pretty roomy inside  thankfully  i  put the rain fly on because a heavy thunderstorm rolled through a few hours later  i was worried the tent was going to be a goner  there were high winds and heavy rain  we took shelter in a big common area and after the first part of the storm passed we went to check on the tents  to my amazement  it was still standing and completely dry  we thought about leaving  but decided to stay  about an hour later it started raining again  so we decided to retreat to our tent for the night  after having all   of us in  i quickly noticed how cramped we were   i did have one twin air mattress that took up most of the room in the tent  now  i could have arranged things better in the tent  but i still felt like we were on kind of on top of each other  it did continue to rain very steady through the entire night  although we were super hot and sticky  we did stay dry with the exception of one or   random drops from the rain fly all in all i am very happy with this purchase  but  i would not recommend more than   people in this tent pros looks great with the yellow and blueheld up and stayed dry in a heavy rain stormeasy to set up and take downcons a little small for a   person tentlike i said  i am happy with the purchase and i am looking forward to using it again  hopefully in drier conditions      
130,5.0,                       i picked this up to be a tent just for myself while chaperoning my a camping trip for my son s class i was very happy with it  the setup and tear down time was fast  the instructions were clear  and it was easy to unpack and re pack  as a one person tent  it was awesome i had space to put my sleep mat and the rest of the tent for my pack and various gear that had unpacked  as a two person tent  it would work but might feel a little cramped it got pretty hot inside during the day  but it was in the mid   s for the trip and we had very little wind at the camp site  i was pitched next to a tree that provided some shade during the day  but as the sun moved around the tree the tent heated up a lot  i don t consider this a flaw of the tent  though  i had the rain flap on to be paranoid  and i m sure that was trapping heat  it still cooled off pretty quickly at night and was comfortable to sleep in  we never had any rain  so i can t comment on whether it would ve kept me dry  but it seems like i wouldn t have had much trouble definitely recommended     
131,4.0,                       i am torn with this tent  the setup was easy enough but   people  just for the size of the   person  needed to lift it  it is lightweight and sturdy  very roomy  we had   adults and a toddler in there  my issue is with these   mesh sides  the weather wasn t even that cold  in the   s at night  and we had proper colder weather gear but we were still freezing all night because of the wind  it wasn t even that windy just every breeze gave you a chill   the rain fly helped a little but this tent really is only for the warmest of days  every other tent i owned let you open the mesh or close it but not this one  i was really disappointed in this fact because living in the north that only gives us a short amount of time during the summer to use this tent  i m going to have to buy a cold weather tent for for the spring and fall and just didn t want to have to spend that extra money besides this fact it was a fabulous tent and i would recommend for anyone camping in hot weather      
132,4.0,                       i am a newbie to camping and bought this tent to join my friends for about   days at camp on a beach  this tent held up as well as my friends  high end tents and was pretty roomy inside  i was out in the desert and  fortunately for me  did not have any rain while there  i can t speak to how well it will hold up in the rain i do need to replace the tent after my adventure  not because of a tent failure but as a dog owner failure  my dog has separation anxiety and i stupidly zipped her up in the tent to run into the woods for a pee break  next thing i knew she was standing in front of me and i had a dog sized hole in the tent  as seen to the right of the door in the picture  at only      it s cheaper to get a new tent and use this one as a sun screen for the beach than try to repair it to be water proof really good tent for the money   especially if you re not a serious camper and looking to enjoy the wilderness intermittently      
133,5.0,                       i was caught in a bad hiking experience with my dog  pitch black  bugs swarming us  in a forest with no cellular reception  we couldn t find the sanctioned camp area but we were both also overheating i laid the tent out flat  put my gear in the door to keep bugs from getting in my bag  zipped the door up and began two metal poles threaded in an  x  pattern and my tent was up  didn t have the energy to put the rain tarp on  so a couple drops of water splashed in from the treetops  but i was so thankful to be in shelter  i bought the   person version  tons of space for me and my   lb dog  could have fit another person easy and still have plenty of space for our gear no bugs got in the entire night love this tent  putting it away wasn t horrible  but of course its a little harder to roll than unroll  just do a practice run before camping  totally recommend this tent      
134,5.0,                       small little tent that can fit a queen air mattress and a bit more wiggle room for your stuff  so it comfortably fits   grown adults and a   lb dog  she had her bed at the foot of our air mattress   sure it can fit     adults but they have to be smaller petite humans  definitely not for cold or freezing temps tho  on either side of the tent is screen only with no option to zip up to completely close off the tent  but it s covered by the upper tarp  that goes over the whole dome  so there s privacy and blocks wind  but really if it s under    degrees farenheit or any kind of strong wind  you will feel it due to this screen  and someone came to stick their head under this tarp to look into the tent  they would see into the tent  but what s great is this screen does prevent the condensation forming so your tent will stay dry through the night  i do think this tent is waterproof  tip  put it where you can get some shade during the day because it can get really hot inside under full sun  happy camping      
135,5.0,                       very easy to set up   i am a small female and set this up by myself in under   minutes on concrete which is important if you are car camping and need to set up without stakes   the tent is well ventilated   i like the floor vent because i live in the desert and need the air   the dark blue is great for sleeping in and keeping tent cool in the summer   the outlet vent for electronics is nice and all of the zippers are well made  door is large and windows are high quality  bathtub floor keeps you dry even in a downpour   packs very easily back into the bag and you even have a little extra room if you need it   i purchased the   man and don t need extra room   it is roomy and i like the height   love  love  love this tent      
136,5.0,                       bought the tent for a two week kayak trip  also used for two week national park camping trip  tent set up and take down easy even with one person  as others have said  leave rain fly off on clear nights and watch the stars but keep rain fly in tent with you for those late night surprise storms for rapid installation   only issue was one of the pole end metal pieces came off when taking down the tent  while pulling through the tent slot for the pole  but was easily solved with duct tape  several storms no rain leaks even without joint sealing that others mentioned  not a flaw but tent design focused on good air flow which means it does not keep any heat in on cold nights  overall as good as a much more expensive tent      
137,5.0,                       this dark colored tent  i chose not to go with the brighter yellow green color  enabled me to sleep later in the mornings and set up easier without the tent poles getting stuck in the sleeve because the sleeve is all one not divided  see amazon and mfgr write up   i camp solo at state county national campgrounds  not in the wild   this tent is too heavy for backpacking  but fine for  car camping   it s a taller center than many so easy in out access and i can stand inside the tent with just my head bent if need be  i m          tall   plenty of room for me solo   i typically fit in one single air mattress  a tall folding chair and have plenty of room for bags  and moving around etc  on one trip i used a double mattress and still had room for a tall folding chair and baggage  though less roomy   half of the ceiling is screen vented  so not a good one for cold camping though a good cold weather sleeping bag should make you comfy  there are two pouches for holding small items on each side of the inner tent  and a ceiling loop for attaching a light weight light  door has a screened window that zips close and other side also has a large screen window with zip  i don t see the point of the additional small screen along the bottom rear of the tent which has a cover though that cover can t be velcroed closed   you peg it open or shut  therefore not ever really shutting off the air flow   plenty of ventilation already and i didn t want any air hitting my head  i stuck a sweater over it from the inside   regarding weather proofing  it does have it s own tarp  plus  i always spray a weather proofing on any new tent and it s tarp prior to going out anyway  and also always bring along a store bought plastic tarp to throw over my tents just in case something a bit strong passes through   because i don t trust any relatively inexpensive tents   so i can t speak to it s weather proofing  i m sure it is weather resistant for an occasional light drizzle suggest you check other reviewers for their experience  i happy with this little dandy      
138,5.0,                       we almost thought there were no instructions in english and then hubby discovered that the plasticized pages were stuck together   there should also be an explanation as to what the small rectangular piece is  from questions answered  it appears to be a door mat for shoes   it s got a loop on ea long side  so i guess you pound a stake into those to keep it in place it s also be great to have instructions included on how to get it back in the bag  lol  per youtube take poles out   put in bag  keeping tent flat  put rain fly   door mat onto flattened tent  lay pole bag on ground by tent and use as a measure  fold tent s two long sides to middle if tent then fold in half longways  this should make tent sz shorter than pole bag  place pole bag onto one long end of tent and roll tent around pole bag  compressing as you go  ta da  now even the extra stakes accessory package fits inside the tent bag we put it up in living room as a test  it s way too hot outside  and everything worked like a charm   it ll be nice to use when we camp in the fall      
139,4.0,                       this was my first tent purchase  and i love almost everything about this tent  especially how easy it is to put up  it s easy to pack and unpack even with just one person in terms of weight  it isn t too heavy  but i wouldn t want to go backpacking or have to walk a long distance with it  the carrying case does make it easier the one thing i don t really like and the reasoning for the four stars is that i don t like the design of the zipper door  as the zipper gets hung  also  when it rains and you try to unzip it  the door wants to fall inward causing the rainwater to fall in the rain canopy is also a bit cumbersome  but i wouldn t knock off a star for that overall i am very pleased with it and would recommend it to those wanting an affordable  easy to use tent      
140,5.0,                       the tent just saved us from our   day camping  we got lucky or what  we had   days raining showers  during our stay in the park  the tent has   leaking and kept us dry inside with rainfly on the top  we are very impressed and happy with the quality of it the tent itself is relatively light weighted and easy to carry  small enough to put into our car trunk  setup is easy  except a little effort to raise it up from the middle which usually requires two person to finish that  once that part is done  it s just a piece of cake to put the rest together  it took me about    minutes to fully set it up or torn down to pack  the tent is spacious inside fits two full airbeds plus one twin pad easily with still some empty space   especially it s very tall  though we are not that impressed with its squared shape no big deal with us   build quality is great  and it seems very durable  once setup correctly  wind does not blow it away easily either  great product      
141,5.0,                       my    year old is a scout and decided he wanted a   or   person tent instead of the   one we had already  he will be a big scout next year and didn t want something so big since it will be just him and one other boy for now on  so this is the tent he and i decided on  best purchase ever  it held   air mattresses perfectly  but left no room for anything else  i mean  nothing  maybe a couple flash lights would have fit  but no room left for clothing or backpacks or anything you would need to take camping  so we decided to let him and the other   boys use the tent and i used one of the other mom s tent  all   boys fit with no problem in their sleeping bags  they had room for one of those trunks that keep all your food and clothing dry and bugs out  they also had room for their shoes and flashlights  they were pleased with all the room they had  i would highly recommend this tent  it took me and my    year old    minutes to set up from start to finish  it was very easy to not only put up  but to take down  we allowed the boys to take it down since they have to do it all on their own for now on  it took the   of them  all    yr olds  approximately    min to take the whole thing down  roll up  and fit back into the bag  though an adult had to help them zip it all up into the bag  it was not a difficult process for them to do  not overwhelming and not too small either  everything you need  comes with the bag  you will not be disappointed      
142,3.0,                       rain fly barely covers all the openings  it s very windy inside if it s windy outside  did well with a light rain  don t imagine it would do so well if it were any harder of a rain  center should have a hook or bag to hold a light but it doesn t  the air vent doesn t have any way to stay open but the rest is so open it doesn t really matter anyway  the bag it comes in has a rip away ribbon to make it bigger  that was thoughtful  as one can never really get it rolled back up as tightly as the original packaging  in short is an okay tent  if i were to be out in weather lower than    degrees or during a storm i would not use this tent  it s nice and big for the purpose of fitting my daughter s pack n play inside along with all our gear and space to sleep  once she is able to sleep on the ground with a blanket with the adults we will be looking for a better smaller tent  and will use this as a place to hangout in the day  or for storing our food      
143,4.0,                       i really like this tent   roomy inside  zippers work well   ventilated nicely   i generally set this up by myself   having a second person does speed things up a bit   this tent is not particularly stable in high winds but it does hold together   that s the reason i took one star off   but if it s not too windy  you can just put something heavy in the tent to hold it down  and skip staking it altogether   the included stakes are not very good  but that s typical for most tents   get some stakes elsewhere   my only pet peeve is that the clips which hold the top tarp to the tent poles do not snap on securely   this isn t a problem once assembled  but if it s breezy windy when you are setting this up  it can cause frustration when the top tarp keeps disconnecting and wandering away   it s comfortable for   people and luxurious for one person if you like to have lots of stuff in the tent with you   personally i wouldn t put more than   adults in the tent unless you like being super close to each other   if you re not tall you can  almost  stand up fully in the middle of the tent   has a couple pockets on the sides  and a hook on the ceiling to hang a  electric  light from      
144,4.0,                       my husband and i bought the   person tent for a week long camping trip  we were pretty impressed with it as it withheld a severe thunderstorm with hail and tornado like winds  it had some leaking though but for as much rain as we had gotten i was impressed with how little it did let in  i had the option to waterproof the seams when buying and in trying to be cheap i didn t  i wish i had because it did cause a bit of a headache for the water it let in  it was enough to wet my husband sleeping bag in the corner  the tent was somewhat roomy  we put in a queen air mattress and you could probably put a twin in there as well but you wouldn t have any space for bags  which was a downside for me  it was easy to put together and take down  you could easily do it yourself if needed i ve seen them cheaper through ebay now as well but overall we were happy with this tent      
145,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i should first specify i spent about     for this item   the   person   foot by   foot model  about    at the highest point inside   it does seem big enough for     even a very tall person could use it easily corner to corner and perhaps have room enough for   small people as well   it is a very  open  type of tent  if you leave the rainfly off then you will have an hourglass shaped window to the stars above you  it seems like many people buying a tent might want it to be more insulated but i think for climates that don t get too cold or windy this may be an excellent choice     one thing is that even solo the set up is about    minutes or so even the first time  there were a few moments i thought i could use another hand and wanted the pieces to stay put while i went to the other side and worked on that side    i assume if you buy one of the bigger models then you might actually need another person to hold the pole in the pocket or on the key   all in all this is just what i needed and i think the price is very attractive considering how cheap some products are and this seems quite solid and useful   and surprisingly light  the convenient bag is a bit bulky though         
146,4.0,                       i purchased this tent to pack on a harley davidson heritage classic with passenger seat and back rest  the carrying handles were long enough to slip over the back rest to secure it  the tent was quick to set up  provides great ventilation  did not collect condensation on a    degree f night  no gaps in door zipper kept out all insects   as for size  i had a twin size air mattress which nearly covered the entire footprint of the tent  i had just enough room to stow my backpack  helmet  and leather goods  tent stakes are very thin and bend very easily  i recommend purchasing heavier duty stakes before using this tent  other than that it was a great tent for one person      
147,5.0,                       i realized tuesday that i needed a tent for friday  and i wanted one smaller than my usual    person tent this time so i spent half a day manually reviewing every option on amazon before settling on this one  as it had the best reviews overall  and i was not disappointed ordered it with amazon prime  got it thursday evening  and friday we set off for a remote property   hours into the mountains on a gloomy afternoon  we set up camp across a stream   after nearly falling in multiple times     i only caught a picture of it before we set up the rest of our campsite  but even the tent alone looks so serene setting up the tent was real easy and i honestly could do it myself if need be in the future  but it was even easier with an extra pair of hands although the tent floor is made of a tarp like material  we set up the tent on another tarp  always better safe than sorry   and put on the rain flap around midnight that night it started raining  and continued raining on and off thought our weekend there  but the inside of the tent stayd dry and comfy easiest setup and takedown i ve ever had  even in the rain  and the inside of the tent stayd dry throughout  just remember to let it air out once you get somewhere dry before packing it away again      
148,5.0,                       i have always enjoy coleman products  because of how long the last   for the most part most of my camping gear is coleman and has lasted for year   this is the second coleman tent i have  the last one i had to toss because it build mold after    years of use  not bad   what impressed me the most  about this little tent survive a windy  rainy and stormy night in upstate ny   it was very scary   my daughter and i ran to the bathroom  at  am in the middle of the thunderstorm   we stayed there until it past   to my surprised when we got back the tent did not had any  water inside   i was shock    the pillow that was on top of the air mattress was a bit wet and cold  but other than that everything else including a sleeping bag on the floor was completely dry   my friends   person s tent got flooded   theirs is not a coleman    the picture was taken the morning after the storm had past      
149,5.0,                       wow  i was super happy with this tent  took it camping in early august in nh  and it was perfect  was debating between the   and   person tent  and so glad i went with the   person   it s a great size   easily fits a large  tall  queen air mattress with a few feet of room on the side for bags and general human maneuvering  extremely comfortable for   people  but much more room than we technically needed  even with a giant mattress  very easy to set up and feels nice and sturdy   i expect it to last for years  no problems with the seams  zippers  etc  the tent stakes are not the best and bend easily if you hit a small rock  but those are easily replaced   we were fine with them for the first trip but will be buying replacements that are more study and easier to use for the next trip   i suggest to go ahead and just upgrade to better stakes if you re purchasing this tent  also get a thick tarp for the bottom for a moisture barrier and to prevent tears from any rocks  big note   this is a summer tent  lots of ventilation  which is super amazing  but  if the nights are cold  the fact that the entire top is a screen  with a light canopy covering  may leave you wishing you had a warmer blanket   i probably won t be using this in the spring fall unless i bring a very warm sleeping bag i was able to pack it all back up by myself and fit it back in the nice duffle bag it comes in  once it was all packed away i saw that there was a way to expand the bag  so it will be even easier next time    highly recommend for family camping  great price and quality lightweight tent for summer trips      
150,4.0,                       i purchased this as my first tent  i ve borrowed others before  and i ve used it at least    times this year  it s super easy to set up  i even did it by myself once  don t recommend  but it is possible  and i ll use it with or without the rain flap  i ve used it once where it was cold enough that ice was on the outside when i woke up and twice in the rain   it didn t leak either time  i only gave it   stars instead of   because the bag it comes in is super flimsy and it s really hard to pack it back into the bag  so i m making my own for it instead  it s also cute and i like that the sides from the bottom come up pretty high  so i m not worried about rain or mud coming in      
151,4.0,                       bought this tent a couple years ago  overall  we ve been happy with the tent for car camping  it s easy to erect and quite roomy  there is an o ring at the apex to hang a lantern  and a decent sized pocket at each of the head and foot walls  materials feel cheap  but it s a cheap tent and has thus far stood well against fair weather  i was skeptical about its waterproofing because i could see light through a few pint sized holes along the corners of the basin since day    the front zipper gets snagged easily on the weatherproof flap over the lower half of the door  but not that big of a deal finally tested it on a rainy weekend and after    hours of rain we counted   leaks  one each in the lower seams of the two front corners  one mid way along the main seam of the left wall  and one on the back wall  all leaks originated where the basin contacts the upper material  only one of the   leaks was quite significant  but we had extra towels to soak up the leaks i wouldn t recommend this tent for rainy weather  such as we have in the pnw  but it s sturdy and roomy for an affordable price  good as a back up for us at this point to share when family or friends visit  if you use this  bring a few extra towels to stuff in leaky areas in case of unexpected rain  or use a canopy or tarp cover to reduce contact with water overall a good budget starter tent      
152,5.0,                       i went camping this past weekend with the boy scouts with this tent  i absolutely love it   we had winds up to    mph  thunder and lightning with heavy rain   this little tent withstood it all    my   year old son and i stayed totally dry along with our stuff   we had heavy winds earlier during the day before the rain and some of the campers tents came up   when the storm came a few more campers lost their tents to the winds   a couple of them had to borrow tents for the night because the winds broke their poles and they could not repair them   this little tent did not budge  it just swayed in the wind  we had a coleman queen size mattress along with our stuff and we were comfortable   i did invest in the campers kit with the heavy duty stakes  a rubber mallet  a tool to get the stakes out of the ground  awesome   and a little broom with a dust pan   my son and i put the tent up in about    minutes easy   the only thing i would say is it got cold at night and the netting on the sides of the tent let the cool air in  but i like sleeping when it is cold  i just wear more clothes and make sure my son had more clothes on   it was pretty hot the first day we got there and after setting up the tent  there was plenty of ventilation   we did not share the tent with any bugs either      
153,4.0,                       i m torn between   and   stars   stars because  this tent is easy to set up  waterproof and durable  one time we didn t anchor it right  and it blew off into the forest and finally got stuck between trees and bushes  surprisingly  the poles hadn t snapped and there was no tear in the fabric   stars  for cold climates  it s only a one season tent  the sides panels under the white part of the rain fly are mesh only and don t do anything to keep you warm  the photos don t really show how exposed it is  and i feel it was a bit of false advertising      
154,4.0,                       one thing i saw immediately  it s a really small   man  i only needed it for myself  and it was perfect for me  i was able to keep all my gear inside and had plenty of room to get in and out  if there were two people  it would have been really tight  and the second person s face would have been right up against the tent flap  my previous tent was a   man  and it accommodated two people and two dogs very comfortably with gear  not much room for any additional people  i m not sure who these tents get tested on  but they must be really short and really thin  i m      and there wasn t a lot of spare room once i had my pillow at one end  i don t think i could have stretched out if i was more than       the rainfly was a bit of a struggle to get fastened  other than that  i was able to pitch it pretty easily  it also actually did fit back in its bag  too  through   campsites      
155,5.0,                       the coleman tents have a pe tub floor  pe   waterproof tarp material   you could set this up in a few inches of standing water and still be dry inside  the superior venting  allows vents to be open in the rain without water intrusion  the screened ground floor vent is large and creates a natural air flow allowing hot air to flow up and out while cool air flows in at the bottom vent  unadvertised was that the tent  even the   person tent  included a stakable mud mat for outside the doorway  also  a nice coleman touch was the heavy duty carry bag  some tents come with a bag that is the same light fabric as the tent  but those do not hold up well to the abrasion that the carry bags endures in handling and storage  the carry bag was also a bit over sized  other brands minimize material use by making a carry bag that fits a machine packed  unused tent  after the first use of those other tents  it is nearly impossible to get the tent back into the carry bag  not so with the coleman bag  after use  the tent fits back in with no hassle or frustration      
156,5.0,                       i did a lot of research for a  budget  tent to get the family interested  and i had an early  miss  with another brand that was so cheap the zip broke on the first day   i m so glad i tried this coleman sundome   it s easy to put up  solidly built  it has a reassuring rainfly  roof  and it s a great size   i got the    x       person  version   we were all so keen to try it out we actually ended up with all   of us   two adults and two tweenagers   sleeping in it the first night   it was a close fit with   of us side by side  and not something i d want to repeat often  but good to know it was possible     people would fit comfortably  we have  x    mattress pads side by side    and   would have plenty of room   i liked it so much i bought the   person version also figuring the adults would have the   person and the kids could have the   person   for under      this is a solid dependable tent      
157,4.0,                       looking for a tent to buy for the camping adventures and well  just in case scenarios  came with all you need  except for the tent stakes as they seem weak and might break when hitting in hard areas  i would recommend getting sturdier stakes  easy to set up and break down  big enough inside to use a queen blow up mattress  as we did with just enough room for other smaller thing inside the tent  comes with   mesh pockets hanging on each ends for smaller storage items  also   sides of the tent have available areas to open up for a screened window and ventilation   the one thing that bugged me was the zipper for the door kept on snagging on the cover valance in front  wasn t much of a issue but annoying  just as well  this tent was great for use camping in ca  nights were chilly but be prepared for that  no rain so could tell if anything leaked  and no condensation formed inside as it sometimes does  the only thing that was frustrating was the f     
158,5.0,                       awesome tent  very easy to set up  took about   minutes with   people  first night we had   mph winds  gusts to   mph and had no problems  wind did not blow through the fabric  fly stayed put nicely  and it was roomy for my wife and i small  stuff  pockets at the head and foot  ring overhead to hang your light  has a small zippered access for passing an electric cord through into the tent  we didn t use this feature  but it was nice to see  i think  for the money  you can t go wrong  definitely only a   season tent  but i would recommend it to anyone just getting into camping or if you only go out from time to time and don t want to make a big investment  only to have it sit in the garage      
159,1.0,                       probably would have been a decent tent  easy to set up  convenient bag and simple instructions  however  our brand new tent  just out of the box  had a hole in one of the windows  and we were setting up camp at night on an island in a verrry mosquito friendly national park along the beach  we picked up mosquito netting and made it work with duct tape  but how disappointing for a brand new tent  and yes  this is why you should always test set up your tent at home before camping  but we didn t get a chance to this time  live and learn  also  the rainfly generally works well  but if any water sneaks under  due to wind  and hits the actual tent itself  the black seams are not waterproof  they will soak through  and slowly drip inside the tent i expected much better from coleman  i m going to see if we can get a refund  but since we did use it for several days  constantly replacing the duct tape netting  i m not sure we ll be able to  will be looking for a new tent      
160,5.0,                       so glad i purchased this tent  used it for camping twice so far and the second time there was a lot of rain  the inside of our tent was completely dry and had plenty of air flow  what an easy set up much easier then my old and smaller tent  luckily both times i went i had a friend adult who used to be boy scout and at each camping set up and take down i learned something from both of them about either set up or take down  even without them this tent was easy to set up and break down  i love the inner pockets one on each side and the two sides that you can zip open and keep the flaps tied up  on my first camping trip it was so awesome to stare out the top and look at the stars  oh i almost forgot i loved how the silver bottom came up higher inside the tent to keep the rain out  couldn t be happier with this purchase    highly recommend      
161,4.0,                       set tent up for  nd time  was a windy day but not horrible  a short storm cane thru   the first gust of wind sent the tent flying  broke a pole   one line for the rain fly   tore rain fly  had every stake we had down  tent wasn t even up for   hours  i bought it for the fact that it was suppose to hold up in bad weather  very disappointed  i changed my rating due to the fact i contacted seller   i had a replacement tent with in   days  hopefully this one does better but i went from   star to   stars due to the honorable customer service       
162,3.0,                       it s easy to assemble  the rain flap isn t great  two sides of the tent are open screen with no inner flap to close off the screen so the rain cover is needed for privacy  however  in the rain  the rain cover doesn t do much  rain drops in through the open screens  not fun  if you are only using this in good weather it s probably fine  we used it for two trips with great weather and then the third trip had rain  we pitched our tent inside a canvas tent on a platform and put up the rain fly and figured we d be good  the canvas tent had a slow leak at the seams and it fell on the rain fly  and then dropped into our tent right where the storage pockets hang so our cardboard box of playing cards was soaked  luckily we were on cots so only one for got wet and we were off the floor  i would hate to see how wet the inside of the tent would have gotten if we had not been inside another tent      
163,1.0,                       despite the coleman promotional video showing how sturdy this tent is with wind  our   person tent  which fits   comfortably  barely lasted a night our tent poles snapped in      mph wind  camp staff came by beforehand saying it would be mildly windy but extra tent stakes should suffice  while other tents were fine in the wind  ours bent back and forth  eventually snapping completely  we ended up leaving our camping trip early to go home overall  disappointed with the tent quality  we ll toss and buy from rei instead      
164,5.0,                       i didn t do a review right away   but i just had two experiences which compelled me to write a review  i saw some reviews which implied the tent wasn t as weather resistant as indicated  it is   we did not see the weather forecast for rain    and we had a deluge in the mountains of nc  we stayed completely dry  the second was wind   we thought we were going to be dorothy and end up in kansas  we were in a severe wind storm with    mph winds that lasted over   hours   the tent withheld these winds and was excellent  i highly recommend this tent  great product and value  i would suggest spending some additional money on better spikes though      
165,5.0,                       i ve had the opportunity to use this two times  and i am pleasantly surprised at the quality and features   compared to tents at rei costing  x as much  this is a quality bargain  tent assembly is easy  without needing to refer to the directions  which are attached to the carrying bag   all of the needed parts were included  and there were several extra spikes included as well   the spikes are cheap metal that bend fairly easy  and i think i will probably need to purchase better ones in the near future   the tent poles are composite and shock corded together  just like the more expensive brands  it sleeps two    people comfortably with space in the center for storage   nice touches are the mat that is used to keep debris out of the tent  the two pouches inside that keep phones and valuables handy  and the center strap to hold a small led lantern   the two times it has been used includes episodes of torrential downpours  and the tent kept the water out both from the top  and from the bottom   the rain cover can be pulled out a little to aid in air flow  but it still gets hot in the florida georgia summer   there is no way around that  disassembly is easy      if you pay attention to how it came out   i think i have it now  but the first time trying to get to back into the carrying case was a chore   i am looking at the next larger size to use when we go camping out west next spring break      
166,4.0,                       very reasonably priced  super easy to put up   i am older and haven t camped in    years and i was able to put this up by myself in maybe    minutes without instructions   i m      and  ended up sleeping on a diagonal otherwise my feet were touching the side of the tent   that said  sleeping on a diagonal with my      dog next to me and a backpack of clothes all fit well   the gear bags were nice   it could of used a few hooks for the camping fans lanterns   i was able to clip them on but it was a little bit of a chore to clamp these on the mesh bags      
167,3.0,                       this tent has several mesh panels at the top  but there is no nylon cover over them that can be zipped shut  like most tents have   so when it gets cold at night  that air comes straight into the tent   and by  cold  i mean      f  not like i was using the tent in the arctic   i could feel it swirling down around my head even without a breeze outside  even my lab was cold  and it didn t make any difference when i left the rainfly sides down flat against the tent  i guess i have to bring some kind of blanket to put over the tent and under the rainfly also  on the third outing  the elastic broke on the rainfly pole set as i was inserting them  or it came loose from one end  not sure yet   so now nothing holds the set together  i don t think i can rethread it because the inside diameter of the pole is so small i don t camp often  maybe only twice a year  so these things aren t horrible deal breakers for me  i can throw an extra blanket in the car to keep the mesh panels covered  i can fiddle with the rainfly poles even without the elastic in place  the point is that i shouldn t have to      
168,4.0,                       this should have failed the coleman claim that a new tent would only have at most   tablespoons of water leak in or it would fail the qc test   faili spray waterproofed the tent before using it  i don t trust manufactures claims    i did not seal the seams based on colemans claim   each corner on the bottom side has small pin prick holes  it rained all night and each corner leaked   maybe   tablespoons per corner   i put a cloth in each corner and that was enough to stop it but certainly need to seal it better the positives i like how the rain cover sticks out over the door  i did not get rain in from sides or top  rainy weather was for   hrs nonstop at around    degrees fahrenheit   i also used the tent in a low of    degrees fahrenheit  side windows were zipped shut and rain cover was pulled down tight along sides have not used in warmer weather but think that with windows open and rain cover loose would be fine   certainly with it off the side screen panels would give plenty of ventilation   wish the sides had zip up window covers like the front and back tent was easy to setup   it fit my sleeping bag laying side to side but it was edge to edge  i could have my gear inside with me and able to maneuver around ok   for two people  you better be quite intimate with the other person and not plan on keeping gear inside with you      
169,5.0,                       i m not going to lie  i was a little apprehensive about the quality of this tent for the price but it had nothing but good reviews and i see why  i used this for   days in the up of michigan where we had warn days  cold nights  and a patch of heavy thunderstroms for   days straight  with a tarp underneath it kept us dry during the rain and comfortable during our daytime naps  the four person tent is really only big enough to fit two comfortably  which is what we planned for  we used a queen blow up mattress inside and that didn t leave much room for extras so we kept our bags in the car and only brought one backpack inside with us each night  we stayed in there for just about   days straight during the heavy rains and it was tall enough to sit up and play cards with a good few feet above our heads  the set up only takes about ten minutes to do really well  five minutes if you re experience and are throwing it up quick to get out of the rain  the bag it comes in can even be expanded if you dont fold it back up as it came  the only complaint i have is that the original stakes it comes with are flimsy and kind of stink  i would recommend buying some thinker  hearty stakes but overall  i highly recommend this tent  i m not sure you can get much better  especially for the price     
170,2.0,                       obviously this is a car camping tent  so it needs to provide shelter and be comfortable enough there are a few good things about this tent   the size of the footprint  i fit a full double size blow up mattress in here comfortable  with some extra room at the foot head to stash extra items  i did try a queen sized mattress and it definitely would not fit  so don t go with a queen size   the tent is tall enough to not feel cramped when you re sitting up inside it  but that s about it in terms of comfort   the price  super cheap it did provide some shelter from a light rain one night  but i don t think it would hold up or stay dry during a serious amount of rain the bad i think the biggest flaw is also the reason why it sucked so bad to sleep in for a week long car camping trip  the tall  dome design is about as far from aerodynamic as you can get  during windy nights this tent strains and shakes and the fly waves no matter how tightly you stake it down  while the tent probably isn t going to fall over or un stake  it is incredibly noisy  i am a light sleeper but my partner is not and it tortured both of us every night with the amount of noise it made if you can guarantee you ll get a still  wind less night it might be ok  but under no circumstances should you camp in the desert with this thing      
171,4.0,                       was going on some weekend car camping trips with friends and family   my   nephews needed a tent and i looked and found this for a decent price   almost chose the   person tent   but  i currently have another  p tent and for me alone it is a little snug when i put my pack and gear in with me   so  i selected the  p version   best choice ever   set up was not complicated  infact my nephews put it up themselves  in just a few minutes   my   nephews fit comfortably and they even had room for their packs and some gear   its by no means a minimalist tent but   it only weighed     lb  packed   in the interior  there is a loop at the center to hang a lamp   it also has   storage pockets for gear   since it s the middle of summer  i cant say much about how weather proof it is   but  it did well against the occasional  water spray   it also came with a  small tarp to be used like a door mat   one short fall was that it didn t come with a footprint tarp   but  i  easily fixed that with a spare one i had in my gear bin   only used this tent a couple times this summer and it performed well on our weekend trips   overall  gave it four stars because of the price at the time and it performed well for what we needed   would purchase again if i need another   thanks     
172,5.0,                       hey  it does the job  bub  took this little baby camping a couple ah times upta acadia national park and let me tell you what  it s roomy enough to protect my husband and i from the elements after a couple of    packs of octoberfest  if you know what i mean  it s durable as all get out  definitely worth the money anyway  easy to set up in under a couple minutes time  can t go wrong  really oh  i wish i could say people send me stuff for free or at a discount for my honest  unbiased review   but   i am just a regular  full price  bottom of the barrel online shopper with no dogs in this fight  trust me on this one      
173,5.0,                       this was so easy to set up  we went on our first all girl s camping trip  grandma  auntie  and preteen niece  and were able to pop this tent up for the first time super easily  so glad that i got this tent  it s cute and really spacious  we easily fit   full and   twin blow up mattresses in there and it was tall    ft  so we could easily stand up in it and get dressed without the weird hunched over balancing act  i m       so it was really nice that i could fully stand up in it  at first  i didn t like the bright color  but i quickly changed my mind because it was really easy to spot on the campgrounds amongst all the trees and camouflage everything   when you re wondering around in the dark at night  after going to the bathroom  it s nice to be able to find your tent again  lol      
174,4.0,                       this tent is pretty big and easy to set up  the canopy top seems to provide excellent rain and sun protection  when the canopy cover is off  there is a net to protect you from bugs and falling leaves or tree debris and provides an excellent view of the stars  there is only one entrance with a back opening for ventilation  it comes with stakes which are low quality  i bent two of the   provided stakes in my first time setting this up  i would recommend purchasing additional stakes that are stronger  it doesn t roll up to be very compact which is expected  this is a perfect tent to go camping with a group or a casual hike in to a site but i would recommend something smaller and more compact for serious backpacking trips      
175,2.0,                       i ve used coleman s tents for a while  i just purchased this one a month ago and took it out on its first camping trip last week  the tent is a great size and easy to set up  we fit a queen sized mattress inside with just enough room for our bags and shoes  i was a bit worried about the rain fly only covering the top half though  turns out my worries were valid  upon setup i noticed a few holes due to mis stitching near the zipper  i think they were seam sealed  but still  being able to see through small holes in your tent where it s supposed to be waterproof is a bit unnerving  the first two days of our camping trip it rained pretty much nonstop  water seeped in at all   corners  luckily it wasn t a lot of water and it didn t spread too much before i was able to soak it up with a towel  i was hoping the tent would fair better on its first go around   but i guess you get what you pay for  i d like to return the tent but i just missed the return window        
176,2.0,                       my first tent came with a bad zipper and a hole in the rear window   i kindly asked for a replacement   amazon  however  sent me a tarp that a tent sits on   when i called  the rep tried to refund me   i tried over and over to tell her that amazon sent the wrong replacement   normally  i would have taken the refund and moved on  but the price of the tent went up an additional     since i purchased it   i did not feel i should have to pay more   we will see if amazon can get it right the  rd time the tent did seem okay  but one thing that bothered me was the packaging was way too small to store the tent in once it was removed   overall  the tent is just okay   i am not impressed by the quality or by amazon s horrible customer service   i would not purchase this tent again      
177,5.0,                       moderately difficult to setup the first time   i recommend practicing at home before setting out on your camping adventure   we needed it up quickly because there was some rain and we arrived at our spot near night fall   once up the first time  we are reasonably sure that we can do it again quickly   carrying bag is nice to have but it takes a little effort to get everything back in the bag   not serious enough to get it back in the bag later that night there was some heavy rain and we stayed dry  nice   because of the difficulties we did have  i cannot recommend this for anything more heavy than car camping  but this is plenty good enough for car camping   you cannot expect more than that for the price we paid for this get something else and pay more for any higher level of adventure      
178,5.0,                       i bought this tent as something more roomy and less expensive than a backpacking tent to use for car camping  this tent works great  it is the perfect size for two people and their stuff  three works but it is a little more cosy  i am      and this tent is tall enough to sit upright  not tall enough to stand in  but i can get dressed and get in and out without too much bending  i did waterproof the seams when i got it  and it has lasted several rainstorms with out me getting wet or the tent collapsing   the inside of the tent does not get much condensation  it is very easy to set up and take down by yourself  and does not need to be staked if you are camping on slickrock  with the rainfly on the tent stays warm enough for late season adventures  without the rainfly you get a nice breeze  the mesh parts of the tent are not really fine enough to see the stars through  but if i really wanted to see the stars i would go outside  so that doesn t really matter to me  for me this has been the perfect tent and has survived many adventures so far without any issues  so i highly recommend it to anyone looking for a small car camping tent      
179,5.0,                       this was my first time experience with this tent in rain and i was a bit nervous but this tent sustained downpouring for    hrs   i would recommend this to any one  one my camping friend recommended to coat the tent with scotchgard heavy duty water shield which seems to help significantly  i did not use it though       
180,3.0,                       i d like to give this more stars because it looks really nice  this tent took two of us to set up and was a little bit of work  which is expected with a larger tent  what we did not like was the fact that two sides are open mesh from top to more that halfway down with no way of closing  if there is a breeze and it chilly out  it will definitely be breezy and chilly in his tent  also  once the morning dew and condensation rose  a nice channel of water began dripping on my pillow soaking it  i think the outer rain tarp was supposed to stop rain but it didn t stop the condensation  the little mesh bag that is sewn into the tent just at the base of the open mesh window   that can t be closed  was a perfect little channel for all the dew to drip down onto my pillow soaking it  my bedding  and a little of my head  that was not a fun awakening  i will be returning this tent      
181,4.0,                       my husband and i  mostly i  decided we wanted to try out camping  it was going to be for me  my husband and our   year old daughter  after looking at reviews of other tents i decided to go with this one since i figured it would give us enough space  i wasn t expecting much from the tent but since it was our first time ever camping i didn t want to invest a large amount of money in a tent in case we didn t like camping  our first night camping we chose the worst campsite  as planner i take full responsibility for it as i chose a spot that was high in a mountain  slanted and winds got as high as   mph throughout the night  there were several times throughout the night where i woke up and thought the wind was going to blow the tent away  there were times that the tent would bow inward as it couldn t take the strong wind coming at it  but then it would straighten up again when the wind gust would pass  the second night we moved to a different campsite and had zero problems with wind  the tent was able to fit our sleeping bags and even give us a little bit of room to fit our shoes and baggage to the side  it has two little pouches that hang on each side that are great to hang our keys and pepper spray  we have just returned from our second camping trip and are both officially satisfied with the tent  the instructions are attached to the bag so you can t lose them and the first set up is the only one that is a bit confusing  if you ve never set up a tent like me   after the first time though it is very easy to set up and takes no more then    minutes for my husband and i to set up the tent at a leisurely pace  the only reason i give it four starts instead of five is because of the stakes that come with the tent  our first time camping we didn t think to buy stakes or a rubber mallet  our fault   we used a rock to pushed the stakes in the ground and they bent like crazy  the ground we were camping in was not very rough so i was surprised that they bent  the second time around we bought a mallet and some extra stakes  when we tried to use the old stakes with the rubber mallet  the ones that were not bent  they still bent  my husband picked up a stake and bent it with his two hands  so  overall i think this is a great tent for beginners but i would recommend buying separate stakes   also for our second trip we ended up buying a queen air mattress  toddlers do not share sleeping bags very well  and it fit nicely in the tent and still gave us space to put our shoes and baggage to the side  we are officially happy campers  we are planning on taking a road trip to the west coast from texas in october and are going to camp at any forest national park as we go and have no intention of moving up in tent  this one meets all of our needs and also doesn t take much space in the car when packed up      
182,5.0,                       we slept through a literal hurricane this past weekend  it was the first time using the tent  i was worried about taking it on a camping trip without setting it up prior  but i did and it was fine  all pieces were in tact and had no issues  it rained the second night  no moisture in the tent so happy about that  then we had about    mph winds all through the night into the morning until taking it down  we didn t stake the cover in unfortunately  but it held on tight and never left the tent  i am very happy with this purchase  the tent is a great size  it was just   of us in a large queen size air mattress  all of our stuff fit in the tent with us  i could stand up no issues  i am       and we had room to place a towel down to wipe our feet  great tent      
183,4.0,                       all product review should be based off of expectations  and this tent certainly fulfilled my expectations with one particular exception i admit that i m new to camping   but i did not realize that a two person tent really is for one person and all of their luggage equipment  a four person tent  however  is used for two people and their equipment luggage  so  if you re interested in taking someone along on your camping adventure i would highly recommend getting a four person tent and not the two person tent  this  i suppose  it s common knowledge in the camping world  i can t hold the tent accountable to my lack of experience with that being said  my camping buddy and i were not desperate for space  it was tight  albeit manageable if you re looking for a nice  reliable  easy to set up and easy to store a tent for the occasional camping trip  looking no further  you can t beat the price and you can t beat the quality      
184,4.0,                       needed a tent small enough to pack on a motorcycle  bmw gs       that is easy to assemble  relatively small to pack  and roomy enough for one person and gear   very satisfied tent assembles with two poles inserted into sleeves crossed at center   generally works well  but clips are faster and easier to use than sleeves   base of poles connects to tent via small pegs  which works pretty well but not as well as inserting  tipped ends of the pole into a grommet as on an older spaulding i have   tent can be assembled and used w o pegs  one of the reasons i chose it   tent can be moved when assembled   tents requiring pegs for assembly are a serious hassle and make some camping sites difficult or impossible to use   windows and door work very well   blue and gray color scheme attractive   inner pouches very handy as is hooking point at top center   easy to roll up   pack  and fit into bag  included  although listed as    x     my tent is several inches shorter   i m       and need to sleep diagonally to keep my head  feet  and pillow away from the walls   would be easier to use if length was actually    have no experience with rain or severe weather  so can t comment on waterproofing etc   i sealed all seams before use just in case in summary  excellent value  well designed and constructed  and length shortcoming is manageable   i enjoy using this tent      
185,3.0,                       i purchased this tent largely based on the number of reviews  which at the time was     stars  the size  and that it had a rain fly  it was pretty easy to setup alone  but needs two people to raise the tent once the poles are inserted  this review is after one week end of camping in colorado at      ft     degrees during the day  and    degrees at night  i ll update after the next pros    hook inside on top  to hang a lightweight led light    side pockets to store smaller items    pretty easy to setup    price was good at almost     cons    two sides have large non zipping screens  air can freely flow through the tent  the first night we used it we were extremely cold  our feet and head were freezing in the middle of the night  i expected a bit more insulation  and our sleeping bags were not rated for really cold weather  i didn t realize there was no way to seal up the sides for cold nights  a huge flaw in my opinion  the rain fly sits away from the tent when staked  so you can t trap any warm air inside  our  nd and  rd night camping  i removed the rain fly stakes to let the fly rest loosely against the mesh sides  and this helped a bit   however  had is been rainy or windy we d have had a different problem    my wife was hooking one of the tent side hooks to the poles  and the base of it partially ripped away from the tent  i imagine those hooks will wear out rather quickly considering how easily the sewing ripped    it seems like small rocks on the ground have almost penetrated the flooring near the entrance  we alway take our shoes off before entering  so i thought this was odd  i m curious how this will hold up over time  and if we ll get holes    after handling the fiberglass poles  i got fiberglass splinters in   fingers  i ve started only grabbing the metal parts when i can  this may be totally normal  but just reporting my findings here    we bought the   person version  and i can t imagine   people sleeping in this tent  i could probably sleep     babies in there  but let s be real  we slept   wide  with some smaller bags at our feet  and that filled the tent  i d layout your sleeping bags and see what s realistic for how many you could fit inside overall i d say this tent is ok  i had thought buying a tent with the coleman name on it would be a safe bet  but i m not very impressed with this one  with that being said  it was       so you get what you pay for update aug          we took this tent to a lake on the plains  day temp     low of     we were much more comfortable this time  of course it was pretty hot  and it didn t cool off quickly at night  the tent was just what we needed for this hot weather  and our second time using this tent was even quicker to setup  if only the sides zipped up  that might help with cooler temperatures  no complaints this trip      
186,2.0,                       i bought this tent after some research and it seemed a good choice in this price range  i was happy with the purchase after i first set it up in about   mins alone and another   mins getting everything set up inside it  the first night was fine and only light sprinkles  then the second outing we got some heavy rain and the tent started leaking and started accumulating quite a bit of water on the floor  about    oz of water or so  great tent but not as waterproof as they lead me to believe  i may try waterproofing it or a tarp over it if im expecting rain next time     
187,4.0,                       this tent is easy to set up and tear down  it s perfect for   people using a queen size air mattress  i m sure if you had a dog it would be fine as well  plenty of floor space with your gear  have spent several   day weekends and a few week long trips in this tent since we bought it in july       this past summer had a huge rainstorm move through an that was the first time we noticed the tent leaked through the rain fly  not exactly sure if it was the seams or just that we haven t waterproofed it since we bought it  threw a tarp over the top and tied it down with a few ropes and the leak stopped  but again this was a hard rain for about half an hour  looking to upgrade soon though because with the air mattress in it you can t stand up completely  if that is important for you     
188,3.0,                       whelp    we went camping for   days and it rained during one of them  the bottom right at the seam leaked  we put packing tape around it to lessen the amount that entered the tent  also by morning the back wall on the inside was very wet  not condensation   had we paid more than what we did for the tent we would be mad  in this case  i feel like it was a risk for buying a lesser expensive tent  on a positive note  it stands up to wind very well  one day was extremely windy  hearing the wind blow through the rainfly was a little annoying because it made a  flarpy  buzzing noise  we closed the sides of the rainfly on a cold    degree  night and the tent stayed pretty nice temp wise through rain  wind  cold and sun  all in   days   yay new england   this tent stood up to all but the rain      
189,5.0,                       i ve purchased this   person tent because i wanted space to sleep comfortably with only   additional person   our backpacks  i can t say how it feel to sleep in    but   people     backpacks  one being very big  is totally fine  very tall people  around     or more  will probably have space issues  i am     and i fit nicely good things  the look is very nice  the materials seems to be of a good quality also  very easy to setup  i like the rainfly  i didn t have the chance to test it  though  and the   small pockets that hand on   sides  very useful to place handy stuff such as a small torch  smartphone  car keys  etc   what lacks  a hook on the center top of the tent would be very useful      
190,5.0,                       i m not one to write reviews very often  but i figured this tent deserved it  i purchased this tent days before going camping because i wanted something fairly compact and waterproof  it is definitely compact when stored  it is held in a soft case that doesnt take up much room at all what i really want to discuss though is its ability to repel water  we took a risk and didn t purchase any waterproofing spray  the second day of camping it began to rain  and it didn t stop  from noon on saturday to an hour before we packed midday sunday  it poured  thunderstorm after thunderstorm  a tree nearby us actually fell down  but i remained dry  i woke up at one point in the night in what felt like a waterbed  the ground underneath was completely saturated  and i was on a puddle  but i remained dry  i woke up the next morning to more rain  but the inside of this tent never got even damp while i wouldn t test this poor tent out by doing the same thing again without waterproofing spray  i can say that    hours of straight pouring rain did nothing to this tent  and i am extremely happy with my purchase  i would recommend it to anyone looking for a small tent who wants to stay dry in the worst conditions      
191,1.0,                       i got this tent   weeks ago and just used it  i noticed on my second use that there were holes already in multiple places in the mesh  i don t know why but i don t think it should be deteriorating this quickly  i m just a couple days outside my return window  so i m going to see if i can contact the seller  i m pretty disappointed since coleman is the brand  i know it wasn t crazy expensive but it wasn t free either and quite a lot cheaper at walmart for what i assume can t be worse quality      
192,3.0,                       the tent this tent is a   season tent  which i did not see listed anywhere on the seller page  this means it will not keep you warm when it is windy or near freezing temperatures  the rainfly did keep us dry while it rained  however the cold winds blasted through this tent  arizona and utah are surprisingly cold in april  apart from this  the tent is very big  enough for   sleeping bags with no room for shoes  or for   sleeping bags and a little area to put a case of water  so the tent doesn t fly away   firewood  so other campers don t steal it   backpacks  clothes  shoes and other muddy sandy stuff set up  take down the set up is surprisingly fast  just insert the rods  tie down the rain fly  and the stakes and you re done  it took us amateurs around   minutes  take down was longer       min   as it was windy and you have to get the giant tent back into a tiny bag  i do highly recommend having a tarp underneath  to give you an additional barrier to keep out the cold ground other info you can bring this on a plane    in checked luggage it s very light   like   pounds  but feels like   pounds the carrying case bag is small and has a handle and a good zipper   holds everything in  the stakes and poles come in separate bags insidethe carrying case  and there is a mud flap thing  which we didn t use   tl dr  not suitable for winter or cold spring fall evenings  can travel in checked luggage  spacious for   to   people    out of    would camp again      
193,4.0,                       i bought this tent   years ago  literally  never used it once  it s just been sitting in its little bag in the corner of my garage  in the last month  i ve used it twice  once in the mountains and once in the desert  to be clear i have the   person version  i used the fly in the mountains and without the fly in the desert  there was no rain or horrible weather on either trips  a little windy in the desert  the tent is tall enough that it acts like a sail so i would say it isnt sturdy or good in the wind  i left the fly off specifically to help let the wind pass through the tent  it probably would have been a rough night if i put the fly on  make sure you stake it down well  the stakes that come with it are a joke  buy some separately with a mallet and you will be happy you did  i fit a double size air mattress in here and still had a couple feet off the side to put gear  i m     and had plenty of room when laid out  you c as n stand up if you are hunched over  it s pretty easy to set up  overall  i m happy with the tent for a very basic car camping tent  the price is a great value      
194,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          quick and easy to set up   enough room for two but would not allow much room for gear   i plan to use this when i am by myself   i tested the rain fly with the garden hose   but have not had an opportunity to see how it does in an ongoing soakers   fingers crossed   rain fly only goes slightly below the half way mark   i did spray all the seams with waterproofed   again fingers crossed   i will update once i get to experience a real rain      
195,4.0,                       these are way smaller than advertised  i mean you could sit as many people in there  but sleeping would be another matter entirely that being said my wife and i took this to a trip to big bend  and we had flooding and rain and no backup plan  the wind was so strong that the tent would fold over entirely during gusts that would last for    second  but it popped right back up every single time  and the inside of the tent was bone dry  even though we had standing water outside  and flooding it s dinky and small but it held up to weather i figured we d be sleeping in the car for  i don t know how many trips like that it ll last on  but it did amazing well under that kind of stress      
196,5.0,                       what a great value   not the lightest option for backpacking  although i ve used it that way  too   perfect for car camping   easy and quick set up  tear down   great zippers  excellent and durable floor   loved using it without the fly when no rain in the forecast  but the fly works well  too   hard to believe the price for such a good product   i bought the   person version  but only used it as a one person tent so i could store my backpack and gear inside  too      
197,5.0,                       first of all  let s remember what this is  a     tent  i usually buy very high end gear  i decided this summer just to give myself a little more space in case i wasn t traveling solo  i ve used it    nights this summer  that being said  i highly recommend this product bugs  zero issuesset up  not easy for one person but not terribly difficult either  took me half hour solo the first time out of the package  the poles kept popping out of the patches  would recommend staking it down first if you re setting it up solo  after multiple uses i was able to get set up down to ten minutes interior    great pockets   room for plenty  can put two twins in here easy but with nothing else  or a double w a little extra space warmth retention  i was really chilly on a    degree evening  his tent is summer only quality  loved the durability and thickness of the bottom of the tent   has the same material as a heavy duty tarp rain   spent   nights in this during the rain  no issues with leaking      
198,5.0,                       my wife and i were going hunting and needed a tent to sleep in  we don t go camping too often but wanted something that was easy to set up and take down so we can take it other places with us  this tent fit the bill pretty well  its less expensive as a lot of other tents that offer the same amenities  my wife and i have generally found that two person tents can barely fit two people  and when its hot outside it not comfortable at all  so we got the   person tent which was just little more expensive  there is room for some of our stuff on the sides and a good amount of room for us to sleep  i am       and i fit in this tent well  if you are camping at a koa or a place that has electrical outlets than there is a nice electrical flap on this tent to put a power cord through  what i like the most in this tent is the ventilation system  there are nice vents on the top half of the tent but on hot nights you need something more  so on this tent there is a base vent that can be opened with a zipper  this brings cool are from the bottom and helps push hot air from the top  definitely a plus in my book i think this is a great tent if you go camping sometimes or on occasions  nothing too fancy but it still nice enough to sleep in and feel good in the morning  if you are thinking about hiking around a bit wth this tent you may want to choose a lighter tent that is made for backpacking  this tent is light but not something you want to carry around in you pack all day hiking      
199,4.0,                       works well as a basic tent  replaced an older tent with this one  husband and i tested it before our family camping trip  the tent is spacious and easily fit two adults plus a dog  dog s sleeping bag  and two   l backpacks  regarding water resistance  it did rain and we did get wet  rain drops seeped in the roof of the tent and plopped on our heads but we didn t get soaked just a few drops plopped down on us  our sleeping bags kept us from getting soaked  body heat resulted in condensation collecting on the inside tent walls so when i happened to touch the sides of the tent with my sleeping bag  the bag got wet  there s a way to deal with this issue but i haven t gotten to that yet      
200,5.0,                       obviously you re not going to take this on a backpack trip  but for trunk camping  it s a good small tent my son and myself are hammock camp hikers  i had an old  person  still in great shape  just wanted something smaller  took my sister s and mom to upper michigan  was a good spare you still need to water proof your tent  or i always do an extra coat than the factory at least nobody likes the pucker effect in a down pour  just because you don t take the extra step to be safe and dry it ended up getting used  and worked great we had a very light sprinkle misting one morning  am or so  and     i can definitely say it was not wet from rain inside the tent     lolset up easy  broke down faster  good buy      
201,5.0,                       when i tell you i have zero experience putting up a tent  i don t know my fly net to my front and back  but this tent came fast and i was able to assemble it within minutes  i did a trial run at home and went camping and was able to put it up by myself in the dark  this is such a great buy and the price is the cherry on top  i would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a tent  i was able to fit a full size blow up mattress  portable potty  and still have room for bags and walking room  i love it       
202,5.0,                       i was looking for a lightweight tent which was actually big enough for two adults and their gear  i also wanted something with good air flow to avoid condensation  and most importantly waterproof with a large rain fly  this tent delivered  you can fit two adults and gear comfortably  even though if the one on the inside needs out you ll have to crawl over the other but i can live with that  too fancy is often too heavy and even a small  one person    lb tent will kill your arm adventually  the floor vent helps along with the fact that the tent poles keep the large rain fly from resting on the top screens  which with the guy lines  works perfectly  the weight when i first received it was surprisingly more than i wanted but once i unpacked it and threw away the heavy cardboard box it came in it seemed more like the advertised weight   i also hit this tent with one can of waterproofing to be on the safe side and since the tent is a medium sized tent  one can was only enough to do one quick coat below the rainfly  along the seams twice and a quick spritz to the rain fly seams  well  it just rained heavily and i can say with content that not one drop has leaked in anywhere  it feels like a regular tarp material floor so if you re camping on a rough or gravelly surface you may want a foot print to be safe  but i m on rough cut field grass with some thick stalks and i ve had no trouble with strength or leakthrough  i went with the green for light and i love how bright it is inside  i m     and can stand bent over which is useful for pulling on pants in privacy but i keep knocking my head on the lantern i hung from the center loop  the window and door open below the rain fly so there s no need to worry if you want them wide open as well  i must say i really like this tent      
203,5.0,                       awesome for my first time camping in a tent   only used for one night of camping but it worked great  def couldn t fit four people tho   i was able to get a queen size blow up mattress with room to spare for a tower fan and gear  set up  once i figured out the wordless instructions  was fast and easy  only had three poles to put together  the rain fly came in handy on our camping trip  it rained for all of   mins but  the inside was completely dry  i did buy a tarp to protect the tent from the ground and the stakes actually were ok  though there was no much wind  the windows have a netting so i was able to sleep with those open for a nice breeze  overall  i think this is a good starter tent  i got it in navy      
204,5.0,                       we purchased this tent after months and months of research   i looked through all the reviews and finally set sight on this tent  we had our previous tent for    years  yes     years  after a small hole and the zipper no longer worked  it to was a coleman brand   i not sure if it would fit   people comfortably  but at least   people with all the blankets and bags  very easy to set up  i set up the first time alone and had no troubles  but i prefer to have another to help  the take down is easier  and fits back into the bag so easily  so far so good       
205,5.0,                       this is great tent if you are a gang of two and like on the spot hiking trip  i bought it as a hurricane supply but trust me i don t want to use it for that purpose  i have gone to places like tenneesse  jeez how do you spell that place  colorado and florida  florida sucks for trekking though  no mountains  all in all it is a great product has pouches and windows and what not  there is a big entrance you can get inside and the fabric is awesome too  so buy it      
206,5.0,                       great one room sized tent  assembly was two person requirement  it was a little awkward for a first timer  that said  we had the worst camping experience i ever had  nothing related to the tent   i was with two small children and the biggest black bear i ever saw came into our camp  less than   feet away while we were seated at the campfire   now if i was with a group of guys no worries  but while we were scaring off the bear i had the girls take down the tent and unfortunately in the rush they put a hole in it  i really wanted this to be a great first camping trip but it ended horribly  now i have a brand new tent with a hole in it and two girls who could care less if they ever go camping again  bummed but happy overall with the product  it was a hot day and the tent breathed well not letting bugs information the   hours we used it  i would definitely recommend this tent      
207,4.0,                       like others have said this tent is nice for somebody that doesn t want to spend a lot of money on a tent and that isn t going to use it on a regular basis  i purchased it for ragbrai last year and it worked  great  i had plenty of room and was even able to put my bike inside the tent with me at night we had had a storm one night and the tent kept me dry  but while taking the tent down i noticed one of the fiberglass poles had splintered   i contacted coleman  and after jumping through all of their hoops to get this covered under the one year warranty  this is the reply that i received your pole was damaged due to the wind  wind damage is not covered under warranty so you will have to purchase the replacement kits thank you coleman since the replacement parts will cost almost half the price of the tent  i ll probably just purchase a new tent of a different brand that has aluminum poles   so if you purchase this tent  just know going in thatyou may have a hard time obtaining any kind of warranty from coleman      
208,5.0,                       we love this tent  and apparently so does everyone else  every campground we went to has atleast   other people w the same exact tent  i can see why  though  it works great  we are novice campers and were able to put this puppy up in less than    min  it is so easy  lightweight and also compact  my sleeping mat took up more room than the tent bag  before using  i water proofed it and seam sealed it  glad i did  in our   wk camping trip  we went through     degrees down to    degrees  we went through excessive heat  rain storms  windstorms  dust storms  and snow  it handled it all like a champ  we like the   mesh pockets inside for little things like our headlamps  keys  etc  the only thing i wish it had were a couple loops to hang light stuff inside      
209,3.0,                       so let s talk about coleman s water resistance first  it is water resistant for the first couple minutes  if it happens to rain all night  plan on sleeping in your bathing suit  my sleeping spot happened to be in a slight unnoticeable bowl in the ground and i  and all my blankets and sleeping bag  were completely flooded out  water came up through the floor and down from the ceiling  it is easy to put up  even if you only have one person  it looks nice  cool colors  if you plan on camping in anywhere except the sahara desert  you may want to invest in some waterproofing spray and spray the heck out of it  just as a side note  customer service doesnt care if your tent floods because it is  water resistant  and not  water proof       
210,4.0,                       this is a basic coleman tent for occasional summer camping  it looks nice  but can take water if it rains long enough  this is without saying not a backpacker tent but is suitable for cub scout or car camping  the room and head space in the middle is decent and the floor space works as described if you are careful with what you bring in  the poles seem to break and the fabric tears over a few seasons  but if you are gentle and dry it out before putting it away it should be worth the money  if you are looking for something more lightweight or durable look for a higher price point brand as coleman is for basic car camping use where you do not have to carry it far      
211,5.0,                       hit two bad storms in this mo  and this mo  kept me dry as a mo    i d buy it again  but that d be ludicrous because who needs two   person tents   maybe one of those tv families with    kids but that s it no one else   happy camping    we saw two bears   i honked the car horn and they left  sneaky sneaks        
212,3.0,                       i bought this tent for a romantic night outside with my gf  the packaging says it is for   people and will hold   queen sized air mattresses  i had   queen sized air mattress in the tent and it was     of the way full  if you need to comfortably sleep   people you should look at bigger tent      
213,1.0,                       does not hold up to wind   on the second ever use  we came back to camp after a day of hiking to find that our tent had been blown away with all of our sleeping bags and gear still inside it   the tent pole corner holders had ripped out of     corners   all the stakes that we used were heavy duty external metal stakes  and those were bent and ripped out of the ground with the tent and rain guard still attached   the rain guard acted like a parachute and a gust of wind propelled it into heavy force which destroyed the tent on the box it says  wind tested    it failed the test that was a very cold night at camp without a tent   be careful purchasing this if you plan on camping anywhere where there could be wind      
214,3.0,                       a pole broke the first time we set this up   coleman was not very responsive   when they did respond  they said to return it to amazon because it was within the return period   it wasn t amazon s fault the pole broke  so we chose not to take that route   the tent is a nice size  but will likely only be a good fit for warm weather camping   this is not a quality item nor does it live up to the coleman name   we could have gotten the same quality in a cheap box store brand tent   disappointed      
215,4.0,                       this tent is great and kept us dry through a heavy rainfall  easy to assemble  i was a first timer and it took about    minutes mainly because i was being cautious  about breaking the poles this is advertised as roomy enough to fit a queen size air matress but i strongly advise against it  i don t see how that can be true based on my experience inside that tent  it would even be a tight squeeze with a full sized mattress unless you plan to get onto the bed from outside  you wouldn t even be able to get into the tent to get on the bed     people can sleep comfortably in this tent and there is a little room for necessities but you couldn t pile all your belongings in this tent  this will be good for   person with a backpack or   car campers   the rainfly was super tight and we had a hard time getting the b pole through the pocket sleeves  and the strap connecting one of the hooks broke   the tent stayed warm enough once we closed the ventilation flap but the tent roof is netted so keep that in mind  the rain fly goes over the netting and protects from rain but if it gets chilly enough it could present a challenge  consider bringing a tarp with you that you can tape over the netting i recommend inspecting your tent before use as i noticed a small defect when i was setting up the tent      
216,4.0,                       pros  price point is damn near unbeatable this sucker is definitely waterproof  first time i used it there was a pretty intense thunder storm and the second time was a long  light  soaking rain  stayed dry in both cases  easy set up  very light weight cons  durability  after only two uses  with proper storage and care  there were small holes in the base material  it s basically a standard  mil tarp and an easy patch  but still frustrating      
217,4.0,                       got this on sale so  i d say this was well worth the money   i bought it for a week long bike tour  so it got taken down and set up quite a bit without issue   we had a pretty good storm blow through one night that blasted us with a good downpour and high gusts   tent held up well and kept us dry however  the pole fiberglass feels cheap    like they won t take long to wear out or break    fabric seems thin and seams will probably leak after a few uses    the stakes are useless   bend easy in hard soil and spin in the ground releasing whatever guy line is attached you probably could hit it with some waterproofing spray and buy a set of better poles and stakes and you d get a few more years out of it   but    if you re that serious about camping   you should probably be investing in a quality tent this tent would be good for kids   or the occasional camping party where you re not too concerned if it gets trashed      
218,5.0,                       this is a really great tent  especially for the price  the quality is just like any other coleman tent  and it is super spacious and very practical with the screened in porch  we had a queen air bed and a dog in the tent with plent more room for storage  totes  bags  etc  the screened porch would easily fit   regular sized lawn chairs  just be careful dragging them along the floor of the porch  the only downfalls were that the fly was missing one guy line  not a huge deal  as the fly still did its job  and dirt sand tends to collect in the porch and if it gets wet can be mud central  we found making a conscious effort to take shoes off outside helped a lot  the tent is super easy to set up  i did it myself but a second person always makes it even easier and the bag for the tent is big enough to get everything back in with not too much fuss  i am     and can stand up in the middle of the tent which is great for changing and stretching in the morning  overall super happy with my purchase      
219,5.0,                       looks like pictures  measurements spot on  and easy for this  indoor girl  mommy to set up the  first time  i chose the four person for my two inbwtween agers to camp at home during spring       this gives them room to have bedding on each side and stuffed animals and dollar tree battery lamp in the middle  old comforter underneath on our deck  added lounge chair cushions and their face blankets and there are two happy girls  hot nights are better with a little fan and the cord corner flap is great  on cooler nights we let the rain cover sag down to close the mesh and keep breeze out  it s become a weekend favorite to add some fun and variety while staying home  we also added a camp stove for  cooking camp food and s mores      
220,5.0,                       this tent is very easy to set up  not too heavy in the tent bag  and has a ton of space  i ordered the   person tent  although  i don t think more than    maybe    adults could sleep comfortably in there if they have a decent amount of stuff in the tent as well  the tent held up great in a rainstorm   a bit of ground water condensation was on the bottom of our sleeping mats  but i don t think i did the ground tarp super perfectly  some of it was sticking out   oops   i like that without the rainfly the top is half mesh  in nice weather  this would be awesome for star gazing  i totally understand why this tent is so popular  very pleased with my purchase  just don t forget to get a ground tarp tent footprint to put under the tent      
221,5.0,                       great tent  it has plenty of room inside  and could easily accommodate   people  i am     and can almost stand up straight in the center   just need to duck my head a little bit  i have used it in high winds and rain and it s held up like a champ  i would not recommend for cold weather unless you have some hefty gear to keep you warm  the tent itself won t do much except stop wind  if you re going to be camping somewhere flat  windy  and sandy  invest in longer stakes  easy to set up and tear down with one person  took me about   minutes to set up and maybe    to tear down  since it is a pain to get back in the carrying case   but what tent isn t      
222,2.0,                       this is not a   person tent  in fact  this was not even a three person tent imho   my wife and i could not fit in this tent with our child   this is really a glorified   person tent   if you have   or more people  definitely buy a larger tent  if you have   people  i would definitely recommend an   person tent the instructions were not great   it is easy to put together but the instructions were poor  it s literally   black and white photos   we had to make inferences and we figured it out  however  the manufacturer could have done a far far better job providing instructions if i had to do it over again  i would pay more money and buy a larger tent from a company that providers more clear and better instructions      
223,4.0,                       for the price  this seems like a pretty solid tent  it was easy to setup  fairly spacious inside  packed up easily enough  and doesn t take up a ton of room  there s a couple inside pockets for storage and a lantern clip on the ceiling  the front and back windows can be zipped up  but the side windows can t and the back vent can t be closed  i didn t realize this until i went camping and the nights were a bit cool as a result  however  you can adjust the rain cover stakes so it s pulled down as close to the windows and vent as possible to minimize airflow  overall  the construction feels durable enough that it should survive a few seasons and i m reasonably satisfied with the purchase      
224,4.0,                       i bought this tent in the summer of      to gain some distance from my parents who i still live with with my partner   we are both in our late twenties and so its nice to have some space   its a good tent  though i don t see how it could even sleep four incredibly skinny adults   three very close friends would be a stretch  as it barely fits our queen size air mattress   however there s enough room at the bottom of the tent to stow my partner s bow  arrows quiver  our hiking bag and two backpacks   the main downside is that there are no side pockets and the two overhead pockets are at either end of the tent   i put a flashlight in one of the pockets and cracked my head against it three times in the night when i rolled over and forgot it was there   it also gets hot during the day  but at night it gives a great view of the stars   i live in california and its been in the    s for the past several days  i have to get up at nine  otherwise its way too hot inside of the tent   i have not yet put on the rainfly  nor has it been through the rain  truthfully we d most likely pack it up before having be pelted with rain   it blew over once  when we left for a few days and left only the mattress and sleeping bag inside it   however i live in an area with high winds by the ocean and so that may have something to do with it blowing over      
225,5.0,                       this is a great little tent for the money  my family takes an annual trip on a river and sleep on the river bank s sandbars  one of my brothers had one of these tents last year  this year  due to the pandemic  we all decide to sleep solo and four of us bought this same tent  we were all pleased with out purchases  i personally don t like folding things up and struggling to get them in a sack  while brothers did so with no complaints  but i just grabbed a stuff sack i had and stuffed it in rather than folding  note that this tent would be too small for two people with mattresses  but is perfect for one with plenty of room for your gear      
226,4.0,                       year    and the tent is still going strong  we use this for our two you g sons and it has held up to their rolling romping inside it for several summers now  i think it s great for kids  but a bit small for adults  we have to put our queen air mat inside it before we blow it up because it won t fit through the door blown up  the air mat fills the whole floor and is tight against the  walls  which isn t good if you get rained on  but if you have an additional canopy it s not an issue  the tent did well in a rainstorm once    the only thing that got wet was the spot where the mattress touches the side  overall we are happy with this tent      
227,5.0,                       so far  we just unpacked it and put it up in the back yard  some impressive things i want to say  instructions sewn into the bag  three poles in a bag  the bottom on the bag has a fabric strip to pull off to make the bag bigger  the tent took    minutes to put up  as it was the first time  very easy  one person could do it  the rain fly went on easy too  hated to do it  as the windows at the top were awesome  a window in the back side too  that you can zip up or leave open  two pockets for cell phones  a place to hang your lantern  a light one   even a little rug came with it for your feet  lots of room for a queen size air mattress   it was super easy to fold up and it all fit into the bag easy  before i discovered that strip on the bottom to make the bag bigger   iwill report back with pictures after our camping trip   so far  very impressed  it looks well made  but i am a coleman fan  just bought a new stove too  will report on that latter  we bought this for the two of us and a queen mattress    it s just the right size      
228,4.0,                       you cannot beat the price  i recently used the tent for a three night backpacking trip  the setup is easy and the tent had decent air flow when the flaps were open with the main door zipped up  i will say that the poles do add a good amount of weight to my pack  the tent itself is not too bad with weight  but other than water and maybe food  it is definitely the heaviest item in my pack  as for room  it is listed as a   person tent  which you could probably pull off  but there won t be much room  i am      and found myself having to sleep corner to corner to prevent my feet and head from touching the sides  there is a good amount of height inside  but i d gladly sacrifice a few inches in height for more floor space  the bottom of the tent is a thicker tarp material  so it is unnecessary to put anything under the tent  the two hanging pockets inside the tent are very convenient      
229,1.0,                       experienced camper  bought the tent for casual car camping in temperate weather  set it up last night   there was some wind   nothing epic   nothing that isn t within the norm of  peak winds for any given week    not part of a storm system   within   hours one of the rings that anchors the tent floor to the poles and the ground had pulled out of the tent   had to spend the night in the back seat of the car   when i awoke in the morning  all four rings had pulled out   the pegs  with the rings still in them  were still attached to the ground  but my tent was stuck in a bush     away   this wasn t an old abused tent   this was a tent i literally pulled out of the box to set it up   what a complete waste of money   the tent was so far away from actually performing that i cannot believe this was just one that slipped through the qa cracks   this was simply cheap crap      and the last coleman tent i will ever buy      
230,5.0,                       so i took a gamble and decided to buy this tent used from amazon warehouse   it was brand new     first off the amazon price for the brand new tent was     to     cheaper than other stores for the same exact tent  second buying it used saved me an additional     i put the tent together in less than    minutes   my queen sized beautyrest air mattress     inches  fit perfectly  plenty of room on both sides and plenty of head room when sitting down   i m     and had plenty of head room just to give you some perspective   can t confirm weather proofing yet and hope that i never will   lol  i d buy this tent again in a heart beat        
231,5.0,                       so happy with this purchase  although noted as a   person    of us used this with two air mattresses  the intex pillow rest classic   loved those too    and we had maybe three feet between us  which worked well for our dogs  without mattresses of course there would be more room but the size of this tent was perfect for us  the mattresses fit the length of the tent well  there wasn t room at the foot of the bed for our duffel bags but if we didn t have the dogs  we d had plenty of room in between the quality of the material  the ease of setting up and taking down   excellent  the flap that covers the zipper does get caught up if you re not watching what you re doing  easy to back the zipper up though and start again      
232,3.0,                       overall  the tent serves its purpose  i only used it once two months ago when going on camping with my family  the mesh vent does provides additional ventilation and keep everything cool and comfortable  the tent was easy to setup  we had to set it up in the house first to make sure everything is good before going camping  there are separate storage bags for different tent items  but they re really small so hard to fit products as you can see in the picture  there s a large window in the front  which i like  however the zipper doesn t seems sturdy so i m afraid to break it  the tent does offer enough room for two small persons  the for is very thin  i wish there s more padding to it  i had a hard time sleeping      
233,3.0,                       great camping tent for beginners  it s nothing extremely fancy  but for the price you can t go wrong comfortably sleeps two people for a weekend trip   three people may be a little cramped inside with personal gear and supplies ventilation is nice with the floor vent  the floor is also like a  tub  made out of a durable tarp  in theory  the tent could sit in an inch or two of water and you d still be dry inside  the only downfall i didn t like about the tent is there is only a single zippered entrance  had there been a door on each side  it would make it much easier for two people to maneuver inside without disturbing the other in a nutshell  it s a great tent for beginners or even the weekend warrior  i think you d get many years of general use out of the tent  i would recommend the purchase      
234,5.0,                       this tent replaced my old leaky tent that i had to throw away after my      camping trip  it didn t rain  so i cannot speak to its water resistance  but i did enjoy sleeping in it  i was able to hang my lantern  with the weight of three d cells inside  without trouble  the little zipper for the plug was perfect for blowing up my mattress  the twin size leaves a decent amount of room on both sides   i can see why people are putting doubles and queens in here  it s very tempting  my favorite feature was something i didn t know was included  the little floor mat was a nice convenience i didn t know i needed  i ll update my review if i ever camp in the rain with it  but i m glad i took the chance on it despite the lemons some people seem to be getting      
235,2.0,                       overall i had high hopes for this tent  the price was right  it had plenty of room and pretty good head room the main issues with this tent seems to be from a lack of quality  first off when i recieved the tent  i set up the tent to find a hole in the mesh at the top  at a seam  didn t think too much of it since my wife needed a tent for the weekend  second issue with the tent occurred when i was attempting to pack it up  the bag ripped at the seam  the last issue occurred the second time setting up the tent  the elastic cord in the pole  snapped another thing my wife didn t like about the tent was the little flap of material over the bottom half of the zipper  the zipper would get stuck in the cloth      
236,4.0,                    hola  feliz d a  he comprado esta tienda de campa a para asistir a una reuni n familiar donde la cantidad de personas dificulta el espacio para dormir y la verdad que esta fue una buena compra y una buena opci n para pasar la noche es la primera vez que ensamblo una tienda de campa a y no fui dif cil  dormimos en ella   personas  ten amos espacio para las mochilas y cosas personales  muy buena ventilaci n  lo que no me gusto es que a medida que el sol se torna m s intenso  la temperatura dentro de la tienda aumenta a tal grado que se hace insoportable  no recomiendo colocar la tienda de campa a en lugares donde haga mucho calor y directamente en el sol  porque no lo soportaran recomiendo comprar un colch n de aire tama o queen  seg n las especificaciones del tama o del piso de la tienda de campa a  para estar m s c modo  compre un abanico linterna para ventilar y obtener luz en la oscuridad pienso que la tela que cobre a la tienda deber a ser un poco m s gruesa  pero en general la tienda de campa a cumpli  el sentido de ser para la cual fue comprada         
237,5.0,                       over the weekend  i went camping for the first time  i ordered a variety of items to take along this adventure and the one thing that i had to order was a tent  upon the reviews  size and price i decided on this coleman tent to fit   of us plus our stuff  the size is decent but the thing that impressed me the most was how easy it was to set up  it took little to no time at all  we tried this tent out at our front yard before taking it with us and sprayed the tent with a hose  we went back inside and could not find any leaks so for minor rains i can safely say it worked  love this tent and would definitely bring it with us to our next adventure      
238,5.0,                       my wife and i probably have     nights in our tent so far and we still love it   it s dry and fast and easy to setup for two people  it d be a struggle for one person    this is our third coleman tent and i haven t yet found any reason other than weight to buy any other brand   as we re mostly car campers  it d perfect for us   as a car camper  i d also say that the   person rating is a bit unrealistic certainly if you want to be comfortable or keep any luggage in your tent with you   our first tent for just the two of us was a   person   ft by    ft  and we found it too small   our second coleman wasn t vented through  window in the back and door in the front  and we found it overly stuffy for summer camping although great in the late season      
239,3.0,                       first time using the tent was over a rainy weekend   it was intermittent rain  heavy a few times but only for a few minutes   during the night i noticed my sleeping bag felt a little damp down by my feet and thats when i woke up and pretty much water was seeping in through the material all around the lower     part of the tent  not enough to pool on the inside but if you touched it  it was wet all around   i don t normally go camping and i only needed it for this one weekend so it was good enough considering the price   if you camp often and need it to be water proof this may not be the right choice      
240,5.0,                       i love this tent  fast   easy to put up and take down and keep clean   i use it for one person  and it fits the coleman comfortsmart deluxe cot  with plenty of additional floor space remaining  compared to buying a pad or air mattress plus sleeping bag  the cot costs less  and uses normal sheets and blankets from the house  so no cost there   the mesh screen top of the tent gives you good ventilation  and the rain fly gives you privacy plus rain cover  i put seam seal on all the seams before first use  and this tent withstood a hard rain storm staying      dry inside   on a later trip  i put up the tent under a pop up canopy  and left off the rain fly  and also went through a super hard thunderstorm  with good results      
241,3.0,                       this is a decent starter tent at an affordable price  however  product page is misleading  as the graphics indicate that this tent was manufactured to include coleman s  dark room technology   this was something that sold me on this initially  as i am a light sleeper  the green coleman sundome   person tent does not include this technology  it is not listed on the packaging and this tent lights up considerably even early in sunrise  that can be disappointing if you are looking for a tent that will help you sleep in  otherwise  as long as you stake this tent down correctly  it is rather durable  the tent did go through some significant wind and collapsed in without the rain fly staked in to support it  durability is questionable if using the tent alone  with all parts utilized and secured  this tent did hold  excellently  i am disappointed by the lack of light blocking but the tent did provide us a comfortable first weekend camping with it      
242,1.0,                       very dissatisfied with this purchase  upon setting up the tent for our first camping trip of the year we noticed that the tent had holes in the seems  this tent is manufactured very poorly      
243,5.0,                       i bought this tent for quarantine fun for my kids  this tent is the perfect size for my two kids to use while camping  in   i set this up  without using instructions in a matter of minutes  i didn t even mind leaving it up for a couple weeks so the kids could sleep in it and feel like they were on vacation  my kids are   and    so there was a lot of zipping and inspiring and thankfully this tent seems tough and the zipper is good quality and can withstand the coming s and goings of children  great pricing for what i was looking for and we will continue using this for indoor fun   i m sure it d be perfect outdoors too and i may have to get another  this will be our special place for sleep overs and for when the kids are feeling they need to switch things up a bit      
244,5.0,                       great waterproof camping tent  got the   person and i do not recommend for hiking as it is a little too big for that  but it is great for drive up camping or a short trek to the campsite  first time we used it it downpoured all night and we stayed nice and dry inside the tent  there wasn t a lot of wind or anything like that  but consistent heavy rain  i was surprised by how well it withstood the rain      
245,3.0,                       we are going on a camping trip very soon  and the only thing we have tent wise is a monstrous   person apparatus that is     years old    we were concerned about the water tight nature of the tent  so we decided that maybe it was time to look for something new this tent comes in three pieces of water impervious fabric  the fabric is very thin  but this likely helps a lot in terms of weight  the instructions are sewn to the bag  and are water resistant as well  which is a very nice touch while putting this together was pretty easy once we realized what the heck we were supposed to do  the instructions didn t have enough instruction  enough photos  and worst of all seemed kind of incomplete  for example  there s a rectangular piece that is not referenced at all in the instructions  so our honest guess is that this is for our shoes to take off at night to not get the inside of the tent dirty  this is a total guess  though the poles were extremely night because they have a string in the middle that are taught that snaps the poles together quickly and easily  the tent looks great once it s up  however it definitely isn t going to win any awards for sturdiness   a few good winds i anticipate having to buy a new tent in the end we re hoping for good weather so none of this matters  but it s just something to think about during your purchase      
246,5.0,                       tent is perfect  i ve never had to set one up on my own and this took me about    minutes  i m sure it will only take   to set up again  quality is nice and it survived some rain  it says   people but if you like space  definitely size up  i was able to fit my suit case  a plastic bin   drawer container  and a twin size air mattress comfortably  mine had a ground vent in the back that really helped with airflow  there s also a fan light clip at the top and a mesh pouch on the side perfect for electronics or small items  i was also able to fit the tent under my  x  canopy making this a great single person tent for music festivals      
247,5.0,                       for not having had that much experience  this product was perfect for me and my family  it was so easy to set up from the box  we did have to buy better stakes because the ones this tent comes with will easily bend on anything close to dry ground  but my wife and   year old fits the tent with plenty to spare  our first night in the backyard  there was a thunderstorm  but despite the deluge  we did not get wet  i did get a coleman sealing product that i applied at the seams after i read suggestions from more experienced campers  it was fairly easy to apply and worked wonders      
248,4.0,                       we backpacked to        feet and spent the night  the tent was heavy      lbs   but the three of us and our packs easily fit in it  the wind was horrible and pretty much kept us inside the tent for     hours  we had room to play some card games  too  the tent held up to the high winds  which continued all evening  all night  and into the next day as we packed up   i would say the temp got down to      degrees  but we stayed warm in the tent  for the price and for our purposes  i would recommend this tent  if we start doing more frequent trips  we would need something lighter      
249,2.0,                       very disappointed with this tent  replaced an old coleman tent with this new one  as with any family that camps  we have a ton of coleman products  stove  bbq  tents  flashlights  lanterns  coolers  etc  most have been solid products that last  this new tent simply will not last easy to set up  and clear from the instant you feel the material  the quality has gone down  thinner and feels as if it will easily rip  there is a weather flap covering the main door s zipper which is impossible not to snag every time you close the zipper  no joke  it gets stuck on the material every single time we open or close the tent  there is an air vent near the floor which doesn t close  always open  makes no sense  and lastly  there are two internal mesh pockets for your gear  one ripped first day we used the tent won t deter me from purchasing other coleman products  but done with their tents      
250,2.0,                       i ve always known coleman to make a good product but seems that may not be the case for this tent   i bought this tent for indoor camping with the family and only used it one time  indoors  and the material by the zipper has already torn or come undone at the seam   i noticed this hole as i was putting up the tent for its second time use   i expected more for a     tent not even being used in the outside elements   since i ve only owned the tent less then   months i m hoping coleman customer service will resolve the issue under warranty and replace the tent when i contact them   i will update my review here if they are unresponsive    disappointed  singleusetent     
251,2.0,                       i bought this tent to do backpacking for two persons pros  the   person tent has enough space to store backpacking camping gears safe inside the tent with a two person sleeping pad inside cons  the tents is still basically new after using the tent for the second time it started leaking at all four corners of the corner seams  we went camping over night and woke up with about an inch of water i side the tent everything got soaked  upon investigation we found that all the corner seams were leaking through tiny holes in the stitching created by the  pulling of the corner spike points and moderate winds i would not recommend this tent lost my trust completely  i will try seam sealer and see how that works out      
252,5.0,                       used for a summer weekend camping trip  space was a bit tight for the two of us  we are both tall and when stretched out  we were pushing on both sides  it stayed dry inside in spite of it having just torrentially downpoured  bugs stayed out  huge plus  we used the rain fly which covers up some mesh panels near the top  so it gets hot inside  you have to sacrifice some air flow for the rain fly  the hanging pouches on the inside were super convenient  there was an extra piece of material  like a  x  foot tarp  i m not sure exactly what it was for but it came in handy  we used it outside the tent to sit on when the picnic table got wet and to put our shoes on outside the tent  kind of like a welcome mat  overall  good buy     
253,4.0,                       i ve been camping with my honey for    years now and our tents have progressively gotten bigger  we bought a queen sized air mattress and needed a little bigger tent  damn tents have got expensive  i ve always liked coleman and got this   person tent for      this tent is huge by our standards  fits our mattress with room to spare  i think i ll be able to dress standing up  very easy to setup  the rainfly covers the tent well  cute little door mat too  very happy so far  as you get older you don t have to give up camping but air mattresses get pretty nice  nice   person tent for us two  yes  we re the   old folks tent camping next to you with the ancient coleman stove and lantern  i hope you like your rv camping      
254,5.0,                       i m totally happy with this tent  i used it to camp up the oregon coast in april  we didn t actually get rain  so i can t attest to how it holds up there  but it s easy to set up and take down  the tent is well ventilated  and was cozy in the    degree weather  unfortunately  it doesn t hold heat well  so it got pretty chilly on the cooler night  also  it lets in some breezes  that said  this tent would be perfect in moderate to warm weather the size is perfect  we had two of us and a dog in the tent  we were able to fit the air mattress sideways  feet towards the door  head towards the back   which left quite a bit of room on the other side for our gear and the dog i was worried the front part wouldn t cover the door fully  in case it did rain   since it s hard to tell from the pictures  but the front overhang does completely cover the door  you wouldn t have much protection from wind  but it covers the rain well      
255,3.0,                       i used this tent for a   day camping trip with my    month old this past weekend  i also bought a seam sealer and water proofing spray for added protection in case it rained  the tent was very easy to set up and i easily did it on my own in about    minutes  the second day  it down poured for about    straight minutes  all four corners of the bottom of the tent leaked and caused a little puddle of water in each corner  you could actually see it dripping in through the seam  i was pretty disappointed since i read so many reviews saying they didn t waterproof at all and didn t get wet  overall  good tent for the price  but i won t use again if rain is in the forecast      
256,5.0,                       i have been around the coleman name and products for    years  everything i have seen or used has been of high quality and workmanship  with this tent purchase i will still agree of it s quality product  there is just a couple small things i would change about this product and that is upgrade the fiberglass rods to lighter weight aluminum rods  the second thing i would change is the tent stakes  this is not a knock on this product as all tent manufactures all use the same type at this price point  by upgrading these   things you will have a better tent and a better experience out camping      
257,5.0,                       it gets the job done  i actually replaced my old tent with the same exact mode  proud to camp with a coleman  didn t opt for the new darker tent as no one really sleeps in when you camp  with groups of course  and i m always up early anyways to hike  fish  explore  i only use it once or twice a year and it hold up perfect  i camp alone but this would def fit   more people  i use a twin air mattress with a lot of room for luggage and other stuff  nothing else much to say   it s a great tent and gets the job done  plus looks stylish too assembly it fairly simple and i typically can do it by myself in about   minutes or so depending on how quick i want to set it up  it s pretty simple to be honest  i event set it up in pitch dark desert night before  tare down is also simple but takes longer as you need to roll it up and what not  the bag is very snug and most likely might not fit everything back in it  might need a little muscle to zip it up  over time i end up taping the poles to the top since i m too lazy to stuff it in      
258,3.0,                       we got our tent over the summer in anticipation of some summer camping trips  unfortunately plans got derailed and we didn t break out the tent until this weekend  set up was easy  the tent looks great  love the colors   and it seemed to hold up in windy weather really well  unfortunately ours came defective  there was a very large cut or tear along the door which likely got worse when the kids opened the door for the first time  i was able to patch it up but it was incredibly frustrating   especially since we re well past the return date  hopefully my haphazard repair job holds up      
259,5.0,                       very well designed  great features   christmas gift so daughter doesn t have to borrow anymore    she liked it    this will be  st summer  but same brand as borrowed tent had mat for outside the door to leave shoes which connects to tent so it won t blow away  center ring to hold lantern  side nets to hold small items   good design for air circulation even in rain      
260,4.0,                       size  very roomy for   people    people would also be pretty comfortable  and   people would be really pushing it quality  its  my first tent  idk what constitutes a  good  or  better  one  but this one kept the bugs out and stayed dry in the morning  i bought some coleman sealer as well and applied that on the inside earlier that day for good measure  held up pretty well in small winds without being anchored down value  this one was more expensive then the green one  i like the look of it  in the dark  its hardly visible  which is cool if you want to stay low key in the woods  but wish it didn t cost     more for just a change in color overall       great first tent so far      
261,5.0,                       this tent is easy to set up  i set it up with only my six year old as a helper   no weird smell  zippers work well  roomy inside   i did have a very hard time folding it up small enough to fit back in the bag   this might not be a problem for a more seasoned camper   i ended up just dedicating a small rubbermaid tote to my tent tent setup supplies so i wouldn t have to fold it back into the bag   we haven t camped in the rain yet so i can t say how it would do in that situation   however  we camp in a very buggy area and it s a pro at keeping bugs out  even with small children flying in and out of the  door      
262,5.0,                       i got the sundome   person and it was extremely easy to set up  i love the pin ring system  it s much easier to set up than it used to be i used it for a week of camping and the last day there were severe thunderstorms with gusts of about       miles an hour  if you check out my video you ll see that i was dry as a bone during the whole thing  and it rained all night  i had to break down camp the next morning in the rain  but i was able to take the tent out and let it dry in my backyard the day after i got home another quality coleman product and a great buy from amazon      
263,5.0,                       i do a lot of camping with just myself and my dog and was looking for a tent that would be more compact and quick to put up  this goes up in about    minutes and is just as easy to take down  i ve camped with it multiple times in hard rains and haven t felt a drop inside the tent yet  the fabric is high quality and the size is perfect for my sleeping bag  the pup in one corner on his bed  and a spare corner for storing backpacks and such  i m       and have a    bag and there is definitely some length to spare  i think it might be a little tight for two people width wise  so would more likely recommend this for solo campers plus or minus a doggo  like any tent  you need to be mindful when packing it up and make sure it s dry when storing it  as long as you take good care of it  it will take good care of you      
264,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          we ve looked for a tent for a good while and couldn t settle on one  visited multiple sporting good stores and even a coleman store  finally decided on this one  the sundome   this was an easy tent to set up  only   poles for the main structure  i liked how the sides of the roof are all mesh to allow ventilation  we ve not used it yet  but we re pleased with the setup and space the inside is large enough for our   cots and then room to stand in the middle to change clothes  i m    and wanted plenty of head room      
265,1.0,                       so i bought this in april and just got around to using it  i drove   hours out in the middle of nowhere for camping  went to go set it up and saw that it was missing the metal piece on the end to keep the tent up  so then i had to drive an hour and a half to the nearest town and had to buy another tent  i can t even return it now because it s  past the return policy i expected better quality from coalman      
266,5.0,                       we got this tent last minute for a camping trip  and it s been a great purchase  it s easy to put together  and has held up on   weekend camping trips involving light rain and temps down to    f  no wetness inside the tent  although it doesn t come with a footprint so we bought a separate tarp to put down  it fits   adults comfortably and would probably fit   adults but it would be tight  packing it up is easy  but fitting it back inside the carrying case is sometimes a struggle  there s an attached loop on the top to hang a lantern  but make sure the lantern has a hook  since the loop is just a circle      
267,5.0,                       you could fit a queen size blow up mattress  mine is about   feet tall  fits nicely  leaked around the stitches but that was in a huge downpour  i saw some ones tent fly away     it was awesome   over all great tent  dont expect a miracle  dont forget to bring a tarp with you when camping  easy to assemble  same design as all their stuff  didnt even read the instructions  lightweight      
268,5.0,                       i bought this tent based on the many positive reviews and my recognition of the coleman brand   i was very concerned about the ability of the tent to keep me and my stuff dry  because of this concern i also purchased a tarp to put under the tent  well  when i got to the campsite i realized i had forgotten to bring the tarp and the weather was calling for a     chance of rain  i hadn t put any sealant on the tent so this was going to be a test of the tent as is  right out of the box  i set the tent up using only the supplied stakes and no tarp  indeed  during the middle of the night there were brisk winds and heavy rains  very heavy rains  i experienced to issues at all  the tent performed like a champ and kept both me and my gear bone dry  i can t recommend this tent highly enough  one of the best purchases i have ever made  setup was a breeze      to    minutes tops      
269,5.0,                       i am writing this review from inside my coleman tent in a state park campground in half moon bay  most of yesterday and last night  there was intermittent rain and a decent amount of wind  the tent has held up quite well to both  i have not noticed the seams leaking and there wasn t any condensation dripping from the top  the rainfly does a great job of blocking rain and it leaves some space between the tent for good airflow  the bottom of the tent is a tarp like material that seems strong and easy to clean i only have two problems with this tent and they are fairly minor  first  the tent is not difficult to set up by yourself but the rainfly can be tricky if you don t have another person  especially if it s windy  but it s definitely still possible  it ll probably just take an extra      minutes  second  one of the poles that held the tent up sometimes made this vibrating sound in the wind  it s not super loud and only happens in strong wind  i don t think that it ever woke me up or anything but it was slightly annoying      
270,1.0,                       this tent is ok  as long as the weather is perfect and you are on soft ground  the stakes are weak and bend easily  it is not wind and rain proof  it is  however  very easy to set up and take down and is very spacious wind  the rainfly has a pole going through the middle that lifts it up on two sides for a nice view out the windows  when the wind blows  this pole acts as sort of a wing and the tent will lift up off the ground  if it isn t properly staked  the tent will tip over  if it is staked into the ground  the tent will collapse in on you  it does pop up back in place without the poles breaking or coming apart though  without the rainfly pole  the tent still sways quite a bit in the wind because it is so tall rain  every seam in this tent leaked  after one night of heavy rain  there were puddles in all four corners of the tent  even the top of the tent leaked  so water dripped on me all night      
271,5.0,                       great tent  easy to put up and take down  pulled it out of the bag on the campsite with an hour until dark  needless to say i had the fire roaring and cooking up hot dogs and chili with sun to spare  very quick and good room for two adults a    lb  fur baby  and gear  only thing i didn t understand is the half circle hole directly across the door  kinda a breeze hole but right where your head is and when it s cold it just comes right in  otherwise a great tent      
272,4.0,                       i have used the tent once so far   i am happy with it   it goes up and down pretty quickly   and i was actually able to get it to fit back into the bag  the zippers all worked well  although to be fair  the flap along the bottom edge of the door is kind of annoying as you really need to use two hands to ensure you don t get fabric in the zipper  i haven t yet used the passthrough for electrical but that is cool   i easily hung an led lantern through the loop in the center of the ceiling which worked well for a nightlight   it was a pleasant evening and the tent kept us cool enough sleeping  i purchased a four person tent with the knowledge it would be comfortable for two   i made the mistake of putting in a queen air mattress and a twin air mattress   that takes up all the room so changing clothes was a challenge   if you use air mattresses  no more than two twins is really what you should stick to you might sleep three people in the tent if you forgo the air mattresses   otherwise you just won t have any room to change clothes or even change your mind  but like i said  i got this to sleep two people  myself and my   year old grandson   the price is right  the tent is light and easy to assemble  and i look forward to future use      
273,2.0,                       after seeing all the positive accolades for this tent online and seeing pictures on social media  i wanted to try it out and see what the fuss was about  i was in the market for a car camping tent for   people i did not like it at all  the poles are wobbly   flimsy  everything about it is cheap  i returned it  i am okay to spend little more           for something that will last and that can withstand harsh conditions  granted there are lot of reviews and anecdotal feedback from people who say they used it for years  so take it for what it is i wanted better quality  and this is not it      
274,5.0,                       i recently had a long chat with my fianc  about what type of tent to buy   she wanted to get a fancy  multi room tent for four people  and i told her that this would more than suffice  and it was perfect important to note  i am      and i fit in this tent with three other people i see more and more tents getting posted for ridiculous amounts of money   these tents are for glampers  who need a lot of space to spread out     or want to run a tv inside      if you are looking for a tent that is compact  affordable and durable  it held up group in a terrible thunderstorm    then this is for you      
275,5.0,                       amazing tent  i ve used this for   months now living in it in the mountains of north carolina and it is very durable and weather ready  we have had some crazy storms and i ve had no leaks  i do recommend keeping a taro under it for padding and water protection further  breathes very nice as well and is very roomy i fit a queen size mattress with room to put and entire other queen if needed      
276,4.0,                       we have the   man version tent before   which has been great for a lot of outings   we needed a smaller one so we could have more family come with us in our aframe trailer   we ordered the three man version and it has worked very well so far   it only lost one star since   i think the fabric around the zipper is easily caught in the teeth   i got it stuck and unstuck twice   be careful   aware when using the product      
277,4.0,                       only used it once so far  set it up in about    mins at  am  slept in it  got up did our thing  it does not fit the intex comfort plush elevated dura airbed queen size  well it will if you blow it up inside the tent  and there will be very limited room for anything else to go in the tent  id recommend   ppl comfortably with their bags  but not many more than that  but for what a tent is used for this one is awesome  easy to put up  does what its supposed to  if you put the rain fly on the right way  it does keep rain out      stars just because it barely fits a queen size mattress in it     
278,4.0,                       i bought this tent for my boyfriend and i to use on a family camping trip  everyone had jokes about how tiny it was but it fit my queen size air mattress wall to wall just fine  just make sure you finish blowing the mattress up inside the tent because you ll never get it in there fully blown up the first night i was by myself and it stormed really bad  i stayed perfectly dry and had plenty of room the  nd night my sister showed up with a bigger tent for my boyfriend and i to share so i can t speak how it would have been for    i will say this  there was no room for bags anything extra as the air mattress was literally touching all four walls all and all i think we could have made it work for the two of us with someone else housing our bags but not ideal  for   person   perfection      
279,1.0,                       bought this for our camping trip in one of texas state park  assembly was ok  not too complicated  however we had some windy rain at midnight and one of the pole snap out    mind you it was four of us    adults and   toddlers so ofcourse it became a little chaotic and fixing the pole in the middle of midnight with rain and wind wasn t really pleasant  also we found some water coming into the tent from near the zipper area  although it was completely shut  at the end the tent was still useful despite its flaws but i wish i went for other leading brand or maybe the more expensive style of coleman tent      
280,5.0,                       it s a coleman  what more do you need to say i finally had to replace my other tent  the same model as this after    years of use  if i had taken better care of it  i know it would have lasted longer i like how they have changed how the poles insert into the sleeves on top  they made them single tubes so that the pole doesn t catch when sliding it through  great change i don t like the little flap over the zipper though  keeps getting in the way  i don t think its necessary as i never had a problem with the older version leaking through the zipper this product is great and i am looking forward to another     years of camping in this tent      
281,4.0,                       buy extra stakes as the ones that come with are cheap metal ones that aren t really long either   i ended up using them to hold down the tarp underneath the tent   you don t want your tent flying away while you re off on a hike   i added the  coleman    in  steel nail tent pegs    count  to my tent purchase  http   www amazon com coleman steel nail tent count dp b   hu   c ref sr     s sporting goods ie utf  qid            sr     keywords stakealso  the hooks that are attached to the hood  wind cover  are plastic  and one broke while assembling   luckily the hook was attached to a bungee loop that i could use to anchor it down   overall great tent   i did fit a queen size air mattress inside with about a foot and a half of extra space on one side      
282,5.0,                       this tent works  i ve slept in it solo and with two and three other people  i won t put four people in this again  we were a little cramped  not big people either  don t think any of us were even    but to digress  if you re looking at this tent as i was it s probably your first or maybe second tent purchase or else you d have picked something from expertise  if you re reading this trying to decide whether or not to buy it  you probably should  it s lasted me a while and it works well  has an easy setup and all those buzz words      
283,5.0,                    hola quiero decirles que compramos   casitas campa as de esta para nosotros y unas amistades   nos fuimos a la playa a acampar   nos cojio fuertes lluvia y tormentas cervera desde que llegamos hasta que nos fuimos  esta m s que probada   la verdad que no se filtro  se mantuvo firme y fuerte   ahora si se que hicimos una excelente compra  estamos muy contentos  la califico   estrellas porque se lo merece   les recomiendo si es para la playa comprar kit de playa arena   c mo lo hicimos nosotros fue lo mejor        
284,5.0,                       this is a great product for my intended use  we took it camping for two nights  and had no problems with it at all  i loved the way they added extra room to the bag so that you can actually get the tent back in  unfortunately it doesn t come with instructions  and as the girls of the group  we had to ask the boys what to do with the seemingly  extra  piece  it turned out to be the rod to keep the cover tarp from touching the roof of the tent  if you re looking for a simple tent for a simple price for a simple trip  like we were  i recommend this one

286,5.0,                       this tent is the perfect size and setting it up was super easy  i set it up by myself first and it took about    minutes  but less than   with two people  it s more durable than i initially thought  but it s a lot stronger than the thin tent would have you believe  it didn t rain so i can t speak to that  but it offered up a nice and cozy home away from home  my dogs loved it  even though we just took one with us  and her    pound body fit comfortably with two adults  we could probably fit the three dogs with us  but i didn t want to push it on our first time out  it was easy to set up and easy to break down  and was a lot roomier than i expected  i think this is the ideal size for two people  because we had room to play card games and move around a bit inside with the dog  the zippers are durable and i liked the hook inside along with the tow interior pockets  the stakes a bit flimsy  i broke one with little force  but it s not a deal breaker  and any sports store should carry stronger ones  i remember camping in coleman tents as a little kid  and this new tent helped me preserve those fond memories  definitely recommend      
287,5.0,                       this is a great beginner tent or a tent for someone who might not use it often  i used this for music festivals all summer and it held up very well through wind and rain  kept everything inside dry after a decent   min storm plus a few other showers  i wasn t in any horrendous wind  but we had it staked down and it didn t seem like it wanted to blow away  it is very easy to set up  even with just one person  even the included stakes are still holding up well  there is a lot of room in this tent  makes it feel bigger than   x    clearance height is also sufficient so you re not completely bent over  the included vent and hanging bags for your phone and other belongings were nice touches  overall  great product for the price      
288,1.0,                       i bought this for my    yr old so he could an outdoor aviation festival  after searching amazon  this one was the right price with great reviews  the first night  last night  it rained   he was soaked  he was in the middle of an airport camping so resorted to staying in the tent all night but slept under his air mattress to stay dry  today he went out and purchased a tent his friend recommended in case it rains again  needless to say he was soaked and miserable and all of his belongings are soaked  absolute disaster  do not purchase   we will be returning this as soon as he gets home      
289,1.0,                       just able to put the tent up  live in texas and we were just hit by a winter storm  dealing with blackouts in freezing temperatures in a state without resources for the store  so this weekend was the first weekend i could get out and check the tent  hole in it were the tent meets the bottom tarp area  and   days past return date  very disappointing  coleman has warranty but i have to pay for shipping on a manufacturers flaw  will not buy from them again      
290,4.0,                       this tent does what it s supposed to do  and had enough room for a queen size air mattress  and enough extra room for bags  a small person  etc pros  lightweight   incredibly easy to assemble   good ventilation through zip up windows and small lower vent   removable weather tarp that completely covers open screen roof   enough room to easily change  move around  etc   when it s not full of people    moderately pricedcons  stakes are super cheap metal and will bend if you re not careful   the yellow weatherproofing ribbon around the tent access zipper always gets caught in the zipper  but it s a very easy fix   collapsable tent poles feel very brittle and i think i heard one slightly crack the first time i assembled the tent   tent manufacturers should decrease all size labels by at least one  as this   person tent can feel slightly cramped when at full capacity with four adults      
291,4.0,                       this has been the best budget friendly car camping tent  easy to set up  has held up well over the last year of canping so far  not the smallest pack or lightest weight so may not be ideal for backpacking  we primarily use to comfortable sleep   on an air mattress with a dog  the queen air mattress takes up about     of the space inside  could fit   people but would be a little crowded with any gear  there is some small fraying at seams and spots where stitching is coming loose  zipper like to catch so just be careful not to yank it and tear it  the tent stakes are pretty cheap and i have bent a few of them staking the tent down  but they still work  definitely recommend for a roomy   person   dog  car camper tent      
292,5.0,                       this tent is a great summer tent with all four walls being mesh  we had plenty of ventilation and cross breezes  the tent was easy to set up  being only three poles and one pole is for the rain fly  the tent goes up with two poles  i did buy more heavy duty stakes to be used  the tent didn t move  we just barely put in a queen size air mattress  gave us about     feet at the end of the tent and maybe about    inches on one of the sides   it didn t rain or have strong winds when i was camping so cant speak on the waterproofing  i did enjoy that the bag expands on the bottom allowing for the tent to be folded up and put away with everything in the bag  great detail there  i would recommend this tent to friends  its a basic tent but fit all my needs for summer camp out      
293,5.0,                       i was very pleased with this tent   i was on a very primitive campsite for   nights   one of the days it rained all day     it was a muddy  sloshy  mess and there was water that i could feel under my tent   but  everything stayed completely dry   i had practiced setting it up before the trip but hadn t staked it   when i arrived it was a little more complicated to set it up by myself   all in all  i thought it worked out well   it would have been nice to have the rain flap come out farther so the area right outside my tent might have stayed drier      
294,5.0,                       i bought this coleman tent because i know that this company makes many great products  i read the reviews and it was coming up a winner    i haven t been out yet camping but opened it up to see if everything is there and look at it really good  looks well made  love the screened windows and door with the extra zippered closures  it has a sun roof    and the extra tent covering that goes over the top reinforces it from the rain and wind  the poles to put in place are metal and has a stretchable cord that runs through the poles making it durably bendable  and also easy to fold when taking it down  it has a net pocket to place little things in and a zippered pocket on the other side  it s my first tent  so i tried to explain as best as i could  it s a   person tent and it s so roomy that you can actually fit   persons  can t hardly wait to use it      
295,3.0,                       super easy to assemble  but i ve had it for three weeks now and we ve already had a couple things happen  i used this tent for a two week road trip  while assembling it one of the poles managed to poke a hole into the slot it slides through  now every time you set it up the pole goes through the hole and you have to adjust it and fit it back into the material  and on the last night of our trip the elastic between the poles broke on one and we had to feed it back through and knot it  it did the trick and i wasn t expecting amazing quality for a     tent but it did have a couple problems      
296,4.0,                          person version this was a nice tent for a single person  could see it being sort of cramped for two considering you probably would only be able to fit your sleeping bags and nothing else couldn t really speak to the water resistance other than the fact that condensation likes to collect on the inside which can be felt if you rub up against it in the mornings   this seems to be common of all the tents i ve had overall  a nice tent with a couple of handy mesh pockets on either end to hold your phone  wallet  keys  etc no real complaints here      
297,5.0,                       i bought this tent for my    year old twin boys to use for boy scout campouts because i thought it would work well enough for their needs and it was inexpensive enough that when they eventually ruin in  i won t feel bad about buying another tent  we are very pleased with it so far this tent was easy enough for my beginning campers to put up and down by themselves without help  it kept them dry during a moderate rain on their first campout  and it has held up to their less than gentle treatment   this was just what they needed      
298,4.0,                       the first time i used this tent was at my friends house  i set it up in the back yard  we had a poker party and a golf outting that weekend and i didn t want to drive    miles home and besides  i wanted to try out my new purchase so  the tent went up as planned  pretty easy for one person  plenty of room well  the wind started around       pm  hardly any clouds  a full moon and just a little breeze  then it got stronger  by       i had    to    mph gusts  it kept blowing and blowing  just when i thought it was about over  it would start again  i had the tent staked down with     tent spikes  the original spikes that came with the tent are garbage  it felt like the tent was being lifted off the ground  i was holding the sides out with both feet and hands  the side of the tent facing the wind collapsed    times and each time it sprang back into shape  i was only about    feet from a    foot oak tree that i thought was going to blow over at any minute  at      am the wind finally stopped  i got zero sleep   when i got out  i honestly expected to see a pair of feet with ruby slippers sticking out from under my tent i m not a hardcore backpacker  i m a laidback car tent camper  for the money  you can t beat it i made my own footprint out of a heavy duty tarp i m not sure how waterproof it is  but as far as the wind goes  i m thoroughly impressed update  the second time i ve used my tent  a little wind and some rain  from sprinkles to kind of a down pour  the whole thing lasted about    minutes  not one drop of water inside  i m thrilled with this tent i did male my own  footprint  for it  i used a heavy duty tarp i trimmed down to   x    i put in some extra grommets  it sets one foot inside from the edge  it just helps prevent punctures and keeps a barrier between the tent bottom and the what water get a under  it worked perfect next time i set it up i ll take some pictures i hope this helps      
299,3.0,                       updated  coleman sent me a pole repair kit after i complained  still recommend buying better stakes  a plastic peg hammer  and bring some cord to add tie downs  also a tarp  others reported water leaks  i did not have any  but used a tarp to cover the ground used the tent for a week bike tour  worked ok  we had some wind gusts up to    mph that almost flattened the tent  better designs  including some coleman  seem to have more guide wires for stability  as a result one pole split  response from coleman  i apologize that your pole split and was weakened by the wind  but our warranty does not cover fortuitous events what is fortuitous  using the tent when it s windy      
300,3.0,                       this is a tent we purchased for our son so we were looking for something that is easily set up and easy to take down  we especially liked the size  a bit bigger than a one man tent but not so big that there was a lot of wasted area   this seemed perfect   the only complaint so far is that we took it out to the yard to set it up and the tab that holds the ring that the support is supposed to go into ripped off with very little pressure   so now i have to sew it back on  and it s too thick for my machine   i m hoping i can hand sew it sufficiently so that it won t be an issue in the future   coleman used to be a product that we could count on excellent quality   grew up with coleman camping equipment  may not be purchasing them in the future      
301,5.0,                       this is a well made tent from coleman  easy to assemble and put away  if you re not sure how to put a tent back into its pouch watch youtube  this was used on a car camping trip  i have other more expensive tents for backpacking and more extreme camping but this will hold up on its own  it s a   person tent that stands much taller than other   persons so more headroom  you can fit two people comfortably assuming the gear is outside but spacious for one person  it may be too heavy to use for backpacking but with some care  this tent will last for years and years  replace the cheap stakes      
302,5.0,                       hubs has been wanting to camp out with boys all summer  it s labor day weekend and he finally did  our boys loved it        there is   of us and this   person tent has plenty of space  it s huge  i think we would have been fine with a   person but maybe if it last and our boys getting bigger it will be fine love all the windows   lots views to watch stars and get air flow  we did put topper over it and fits great was easy to set up great tent if your thinking of doing the same it s so worth it      
303,2.0,                       technically  the tent worked as needed and was perfectly fine for my camping trip  however  one of the straps that attach the tent to the tension bars broke ripped on the first use  i tried patching it back up for the weekend with duct tape and that didn t work for me  the tent however did still technically work  i love all the mesh  windows  that help with air circulation and it was fairly easy to put up as break down with just one person  i m still disappointed that it broke literally the first time i used it  it ll be fine for trips where there s zero percent chance of any rain      
304,5.0,                       we bought this   months ago and happened to use it only once this year but boy was it memorable  we went camping at a campground for father s day weekend in june  this tent impressed me so much because unfortunately one night just happened to be some of the worst rain i ve ever experienced camping  like we are talking torrential downpours  we could see car headlights most of the night because so many people were leaving the campground  in fact when we woke up the next morning the people camping next to us had to move sites because theirs was completely flooded  we had a little bit of flooding too but this tent was an absolutely champ  we did wonder how much it could really take if the thunderstorm didn t let up  so we almost left too  but we were dry and we wanted to stick it out and we were happy when we did  after surviving such a  horrible  night in this tent it has definitely proven its quality to me  definitely recommend      
305,5.0,                       this tent is amazing  we  my   year old and i  camped in october with my son s scout pack for a couple of days in maryland   pouring rain both nights and heavy wind the second night  it was in the    s during the day and       s at night  this thing held up like a champ  the rain fly was great at keeping the rain out and stayed put against the wind  we had nice and warm sleeping bags and were very cozy  easy to put up and take down  it s probably ideal for no more than   people with gear  otherwise it will be too tight  the only things i wish were better are the mesh pockets that ripped probably because we put something too heavy and a hook at the center would be nice for an led lantern  this is a great tent  you will not be disappointed      
306,5.0,                       update     years and dozens of uses  this thing is still going strong   i always dry it before storage and sweep it out when needed   camped on ground and sand  wind  rain  sun   still love it i bought this to replace a decades old tent   the tarp floor was the main draw  as the old one i had was still from the days of nylon floors pros   fast to setup   my wife and i can do it in      mins and that s taking our time   i have done it myself and it only takes a little longer   without the rainfly  the screen roof is great for stargazing   we camped under a meteor shower a few weeks ago   the zipper for running an extension cord  you stay dry   i went through a decent rain  granted not a raging thunderstorm by any means  but no leaks cons   only one i can think of is when you stake it  set it up and clip all the hooks to the poles  the door zipper is a little strained  i worry about the wear and tear on it over time   this is only a perceived con  so far  after   trips with constant in and out  kids   it is still working fine as an aside  we have a queen and a twin blow up mattress that we use in this   they take up the entire floor  but you can fit them  if it s just the queen  there s plenty of room around it to store stuff      
307,4.0,                       after doing a cross country bicycle trip across america in the coleman hooligan  i decided to buy a new tent for my next venture just to try something new the sundome is a pretty good tent overall  it has that coleman quality i ve learned to trust  and i do recommend it  however let me point out some things are different compared to the hooligan pros   if its not raining   its base without the rainfly offers more privacy  if you have to set up this tent while its already raining  the base already has some protection to help keep less water out while setting up  the pockets inside the tent are in a higher spot which keeps your stuff safer  has a zipped up opening to plug in your devices  personally not my thing  i like less temptation to use my devices while out camping things to mention i find this tent  the sundome  to be a little less  hardcore   in the sense that   the stakes are smaller and a tad bit thinner  the window doesn t open which is my least favorite thing as in the hooligan i found an open window to be surprisingly useful  the tent is smaller in every dimension including my favorite dimension  the height of the tent  i m a tall guy    the rainfly  hugs  the tent less so you can expect it to be slightly less warm     better for warm weather  less for cold   you have to pull   poles through the tent which means more setup time     
308,4.0,                       i took it to cam out in desert for almost   weeks   yep i went to burning man with it  and at night it was as low as   ish    that was cold  and the tent is not maid to keep you warm through this low temperatures  however i had a tarp with me and the tent covert with tarp combo was pretty ok  dust still gets in through the windows tho  i would definitely get a fully covered one   i m about to go camping in big sur with this ent so let s see how it will hold up in humid weather overall im really happy how durable it is      
309,4.0,                       this tent is great for camping  it is very roomy  it can actually fit a queen air mattress with room to spare  i haven t had any leaks when using it in light rain and i did not do anything extra to seal it  very easy to put together  one person can do it alone if needed the major negative i have is it is very noisy in wind  and because of the height  it can be blown down more easily  i moved to the desert where it can get quite windy and this is not the best tent to use  i had a couple nights where the tent blew over  i think this tent would be perfect for other areas without so much wind  and possible with more trees to better tie things down properly  i agree with some other reviewers that it is worth it to buy some higher quality stakes separately i would definitely recommend this tent for those looking for something easy and basic  and planning to use it in moderate conditions      
310,5.0,                       used it for the first time out of the box and it performed very well under the rain  no leak and little condensation  quick setup under    minutes the tent is spacious and it is right size for   persons and  backpacks  etc   would be very tight for six persons   we like the idea that we can stand upi tried many brands and so far this is our family s favorite      
311,5.0,                       i ve only used it twice so far  but it was really tested  and it held up well  one use was in the hoh rainforest in washington  it rained like crazy but i stayed totally dry in the tent  the other test was the extreme polar opposite a trip i took to death valley  i had several major windstorms in death valley and i was worried the tent poles would snap given how strong the wind gusts were  again  no problem at all  the tent is also really perfect for two people  but a third would work too  although less well  not sure how you would squeeze four adults in though that would be tight   i m really happy with this tent  i got it for car camping and it works perfect for that  the price is so cheap that if something does eventually happen to the tent  i won t lose any sleep over it  but so far  i m super impressed      
312,4.0,                       i wanted to write a review for the tent because people should know that this coleman   person tent was super durable  lightweight  easy to put up and with the rainfly  pretty much waterproof  the downfall  and probably to my blame  this tent is tiny  i bought a twin blowup mattress     height  and when inflated hit both sides of the tent and gave me about      of room to put stuff on one side  i am     and when i laid down i was all up in the tent  head rubbed or i had to bend at the knees to avoid my feet going through the side i upgraded to the   person sundome so i know i will have both ample room and a little more headroom     
313,5.0,                       i ve used this tent multiple of times and it has been great  first tent buy on my own and so glad i went with this one  fairly easy set up  it is just a little tricky to fold it all back into the bag it comes in  i haven t camped really in the rain  plus i like to take extra precautions  sprayed the tent with the silicone water guard and for extended camping i put it under a canopy if a storm is expected    hate when everything gets soaked   overall  best purchase for the price and i will be buying another when this one s life has been used up      
314,5.0,                       set up with total ease   i m disabled  i hear people come up with all sorts of reasons to complain    i think they are bumbling fools  this product is just awesome and there is no reason for complaint    took less that    minutes to get it done without even looking at the instructions   and looks like it will be fine for a good long time    if you manhandle the support rods i guess they can break  so just be easy with them and allow them to do the job they were designed to do      
315,5.0,                       i had zero camping experience  my husband remembered a few things from when he was little    we decided it was time to get back out there  after much research  we purchased this tent  thanks for the great sale  amazon    not only was it it a good value  but this is a good tent  as with any   person tent out there  it fits   people very comfortably  with plenty of room for storage  i camped with a friend once  and we had plenty of room for two separate piles of stuff  while still being so far away from each other sleeping  that we would not be able to reach with our fingertips if we tried  it feels like it has sooooo much space in there when you crawl in it for the first time  it has nice little pockets for personal items and great vents to keep things cool in the summer while it has not rained either of the times we took it out  it seems to be holding out well to moisture  we additionally sealed the seams  just to be on the safe side  the little plastic  porch  that comes with the tent is a nice feature also   it is so hard to get dirt out of the tent once it gets in   better to leave your shoes in a dry clean spot outside things got a little heated between me and my husband when we were putting it up for the first time   i chuck it up to inexperience though  as putting it up the second time was no problem at all  pulling it down and folding it back into its carrying case was a cinch also  basically  in good weather  this thing is your best friend and we ll see about the rest when the time comes      
316,1.0,                       looked great  very roomy  that s about it  used six times  the zipper constantly catches the doorway flap even when being careful  third time out zipper tore a hole   th time out the elastic in the doorway stick broke  went out the last time and the elastic in the main support just snapped putting up  less than a summer of camping  invest in something nicer      
317,5.0,                       so   i needed a larg er  family tent for some combined camping  i love coleman products  coleman may not be the lightest or feature rich   but they do basic stuff very well and seem to outlast more expensive products  i ve run a   person traditional scout tent for many  many years and had no failures i was looking in the      person range  seems most run well over      each  even many coleman ones  i have had this same kind of tent  ez up dome  in several styles  names  and colors  i noticed they had a   person     x      x       sundome on amazon for      picked it up to see if it would work first  this ten will fit     adults or   adults and     kids  whatever the  people size  of the tent it s more like half that for comfortable sleeping  you can get   full size adults in my tent but it would not be comfortable  tent went up fairly easily  really is just an oversize dome tent  once you easily master it you ll love how incredibly simple it is to set up or broken down      
318,2.0,                         star because of misleading photos that show  closeable   window  without the rainfly   the photos are for   person tent  which appears to be quite different then the   person version  we got the   person version of this    of the walls are almost completely mesh with no way to cover them close them   the rainfly does not help the heat stay in and not much privacy through the rainfly that just barely covers the mesh at the bottom  its all mesh under the white part of the rainfly     if one could close the mesh  the tent would stay warm  luckily took the really warm sleeping bags  otherwise would have been spending the night in the car pros easy to setupable to walk around insidebigger than expected  fit everything in there and still had room zippers are really good  opening closing door was super easy     
319,5.0,                       i bought this   person tent as a gift for my  at the time  boyfriend  i had never slept in a tent and i thought it sounded fun  it was an inexpensive tent and seemed to e a good choice considering we may use it just once if i don t like the experience we ve gone camping   times with this tent and are very happy with it  the first time we had to set it up in the dark and it was up in no time  the instructions on the package are very easy to follow   recently we used it on a very windy island and it behaved quite well   it did shake quite a bit  as expected   but withstood the winds the only problem we had was that  due to the wind  the tent got filled with dust although all the windows were zipped up we have been lucky with the weather  so i cannot comment on how well it does in the rain  overall  it s a great warm weather tent      
320,5.0,                       wow this tent is awesome  we were very impressed and happy with purchase before our family camping trip  it took about    minutes to set up as advertised  which was very easy and fool proof  with no directions you could figure it out  inside was huge  we were able to fit     queen air mattress and     twin mattresses  for the price   quality we would buy again if needed     
321,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          overall a good tent  easy to setup with a rain guard that covers the screens on the top of the tent  its a   person tent but with   air mattress you barely have any headroom  lots of windows inside for good air flow  maybe i just got unlucky and received a defective one but the seams were a little ripped in the corners and the tent took on some rain water and got some of our clothes and gear soaking wet      
322,2.0,                       i bought my tent at full price for a new tent  when i opened the bag of the tent  it was clear that the tent had come used  it was dirty with rocks and debris still left on the inside from whoever used it last  and the door had a huge rip in it  overall i like the style of the tent and when set up it looks just like the advertised pictures  which is the only reason why i gave it two stars instead of one  but selling used and damaged products at full price is just bad business  coleman is a great brand with quality products  but they did me dirty this time and i m not sure if i ll ever buy from this store again  at least not off amazon      
323,5.0,                       great tent  easy set up  i took a camping trip to the smokies and i had never put up a tent in my life  this was so easy to figure out  even putting it up by myself  it s   rods total and took about    minutes the first time i put it up and about   minutes the second time i put it up  sleeps   comfortably  two adults would be a little crammed and there would be no extra room for their stuff inside the tent though  after reading the reviews i decided not to waterproof my tent  and that was my only complaint  which is totally my fault  after spending a whole night in the rain  i woke up to a wet pillow  wet hiking shoes  and puddles in the corners  i would definitely water proof the tent first        
324,5.0,                       it started to pour down rain as i was putting up my tent  luckily i practiced putting this together before i went out  it was quick and easy to assemble  i even had time to help my friends with their large complicated tent  i put a tarp under for protection against ground moisture and brought a towel to wipe my tent down the next day  i am very happy with my purchase      
325,5.0,                       bought this for an amateur radio field day event which lasts from friday to sunday   the purpose of the event was to test radio equipment in emergency disaster situations   believe me this turned out to be one terrific week end   it stormed and rained off and on all day saturday with wind  lightning and driving rain through the night   the wind blew so hard saturday night it rocked my car  not having used the tent before i decided to stay in my car saturday night just to be safe   when i checked the tent on sunday morning it was one still there and two dry as a bone inside   i did have the rain fly on but no added sprays or coatings   next year i will not hesitate to operate from this tent should we encounter such weather again      
326,4.0,                       absolutely a great tent we set it up right away  it will fit two people but a little crowed for two with backpacks we kept our packs covered under the outside fly so no problems  however i would recommend sealing all the seams on the tent before using with their  coleman product which is also a great sealer for the money  this will ensure you have no leaks from bad weather like we have here in the northwest  tent will do what i bought it for as a base camping tent while hunting and a casual weekend trip   nice and light with great carry bag  almost didn t buy because one of the reviews said  they could not use carry bag for pack backing   this is not the case  fits on back pack nicely no problems  like all coleman products i have used this product works great  plus it is light to carry      
327,5.0,                       i had successful time winter camping with this tent  perfect tent for off seasons  doable for winter camping if you are a seasoned camper  we aren t pros and it was doable and we had a blast  but more appropriate for fall spring summer camping  spacious and sturdy  it faired very well with our time in the wintery woods      
328,5.0,                       i ve been camping in this type of tent for decades now  they just work  take care of your equipment and realize the limitations this might have and you ll be fine  it s not a   season basecamp tent  it needs to be waterproofed about once a year  sometimes the poles break and need to be fixed  the stakes suck but they can work if need be  but  it s a great value for what it is  it ll get you out there  it will keep your dry  it will get you out of the wind and the sun  it works      
329,5.0,                       i ve had a spendy  mountain hardwear backpacking tent for    years thats amazing  but i needed a cheaper  bigger tent for car camping  this thing got put through the ringer on the first night  mega winds  rain  etc  it had a hard time standing up in super strong wind  but honestly what tent this big wouldn t  nothing tore  nothing broke  had a really good first experience with this thing  recommended for a bargain tent      
330,5.0,                       love this tent   i actually own three of them   my family and i go camping every year   this tent is lightweight  takes up very little room  and is easily assembled   we used to have one large tent that held all the family members in it  it was too heavy  took long to set up  had too many parts to it  and there was no privacy   this tent remedied all of those issues   i can put up this tent in less than five minutes and it is just as easy to take down   it fits two people comfortably or   people snugly   i am      and i have enough room to stand in it to change clothes   while it is not waterproof  it is water resistant   i have camped in the rain with this tent  without issues   this tent is good for new or seasoned campers   definitely recommend      
331,5.0,                       this tent is awesome  it is super lightweight  easy to pack  easy to carry  the bag that it comes with extends out  so that you can repack the tent into it  every other tent i owned did not fit back into the case it came in because it is just impossible to get all of the air bubbles out  coleman really changed the game with this as most campers know  the size suggestion for number of people is not reliable    adult males can fit into this tent    very small people can fit  but they would really have to be small      
332,5.0,                       i haven t used in rain yet so i couldn t rate that  but this is my first tent  i d always wanted to get my own so i was prepared for a good camping opportunity  had relied on others more well provisioned  and    i really like it a friend helped me set it up  very quickly  she used a more intuitive approach while i was leafing through instructions   the   person was roomy  easily held a big air mattress  cute green color  our group agreed it s cool the instructions are attached to carrying case  why have i never seen this before  i like my new tent    i bought a tarp for ground cover  and heavy duty stakes based on others  reviews but haven t needed those yet      
333,3.0,                       this tent was pretty easy to assemble  however  we didn t discover that one of the main poles is longer than the other until we had everything set up   the longer one is supposed to be the pole that runs along the very top  this is not in the instructions  it is fairly lightweight  but durable  the zippers are sort of cheap  they ones on the door kept getting stuck or caught on the draft protector flap i haven t camped in a tent in a very long time  so perhaps the design of tents have changed  but i didn t realize that all sides aren t covered solid unless you have the rain fly attached  in other words  two sides are just uncovered mesh  and are only covered by the rain fly  this made for some very cold nights  as the cold air couldn t be kept out the pockets on both sides of the tent were very handy  and so was the little hook at the top that allows you to hang a lantern what was best appreciated was the e port zippered pocket  though  we had to run an electrical cord through it so i could use my cpap machine to sleep  and it was so easy to do  i like that it zips up  to help keep any bugs out important note  this is definitely not a   person tent  unless all   people are on the short and slim side  my boyfriend is      and i m       we had our   lb dog sleep with us  too  we all snuggled up in a queen sized air mattress and had only about   inches between the mattress and tent      
334,2.0,                       the zipper on this tent did not hold up past a couple of camping seasons   coleman seems to have problems with the zipper in their tents   we had another cabin tent that lasted only one season before the zipper would keep splitting   the zipper in this tent did last a bit longer but is also splitting regularly   it is too bad  because this tent is perfect for scouting   it is easy to set up and seems to hold up to weather  rain  well   my son has the four person size and could easily set it up by himself at age    or so   the   person tent is the perfect size for two people with room to store their gear out of the elements      
335,5.0,                       great product  if you re going to put two people in it you would need to have them laying side by side on a sleeping bag  but we bought it for one of our kids we bought them each one  they love it and it s easy to set up the rain fly can be put on top to protect from the rain and shade or be taken off it has great circulation throughout the whole tent and a little corner piece where the electrical cords can come in and out zips closed you don t have to worry about bugs and little creature is getting in if you don t want to use that you can just leave it closed  it compacts down to a small little bag that s easy to carry and expands after you bought it so that everything fits in there very nice      
336,2.0,                       i was pretty excited about this tent   super easy to set up and take down  very roomy  great ventilation and it performed well for two nights of heavy rain   the third night we had some wind and tied down the stakes   the tent didn t blow over but one of the tent poles snapped   disappointed that the tent didn t even make it three nights   not recommended      
337,4.0,                       purchased tent for a   day rock festival   environment   open field soaked by a weeks worth of rain     grass  weeds  thorns  and stubble   we purchased a heavy duty tarp for protecting the floor  so we felt nothing underneath it the tent was not as easy to setup as i was led to believe  however  the winds were in excess of    mph while we were trying to set it up   but with some help from our camper friends next to us  it went up just fine  took about an hour including the ground tarp the first night during torrential oklahoma rains  there were about   drops in each corner   the next day we sprayed those areas with some scotch guard and no issues the next night during the rain this tent required the use of larger stakes than were included   we had purchased some  and recommend the same for anyone using this tent especially if the ground is damp the side pockets are handy  we stored quite a few items in them did not use the lantern hanger  but if you do  you will need a hook  it just a plastic loop is it very sturdy  while it does tend to flex a bit in the higher winds  it is very sturdy  make sure you pull everything very tight  on saturday night we had a tornado warning  the sirens went off  we ran for our truck  its all we had    a tornado passed overhead producing winds in excess of    mph with horizontal rain  small bb size hail after it passed we expected the worst  however  the only issue was the front part under the rain cover collapsed enough to let some rain blow in  but at     mph we were happy   unfortunately the rain came in right over a sleeping bag  but even then it was not enough to cause an issue   unfortunately our neighbors tent was flattened  and everything completely soaked recommend this tent  we have   tents in our collection  some from other manufacturers  this one has proved itself   also it breathes so it s not a winter tent by any means  but great for probably a   season tent if you have warm sleeping bags for autumn and early spring oh also the instructions were in spanish  the english ones we found later in the box   the pics were good enough      
338,5.0,                       when i went camping for the  st time  i used this tent  it rained almost constantly during the first couple days of our trip  the tent stayed dry on the inside   i stayed warm at night  i actually got a little toasty   had to shed a layer of clothing  i do wish it was maybe   inches taller so i could stand up to change clothes  but i m a dancer  so i m used to changing in awkward spaces     
339,5.0,                       to start  i researched tents for days before i made this purchase and i m totally satisfied  i was looking for a lightweight  compact  very waterproof tent at a good price and this tent met all the criteria   i ve used this tent to camp in hawaii   times so far and it s really been terrific  bought it for a camping trip in maui and it s small enough that it fit nicely in my carry on luggage  which was one of my biggest concerns  additionally  it s held up through several rainy hawaiian nights and i have never gotten wet  i did spray the whole tent with waterproofing spray before use though  which i d recommend  the tent materials seems very durable and waterproof  the only water that ever found it s way in was through small seam where the tent material meets the footprint material and the seam meets inside the tent  it poured all night and only about   drops of water found their way in through the seam  so no real complaints  this tent has also been really easy to set up and take down  i can set it up by myself in less than    minutes and when i take it down  for once it actually fits in the bag without any problems  a great tent at a great price      
340,4.0,                       i had previously owned a   person instant tent  i loved the thing but it was just way too big and did not pack down to a decent size  forget trying to stuff it back in the provided bag   i needed something that would pack down smaller and was easy to manage one of my friends had this tent and she had nothing but high praise for it  so when it came time for our annual camping trip  i snagged one of these just days before  i really love this thing  it solves the biggest issue i had which was the size of our last tent  this thing packs down small and the provided bag that it comes in actually expands once you tear off the bottom strip  the tent stuffs back into the back wonderfully  set up is easy and i was able to get it constructed by myself in about   minutes we only have used it for one night  but that one night was great  we slept with the rain fly off and could see the stars at night  the temperatures dropped to     and we were warm and cozy all night  there are two mesh pouches to store your belongings in and a little plastic loop at the very top so that you can hang a lightweight camping light  two windows on the front and back which is also nice  i can t comment on waterproofness just yet  but i may revisit my review once we get rained on  the size says three people but i would have to say two people and some gear  my girlfriend and i both had sleeping pads and there was plenty of room on the size for gear my only complaint is that the tent spikes that come with this thing are garbage  more than half of them bent extremely easily  go invest in some higher quality spikes and you ll be good to go      
341,4.0,                       got this tent for a short camping trip in shenandoah  va with a friend  i am new to camping  and was just looking for something relatively cheap to try out  my friend already had a large tent for her family  and i was just looking for something for only me that would provide a bit of privacy  this did do the job  but it was a tight fit  i don t see how anyone could fit two people and their stuff  i have a blow up twin sized mattress that fit perfectly  leaving only about a foot of room on the long side of the tent  great for sleeping  but that was about it  had to change clothes lying down    we did get caught in quite a storm and this tent did splendidly  kept all my stuff dry  and i didn t see any water in the tent except what i tracked in myself   we did have an additional tarp set up above it  so i can t speak to the efficacy of the rain fly  but the bottom of the tent performed very well this is a summer weather tent  there are two sides at the top where it doesn t close at all  it just has a mess netting  this made for one very chilly night for me  but i was very happy the rest of the time  would not recommend if you are going anywhere where it gets below around    at night i put this tent up alone with no problem  even as a novice tent setter upper  all in all  very satisfied      
342,5.0,                       great tent pro  surprisingly high quality for the   man tent at       stitching was very good  material and design was excellent with good ventilation as well   i m     and was able to fit along the short axis  to facilitate   adults  with an a couple inches to spare      and above may want to sleep along the long axis  maybe fit   people in that orientation  cons  minor   the zipper is a little light weight and  may become the first point of failure in the future  not cheap  just light weight and catches frequently     top marks for light use weekend camping with the family     
343,5.0,                       great tent  coleman quality  definitely not for   people  we had   adults in there and it was snug  i never have listened to the number of people that companies claim to fit  this is no exception  i always cut in half whatever number of people claimed anyway  this tent was easy to put up and down  nice height  quality zipper i always use tarp under tents  and did so with this one too      
344,5.0,                       this was a wonderful tent  easy for my husband and i to set up before a music festival in about    minutes without having to read the instructions that are sewn into the casing for easy access  it withheld during a windy  rain storm well and only started leaking from the window zipper when there was a terrible downpour  which was expected   if it hadn t been for the rain this tent would have easily lasted for awhile  i purchased the   person tent and it easily fit   of us comfortably while we were seated inside  we could ve fit   additional people comfortably also  def a must buy for the price and quality  coleman products offer the best products   i will def be buying again in the future for other music festivals       
345,5.0,                       was camping by myself and it offered plenty of room for an army cot and a couple of steralite footloockers  i assembled it without help in    minutes  didn t enounter inclement weather so can t comment on how water resistant it is  going camping again in august and will update if there s issues  like most tents jt was a little challenging to get back in the carrying case  however  i was in a hurry and if i had more time i could have  i like that the case expands giving you more room  great value on the four person and recommended      
346,5.0,                       recently took the tent camping  it rained at night and the tent stayed completely dry on the inside you can fit a queen sized air mattress inside with a little room to put bags and to step in and out of the tent im      and i was able to stand in the middle of the tent almost perfectly upright  i had to bend my head a bit i would say this tent could fit   people very comfortable with air mattress     and their bags with just sleeping bags    would probably be a little tight  but say if your friends tent collapses in the middle of the night because it was down pouring they could join you in an emergency the tent allows ventilation very well  which wasn t that great when it was raining because it was also windy and made the tent very cold  so if you re going to use this tent during a windy season bring a lot to keep you warm the door is also a little finicky  theres an extra flap for some reason where the zipper is and it kept folding in and out while i was trying to zip the entrance back up  i probably could have cut it if i needed to      
347,1.0,                       i purchased this for my daughter for the  th of july celebration with her friends   one of the poles was missing the piece to be able to connect it to the tent   the elastic that is strung between the pole segments was sticking out the end   no way to connect it   very disappointing   will not purchase again   contacted coleman customer service   they would not send a replacement until i sent them a picture of the pole and a copy of the receipt   when i explained i was not anywhere where i could do that but would send it as soon as i could   they said they could not send a pole until they received the information      
348,5.0,                       super easy to put up  i can put it up in about    minutes by myself  i didn t realize that the sides just have a screen  the rain fly covers it  however if it rained  it possibly could get wet inside  not a big tent camper  so not sure if this is a feature on other tents  it seems to be well made   the price was right   it is a   man tent  however really only   could fit comfortable ish  took it camping in wyoming where the winds are bad   held up well  i did replace the stakes with bigger ones   the ones it comes with are really small      
349,5.0,                       does the job well  easy set up  bag is sufficiently sized to repack everything with ease  the bucket bottom really works  we were in a downpour for hours  in the end leaving the tent in a puddle larger than the tent itself  no leaking from the bottom at all and only minor leaking from the upper areas  if i had treated with waterproofing it would ve been even better we fit all   of us for one night and it was ok  four of us another night and it was ok  would be ideal for   people to sleep  if you want room for anything other that people and bedding it would fit   plus gear      
350,5.0,                       purchased about a year ago  been to big bear when it was    degrees  mamoth  zion and joshua tree  easy to assemble and it s so roomy  we can fit   queen air mattress and   twin air mattress  when we where in zion it rained and the inside of the tent stayed dry  we are a family of   and   dogs  and we fit perfectly well inside and still roomy      
351,5.0,                       i ve used this tent a few times now and it has done well  last time i used it it was raining and with the rain fly on it no water entered the tent  although i wouldn t want to put   people in this tent unless two of them were children      
352,4.0,                       i bought this to replace my bear grylls easy up tent  i learned easy up means nearly impossible down  sure it went up really easy  but when it came time to take it down  it was ridiculously hard  so i opted for the standard tent and it was easy to put up as well as take down  i was also able to fit it back into the bag it came with  yay  i gave   stars instead of   as the material seems much lighter than what i am used to  but it still held up very well in some rain  i bought the green and my friend bought the navy      
353,5.0,                       so i bought this to go camping and have only tested it say in it for a couple of hours on a very windy day first off go get new stakes     the ones it come with are absolutely garbage when i first put it up i used the steak that it came with and the wind ripped the whole tent out   no weight inside but still bought some decent ones and the whole day it stay right in place  i did use some sealer on the power cord zipper  and around the vent seem like could be some problem areasvery easy to assemble and disassemble took about    ish minutes to put together far less to take apart  seems very sturdy and tough  i d suggest a tarp for the bottom but my dog ran in and out with fairly sharp claws without a problemseems great i ll update once i use for actual camping     
354,5.0,                       bought this tent for a      mile camping adventure  had never had a   man tent  set it up in back yard and it was so easy even the first time and got it back into the carrier also  the first night out on our adventure had a very hard rain storm catch us just after we set up tent  no water got into tent and every thing in it was dry the next morn  it rained on us for the first three nights and the tent did its job every night  ended up camping   nights and the tent handled the travel perfectly and was easy to assemble and disassemble every time even when we could not get the stakes in the ground it stayed up perfectly      
355,5.0,                       so i used this for a campout in the mountains  it was pretty simple to set up    long rods for the main tent and one short for the rain fly  only took a few minutes to put together for the first time we only had a     chance of rain and sure enough we got a massive storm hit us at  am with high winds and rain  winds in excess of   mph easily while others had their tents collapsing on them this tent held up like a champ  i stayed dry and the tent didnt even budge the winds were so bad that one tent nearly flew off pulling stakes out of the ground   thw other tents rainfly acted as a sail in the wind nearly taking it i would buy this tent ten more times and highly recommend  its light  compact and definately holds up to the elements     
356,5.0,                       now that we have used the tent a dozen or so times  i feel comfortable rating this tent at a full five stars  for the price  it is surprising that it has held up perfectly  time to set up is about     minutes after you have done it one time  zippers work great and haven t caught at all  the rain fly works well and helps block a lot of wind  we haven t used it in snow so can t comment on its performance there  packing it back up is very easy and it fits in the bag effortlessly a queen size mattress is a very tight fit  so we have to use our twin mattresses instead  i m       and fit but it s a bit snug when lying straight out  only thing i needed to get was a few extra stakes for really windy days  it does come with   but i wanted some longer ones  other than that  no complaints and it is great for a starter tent      
357,5.0,                       i got this tent on the way home after i flooded on day   of a   day camping trip with a cheapie i bought when i was inexperienced  so far it s held up well and i m getting better and putting it all away  on my latest trip  it got down into the high    s and with some layers  hot hands  and a good sleeping bag  i was ok in the tent  it s super airy but you can latch down the fly close to the tent and it helps  the rain fly works and the tent itself is waterproof but i end up using tarps or my newly bought fly so i don t have to put away a soaked tent  note  i sealed all the seams when i got it     
358,4.0,                       i didn t realize when i bought this tent  though i looked at the pictures  that the sides are mesh  with no covering   there is a rain cover that covers the mesh  but it doesn t have anything like a zipper closure from the inside to cover the mesh   i ve only used it in warm weather and from what i can tell it would only be a warm weather tent   it is very easy to put up and take down  i got the six person tent and it fits two single air mattresses with room at the end and between the beds   can also easily stand up inside      
359,5.0,                       this coleman   person sundome tent kept us nice and dry on our camping trip   it was very easy to assemble and we had it up in minutes   this is the perfect size for one person or a couple of kids   it was a little small for   adults  a full size mattress fit but  nothing else  we will buy a coleman tent again but  next time we will buy a larger tent   i think the   person tent will be a better fit   we were satisfied with the quality of the product and ease of use       coleman    person sundome tent  green
360,5.0,                       what a great summer tent it has been  easy assembly  large interior  high enough door opening to simply walk out bent over a bit in the morning  and i m         lbs it s been in several good rain events in northern vermont  grand isle sp  little river sp  lake st  catherine sp  lake bomoseen sp  and seyon sp all this summer i realize that it was very inexpensive so i spent the ridiculous    to buy a can of coleman tent sealant and put it all over exposed surfaces right off  since then it acts like a      marmot      
361,5.0,                       bought this for a camping trip  the setting up takes    minutes  the tent is lightweight and keeps the bugs out  cannot comment on if it is waterproof but i don t think this will stand windy or rainy weather  the tent gets cold at night as tents tend to do  this tent is ideal for summer camping  as for size  it will fit two adults very cramped  trying to fit the camping gear and bags in the tent would be even more cramped  it fits one person with gear comfortably   overall a great lightweight tent for summer camping      
362,5.0,                       i ran out of time and didn t get to apply the seam sealer  the weekend i went camping it rained nonstop and it was cold  the rent kept us warm and dry  and by us i mean one large adult  almost   foot tall  and   dogs  there were times i wished i had purchased a larger tent and i plan to before my next trip  overall this was very easy for me to assemble by myself  i used a twin sized air mattress and had one      dog and one chihuahua as my company  it was a tight fit and there really wasn t enough room  but that s my misjudgment and no reflection of the product  it also dried quickly  hung it from a clothes line in my yard when we got home  and was easy to clean and put away      
363,3.0,                       beginning with what an amazing price i paid  and that it is perfectly lined on the bottom  no tarp required    but it is not a four person tent  maybe four quite short people could fit  but it is much wider than it is long   you can t tell this from the picture   so we had to sleep with the door to our side and squeezed three people in the long way  note that is three women who are about           feet tall   it was odd  a great two person tent though perhaps      
364,5.0,                       used this tent this past weekend for the first time   it fit me         my wife        and our   lb amerian staffordshire terrier in there with tons of room to spare   i wouldn t suggest this tent for any cold weather trips as the whole top of it is mesh that has nothing to stop cold air blowing in  but it did a very good job during the cooler weather we experienced this past weekend   the bottom of the tent is very strong too  almost to where you wouldn t worry if you forgot to put a tarp underneath   it almost feels like it is made of an actual tarp   overall very impressed and pleased with this tent      
365,5.0,                       i got this right on time for my birthday camping trip  if you really want to be close to someone and not have space for your things  this is perfect  i got it for myself  my twin sized air mattress  and my bag  i m      and i weigh    lbs and at times  i wished i had more space  especially when i had to change   over all though  it was comfortable enough to sleep in  my only real complaint is that the zipper kept getting stuck in the same spot  nothing i shouldn t be able to fix though      
366,5.0,                       we bought this specifically for quick weekends away   set up and teardown are easy as can be   with two people  it goes up in a few minutes and comes apart almost as quickly   we didn t get any rain  so i can t vouch for how watertight it is   the only issue was fitting it back into the bag afterwards   there is definitely some trick to getting it re rolled tight enough  but we haven t found it only one complaint   after the first use  the carry bag split right above the handle   we re not sure if that was a defect or if trying to fit it back in stressed a seam   either way  we re ditching the bag and buying another that s a little sturdier and roomier from a local discount shop inside  the tent is large enough for weekend gear and a queen air mattress   the mesh pockets are a nice bonus  as it makes it easy to locate glasses  cell phones  etc   ventilation is more than adequate  the ground level vent was a brilliant touch    we had zero condensation inside   we didn t use the electrical port  but it seems to be well designed   high enough to avoid seepage and wide enough to accommodate large cords like all coleman tents  the zippers work perfectly   no snags or special handling required  our only complaint with our gigatent   the zippers tend to catch on the rain flaps    the door is more than wide enough for transporting items in and out overall  i would highly recommend this tent for weekend getaways   tall people  over         may have to bend over a bit  but the generous floor space    x    makes up for it      
367,4.0,                       this is actually a pretty decent tent  it is very spacious and pretty tall in the inside  my daughter and i had way more than enough space to sleep  i bought the   person tent and unlike other tents this tent will fit   people if you really wanted to  not sure how well it holds up in the rain  but then again i don t intend to use it in rainy weather  plenty of ventilation for air to pass through  it s definitely a summer tent more than a winter tent because of all the open screened ventilation openings  light weight and easy to set up      
368,5.0,                       my son stays with me on the weekends but our current house is too small to accommodate him as far as having his own space and sleeping area  we decided to try out using a tent so that he could have some space to himself  he s tall  so we went with this tent for the headroom and it s larger floor space  we live in northern california  right on the coast in mendocino county  and since the purchase of this tent in january  it has weathered every storm and bought of rain since then with no leaks in any of the seams  or in the fabric itself  because of the taller canopy  it s a bit floppy in strong winds  but even in the strongest winds  when it was practically flattening  the rain fly stayed secure and prevented the rain from getting into the two large open screened areas  i am really impressed  it has weathered some serious constant downpours for days at a time  and the only place water got in was through the little port for putting your extension cord  and it was a trivial amount  disclaimer  this is the second tent of this model that i purchased  as the first one immediately started seeping water through the wall seems  i returned it for the same model and have had no issues  of course  as is probably true with all tents  i recommend getting some deeper and better quality tent stakes  as the ones that came with it could not do much against being constantly pulled around in the stormy winds  but i guess that s only if you ll be out in really windy weather      
369,3.0,                       an inside pocket in this tent was sewn accidently to side of the tent  so when i set it up  it didn t look right   a couple of friends found the flaw and we had to cut open the pocket to fix it   so  the pocket was ruined  but it wasn t a big deal  i can fix the pocket and the now corrected tent went up   and was taken down   fine  coleman tents are of great quality and after letting it sit in the rain  i inspected the inside of the tent and all areas were  water tight   i spent a night in the tent and was very pleased  it was very well ventilated  solidly constructed and i look forward to using it on many camping trips in the future      
370,5.0,                       heavy as bag of stones but great quality and high water resistant  i d say      water resistant  in any weather conditions  hard rain  storm  hail and so on      these makes it super choice for budget tent but you better share tent parts with group of   to make it easier to carry  or you should be strong enough to deal whole tent with yourself   i always choose the last one and not too big problem for average person  i have this tent from      and tested in every weather conditions  took it for    km trail for   days and it s not as hard to deal with weight of this iron tent         
371,5.0,                       so far so good  used it two or three times over the summer and loved it  it s very spacious for   people in the   person tent  i m   foot tall and i can stand up in the center  it rained and we did not get wet  we did put a tarp under the tent and sprayed it with waterproof spray just to be safe  easy to assemble but i recommend taking a video the first time you open it to make sure you fold it up the same way  it does have a strip to tear out and expand the bag if needed      
372,4.0,                       ive only used it once because im a noncamper  but i want to become one  it was so easy to set up first time  i had help because im still learning but i realized it was so simple   ill be okay on my own  plenty of rooms inside  again though  its only my dog   i i can testify for weather conditions like rain  but when i can ill try to update  i always put a tarp under my tent anyway only advice  buy separate sturdier ground pins  the ones it came with are just really short and kept coming unhooked several times  i wouldnt wanna be in windy conditions   wish i bought them  so buy ahead  coleman has some on amazon for        
373,4.0,                       my adult daughter and i enjoyed this tent   it was for a   night trip   we had a lot of rain but we kept dry  and had just enough room for our gear   i highly recommend it  especially for the price update           we ve continued to use this tent with good success  one strong point of the tent is the ventilation   the way the rain fly is configured  and because of the small window at the bottom  don t forget to stake it  we had great airflow   other our our crew mates had tents with flys covering top to bottom and weren t able to enjoy the nice breezes like we did one thing   the door always  always  always fall into the tent immediately   if it s wet  your tent is then wet   and the little flap over the zipper catches often   coleman  redesign this door       
374,5.0,                       bought this to set up in the living room to occupy and entertain small kids during the pandemic when there was too much cold and snow outside this spring  it is extremely lightweight   we ve taken it up and down the stairs several times  and the kids can move it around effortlessly  we have not had it outside yet  but slept an adult and two small kids comfortably in the living room  zippers are durable  as they ve stood the test of toddler hands for months of continuous zipping and unzipping      
375,5.0,                       purchased this tent due to the low price  my youngest son had never been tent camping  he has only experienced it in a camper  so we though we should share the experience with him  took the tent up cache la poudre river in colorado  the tent was easy to set up  even in the wind and sprinkling  it is great in the warmer weather  but due to the tall inner height  and the vent below it got pretty cold when the temp dropped down to   f  lucky for us we had a tarp to cover the vent  and good sleeping bags  overall the tent is a great buy for the price  and ease of set up  there was plenty of room for my wife  my son  myself  our   dogs  and still had room for gear  we will be using this tent throughout the summer for sure      
376,5.0,                       my boyfriend and i are new to camping and we wanted a reasonably priced beginner s tent  so we purchased this one  it s great  three people might be a tight fit  but it s perfect and roomy for just us two  there was plenty of room above our heads so we could sit and talk comfortably  there s plently of ventilation on the inside so it doesn t get too stuffy  i also like the loop on the ceiling where you can hang your lantern at night  it s super simple to put together  we set it up in the backyard so we could practice putting it together before our trip  there is a   minute youtube video that was really helpful  it honestly only took maybe    minutes for us to set it up  for our very first time putting a tent together ever  it was also just as easy to break down and pack it up  this tent is super sturdy if you insert the spikes correctly  a tip from my dad was to insert the spikes diagonally  a     angle  towards the tent  make sure you pull the corners tight  and you have yourself a windproof tent  we didn t experience any rain in the chihuahuan desert in july  so i can t speak for it s waterproofness  however  this tent is exactly what i was looking for  especially for the price  i m very happy with this purchase  highly recommend as a beginner s tent for two people  when the time is right for marriage and starting a family  i do plan on investing in a larger more expensive tent      
377,4.0,                       i m quite small  and i set this up in under    minutes  the reinforcements keep the rain out  all hardware is included  which is great  i like that the poles securely attach by pins at the feet instead of by the pockets at the corners  the air flow is great the only thing i didn t like is the multiple tiny splinters i got from the poles  i have never experienced this with a tent pole before  it was frustrating to have to dig splinters out of my hands and fingers after setting up the tent      
378,5.0,                       well  we used it for a week of camping  we set it up and took it down   times on our trip and slept in it all   nights  my impression is that it s a solid summer tent  we used the rain cover or whatever it s called  it provided privacy and seemed to hold in a bit of the warmth  we camped in weather that got down to near    for the first   days  which felt almost too cold in the tent with our summer sleeping bags  but the rest of the trip only got down into the high fifties at night and that felt good to us  i like this style of tent  which seems to be the way everything is made now  with the supports being only on the outside of the tent  no complaints  great value at      the only reason i might hesitate to take my review super seriously is because we haven t used it for very long      
379,5.0,                       we recently used it for one night camping  it took about    mins to set up end to end   including putting stakes   it can hold a queen bed and can sleep   comfortably  i can t imagine how it can be a   person tent  because there was no place for  th person  i wouldn t know what bed would fit   people  the pouches helped us to hold our things  has a hook for the fan  couldn t test it s weather resistant feature as it wasn t raining  it has easy to use zips  overall a good one      
380,5.0,                       this tent is definitely on the more inexpensive side in comparison with other tents which is great for anyone interested in trying out camping  setting this up is relatively easy  much easier with two people  and can be ready in roughly    minutes  i ended up not needing it but the rain fly is great to have in the event that you get some unexpected showers  only downside to this tent is the low quality stakes  however these can be found elsewhere for relatively cheap  i would also recommend purchasing a tarp to put underneath the tent to protect the bottom and prolong the life of your tent      
381,4.0,                       i love this tent its definitely a small      person tent  but it s good quality  i enjoy that you can take the top off and just see the stars through the netting on summer nights   it s light and easy to carry with my pack when backpacking  and very easy to set up   overall  i enjoyed this tent  i wish it was slightly bigger  but it s big enough to sleep two people and two dogs  semi comfortably  however  it is a tight squeeze  the material is nice  the cover does protect from the rain  and it is a good quality tent      
382,5.0,                       we bought the four person tent because we had our grandson with us for his very first camping trip the tent was easy to set up  light weight to handle and plenty of room for the three of us   i will say that had it been four adults we would have been sleeping bag to sleeping bag  but   would fit   just no wiggle room well as luck would have it  at    pm all snuggled down  we had a   hour electrical storm that dumped   inches of rain   not one drop came in anywhere   when i stepped out at midnight to check the rest of our gear  the water was up one inch on the ground very worthwhile purchasing      
383,5.0,                       we absolutely love the tent  it is what you would expect out of a coleman product  well made and dependable  for the price it s hard to beat the quality and performance of this tent  i would definitely recommend pros qualityexcellent weatherproofing  have not had an issue excellent airflow  hard to beat at this price roomy for a   person tentgreat durabilitycons not heavy by any means  but not an ultralight backpacking tent  in other words a little on the heavy side for a serious hike and camp scenario  although definitely doable  this tent is better suited for the campground      
384,4.0,                       i am only giving   stars at this time as i really need to see it rained upon before i can give a more thorough assessment  i have set it up   times  and i have been camping three times in the month since i have gotten it  i have had no problems with it at this time  the setup is fairly quick and straightforward  this size tent should be good for two people with some gear  if you were to put a queen size mattress in this tent  then i imagine that there would not be much room for your gear  however  this would probably not be a bid deal since you are probably using this for car walk in camping  the advertisement says that it is good for backpacking  but you would have to carry this tent the entire time due to its size  and it would get old at some point do understand that there will not be as much airflow with this tent as with others  it has a mesh roof  on two sides  and mesh windows on two sides  but the walls are fabric  the benefit to this design is that you get much more privacy  i am camping in texas  and i have been able to sleep fairly comfortably one general tip for this tent is to make sure not to drag the ends of your tent poles on the ground too much  they are open for you to attach to the tent  and they can get debris in them so it makes it hard to attach to the little metal rods on the tent  you will understand once you get it      
385,2.0,                       so  i must say i was loving my tent  it holds up well to winds  hail and multiple downpours  honestly the rain seeped through the bottom corners a little  but thats better than coming through the top  the second time i was putting up the tent it ripped a nice big hole out of no where  i was shocked since it is literally the second time being used  the first pic is me happy my first time around  the other pictures show it ripped where the strap attach to the pole  the strap ripped as well thats why i put duct tape on it to get me through my trip  i must admit i am not impressed with the durability of the material after this      
386,4.0,                       i love my coleman tent  i use it mostly for cat camping as it is a little too heavy for backpack  i would recommend this for summer camping not because of the rain but for the cold    i live in a very cold and windy area and in the night we might get to   c  about    f   even when using a winter sleeping bag and good insulation in the floor you still get cold  you will feel the wind in your face and trust me  you won t have a great night  other than that  i love  i ll use it anytime i go camping to warmer areas  is cheap  reliable and waterproof      
387,3.0,                       we took this out on our first camping trip together and it performs great in dry and breezy weather  it holds up well in scattered light to moderate showers as long as the sun comes out occasionally to dry the surface  there was one day and evening where it rained steadily with some moderate pours  in this case the tent struggled to keep water out  we ended up with a small but manageable puddle in one corner  it does keep the bugs out quite well  not once did we have an issue  it also ventilates nicely which is a plus in warmer months  i suggest using this as a strict summer tent and would avoid monsoon season      
388,5.0,                       easy set up with the help of friends  roomy enough to keep all my essentials in the tent with me  i brought a twin size air mattress  but my queen would have fit  just not much room for other items  several friends had their tents collapse in a bad storm  but mine stayed up and dry  would highly recommend this  just not for   people unless two are very tiny  like most tents  the door zipper was tricky  so you might want to run a wax candle around it to facilitate smooth zipping  very happy with this tent      
389,1.0,                       we purchased two of these tents november          we had used them maybe   times since  we always rake the area and put a trap down  we also always sweep the floor and wipe the tent down prior to packing it up ensuring it is packed dry  point being the floors are worn out  we are only in the tent at night to sleep  the tents have only been set up on sand or grass areas  never on roots or rocks the tents are waterproof and easy to set up  the zippers and seems are holding up well and haven t shown any signs of wear i love the tents but i m very disappointed in the quality of the floor material  i wouldn t buy again      
390,5.0,                       great tent worked great for   adults and toddler and we all used a cot  i wouldn t suggest it for cold weather just because of the venting in it  we saw lots of people with this tent in the campsite  extremely easy to put up with two people or just one we stayed in northern indiana fall halloween weekend about   ish at night      
391,5.0,                       very cheap  but the quality is just fine   comes in a nice zipper bag  not incredibly small or light  but i guess it could work for backpacking if you put it in a lighter bag  it says it is for   people  but they would have to be really close friends to make that work   great for two  sets up easily   great value  this is a two or three season tent   do not do winter camping with this one   great for hot nights   lots of ventilation  stood up to some wind  too      
392,1.0,                       this is only for summer camping  there are literally   open sides on this tent  do not get if it will be cold where you are camping  we had to drape blankets over the tent which caused it not to vent properly and made it wet inside  easy set up and a decent amount if space but a stupid design in my opinion     
393,4.0,                       we purchased this tent so that my husband could stand up and not have to crouch while in the tent  we used it on a week long trip and had no issues  it rained and everything stayed dry  we have not tested it in a thunder storm with heavy wind rain but we are satisfied so far  i was concerned with some of the negative reviews about the sturdiness of the poles but we had no issues  we have multiple tents in varying sizes from r different activities and we were completely satisfied with this one      
394,4.0,                       fairly easy to pitch  works best with two people  ventilates well and the front door flap is easy to use  zipper did get caught every other opening and closing  but didn t rip or tear and was easy to back out  roomy enough for two men and two cots with plenty of room to spare  side pockets held all the pocket items we had  bottom is a little thin if you are on gravel or other bumpy terrain  we used a tarp for extra protection  breaks down and folds well into the provided bad  no rain or inclement weather during our trip  with a camp fan it stayed well cooled and ventilated      
395,5.0,                       great little tent for car camping  it is rather small  i had to sleep diagonal to keep from bumping into the walls i am        i would recommend caution for anyone over   ft  and those trying to fit two people  while two people could definitely fit in  it would be very cramped  very water resistant  it rained pretty heavily one night  but nothing inside got wet  i was unable to take the time to dry it out before putting it away  and that evening when i took it out  most of it was still rather damp  however when i set it up the inside was dry  and even though it rained again the night  i stayed dry and warm   the door is a couple inches above the base  making it more water proof  but also kind of a struggle to get in and out without getting mud dirt on yourself or inside the tent  i used a base tarp under the tent  because that is how i was taught to camp   but you def  don t need one      
396,5.0,                       quality product  delivered quickly with zero drama   hope to buy from you again some day   this is my motorcycle camping tent   have used it twice in first month   easy to put up  after the initial assembly procedure   very clear and convenient instructions   seams are already sealed   this is a very good tent for the money spent   more money can only buy you a larger rain fly  which is already big enough   i plan to buy its   person bigger brother too   the   wallet keys glasses bags are particularily useful   storage bag is expandable if you add stuff to your tent kit   i use this   person tent for me to sleep with my motorcycle equipment securely next to me      
397,5.0,                       loved this  these   great for beginning campers like us  we just used once so far for backyard camping and hope to do more at actual campsites  was a warm summer evening in the   s f and ventilation was excellent  fits   adults and   kid comfortably    adults would be too cozy for us  but we re just beginners  accidentally ordered   tents and will happily keep the extra for kid    when he comes  a tent for the kids and a tent for the adults would be great  not that we are not backpack campers at this point      
398,1.0,                       the door zipper broke on the first day it was used   not sure what to fix it with   unfortunately  i am wilderness camping for the next two months anyone know what size double zippper the tent door takes please help  darn mosquitoes other than that zipper  it is a nice lightweight tent that only took    minutes to set up the first time  suggestion  buy yourself some quality tent pegs before you go camping with this tent   the tent stakes that came with the tent are worthless   oh  and make sure the zipper for the front door works  don t be like me who s out in the middle of nowhere stuck with a door that can t be zipped up      
399,1.0,                       good thing i test pitched my new tent the day before i left on my campout  or i wouldn t have known that one whole pole was missing  and the other two have limp  floppy elastic that lets the segments fall apart  the tent only included one of the two main poles  the rain fly pole  and two random loose pole segments with only one metal connector each   no idea whether the tent has other good qualities  since i had to leave it at home and use a different tent      
400,5.0,                       this was a total sleeper  i bought it for a good price  decided to do a test  i set it up in my back yard and left it there for a month under some maple trees  i did use a tarp for a ground cloth  it does have a bathtub floor by the way  it held up no problem  through rain small branches wind bugs  i did not expect these great results  i just found out you can get good gear without the high price  well done coleman      
401,4.0,                       i just used this brand new tent to camp for four nights and i m a new ish camper  i did   night at one campground and   at another  it is very easy to put up  note the fabric instructions have two sides and the instructions for the rain fly or kind of hidden  you ll need it   i was very close to the ocean the first night and there was a great deal of condensation in the morning  to my newbie surprise   the tent pegs or stakes are very cheap  they bend easily  and don t hold that well  they also turn in place by themselves so whereas they were holding the tent down fine in one corner  one side was out when i went to take it down i couldn t fold the tent compact enough to get everything inside the box after i took it down  i ll tackle that at a park  since i live in a condo and don t have a yard i couldn t stand up in it  but i think all tents of this size are the same  i saw more at a store today   it is not a three person tent unless it s a couple and a child  there was enough room for a queen sized blowup bed with about a foot or more left on one side  the tent was very easy to assemble and take down i think i ll move on to bigger tents after this and save this for emergencies or for a friend      
402,5.0,                       bought this after doing some research on a     person tent  i already have a coleman and have had great experiences with their products it was very easy to set up and breakdown and plenty of room  it may be a bit crowded for four people    kids maybe ok  but it was comfortable for two people  we kept all our gear inside the tent the airflow wa wonderful as it was nice and cool considering it was high    s low    s during the day  at night  it was high    s and it was fairly warm inside  i do have a great pad and sleeping bag  for the price  the workmanship  size and ease to setup breakdown  this is a great buy      
403,5.0,                       i ve had this tent for a couple of years now and i have enjoyed using it during my camping trips   it fits three small adults comfortably and it is very easy to set up  i have stayed dry in this tent even in windy and wet conditions  i really like the two mesh pockets on the inside of the tent to store small things like glasses and keys  it is a little bulky so probably not ideal for backpacking purposes  but it definitely is possible to backpack with  this tent if you separate the tent from the poles  and have two people transport it     
404,5.0,                       we used this tent for a week long camping trip in rainy south wales  i went over all the seams with brush on seam sealer and emptied a can of scotchgard heavy duty water shield onto the tent before use  i also cut a footprint for it out of some thick plastic sheeting that i bought at a hardware store  we did not actually test it before our trip  but luckily  the tent performed flawlessly  this is a good sized tent for two adults and a lot of gear  especially for a  low end  tent  this thing rocks  would definitely buy it again  if i had it to do over again      
405,2.0,                       small is an understatement for this tent  the description assures that it will fit a queen sized air mattress  and that is literally the only thing it can fit  i m      and my feet and head touched the sides of the tent as i slept  if you do attempt to fit a queen sized air mattress in it  be prepared for the tent to hardly be able to zip  this tent might be ideal if you don t camp using air mattresses and if you re the only person who s going to be using it      
406,5.0,                       we ve only camped with this tent once so far  but it rained steadily for one of the days we camped  with a serious downpour in the afternoon  the tent stayed nice and dry  note that we had sprayed it with two coats of a waterproofing spray prior to use   we had a queen sized air mattress inside  which didn t leave much room for gear  but we leave most everything in our van anyway  hopefully the tent will hold up  but we had a good experience with it the first go around      
407,5.0,                       very spacious tent  great for summer camping  easy set up  it fits two comfortably and it would fit   if you literally all sardined on the floor which i don t recommend  as a woman that likes her space  i bought this because i m        and tend to overpack  it was perfect  this thing withstood strong desert winds and the pacific coast during two of my field schools and is still a very reliable tent  it was a bargain  but i will say  i probably would check the weather next time i take it out on an excursion just because you don t benefit from the open ness of the tent when you re waking up in    degree weather with a windchill that made you wish for sweet death   i only speak from experience   this tent is great for the summer and it s pretty durable  it gets the job done  it also fits a cot in case some of you were wondering      
408,1.0,                       im currently in the tent l with my   yr old on his first camping trip and rain is coming in   points  we will buy different tent for next trip would be great with no rain   but can t control that     
409,5.0,                       i ve had a coleman sundome for the past    years  and just barely had to replace it this year with this newer model  when we get to camp my husband goes and gets firewood and i am responsible for setting up camp  tent  sleeping bags  etc  i can easily set up the sundome by myself in less than    minutes  this says   person  but we use it as a couple and have plenty of room for our air mattress  sleeping bags  and all carry bags  is fairly resistant to both wind and rain  my only wish would be perhaps   more inches in depth so you dont have to come in on the side as to not step on your bed      
410,5.0,                       this tent was so easy to put together and just as easy to take down  we never made it to our camping trip but we did put the tent up in the living room  we had it up all weekend and it was super comfy  we got the   person tent for   people and we had plenty of room  we were able to fit our air mattress in there with couch cushions for extra added comfort  we added the lights for ambience  which made for a super cute and romantic weekend at home      
411,4.0,                       i got this on sale  and it s great for what i paid  it s huge    x   footprint and i could stand up inside  easy  classic two pole setup  one person can set it up  but it s a breeze with   people  i always appreciate having somewhere on the ceiling to hang a lantern as well the best part is the ventilation  many tents often sacrifice ventilation for better weatherproofing  the screened sides  vent  plus the windows provide excellent ventilation even with the rain fly on  the rain fly is also designed well to provide ventilation without sacrificing cover  it didn t rain on my trip  so i can t comment on how rain proof it actually is otherwise  though      
412,4.0,                       to start    i like coleman and have had many coleman products  i chose the   person tent because i m a bigger fellow and i didn t want to crush my wife     with that in mind  could it be a little lighter in the weight department  also maybe even packaged in say a compression bag    maybe  rain fly    well like some other reviews stated    it s a bit on the small side  it s ok for letting in the breeze  but i m not too sure about rainy weather    i ll have to get back to you on that note  but honestly  living  in florida  i m looking forward to being able to find out      
413,5.0,                       i love this tent  i purchased it five years ago and i have zero complaints  the setup is a breeze and i frequently do it by myself  it s very well made and has held up perfectly  have had zero leaks and it s been through a fair share of hard storms  it s more like a   person tent   but that s pretty standard for all tents  i appreciate the height inside as it allows me to stand up when changing clothes  lots of ventilation so airflow is good if it s hot outside      
414,3.0,                       not sure who is deciding how many people can sleep in a tent  but this tent  rated for    barley fit the   of us  big enough for a full small queen blow up mattress and thats about all the space you have  a little room to one side of you push it all the way over over all the tent it cheap but works  did the job for this trip  id buy some different tent steaks i did  and if your tall im       the front over hang comes down pretty low and you have to duck down quite a bit to get in and dont plan to stand up straight in it   ft peak inside like i said  cheap but will do the job if in a pinch  which i was  id say  save your pennies and buy something better bigger taller      
415,5.0,                       i did not grow up camping  i had never pitched a tent before buying this one  i had no idea which brands made the best tents    i was going into the purchase blind  i researched and read reviews all over amazon because i didn t want to spend tons of money on something i might not use much  again  i ve only just started camping  but i didn t want something that would leak or tear either this  tent  is  perfect  by way of my needs  i hit the jackpot  i was able to pitch it  including the rain fly  in under    minutes  with literally zero prior tent pitching experience  it survived three days of heavy downpour with a bone dry interior  and it is the perfect size for me and my dog to go camping together  i am in love with this tent    easy to pack it up into its carrying case  which  if i get into backpacking  will be highly beneficial for newbies and experienced campers alike  this tent is a winner   cannot beat this price for this quality      
416,4.0,                       we ve had this tent for almost   years  i figured i d finally do a review   we use it     times a year pros  airy spacious door can be a screen door   pockets and hanger to hang up a flashlight and put all your necessities in the side pockets the door is pretty big and easy to climb in and out of there is a good amount of space at the end of a queen mattress to put your stuff holds   queen mattresses option to take the rainfly off and sleep under the stars doormat  kind of helps  it keeps some of the sand out of the tent but don t expect it to be amazing  it s just plastic  directions were sewn inside the bag so they weren t lost from season to season  felt sturdy  i didn t feel like it was going to blow over in the wind cons  the side windows are always open  rain  sleet  or cold  those windows are always open with just the rainfly to keep the cold air out    height interior is    in the absolute middle  then it quickly slopes and is no longer comfortable to stand in  even for a    petite woman   person is a big stretch   even without mattresses  more than   people are smushed   the last   people have to sleep at the feet of the first    which means climbing on someone s sleeping bag and no place to store your stuff   this requires two adults to put the rainfly on   everything else can be done with an adult and an   year old  an adult is needed for the rainfly   it is not the easy up and down they claim it to be   i m     i ve told my kids they can go camping with me when it s just the   of us once they re    when i know they are tall enough to get the rainfly on  i m not sure if i did it wrong  but i could not get the rainfly cords to stake down tight   at one point the side corrds were flapping in the breeze  when we set it up initially in our backyard  there was a bad storm and it leaked   i had already put seam sealer on it so i m not sure where it was leaking   was it coming in from the windows or was it coming up from underneath   it was a bad storm  we got about    of water and it came down in sheets so who knows if it would have leaked in a normal rainstorm   that said   years later when out camping  there was hail and heavy rain and winds  found out there was a tornado not far away   the tent stayed dry  in one piece  and we made it out dry and alive side note  just so you know  those windows in the front and back   yes you can see into the tent from outside   be sure to close them when you re getting dressed   the people next to us may have gotten an  unwanted  show  to get the tent back into the very small bag  fold it in    s  roll it tightly  squish the air out and hope your hands are strong enough to keep it held in a small roll   it didn t look as pretty but it did fit on a night that it dropped into the low    s  i used this with a sleeping bag rated for       degree weather  wearing light pants and light long sleeves  lightweight cotton   the openness of the tent letting in the cool breeze and damp made me cold   it was great for keeping the tent cool during the day but how often do you go into your tent during the day i would definitely recommend it for a family of    not        
417,5.0,                       camped in this tent for a total of     days all together    different trips  this tent has survived high winds in hood river  wind surfing capital in oregon  and rain on the beach  didn t get wet at all when it rained all day the first day  night we stayed at the beach and slept in the tent  tent is durable and has not ripped or got any tears that i can see  tent is small and only fits me and my boyfriend  we couldn t bring stuff in our tent like clothes or backpack just because it take up too much room in the small cozy tent  it s perfect for a couple e and my boyfriend upgraded our tent to a   person colman now  great value for your money      
418,5.0,                       got this for a camping festival  and for as cheap as it was  it was amazing  set it up in two seconds  it was a   person tent and had three people in there with plenty of room  i wouldn t put   people in there though expecting to fit your belongings  it sleeps four perfect but there s not room for anything else  lasted in the wind and super light weight  definitely recommend  didn t rain while i used it but it s perfect for camping festivals  i put a tarp under the tent to keep moisture leaking through the bottom     
419,5.0,                       i love coleman products     it s like affordability and quality had a child  and named it coleman   sure  there may be better fancier tents  but this second home of mine has gone through the desert heat  joshua tree  grand canyon  zion   snow  june lake ca   perfect weather  yosemite  mammoth lakes   rain  and it has held up beautifully since        i bought the   person tent  and it held true   i love this tent  and i will keep using it until it is no longer usable  a lot of awesome memories with this tent      
420,5.0,                       me and my wife simply love this product  we are new to camping and bought this product from amazon for our first ever camping trip  we understood the real worth of this product in the second night of our camping itself  when we were caught in a severe thunderstorm situation  we were worried if this tent is going to hold good or not  but not only it saw us through that night but kept everything inside absolutely dry  next morning  when others around us in the camping ground had some terrible stories to share about how their tent gave up under severe weather conditions   we were in all smiles as we knew we made the right choice by buying this product  i would say it is a perfect tent for      yes    if you prefer little space inside your tent after you put down your queen twin size sleeping mattress  it is quite easy to carry  pack  install and unpack too  we are looking forward to make more camping memories with this great product      
421,4.0,                       we love the tent  however one of the big tent poles broke the one time we used it  the rubber connect inside of it snapped  never had that happen before  disappointed  the size is really perfect for two people  maybe three  it would not work well for    it would be pretty cramped  you can stand up in it and it s designed really well  i put it up by myself in less then    minutes  very easy to put up and take down  i think the pole breaking was a fluke     
422,5.0,                       temper your expectations a little bit  and this is a really good tent  i bought this for car camping  and it works well  it s reasonably light and easy to carry  setup and teardown once you know what you re doing take    minutes  and it stands up to weather reasonably well  i took it for a trial run a couple of weekends ago when we had a nice storm front blow through  and we didn t get wet at all  the rainfly kept everything nice and dry  and we stayed pretty comfortable if you plan to take this anywhere with a lot of wind  buy better stakes  the ones included are your basic steel shepherd s crook style pegs  they work fine for light duty work  but if you want something that will keep everything in place under harsher conditions  spend the extra     to buy the y shaped style of stake if you end up using this tent a lot  go ahead and invest in a spray on tent sealant  it doesn t need it too much right off the bat but after a few uses  it would probably leak under heavy rain also  as with every tent s capacity  a   person tent assumes you are very comfortable spooning for the whole night  my wife  myself  and two dogs all comfortably fit in this tent  even with us both using air mattresses  three people using backpacking pads and sleeping bags would be comfy  four people would be a tight squeeze      
423,5.0,                       nice family tent  however moisture does get in easily  easy to set up and take down one person can  but it s so easy with two   we ve used it twice  once camping in a state park and once in our back yard  we got a little damp at the state park  if you are guaranteed a clear night sleeping without the rain flap you can have fun watching the stars and even catch some nice breezes      
424,5.0,                       it is so hard to buy a tent   i read so many reviews that my eyes started to cross    it seems like just as soon as i make up my mind on something i see a review so bad that makes me think  hmm    what else is out there    i finally just decided that this tent fit my needs   i bought it primarily for camping alone  i have an   person for use with others  and i wanted something easy and quick to set up  again alone    i also wanted to be able to fit the cot i bought inside   this tent fit my needs perfectly and the price was good   and wonder upon wonders i can actually fit it back in the bag when i put it away   that is honestly a first for me        
425,5.0,                       one of the best tents i have owned in my life  i knew going into it when it said   person that it was more for two adults and two kids which it is so if your looking for a tent for   adults  you may want to go for a   person tent or plan on getting  close   for us this tent was perfect   my wife and i took it with us on our weekend away and it worked fantastic with a queen soundasleep air mattress which we also bought here  great buy   the combination of the two was awesome  the tent set up in no time  has plenty of venting  door is nice  even has a mat for the entrance  the poles and stakes worked great  packs away nicely  everything feels pretty rugged  maybe be gentle with the main door zipper as that seemed a little worrisome going around the corners but even that was not a big concern of ours  i think this tent will last us a long time even when we go away with our littlest kids  our friends we camped with actually want to borrow it on their next camping outing so they can see if they want to buy one as well      
426,1.0,                       i just used this tent for the first time after buying it on prime day  thought i was getting a deal   it is made very poorly  with substandard materials  the stitching has threads all along the zipper  which caused constant hang ups and getting stuck  i truly believe that this tent was made for the intent of being  disposable    i can t see it lasting a whole summer  much less years  the only reason i bought it  is because my tent of decades was just to big for camping solo  i do not recommend this tent for camping  it might be fun to have for kids in the backyard for about   hours  but not for outdoor trips  very  very disappointed      
427,5.0,                       wow   coleman has come a long way in their   man tents since i used one in the late     s   bought this for my kids campout to go along with them   others in the camp brought monster tents with fans   this baby kept very cool due to the ground level vent   rd photo  white flap  which captures ground air movement and funnel up and out through the vents      minutes to setup first time  stakes aren t really necessary unless for setup but clearly help the runoff  had       of rain at  am    i did coat the seams with coleman seam sealer  though  on advice of others   can t go wrong      
428,4.0,                       i ve not been able to thoroughly put this tent through the motions and will update as i progressively use it  i purchased the   person tent strictly due to the value while it was on sale  i will say that it won t sleep   adults comfortably and still have room for your gear inside  so if you have   people to sleep in it just know that all your camping gear will be left outside to the elements  as for the quality it seems like it will hold up and i believe that it will be a good purchase      
429,3.0,                       bought this tent for a camping trip and was impressed with how easy it was to set up and take down  one thing we didn t realize when we bought it was that there are two netted windows that have no zipper closer on top  its not a problem for privacy or rain since they are covered by the rainfly but it does mean on cold nights you have less protection from the wind and cold  i could also see rain getting in if there was a bad storm the   person tent is really roomy and being short  just over  ft   i could stand up in the middle  we loved the amount of pockets for all your stuff on the inside      
430,3.0,                       got this unfortunately more than    days ago for a week long motorcycle camping trip  setting up camp for the second night and the screen portion on the door rips out  i ve been camping forever and have other coleman tents which is why i bought this one thinking it would at least last the week  wrong   if you ever set up a dome style tent before you won t have any problems getting this one set up  takes maybe ten minutes for one person  had some light mist and heavy winds and see the first night and with a tarp grind clothe it stayed dry  i wouldn t purchase it again based on the rip      
431,4.0,                       great basic tent    two person sleep tent  or for me  a one person tent with plenty of room for my gear so it stays dry on rainy days   and last night we had a storm  winds blowing a good sustained        mph    held up like a champ    small leak at bottom of zipper  had to put a towel down  could be a problem for two sleepers  but handled ok as a one sleeper   stay out of tent on hot days  you ll roast   sealed nicely  keeps the bugs out   overall  it s a great tent for the price      
432,5.0,                       i m not a big camper and rarely go camping  i decided to buy it because renting   person tent in rei costs a half of the price of this item  so far i used it three times and have zero complaints  easy to install and lightweight  i don t think it will last very long  but i already have proven the financial benefits of buying it and pretty happy with the outcome  recommend to everyone who doesn t have very high expectations      
433,4.0,                       i bought the   person tent for my son  i knew that realistically   people would never sleep in such a small tent  but i assumed it would be more than large enough for just one  he had to turn his twin sized air mattress diagonally to fit  and at      he was not entirely comfortable  although i should have bought the larger size  the tent is easy to set up and lightweight  i treated the tent and rain fly with camp dry before our trip  and everything stayed dry through two nights of rain      
434,4.0,                       this tent is great for summer and warm spring fall camping   the sides under the fly are screen only up to the top  so lots of ventilation   we could stand up easily in it  and hung a light from the center for the evenings   i had a hard time with the bottom of the door being so high up  you have to step over it to get in  which i d appreciate more on a rainy camping trip   set up easily  and packed away just as easily  since the bag is extra large   coleman knows you can t get it back to original pack size  and makes extra room for that      
435,5.0,                       this is the first tent i ve owned  and i went with the coleman brand because i m familiar with the name and it had many positive reviews   i ve used it for one camping weekend so far  and it didn t let me down   fortunately the weather was perfect  so i didn t have to test the water resistance  but it was simple to put up and felt sturdy   glad i went with the   person size  because it was large enough for a   person air mattress plus room for our things inside   i would buy this tent again      
436,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this tent saved my boyfriend and i on a camping trip that went completely awry  for info  this was the first time for both of us camping on our own  first time using this tent  and we camped in june at bennett spring  mo for   nights  it is very compact for travel         x      and i was able to get it back in the bag upon take down  setting the first time took about       minutes  take down less than     i was surprised to find such a cheap tent with coleman s name on it  and it was worth every penny i ll start with the not so great things  first and foremost  the style of the tent has the corners pulled so taught when it is set that there are teeny tiny needle point sized holes in the corners  it lets in nothing but rain  but even then it s not that much  i ll touch on that when i get to the good things  also  the zipper protector is completely necessary and helpful  it can just be a huge pain because it gets snagged and caught in the zipper a lot  i was able to stand up almost completely in the center of the tent  i m a little more than     but my boyfriend could not  we did not use an air mattress  but there was plenty of room still with the pool floaties we slept on  a huge sterilite container  our box fan  and more  speaking of our box fan  the weather was complete garbage on our trip  it was hot  the heat index got up to      this tent has tons of ventilation  even a little vent in the bottom on the back  we definitely needed the box fan any time we spent more than     minutes in the tent  and it was going all night  one of the nights did get down to     and i was shivering  so it s safe to say that this is not a flaw of the tent  just more of a tip for fellow campers  when it s hot  it s hot i will now begin raving about this tent  our first night  we got severe thunderstorms and torrential downpour for almost eight hours straight  we stayed completely dry   i was convinced that it was going to leak or at least start seeping through the walls eventually  but it didn t  some water did get through the aforementioned corners  but i was able to use a hand towel to dry it up and the towel was still mostly dry  very impressive  the next day  the tent had a few hours to dry in the sun before more severe weather came through  after the previous night  we didn t want to be around for it  so we left camp for the afternoon  more torrential downpour  this time tornadic weather  so there was a lot of very strong winds  in all seriousness  this storm literally took down a tree and several branches on the campground campus  but not our tent    out of   steaks  all but one was torn out of the ground  and the tent had been shoved forward about   foot and was leaning about    degrees forward  the tent was easy to set up  we did do a full trial run before leaving   but the very rocky missouri soil made it extremely difficult to get the steaks in well at the campsite  the one steak that was in the ground still was the one we were actually able to get in well  so i can t say if the steaks were ripped out strictly because of wind  or if they were set more poorly than we thought  i would still recommend different  stronger steaks  because the ones that come with are flimsy  i purchased   msr groundhog steaks that we used on our tarp underneath and they were unphased by the storms  needless to say  all our stuff inside was safe and dry       the corners did their infamous leak again  but i dried it up just the same as last time  and then we reset the tent in the dark by flashlight    no poles broken  nothing ripped  no leaks that weren t the corners  i will add that we used those interlocking foam mats on the floor of our tent to make it a little more comfy  and upon pulling them up when we were leaving  there was moisture that we are assuming was from the corners  but don t know for sure  we were on a very slight downhill  and the moisture was only under a small portion of the front three mats  thinking it was just the water from the corners rolling forward  everything else was fine and dry i have photos of it set  but have to post them later  i am including a video of the storm from inside during the first night  i know that being in a tent amplifies how rain sounds  but it was truly as bad as it sounds in the video edit to add  we did no waterproofing on our tent      
437,3.0,                       at first impression  this tent was really nice  its roomy and tall that i dont have to slouch too far down when im in it  my daughter is   and just loves to play camping at our backyard  one day  i was disassembling it and the pole made a hole on the canopy as i tried to remove it  so disappointed  the seam is compromised and the whole can get bigger easily after that  cant seem to find a replacement specifically for it  no answer from customer service yet      
438,1.0,                       i will say this is a well designed  functional tent that when up has a lot of storage and room for   smaller individuals  unfortunately my poor rating is reflective of the durability of this tent  or lack thereof  on it s second use  over the course of just    months  seams have failed in   separate spots leading to water intrusion with some moderate rain  surprisingly  only a    month warranty here folks  what a waste  no thanks coleman      
439,5.0,                       good tent  easy to set up  even in the dark campground  lots of mesh for air flow  will be great in summer  but i woke up to    f one oct  morning and didn t want to leave my sleeping bag   ever i wish there were a few more places  loops or pockets  inside for hanging or attaching the bits i take along  i can probably amend that by sewing in an extra thing or two door s upper half screen  or not  is great for privacy but i wish i could look out without sitting up i managed to blow up a twin air mattress in just less than half of the space of this   person tent  made for extremely comfortable camping      
440,4.0,                       for the price  this is a fabulous tent  we used it on a kayak trip and it was light enough to take in the boat with gear  my biggest complaint suggestion is to add another door to make it easier for one person to exit in the night without going over the other person  but going back to the price  also the rain flap doesn t give you any vestibules  but going back to the price     great buy  don t regret it  great ventilation as well      
441,4.0,                       this tent may fit   kids but not   adults  honestly i think this is more a single person tent  my teenage daughter and i were not very comfortable in this tent  it fits queen size mattress and not much more  it s too small very basic tent  nothing fancy   i regret not spending more money on better tent  i liked all the mesh windows though   easy to set up     less easy to squeeze that back into the bag      
442,3.0,                       the   man tent is a little cramped for   people  i m      and found my self touching both ends  the rain cover stopped the rain on night one and the side walls leached a little water  however  night   was just heavy dew and the inside walls were soaked by morning and my sleeping bag was damp as if i hadn t had a cover over me  it s probably a great tent for non wet camping for children  but not enough for adults and repeated water applications      
443,5.0,                       i had never set up a tent before and i was really nervous  especially because it was raining and i didn t want to get soaked because i didn t set it up properly   this was so easy  literally anybody could do it  it took about   minutes  it was super roomy for just me  and i think will be nice and cozy next month when my husband and two children join me on another campout  the rain tarp worked well and since i kept the tent zipped at all times  i never had any critters or bugs join me all in all  this was a great buy      
444,4.0,                       easy to assemble and well constructed to boot   i would love to see the size of the four humans who were used in the sizing tests for coleman though   the tent is very open and not suitable for cold temperatures even with the fly installed   my only minor complaint is that water enters the tent when you unzip the main opening because the flap basically falls inside the tent   maybe i ll figure out a way to keep it from happening with more use      
445,5.0,                       was a perfect tent  just enough room for myself and my backpack and a few essentials  the corner seams inside the tent dripped water a little when it rained but i also didn t seam seal it with waterproofer before use so i recommend doing so and i think then it would have been just fine  also the right side inner storage pocket that hangs from the window was dripping a little water as well but again i think it was just because i didn t seam seal it  i would personally recommend this tent  colman is a great brand in my opinion      
446,5.0,                       we loved this tent  it fits two queen mattresses perfectly  we are a family of four  including two children and it was perfect  it s cozy and helps us stay warm  as opposed to huge tents   it was roomy enough to allow four small suitcases as well  perfect purchase  definitely recommend      
447,5.0,                       took the tent on our first camping trip and it was perfect  easy to setup  easy to take down  it s your basic dome tent but my favorite feature was the air flow window at the rear of the text that helped keep the tent cool in the morning when tents tend to become hot and sweaty we didn t experience rain  but based on previous reviews i used seam sealer on all the seams anyways  to make sure it was rainproof and kept us dry  it didn t affect us this time  but the tent definitely did it s job well and  like other coleman products i ve purchased  seems well built i ll update after future use s  and especially after rain  but for now    stars      
448,4.0,                       pros  price is super cheap  but it doesn t feel like a cheap tent  two large doors  lots of ventilation  easy enough to set up and take down  pockets inside are a plus cons  the poles seem less than sturdy  i assume they won t hold up after a year or so  rainfly could be larger and closer to the ground to give a bit extra cover outside of tent  should come with a footprint other  do yourself a favor and rope up the hooks on the four corners of the tent  that way you can stake it in much easier  the metal hooks are useless      
449,1.0,                       i purchased this tent in january of       my daughter and i used it for the first time this past weekend  april        upon disassembling the rain cover i started noticing little holes in the fabric and upon removing the crossover rods i found over   more small holes and tears in the fabric  i am a little disappointed to say the least that after one overnight use this tent is now ready for the trash  very poor construction to say the least      
450,2.0,                       pros   looks good and sets up easy   good in dry warm weather  good airflow  cons   leaks   puddles in corners   would start to get uncomfortable in temps below   f  especially with any wind  remember  good airflow    but you have no option to stop it    not durable in my experience my experience with the coleman sundome   tent i bought this tent so my two kids and i would have more space when car camping  vs   person tent we use backcountry  and to allow the option for a friend or two    as with all tent specs    sleeping bags would cover      of the floor space in this   person tent   i used it on a single   day car camping trip in wv in june   it rained lightly the last day on off for a couple hours with no wind  when we went into the tent to sleep that night we found puddles of a few ounces in each of   corners and just a few drops in the forth corner with the cord access port   very disappointing   the tent was setup correctly with all guy lines and a footprint      smaller than the tent perimeter on all sides  doing this for more than    years    although dry when we broke camp  i set it up at home for a good dry out before storage as i always do upon returning from a camp trip   while evening out the poles in the sleeves after erecting the tent  one of the pole couplers ripped a    gash in a sleeve  i could not find a burr on the coupler    amazon allowed me to return the tent without complaint   great customer service   my sister has two coleman redwood   person tents  they don t sell them anymore  and they have never leaked even under harsh conditions  i am not sure if the quality has gone down on coleman s newer generations tents or         
451,4.0,                       i bought the   person tent for myself and my girlfriend for our camping trip  was easily able to fit a twin size mattress without a problem  while also giving us room to store items in both the side pockets and corners of the tent ended up pouring one night during the trip with some moderate winds  but our tent stayed dry and had no issues  note  we also put a tarp underneath the tent   only thing i d recommend is to buy better tent stakes   ours bent     
452,5.0,                       this is a great tent  the materials are all high quality  and everything fits very neatly into the carrying case once it s rolled back up  the bathtub design is so great  i don t think i could go back to a tent that doesn t have it  the thing that i m most impressed by is the super fast setup time  we were able to put it up in a few minutes and take it down even more quickly  i got the   person option  and it was pretty cramped for three adults  it seemed more like a   person tent in retrospect  if i were to order again  i would definitely go for the   person option  as a little extra space would have been nice  other than that  really nothing to complain about      
453,5.0,                       took the   person tent camping in wisconsin and had a variety of weather  the first night was very humid and hot so we did not put the rainfly on the tent  the mesh kept the bugs out and also allowed for a breeze as the windows are very large  the next night  however  it thunderstormed from   pm to  am  before the downpour  i put the rainfly on and hoped for the best  while other at my campsite  in other tents  were soaked the next morning  my partner and i were totally dry  there was a very  very small amount of water in the corner of tent  but that section was literally underwater when we checked in the morning  i can t recommend the tent for the price enough      
454,2.0,                       i bought the   x     person tent hoping it can fit me alone          i measured the widest part at the floor an it is not   feet but is about   feet   inches        at most  when i lay parallel to a wall i touch simultaneously both walls with my feet and my top because at    foot height it s about     good part that i fit after all with no space left and i can lay diagonally     it is not too hard to assemble but easy to do many mistakes while assembling      
455,5.0,                       this tent lived up to all expectations when i took it out this weekend  even though there were only two of us  we did opt to get the three person tent so that we could fit a queen size air mattress in it  the fit was just fine  but i would recommend not getting one of those tall air mattresses  and instead using one of the shorter ones  like     in tall   i think the tall one would not fit  we had about     feet of space on the side  the tent was easy to set up  one thing i would recommend is getting a tarp to put under it to protect the floor of the tent from any damage  we opted to use the rain fly not because of the rain  but because of the temperature  the tent stayed probably    degrees warmer than the outside temperature and we were very comfortable  from what i can tell  the tent is well made and should hold up for a good while      
456,5.0,                       very well made for the price  the instructions aren t great  but once i figured it out and set it up a couple times  i was able to set it up completely on my own in less than    minutes  it fits my air mattress perfectly and makes a good home for the night  it s roomier than i expected  the expandable carrying bag is nice because it is never possible to pack something up as tightly as it came from the manufacturer  it looks really nice too      
457,4.0,                       the tent went through a flash flood and i stayed dry     true to coleman quality  that said i tried this style because i would not have to carry it backpacking  i like that i can stand up inside the tent  something is going on with the floor dimensions and the height that i get floor creep  the tent sides creep up if i do not have holders on the corners inside  yes  i use the stakes  the stakes move  i still consider it a good tent for what i use it for  thx      
458,3.0,                       i used this tent only once at a cub scout overnight  set up was very easy  never rained so i can t tell how it would hold up there the roof ventilation netting area is very large  i am assuming that it is made for very warm climates  as the name would suggest  i paid no attention to the name because it came up under a search for a   season tent  and of course  the term  season  is a variable term when climate  geography and topography are considered  the opening is large enough that passers by were stooping and looking in  i figured out a remedy in staking the rain fly close to the tent to pull it tight to the opening i would have been pleased and kept it for summer camping  except that as i was taking it down  i noticed that it had formed a tear along the door zipper about half way up  no one operated it but me and i didn t use it in any improper  aggressive or stressful way  it had been a calm  mild and dry night  but a tent designed for camping in the woods and wilderness shouldn t wilt so easily when faced with even moderate to strong challenges i most definitely didn t want to have to send it back and look for another one i gave   stars because other than the tear it seemed nice  but i suppose that would negate any other good qualities  especially if it rained  and noting that tears only grow larger      
459,5.0,                       tent came as expected  but i will only recommend it for summer time camping    even cold nights during summer you cannot sleep in this tent  we used this during our yellowstone trip during july and the nights were freezing to    f  we did not notice the tent has air net on the top and we were freezing as hell during the nights     had to hide your whole body in the sleeping bags  good thing we had good sleeping bags from costco to prevent freezing to death    installation for the tent was easy  just not recommended for cold summer night use or any weather condition below    f    thanks       
460,3.0,                       overall  the tent is ok  good for   campers if you have   individual pads or   larger air mattress  we were on a   day    night camping trip  and it unfortunately rained a lot  especially at night   after the first night  i noticed that the end of my sleeping bag was pretty damp  away from the vents and the front   i felt that side of the tent and it seemed like water was seeping through the material  the second night had torrential downpour  the rainfly did a really good job  but i woke up during the storm to find my sleeping pad and bag were soaking wet  we could see water was pooling up on the inside wall of the tent pretty bad  i wish i would have taken pictures to show how bad it was  yes  all of the vents and zippers were closed  we knew the storm was going to be bad  so we double checked   from the other reviews i ve read  i don t know if my tent was defective  or the other reviews exaggerated the storms they experienced  but this tent is definitely not waterproof  it s possible that this tent can t handle continued rain  but  the setup was really easy  good venting  so  a good tent if you know it s not going to storm  however  we will be buying a better tent for our next camping trip      
461,4.0,                       setting up  i first set the tent up in my living room by myself and it was pretty easy to do so  a second person definitely helps so they can hold up the polls in the middle of the tent while you are connecting them to the tent  i first used it this past weekend for two nights   the stakes that come with this are not very good at all   they are small and have a flat bottom  we had pretty hard ground and had a stake bend while putting it in  we were able to bend it back  but it is worth buying different stakes rain  it ended up raining on sunday morning and the tent held up very well even with some of our things pushing against the outside of the tent  there was no water or dampness inside the tent size  this says   person tent  but it is usual to half this amount for the true size   for two people  this was adequate   we had a double tall queen air mattress which fit  but since it was double tall  it pushed against the outer tent a little bit   with the air mattress inside  there was still room for our bags  snacks  and a small side table as well as room to change   although  unless you are    tall or less  standing up straight in the tent will not happen packing up   we had to pack the tent while it was wet and still slightly drizzling  but it is quick and easy  the worst part is getting the air out so you can roll it up  but that comes with any tent accessories  the tent has a small ring  not hook  at the top to hang a lantern or other lights  we brought a light meant for under a cupboard and it lit the whole thing up   there are three netted pockets on the sides of the tent to put any loose items in which was very nice   the windows can be opened all the way even in rain as long as the rain isn t coming in sideways  there is a flap on the back that can be staked out and helps with air flow in the tent   the rain cover acts as an illuminator as well  a dim light could even work well enough to light up the whole tent overall  i would recommend this tent for anyone who is looking for something small to use and of high quality      
462,5.0,                       this is our second tent  cabela s lost a customer when their customer service department wouldn t respond to repeated attempts at getting information for new parts for our old tent  so i threw it out  this tent is comfortable  lightweight  waterproof  and held up better than the cabela s off shoot brand  even with windy days  this tent didn t move  we aren t hardcore campers yet  so this is inexpensive enough that we ll get considerable use and not be heartbroken when it s  time to buy a new one      
463,5.0,                       we took this with us for a week long camping trip up to the mn canada border   got down in the    s every night and rained almost every day   we had   single blow up mattresses and all our gear in the tent with plenty of room to spare   you could fit   people comfortably  but   would be too close for comfort   the tent was dry and comfortable every night   we put an   x    tarp down on the ground too as a water  moisture bearer just to be safe   this tent is light weight  folds up into a small carry bag  actually fits back into the bag easily      
464,4.0,                       i like this tent  i have only been camping twice and it was super easy to set up   it does fit exactly two standard sleeping bags and you could throw a couple of small bags in there but it will sit on top of your sleeping bags  there is no extra room because the sleeping bags cover the entire floor of the tent   i think it s worth it if you are car tenting for two and have most of our belongings in the car close by  it did not rain but it did get misty and the tent did feet a bit wet when i touched it from the inside  not sure how it would with hold against rain      
465,5.0,                       just got this tent in the mail and set it up  it really does take    minutes to setup by yourself  half that if you have an extra person  as far as the dimensions  i m a bit skeptical  i m      and when lying in this tent vertically from the door opening  my legs stick out the door up to my knees which is way more than a foot long  but maybe i m measuring something wrong here  i don t know  either way  this tent gets the job done  thanks      
466,5.0,                       beginner camper  i read a lot of reviews on this tent and i don t think you could go wrong  i bought the four person tent and there was plenty of room for me              my stuff  and two    lb dogs  i couldn t stand up at full height but i didn t expect to  setup was easy for one person  it took some effort to get everything back in the bag  again  first timer   i don t recommend it for cooler weather though      
467,4.0,                       i bought this gently used and fulfilled by amazon in case i needed an uncomplicated return  it had been used maybe once and the rain fly seemed unused  so great condition  my       year old helped me set it up in    min on our first trial run  but i could do it in    by myself   however  our first time using it was on a scout camp out and i had to set up the tent in darkness  with the help of two older scouts  we got it done fairly easily considering how dark it was  and how inexperienced i am  it probably took more like    min that night  still  it really is easy to put up and take down when you can see  it s very roomy    we had full and twin inflatable mattresses and plenty of room for our stuff  it s going to be a fantastic summer tent  but that night it got down to    degrees f and it was seriously the coldest night of my life   absolutely miserable  i had even tried to cover one mesh wall with emergency mylar blankets and it didn t help  we had extra moving blankets under and over our sleeping bags  hats on our heads  extra layers of clothing  put the rain fly as close to the walls as possible    cold  cold  cold  i would say    degrees would be the coldest i would sleep in this tent  and even then i d take extra measures to be warm in there  the two mesh walls just aren t designed to hold in warmth  otherwise  we do love it  and i would highly recommend it for camping in milder weather  oh  and a new duffle bag is needed to pack it in  the one it comes in its really small and came with a tear already in the bottom      
468,5.0,                       perfect   love it  bought a year ago and after using twice in the summer  it is a great tent  last year we got thunderstorms every other night and the tent was solid   i use a queen size inflatable mattress and still have enough place to walk around  the ventilation is great  easy to assemble it  myself and my    yrs old daughter did it in less than    minutes   the tent will fit two comfortable  it was me  my daughter and two labs inside  i could stand and walk around and the hook in the middle of the roof is great for a lamp  the zipper for the electrical cord is a plus       
469,5.0,                       for under     this tent is amazing  i ve taken it backpacking many times now and took it for a week in washington  easy set up and not too cumbersome  i managed to also fit a tarp in the bag it comes with too  it holds up in the rain really well if you can lay a tarp under it when setting up  the only issue i had with water was just from condensation but that s with any tent  this thing has been in some pretty heavy rain and i woke up nice and dry  for the price this thing is amazing  highly recommended you will get your moneys worth out of it first trip      
470,5.0,                       my sons first tent       he was able to put things together fast very easy instructions    we had only light rain but nothing leaked in the tent  we did put a tarp down before laying down the tent  with an        year old  it had lots of room even with all there things with them in the tent  can say it would be a little tight with two adults unless you don t mind sleeping very close  with the blue tent and not the green it is a little darker in the tent during the day but not by much  this was very worth the price i haven t had a bad experience with a coleman if you take care of it      
471,5.0,                       first time camper here  i wanted a tent that was spacious and easy to put up by myself   i wish it was a little longer  or wider  because air mattresses and cots are the exact same length width so your feet are always up against the tent   that is my only complaint  i ve taken it camping   times now  and it has no signs of any wear or tear yet   i ve gotten poured on twice and not a drop of water got inside   it s perfect for my dog and me      
472,5.0,                       this tent is great quality  we have mostly used it for warm weather camping  it has also kept us completely dry in the rain which is not always the case with some tents  the tent set up is pretty easy  getting it to stuff back into the bag afterwards is a challenge but manageable  overall great and reliable product  we have had ours for   years and have used it about   times and it still feels like a new product      
473,5.0,                       it was just as easy to set up as i thought  took like    minutes and i have never set up a tent before  it didn t rain while we were camping so we didn t test that part  i really like the little windows and the tarp part on the bottom  color is great too  we had   people sleeping in it and could have comfortably added another without event touching each other  unsure if   people would be very comfortable  excellent birthday gift and good price     
474,5.0,                       this tent is great for the price   i am able to fit my backpacking cot in here as well as my gear   theoretically two people could fit in here but it would be really cozy  and there wouldn t be room for gear   i bought this for desert camping and the short rain   fly doesn t bother me as it mostly acts as a sun shade   the only thing is that if you are taller than say      and plan to use a cot  your toes might touch the opposite wall of the tent   if you have a sleeping pad i think you can get away with a little more length it has a nice hook up top  i attached a solar lantern onto it for use as a night light and it s great i will have to see how it does in the rain but for a cheap tent that will be used in a dry climate  i am happy with the purchase      
475,4.0,                       took my    year old and i just    minutes to put it up the first time  by the second time we had it down to   minutes  another minutes got the rainfly up and stakes in  plenty of room for two queen size inflatable mattresses plus gear  very simple inside  two mesh pockets on each side  a small pass thru for electrical cords and lots of airflow  makes me wish i had tents like this when i was a kid  since we ve only encountered beautiful weather i can t comment on its ability to repel water  construction and ease of use  both putting together and taking down  are the biggest pluses  it did come with a small mat i assumed was for the entrance  really too small for our use but it was a nice addition anyway  a couple times the zipper got caught on the overlapping door material  it was very easy to pull out the material and i wouldn t consider it to be an issue  we just needed to be more careful  i wouldn t mind another mesh pocket at the top apex of the tent  just for holding small lights lanterns but i can t think of any other way to improve on this tent at this price  i would highly recommend      
476,5.0,                       love this tent  big enough for two but a little snug if you re in it with someone you don t want to be that close to  it was wet and drizzling when we went camping and this tent kept us completely dry  i m sure even with more rain it would ve withstood it  reading the rest of the comments  great color and extremely easy to put together  we used our own stakes for more stability but the ones it comes with should work fine unless you re on soggy ground  the tiny ones might pull up      
477,5.0,                       i got this as a secondary tent for when car camping with friends  it doesn t pack down as small or as light as my backpacking tent  but it goes up easy and has a ton of space  the tall ceiling makes for relaxing and changing clothes a breeze  plus good floor room to stash things  my gf and i can use a cot and an inflatable mat side by side and not feel crowded   haven t tested it in the rain yet but seems to have adequate waterproofing should it occur  tub floor  walls      
478,4.0,                       despite the description  this only has one door   it s well made for what you are paying for  if you want a tent that will survive high winds  get aluminum poles   if you want a totally waterproof tent  pay for a high end tent   this is a good tent for     people  i am      and can stand in the tent   i was disappointed that this did not have   doors as the description states  as   doors can be very handy   but i guess i will have to live with it      
479,5.0,                       i am so happy with this tent  i have used it for   camping trips here in florida and it just performed well  more room than i need for two people and gear  i think   people would have to put gear outside  stakes that came with it are crap  so i recommend upgrade those  but besides that i m looking forward to the at in georgia at the end of the year  a little on the heavy side but i can manage  i m not doing hardcore hiking so it works for me      
480,5.0,                       if you re looking for a durable but still inexpensive tent  i highly recommend this one i have been using it now for about   months and i have taken it on several camping trips  including two to the white mountains   my son is a scout and goes camping regularly   i wanted to get a tent that can handle the abuse of being used by kids and is inexpensive enough that if it does get destroyed it s not a serious loss   i have been pleasantly surprised by just how easy this tent is to set up  how dry it has stayed  i used it in    degree weather in a nor easter   and overall just how well it has stood up to several scout campouts   i plan to get another one      
481,4.0,                       i used this for a camping trip  i loved that it was pretty easy to setup  i recommend setting it up with a friend but i was able to do it alone without too much trouble  the rain fly was the only issue i had  it was tough to get it to sit right on the top of the tent even following the video if you re trying to squeeze a queen air mattress in it  it s possible  i got mine in with just a few inches to spare  if you want a queen mattress in there with a little more room i d recommend getting the   person model if you purchased the   person  like i did  there s plenty of room for two people  squeezing   people in there is going to be tough  if you want anymore than two inside the tent go straight to the   person model      
482,5.0,                       buying a tent can be difficult sometimes as different weather will determine what kind you need  i would say so far this has been great  i use this as a backup tent or one for when my kids want to sleep next to my tent  it s great and has handles mild rain well  i would say it handled condensation build up pretty well  i also have to remember this tent wasn t made to endure heavy continuous rain so always check the weather before you go camping      
483,5.0,                       bought this tent for our    yo kid for overnight camping trip  it was the kids summer day camp trip there parents are not allowed  so       yo kids had to setup and pack back their tents by themselves and   girls did it without any help  in this   person tent supposed to sleep   girls plus they bags but it was really bad night with thunderstorm and other tent with other kids was soaked so these kids were invited to stay overnight in our kid s tent  thank you coleman for your quality    girls     bags slept in   person tent and stayed dry during heavy rain all night      
484,4.0,                       the coleman tent is a free standing tent  a feature that makes it easier to install  you ll only need ten minutes to set up your tent  it is dome shaped and comes with fiberglass poles that are    mm thick  these poles feature insta clip attachments for easy installation and help the tent to stand up against any intensity of the wind  the pole sleeves are continuous and snag free  a feature that makes it easy to install  the tent s canopy is high performing and durable polyester  while the floor features the sturdy     d polyethylene  the tent is    percent more water resistant as compared to any other product from coleman  its ability to withstand strong gusts of wind is unmatched  the unique design allows for its unparalleled services  with a weathertec is a robust system that protects against weather elements  overall  this is a durable  free standing  spacious  cost friendly tent      
485,5.0,                       i purchased this   person tent before a weekend camping trip  it was a great buy  the first night of camping it stormed and down poured  for    minutes  we stayed dry and had no problems with leaking water  we are family of three and fit comfortable in this tent      
486,4.0,                       i don t camp often at all  so i didn t invest much in a tent  but this one seems to have great features for a warmer climate such as north carolina   i will say though  it should include a footprint  the one on it is quite thin and won t last forever so do invest in a slightly smaller tarp than the outer edges of the tent waterproof this is not  seam seal it for sure and the rain fly does not cover the majority of the tent like high end models from reiabove all  it s great for light users who want to camp a few times per year      
487,5.0,                       set up is super easy  i bought a   person and had room for a twin air mattress  camp cupboard  and all of my gear and never felt cramped  perfect for a solo camper or a couple  first trip was a week on the shores of lake michigan and it held up amazingly    days of heavy rain and not a drop made it into the tent  ventilation was great  but this will not keep heat in  a perfect warm chilly weather tent  i haven t been camping in over    years and the tent helped make it a breeze      
488,5.0,                       this is the third tent i ve tried this summer and i think this is the keeper  took me ten minutes by myself to set up  size of  p is perfect for my family of five  we went camping two weeks ago with an  p tent and it was too big  i love the material  it just feels like a quality tent  the poles are stronger than others i have tried  zipper is smooth  i cannot speak to the warmth yet since it s set up in my yard and it s summertime but so far i m pleased      
489,5.0,                       i bought this as i discovered our tent was bigger than i thought when i unearthed it in the basement  and yellowstone said we couldn t change our reservation to include a larger tent  my choice was not to give up part of our vacation  but buy a smaller tent  this was easy to set up  even with children assisting    we had rain one night   no leaks  no dampness problems  we were nice and dry  despite heavy rain the tent is rated to handle   mph winds  it did fine with those  but gusts of higher than that caused the side to go concave  when the wind eased  the side would pop back up  during particularly strong gusts at badlands  i held the side up to keep it off of my child we had a queen size air mattress in the tent  with that fully inflated  we had room to spare on one side  the child who decided she didn t want to sleep on the mattress slept on the floor next to it  and had plenty of room      
490,5.0,                       super easy to set up   went back in the bag which normally products never fit back in original   it did rain on us but the tent did it s job   it fit our queen size blow up mattress perfectly   i don t think any bigger could have fit   the air flow throughout was nice as well  there is a weird little flap window at the bottom side of tent  that you couldn t roll up on outside it just kinda flapped in the wind lol   i wish i could close it due to weather or some weirdo trying to peak through   but i think the mattress blocked out view mostly   nothing major   but just found that lone flap odd      
491,5.0,                       we have used this tent several times now  once in pouring rain  it is super easy to set up and a good size for   people with luggage   the horribly rainy night we used this tent  the tent did get wet and water came in slightly but we did not have a tent footprint tarp under which may have made a world of difference   this is a great tent for the price and i would definitely recommend  it to any of my friends or family      
492,5.0,                       the coleman sundome   person tent is very affordable at      prices will vary  for what you get  first thing i noticed when unboxing it was that it is bigger than i had expected  i was very pleased with the size of the tent    people will fit very comfortable with gear and even pets  you can fit a queen size air mattress with room for gear or   cots or twin air mattresses with gear and room to move around  when tents say   person or   or whatever number that means how many people you can physically fit laying side by side  head to toe on the floor to give you an idea of how big the tent is in comparison to an average person  it does not mean that is how many people should could sleep comfortably  so  i would say in my opinion this is really a     person tent  and that is being comfortable with gear  it has   storage pockets one on each side  a loop hanging from the roof to attach a d ring and a light  it has a back ground vent to allow for good ventilation  it has large  halfway up mesh windows on all   walls  the back window zips closed and is fully enclosed once the fly is on for bad weather protection  it has very durable  thick  and tough materials that last a long time with good care and maintenance  i am disabled and can carry the whole tent with one arm  it was so simple for me to put it up and take it back down  i would highly recommend this tent  it would be great for beginners  disabled  young and old  it really is an awesome tent and so easy to use      
493,5.0,                       great   person tent  really comfortable with two adults and possibly one child and or a medium size dog and your clothing and other hiking gear   do not buy a   person or   person tent and assume there will be room for two people with sleeping bags  inflatable mattress  an any other gear or backpacks you might want to store in the tent i really want the blue and grey version of this product but amazon prime could not guarantee it would come in time  as such i ordered both and both came within a day or two of one another about   days before our trip   quality of the tent for the money was as advertised and reviewed before  that is to say it was exceptional   we were very pleased with this tent and it is exceptionally functional  durable  and attractive for the money   we liked it so much i actually bought   other   person tents of similar style  sundome  those are both blue and grey because the green and white looks a little outdated   we also kept the green and white because we are nearly     our kids are now adults  and someday hopefully we will have grandchildren and i can envision family camping trips where grandma and grandpa are the cool grandparents with the camping equipment that matches that everyone can use   love this product  did thorough research before i purchased it on the internet and in brick and mortar stores and if you are going to do boy scout trips  day hikes with a base camp for starting and ending point  or camping trips to tourist locations and camping grounds i cannot recommend this tent or the   person tents i bought highly enough to you my wife and i used this on a trip to the northwest to see dave matthews band at the gorge with my    year old son and his girlfriend  they had a much higher tech backpacking tent  sleeping bags  etc  because they hike and backpack frequently   given the use  and the fact neither my wife or i had hiked since our kids were little     years ago  we were exceptionally comfortable  warm  temps got to low    s overnight  without being too hot  and dry   in short our experience was comparable to my son and his girl friend s for about a quarter of the cost of their high tech equipment great value  very pleased with product and ordering and delivery   amazon prime was one of the better shipping decisions i have made for a tent priced well below       i do not think you can find a better alternative      
494,4.0,                       the tent was decently easy to assemble with one person  frustrating at times  but when you add a second person to assemble the tent  it was extremely easy and went up without a snag  on the very first use we put the water resistance of the tent to the test  it rained all weekend  including while i was setting up the tent  but the inside of the tent stayed dry   highly impressed  the vents help keep the humidity level inside the tent as low as possible      
495,5.0,                       i am in love  coleman never lets me down and they didn t start with this tent  the last time i slept in a tent  i was sleeping next to three guys in a one person tent in some desert for some training event in the marines ha   ha needless to say i was already excited to only have to share a four person tent with my wife  we live in montana  we need tough and weatherproof basically  this exceeded my expectations and we camped for two weeks straight  excellent shelter and its so easy to pack  unpack  and setup  she s    lbs       and thin  i m    lbs     and muscular and it fit us with adequate spaciousness with our two great dane pitbull mixes  if it can stand up to montana weather  you re in good hands people      
496,5.0,                       got this tent for just myself for camping at a music festival  i got the   person tent because the price was comparable to the   person first  held up to on and off rain through out the weekend  just make sure to use the rain fly second  for one person i had plenty of room for my gear and my sleeping pad and to move around  would be comfortable for   people to sleep in  but if   people were to sleep in it they would have no room for gear      
497,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          the rain water leaked in after the second use of the tent in just one year     
498,5.0,                       this tent is perfect for a solid entry level   just got it a few days ago for a long weekend   super easy to set up  and even though it rained all night  ours was the only tent in our group that didn t have any issues with getting wet   we were able to leave all of the flaps open and didn t have an issue   easy to set up   we were able to fit a queen sized blow up mattress  intex classic downy airbed set available from amazon  and it was just barely able to fit length wise   just two of us slept in the tent  and there was still some room on both sides of the mattress for bags and coolers and everything   if we didn t bring the air mattress   adults might be a little tight  but as a two person tent with a blow up mattress there was tons or room     
499,5.0,                       went on a    week car camping trip  took it down and put it back up at least   or   times and it was just as easy every time  takes maybe   minutes  every time we put it up my boyfriend commented how easy it was  highly recommend getting a tarp to lay down  as tarps are cheaper to replace than tents and it keeps it cleaner less likely to get punctured or worn  stayed put even with some heavier winds and didn t get wet inside when it rained  we did spray it with weather protectant spray from walmart just for safe measures  overall great quality  and great price  would definitely purchase again      
500,5.0,                       easy to put up and great price   i would use a tarp for heavy rain but it did really well   it fits a queen size blow up mattress with room for my large suitcase  bottled water  camping games  portable lantern    magazines and still has room on the one side   if you put the mattress in the middle of the tent you would have about a foot on each side   length is a tighter fit you only have about    inches at the end of the bed   you can not stand up right in this tent unless you are a child   the tent floor and about   to   inches up on all sides is a thick dark gray tarp type material   i put it on gravel for a week and no problems with it tearing      
501,1.0,                       i ll never buy coleman products again and i ll tell everyone i know the same thing your zippers are garbage this tent lasted less than six months   so did the coleman sleeping bag i bought at the same time   i almost froze to death last night because your zippers fell apart more chinese garbage forced on unsuspecting  powerless american consumers you people should be ashamed of yourselves   you re nothing but con artists      
502,5.0,                       when i bought this tent  it was slightly smaller than my other one  i had  x   this one is  x    but the quality outperformed any tent i ve ever had  there was no condensation at all  and it was      waterproof   there was a storm the first night i used this  there is plenty of room for everything you need  and there s even a little thing to place the shoes on   we fold it in half to help keep the water out  and keep our shoes outside   i highly recommend this tent   downside is it s heavy and so not quite suitable for backpacking     
503,5.0,                       upon arrival  my daughters     and     promptly set it up and had dinner in it during camping  the torrential rains did not penetrate into the tent at all  it is very well manufactured nice flys and everything  still wondering what the extra small tarp thingy was for it was also very windy but anchored well into the loam upon which it and we sat completely dry and safe great tent for newbies      
504,3.0,                       of course  the  st day we used it  it rained out  inside of the tent got very wet  very fast  was hoping from the video they include on the product screen that it would handle bad weather a bit longer  i realize eventually all tents will leak but this was not a very hard rain storm  no wind and it seemed to leak a lot  other than that  easy to put up  take down  roomy  good quality      
505,1.0,                       we used this tent for the first time thismonth  it s very easy to set up and break down  light weight  comfortably sleeps two  and we loved the pockets inside to hold small items however  our tent did not keep out the rain  it leaked at the seams and we had to use towels and other clothes to soak up the water that was coming  in  we woke up in puddles of water overall very disappointed in this item  the manufacture video provided by coleman says this tent fails their test if more than   tablespoons of water make it in and is guaranteed bone dry  this tent definitely failed  our friends camped in their tent  same exact one  that night and they woke up soaked as well  do not recommend      
506,5.0,                       my home away from home  i love this tent  i have used it for over   months now and have only one small tare on the top cover  so who really cares   that small tare  i just put some duct tape on it and i was good to go  but the tent is great  for the price there is no better tent  even for more i don t understand how any tent could be better than my sundome  it s easy to set it up  comfortable  and large  now you could fit   people in here but it would be very snug  but that s with any tent s given capacity  but with   people  which is how many people i usually go with  there is plenty of room  i can t recommend this tent enough      
507,5.0,                       we love this tent   we ve taken it out for   camping trips so far   it s easy to put up with   people and takes us no more than    minutes  we bring a queen sized air mattress and still have enough room to keep our bags inside and move around comfortably   i feel like   people would be tough in here   i personally wouldn t push it past   as i feel like that would be kind of a tight squeeze and definitely hot in the summer   but then again  i am a little spoiled and like to have a lot of room in the tent when camping   the little breeze vents are nice but the thing that has wowed me the most is how great it is at keeping out the rain   i ve had a lot of camping trips get disrupted by rain   i despise waking up in a rain puddle but this tent kept us dry  even in during a pretty wild thunderstorm with heavy rain and wind   the key is that the seams are up higher on the walls than on any tents that we ve previously owned   it s genius   most of the top is mesh so it s hard to have any privacy if the ran fly is off  but that also means a great cross breeze and view of the night sky if you don t mind being visible to people outside   it s not hard to pack away either   i d definitely recommend it to others      
508,5.0,                       i bought this tent for a camping trip last month and i bought the   person size  when you set it up it looks bigger than a   person so that s cool  the inside will fit a queen size mattress but just enough  in other words  fitting your bags will be a little cramped but not impossible or uncomfortable  i didn t feel any excessive wind coming in  just a breeze which i like  if it s hot outside the tent will hold extreme heat   like  wow  but at night it was fine  it s also easy to set up  i love this tent  i cannot wait to use it again      
509,3.0,                       bought this for camping for myself and my two spaniels  definately would not be big enough for   people  was not easy to set up by myself  getting it back in the storage bag was another labor  it was    degrees out and i was freezing because the whole top is screen  wind came right through  since i used it for one night i m not returning it but will sell for half price plus shipping      
510,3.0,                       i just put this tent through the ringer in eastern north carolina for   nights on the beach on cape lookout national seashore  it was a good tent for the price and i was happy with how it stood up in the wind  i do want it to be known that the mesh is not a true micro mesh  therefore one night the no see ums or sand flies got through the mesh and mauled me pretty bad  so be aware that if you live in a place that has midges or sand flys or biting gnats or anything of that size the mesh on this tent will not stop them from getting in  besides that  setup was easy as could be the rain fly was decent  air flow was a bit rough but a solid tent on a budget      
511,4.0,                       easy to set up  inexpensive  and despite my hopes and prayers of no rain on a three day     mile hike  the heavens opened and it monsoon d   out of   days  this tent proved to be sturdy and kept  the boy  bone dry  plus we had to set it up in a jiffy in the aforementioned downpour   i think we had it set up in under    minutes  the  bathtub  style floor is very good and doesn t need a ground tarp cons  i wish coleman had backpack friendly packaging as it basically comes in a bag with handles  and i wish it had a vestibule  so if one wants to take this tent   outdoors  one can leave their shoes outside and not take the muddy shoes into the tent with you     in our case we took the boy s shoes into our vestibule      
512,5.0,                       we bought this as a second tent now that our kids at egetting bigger  it s so easy and fast to set up  great tent if you need something smaller  i don t know if i would call it a   person tent  definitely not   adults  maybe for   adults and kids but it would be snug  we use it with   kids or   kids   adult and we are able to all fit comfortably with a little space for belongings  my favorite thing was that the directions are sewn right into the tent bag on weather proof material  i love that i m done have to keep track of them and they will last no matter what weather we camp in      
513,3.0,                       it s decent if you only go camping once or twice a year and nothing too wild  it will leak in rain  material only tends off rain for a short shower but anything more than that water will pool in the corners and the seams need to be waterproofed by you   rainfly is inadequate for more than a drizzle as it does not provide enough coverage  works well in dry weather only      
514,5.0,                       this is a great little tent  i ve used this tent a few times now and have absolutely no complaints  setup is a breeze and can easily done by one person  it sleeps two comfortably and could accommodate three  if need be  i ve used a full size air mattress in the tent and there was still plenty of room for my stuff gear  so a queen size air mattress should fit with no problem  the vents allow air to flow nicely through the tent  which keeps it cool inside and prevents the air from getting stale  so far  it has remained fairly cool in the morning  at least until  am   even with the sun beating down on the tent the rain fly on this thing is awesome  the last time i used this tent it poured rain for two days  with strong winds  gusts more than    mph   the tent stayed put and the inside of the tent remained totally dry  even when the winds changed direction  this alone makes it worth every penny to me      
515,5.0,                       great tent  easy to set up  spacious and looks great   many features that set this apart from others such access for a an electrical extension cord into the tent  pocket to put your phone misc items in  and being able to hang a small lamp from the ceilig   i would suggest getting the larger version of the tent to have extra space if you plan on  using a queen sized inflatable mattress   i used this on a two day camping trip in the california desert during the summer  so regarding how it performed in the elements  this review will not correspond to most   aside from the tent  temps were supposed to be around    degrees fahrenheit but ended up being      so the inside of the tent was very hot midday   this would be the case for any tent   luckily was cool at night      
516,5.0,                       i hesitated buying this tent because of the price tag  i was worried that the tent would not hold up to moderate use  fortunately  my hesitation was unnecessary  this tent works great for what it is this tent is great for car camping and also backyard camping if you have kids  it could be used for hiking if you have another person to split the load with  it is not really designed as a hiking tent  though  so don t be surprised if it s a great deal more bulky than a tent that costs     times as much both my wife and i fit comfortably inside the   person tent  i am slightly over   feet tall  and i do not feel cramped  if you are taller than     you could still use this tent and sleep diagonally  obviously this would make the tent effectively a one person tent with plenty of room for gear this tent is      keep that in mind when you crawl into it  and you will quickly understand what a great deal it is      
517,5.0,                    con la resiente situacion de terremotos en puerto rico  el miedo a quedar atrapados en nuestras casa por las noches a heccho que pasemos las noches fuera  la compra de esta caseta le a dado paz a mi mente para poder dormir tranquilos  es muy amplia  segura y realmente es una buena invercion  me encanta que la puerta sea de lado y las ventanas le da una excelenta ventilacion  excelente la recomiendo  y el precio esta super bueno        
518,5.0,                       i bought this for a   day trip in az in the summer  for reference   of the products i bought for camping  this was easily the best   the assembly was very simple  i remember tents from the    s    their  simple  design left some in tears       main folding frames that self assemble  all you have to do is guide them through a simple fabric tube on the tent   there is one more bar that works the exact same  if you want the rainflap on   every zipper  every seam was perfect on mine  and i had it up and put away  literally  in minutes  like        two built in net pockets are inside  one on each side  perfect for food or flashlights  etc   it comes with a nice case to carry it all along   this one s worth it like any tent   this is only for   men if you want to sleep arm to arm  and at least one is short  ha   but for a couple  or solo  this is a great but      
519,4.0,                       the good is that you will stay dry  if you keep the flaps staked down rather than tethered out  the bad was the lack of side windows now and that the top is wide open  lots of air flow if you need it  we have used them during rain without issue but we brought the fly down close and the vent flap staked straight down  better usage in summer than in fall  i would even put a poly tarp over it for colder and super wet weather  bottom did not leak      
520,5.0,                       i m extremely happy with this purchase  the tent is a great size for my queen air mattress  myself  and my two young kids  we ve camped in a downpour twice and have not had any leaking  it s easy to set up by myself  and honestly i m not a super experienced camper  i have a small four door sedan and this fits just fine with the rest of my gear for a weekend in my trunk  i highly recommend this for a  family of casual campers      
521,5.0,                       this tent is very easy to assemble my friend   i had never assembled a tent before  w out a veteran camper being in charge  she   i had it assembled   secured in under    minutes  w the fly on w no problems whatsoever i did a lot of research to find a good  economical tent w dimensions that would be comfortable for   ppl that aren t partners    w enough height to be able to stand in the center of the tent  this tent hit all of my criteria  spot on  i couldn t be happier it hasn t been rained on  so i can t speak to its water weatherproofness      
522,5.0,                       easy to set up  easy to break down  camped in it for   nights and   days  two of those nights it poured for hours and we had   leaks  the bottom of the tent is made of tarp material and we probably didn t even need the tarp we used underneath  the only catch is that if you press up against the sides of the tent  you will absorb rain and or dew from the outside  we noticed this with a pillow that was a bit damp from being up against the wall slept   people on a twin coleman air mattress comfortably with plenty of room for bags and such  could easily fit a queen size   it s also tall enough to comfortably sit up in  even for those over  ft tall  i loved the built in hanging pockets on the two side walls  i put my glasses and knick knacks in there to keep them safe overnight  this is very much a summer tent and therefore you should bring a sleeping bag or blanket as a matter of course  mid atlantic area here       
523,5.0,                       i ve only used it once  but  it was fantastic  it was fairly easy for me  just over   ft  and my friend to get the rain cover on  it was the fastest i ve ever set up a tent even wutg the time it took having to explain how to set up tents to my companion  it was raining all day   the tent held up fantastic  i was worried about the grooveless pegs in the soft ground  and the rain reeeally worried me  no need to fear though they stayed in solid  the tent even stayed up with all the pegs out  would buy again      
524,5.0,                       took two of these on a  day float in the back country  we had torrential rain fall and two times in micro burst winds  our kids tent had a bracket that connects the tent to the poll rip off in the wind  but other then that they held up pretty good  seemed small at first put fit two people and some gear really comfortably  not sure how long they will last  but for the price we will just buy another one when that time comes      
525,5.0,                       this is the perfect tent for me my husband  and our son  yrs old  it s so big and cozy    the door flap and windows open up and are big enough to let plenty of air through so it s very breathable every opening including the door flap has screen netting to keep bugs and even tinted pretty good to keep shade from the sun   strong zippers are very important and this tent has them   our son happily lounged around in it through days then we would put the dome cover back on and call it a night there s a nice lamp hanger overhead in the center and it also has an electric cord slot that is secure enough to keep weather out the floor material is very thick and durable and the carry bag is strong as well the list goes on and on but i ll stop for now  this is one of the best tents we ve owned by far    oh and it even has a nice durable floor mat for outside to kick your shoes off before climbing in  actually very handy       
526,4.0,                       my boyfriend and i just came back from a five day camping trip to glacier  and we used this tent  for the money  i think it s a pretty good buy  there were only two issues that we ran into  one  the rain fly pole seemed a little too long for the actual rain fly  so we could only insert one end of the pole into the pocket no matter what we did  it still stayed on well and it wasn t a huge deal  but i think if you re paying for something like this everything should be proportioned correctly  two  it isn t something you can use when you re minimal camping  backpacking  smaller car   the packaging is fairly large and rectangular  it didn t rain much at all while we were there  but i would recommend using seam seal if you ll be camping anywhere with rain  the size was perfect for my boyfriend and i  and small campsites too   but with two people you wouldn t be able to comfortably fit any bags in there  which wasn t an issue for us since you have to put practically everything into your car in glacier  overall  i think this is a really great tent for the money  just make sure you set it up when you get it and make sure to exchange it if you find that everything isn t proportioned correctly      
527,5.0,                       we used this tent on vacation for a couple of weeks  we moved nearly every night to a new location so we took it up and down a lot   it withstood a very hard rain with no water entry  it dries fast  super easy to put up and take down   nice roomy storage bag for it all that is not like putting a puzzle together to get it to fit back in  the price is good  we had an adult and two pre teens sleeping in it  there was all the clothes bags as well   wasn t too crowded for all that  i think it might be tight for four adults though  i highly recommend this tent      
528,5.0,                       surprised by the amount of room and the quality of the fabric  the stakes for the ground are on the thin side  so if you have some rocky ground to camp on you might need better stakes  good against the wind and light sprinkles  i have not been in full on rain in this tent yet  very pleased with the quality so far  directions are not clear  took me a couple of mistakes to realize exactly what is was trying to show  but once you figure it out  it is really easy to assemble the tent      
529,5.0,                       been meaning to write about this tent for a while now especially because this tent practically made my summer  so here s my two cents  i was skeptical at the low price of this tent  but two music festivals and a few small camping trips later  i m beyond satisfied  and would purchase this tent again if i needed to   but no need to because it s  easy design and sturdy construction gives me the impression i ll be living out of this tent again next festival season  it s spacious  airy  rain resistant  and soooooo easy to assemble  by the third assembly my boyfriend and i made it a goal to see how quickly we could assemble and disassemble and i think the fastest was under    mins each way  including bickering  and repacking it into the carry case  he s     and could stand comfortably in the center  the one very slight annoyance is the zipper flap often gets caught in the zipper  but hey  nothing s perfect  but for the price this tent is a steal  enjoy      
530,5.0,                       if you re looking for a large  quality car camping tent  this is your tent  if you re looking for whatever this product description is  this is not your tent description says   doors  false    door  and   window opposite  certainly no hinged door  only having   door is probably the biggest let down description says led light system  false  huh  what  it s a tent  thought this feature might be cool  but nah bro  there is no light system description says self rolling windows  false  this is a tent  again  thought this strange feature might be cool  but nah bro  nah  there is a regular tent window  convenient  yes  normal tent window  check  self rolling window  negative again  coleman makes quality tents  and this is replacing a    year old coleman with many miles on it  i will keep the tent  but whatever the product description is describing  it is not this tent      
531,1.0,                       the first night we had this set up one of the pole sections failed   we had some wind  but certainly not over   mph  which the tent was  tested  for  and the pole section splintered   had to duct tape the pole for the next   nights and was visibly weaker than the rest of the sections maybe a factory defect in that section of pole   we shall see how customer service handles this         
532,1.0,                       the tent arrived yesterday  set it up this morning to seal the seams for a cub scout camping event next weekend  noticed the the rainfly is coming apart as if the material is rotted  you can run your finger gently across the fabric which is very thin and it just separates  we have camped numerous times in our coleman red canyon   person tent with no problems  it seems better made than this new one  i ll be sending this tent back and i m not sure i ll be replacing it with another coleman  it will be raining this coming weekend and i need a tent that i can trust not to get us wet      
533,5.0,                       very well built tent with plenty of ventilation  easy to set up as well  does get chilly inside if it is cold  used it in      ish degree weather   the tent itself was designed for   people  and it is big enough to accommodate   adults  but it might get a little crowded  around     will be better especially if you consider other items such as backpacks  sleeping bags  etc  with   people  the tent has more than enough space and is surprisingly roomy and comfortable  i will definitely recommend this tent  especially if you are on a budget and plan to use it during spring  summer  and early fall  winter is too cold to use this tent   finally  the rainfly does help cover two of the ventilation to keep the cold out and provide cover when it rains  have not used it in rain yet   it is up to you to setup the rainfly or not  without it  you basically have a  sunroof  and be able to see the sky when inside the tent      
534,4.0,                       used it on a campout for the first time   it does not compare in ease or quality to our rei tent  but for the money it was reasonably well constructed and easy enough to put up   the kids loved it as an extra tent  and i put it up by myself in about    minutes   needs a tarp underneath  and i will order some extra stakes  but great deal and solid tent      
535,3.0,                       i really like our new tent  wanted something one person could put up for when we do mom and me or dad and me camping and it is too hard to take out the big tent  this was plenty of room for me my   boys    and under and our backpacks  my only complaint is i snapped one of my poles taking my tent down  i ordered a replacement but the poles on this tent should be a little sturdier than that  i have never broken another pole on my other tents and we camp quite a bit     
536,2.0,                       we are fairly experienced at trunk camping and needed a new tent for the kids  biggest criteria is easy up   down and good ventilation  living in the south  this is very important   thought this would meet the criteria but upon receiving it and setting it up  we discovered a tear on one of the pole sleeves  the tent was dismantled and returned   as far as ventilation goes  it would have been lacking in this area too       
537,5.0,                       bought this for a july  th camping trip  for me and a   year old girl   i dont have much experience camping  but i was able to set this tent up pretty fast     min  and it had plenty of space for me and my daughter     full sized adults would be a real stretch  though   at most    adults and   kids   it didnt rain  so i dont know how it would perform in a downpour  but we had a lot of fog dew  and none of it seeped through   the carrier bag can expand  which is nice  because its impossible to refold it to factory conditions      
538,4.0,                       i have used it four times so far  two times were in far from perfect conditions  the first time was a very cool but dry fall weekend  lows in the   s and highs in the   s  the second weekend was horrible weather  lows in the   s highs in the   s and rained hard all weekend  the last night the wind was a steady   mph with    mph gusts and pouring rain  i am so glad i staked out everything with real stakes not the little ones that come with the tent  the tent held up great  no leaks  no tears  i do wish this tent had a vestibule to keep the area just outside your door dry  i will have to see how it holds up over time  i am a assistant scout master with a very active boy scout troop  so i camp at least twice a month in tents   spring summer fall    in the winter  we sleep in igloos lean too s cabins  this tent is my personal tent  plenty of room for me two people would be tight with gear  three people would not be fun      
539,2.0,                       high hopes but disappointed  on first use  the stitching tore and a hole appeared by the door  literally right after it was set up  i bought the two person tent but doubt you can fit two sleeping bags in there  i have a normal gym bag and the length of that bag was the space left  there were some cool mesh breathing features but the space and hole really dampened the quality      
540,2.0,                          you can find all the good things about this tent in other reviews  i just wanted to point out that this tent has full size vent windows at the   sides of the tent which you cannot close  unlike zippable front back windows  because of that  if you are going to camp in an area where the temperature drops below    f  you are going to need a lot of clothes for good night sleep  still  you are going to have to face a chilly wind blowing into your face  while you are trying to sleep i wouldn t recommend this tent for other than summer camping where the weather stays above the   s degrees at night   early morning    also  just after   uses  few of the pole parts are kinda bent  and i think i will be lucky to use this tent two or more times      
541,5.0,                       i ve used it a few times  it s made of great quality and my children love it  we ve used it to camp out on our balcony and at the park period one day while we were camping out in the park started to pour down rain and all i could think was wow i wish i kept that rain cover cambridge but i have no idea where it is anymore nevertheless it s a great product i m very happy about it  it s creating some great memories and i m sure i will continue to  i haven t seen any signs of wear on it and i ve also used it at the beach  we have a family of   and we all fit in it very comfortably  at first it is a little bit difficult to figure out how to open up and put away if you re not used to using tens but like anything once you do it   or   times it becomes very routine and easy  it also fits into a very small carrying bag that you can fit onto an airplane carry on storage or even in the front seat of your car or anywhere for that matter  highly recommended      
542,5.0,                       so far  we have taken this tent only once when we camped in paso picacho in san diego  it was a strong windy night  but the tent did a very good job of protecting us  it s a light tent  easy to set up  we have the green one  it looks so nice  you can adjust airflow ventilation  there are pockets inside which you can use to store small stuffs  safe choice for a new camper      
543,4.0,                       pretty nice tent  good size  used it for two people  it fit a queen size air mattress perfectly with plenty of room to spare for bags and changing  only reason i m giving   instead of   stars is because i was missing one stake  needed to fully secure the tent into the ground   also because one of the black fabric loops were broken and last because the directions were a little difficult to follow  especially for someone who s never assembled a tent before  since there were only pictures and no step by step sentences instructions  none of these caused a major problem with the tent and i was still able to use it and will use again in the future  i would still recommend this tent to a friend      
544,4.0,                       it was easy to set up  only took me roughly   mins but then again this is my first ever tent  now that i understand it i can probably get it up in   mins  plenty of room and seemingly plenty of ventilation i suppose i ll find out if it s water resistance is up to par when i use it this weekend as it s supposed to rain on my first ever camping trip  i may update my rating depending on what happens s n  breaking it down and being able to get it back in the storage bag is darn near impossible  they should be able to do better with that      
545,3.0,                    tiene un tama o c modo como para dos personas y es excelente cuando no hay lluvia  por lo menos  ac  en puerto rico  cuando llueve   llueve  necesitar a colocar un toldo sobre ella  de lo contrario  todo se mojar   es f cil de armar y aunque  hay que utilizar un toldo  realmente  aqu  necesitamos utilizarlo con todo tipo de casetas         
546,5.0,                       we bought this tent about two and a half years ago to start camping as a family  we ve used it about   or   times since then  it s been amazing  we get   adults and   children inside with plenty of room left over for gear  it is easy to set up with   people  the best part is how it holds up in rain  every time we have gone camping  it has rained on us  and we have never had any leaks or flooding  and one of our trips  it basically rained the entire weekend  i spray the seams every once in a while with sealant  but the weather tec system with the waterproof bottom does a great job of holding out the water  i won t buy another coleman tent that doesn t advertise this feature  the only real con is the rain fly  i wish it were a full rain fly like the ones when i was a kid  but it seems like all of them are shorter these days  overall  this is a great tent for an amazing price      
547,5.0,                       we had the green one of this for about ten years until the poles finally splintered after using them in humidity and sand usually  ordered this one again but in blue  the tent is perfect for two people  you can stand inside and plenty of room but still small and lightweight and easy to set up  i can do it by myself if i have to  really like the blue that we got to keep it a little darker on the morning      
548,2.0,                       ok  so i do not know a single thing about camping using tents   i ve done it before  but was not involved in set ups  i was extremely disappointed at how we got rained on  i love the simplicity of this design  but we got some of our items wet  thankfully they were waterpoof  and i ended up started to take down the tent at  am  having to wake my kids up  since it was only a matter of time before everything got wet  again  i know nothing on set up  i didn t do any fancy  tent hacks and what have you to ensure anything cause i know zero on camping  but feel like even so  this tent  with the fly  should ve prevented water from coming in  i want to return  but beyond the water issue  i really liked this tent  but the water issue was an absolute necessity  so i am disappointed      
549,5.0,                       i got this on coleman camping deal day  super great price  it sets up really easily and is lightweight  one thing  and it may seem minor  but we liked how the bag is expandable  you know how you can never get the tent back in the bag after the first time no matter how tight you roll it   well this bag expands and you can get it back in my    yr old son put it up on our lanai and slept in it for   weeks with the dog  but  we got it so he and my husband to go to a father son camp  my husband has a huge cot  like  ft long and it fit  just barely  but it fit      
550,5.0,                       i purchased this tent for a month long motorhome trip across the usa and back with my parents    in their motorhome  summer       my two kids and i slept comfortably every night in this tent  even through a couple monsoon style summer storms back east that were breaking tree limbs and power lines  we pitched this tent in just minutes every night for over a month with no problems  and it s square footprint leaves no space wasted  it fits back in its small bag easily even after tons of use  this little tent is so good in fact  it is now my  go to  tent in our camping gear  i prefer it over our   man pop up tent because it s almost just as easy to set up  definitely easier to break down  and so much easier to put back in the attic afterward  although the footprint of the   man is huge  there is practically the same amount of usable sleeping space due to the   man coleman s straight wall design  you really can fit three people in there  comfortably  tall people too  we are short but use the extra space at our feet for our huge dog  you can t go wrong with this tent      
551,5.0,                       my boyfriend and i used this tent to camp our way around iceland s ring road  very spacious for both of us  there was plenty of room  also   it rained for   days straight and not a single drop of water got into the tent  extremely well made product  was greatly appreciated in the grueling icelandic weather  sturdy throughout all the wind too  overall  an amazing product that is lightweight  super easy to set up  about    minutes to set up and take down   and very waterproof            recommend      
552,5.0,                       this is not a backpacking tent  hell  this is a coleman  a      mass produced tent  i m fully impressed though  took it out for its first time with the lady and joshua tree decides it d be a great time to have a random flash flood  this storm was the worst i ve ever camped in  lightning  thunder  and rain for literally   hours straight  at one point i decided to get out  you know  so as to save all my valuables from being destroyed by water and wind    well  i was drenched literally the first moment of being outside  this tent survived it  and gave me a place to warm up and dry after being in that craziness  albeit naked and in a sleeping bag   did this tent bleed water through  sure  did it rattle like hell  yes  did it do its job  absolutly  emerging like a groundhog from a winter s slumber  we found more than a few wrecked tents and roads covered in mud and rock  all of the park was closed  and soon we were to leave without getting our hike in     point of the matter is    this tent worked way better than i could have anticipated     out of     would buy again      do it  save the big bucks for the backpacking equipment      
553,4.0,                       easy for one person to set up  took about    minutes   if it s used during the winter definitely use the rain fly as the tent only has screen on the sides   that being said  it has pocket storage inside and a place to hang a light from the ceiling  used it with an oversized cot  just me  and had plenty of room for gear and to move around in   i would say this is more like a     person tent if you want to store all your gear inside   even without the cot   i had no problems packing it  back in the carrying bag and it didn t take up a lot of room in my jeep      
554,5.0,                       when we first set up the tent  it felt very thin and light  we were slightly worried it wouldn t hold up to the expected thunderstorm and wind  turns out  we were worried for nothing  this simple tent with its rain guard was more than enough to keep us dry and warm  the door flap is a little tight and some beefier zippers might provide a smoother zipping experience  but that s small complaints a tent of this price point  folds up easily and bag was more than big enough for the tent  setup in under    mins and that s without looking at instructions for the first time      
555,5.0,                       our daughter loves to play in a tent in our backyard during the summer season  this one is made very well  endures rain and strong winds without any issues  no water leaking inside at all   and looks great  it is very easy to set up   takes only about       minutes to do so      
556,5.0,                       i m amazed that coleman can turn a profit on this tent at       even other cheap brand name   person tents are about  x that price  a top quality   person tent will be at least  x that price   is this tent top quality   of course not  everything feels a bit cheap and the poles especially are fairly clunky and heavy   but for backyard camping or occasional car camping the value is incredible      
557,3.0,                       i was excited for this tent   for the most part it held off the rain and we stayed dried  however  water got into the tent from the edges and there was a pool of water on the corners of the tent and a long the sides   at first  i thought it was user error but after checking the tent  it was leaking from the heavy amounts of rain we got that day  i ended up returning the tent  not ideal for fall camping or cool nights evenings      
558,3.0,                       first time ever putting up a tent  it went well even without intructions  soo instructions would be helpful used it camping at a festival for   days  there was a small tear in the netting under the rainfly   might have been small but enough for a big or two to fly in it rained one night pretty hard  there was a little puddle in the corner when i woke up  not so dry there was enough room for a twin air mattress  def just a one person tent  slight room for clothes  not much tho     
559,3.0,                       nice tent  but not three seasons we just got back from a camping trip on october            it got cold  into the lower   s the problem with this tent is the large mesh windows on two sides   these windows take up half the walls and  at night  provides a steady stream of air flowing over your body   in the summer  this is a nice feature  not so much in the fall   the venting is smaller and higher up on other tents i have had   this tent does not hold heat and  even with the air flow  everything was damp inside the tent in the morning   my son was warm sleeping in two sleeping bags and a winter hat   i was a little colder as i only had one sleeping bag what would make this tent great is if it had zippered enclosures over that mesh  as it has on two of the sides   but those two large mesh screens really hurt the performance of this tent is colder weather   other than that  the tent is a great size  good for two people  two slim air matresses  not twin  and all of the gear   easy to set up   tall enough that you can stand in the center and relatively light and compact i just wish it had a way to close off some of that venting   but  that s what you get for the price      
560,5.0,                       i usually don t take the time to write reviews  but this tent is awesome   i m in my third summer car camping around yellowstone and outlying areas   each year i had it out for   ish days i m usually in the parks as soon as campsites open in the spring  and until they close for the season in the fall   it has seen storms  rain  hail  snow  freezing temperatures   taking it all with minimal leaking yellowstone and gtnp have some pretty strict bear storage regulations  so i sleep w o any gear in the tent   this means that there is less stuff to touch the tent walls during a rain   ymmv in the rain with the tent full of people and stuff nearing the end of my third summer using it  the poles are starting to bend  especially the rain fly no tarp  and no waterproofing   when setting up  all four corners are pulled tight and staked down   the rain fly is also pulled tight to make sure water has a way to flow down quickly   don t skip any of the steps   make sure all attachments are used staked down and the tent is pretty solid i m also sure to always put it away dry   after i get back home from a weekend of camping  i hang it over a railing until it s completely dry my only complaint is that   people is a bit of a stretch     people will be a very snug fit with zero room for gear   i would call it a  ish person tent      
561,5.0,                       i bought this for my grandsons to play in this summer  keeps the sun off them  plenty of ventilation and they love to play like their camping  good and sturdy  waterproof  bug proof and they actually use it to camp eady to put together and take apart      
562,4.0,                       awesome and easy to put together   i struggle with getting it back into the bag  but i think that s expected with any tent and a person who doesn t enjoy camping  i can fit both a queen and twin size air mattress and our bags into this tent   the rain flap helps with light rain but you ll still need a tarp to put over the tent if there s anything more than a drizzle      
563,1.0,                       we bought this tent as a backup so that our family could have a bit more room   in the middle of a rain storm  the  nd day of use  the zipper broke and everything in the tent got wet   this is the  nd coleman product i ve purchased with less than favorable results   i would not recommend and i will not purchase coleman products going forward      
564,5.0,                       after the storm i survived   nights ago  i feel obligated to leave this tent a   star review  heavy downpours  hail      mph winds and i stayed dry throughout with no damage to my tent  granted it s not a four person tent as i am      it s well worth the money  this tent is very strong and i can still fit a queen size mattress on the floor and sleep great  very quick setup and teardown  pretty compact storage  not great for backpacking but i just set it up next to our camper  would recommend to anyone     
565,5.0,                       this tent has been exactly what one would want out of a tent  it stays decently warm even into    degree weather  its durable  and takes only   minutes to set up or pack away  i have put the tent through it s paces over the past   years and it s still holding up no problem update  the tent finally died on me after years and years of hard use  the sun made the tent material thin and one of the corners ripped off when it was set up on a hill  this was one hell of a tent for the cost      
566,5.0,                       for camping  weather proofing is crucial  unfortunately  i can t speak to that because we always camp in southern utah where it barely ever rains  however  the   x   tent is awesome for a family to sleep in  i m      and i can stand up in it  and it is fairly easy to set up especially for a tent this large  it s probably a two person job that can be done in under   minutes  this is also important to note  the tent actually fits in the bag that they give you  which is really nice      
567,5.0,                       we bought this tent after our    year old tent finally gave up the ghost last year and our kids graduated to having their own tents  the six person is just the right size for our double high queen size air mattress  my husbands cpap machine  our clothes  and our jackets  we love the size  the zipper seems well constructed  it was easy to set up  the tent is very airy even with the fly on so it s not so great for our chilly  oregon foothills camping  we had to add another layer to stay warm as it doesn t hold heat in well      
568,5.0,                       first     i did not buy this for a tent    i bought this tent for the poles and rainfly  i made these into a sun shade for my canoe  i used   large wood clamps that look like big laundry clothes line pins to which i shrink tubed some pieces of small pipe so that the tent pole ends would go into the these like the grommets on the tent floor then i could bend the tent poles into an arch over which i stretched the rainfly i then secured the corner hooks on the rainfly to the  clothes pins  with some para cord loops and after a few adjustments i had a sun shade for my canoe for around    dollars   compared to the almost     dollars that a factory made shade would cost  the materials seem to be good quality so i am sure that if i had used this for a tent it would have been adequate for that      
569,5.0,                       we were so happy to have this tent   pur first night using it we got a surprise thunderstorm  i m talking   mph winds  thunder  lightning  torrential rain you name it  and this baby held up  several other tents in the camp ground collapsed but for the most part ours was fine  i do wish however that the vents had an option for a roll down cover including the tarp  just for the fact that one of our strings got loosened because of the weather and the whole thing flapped  the front door seam also leaked but hey that s is the only thing i would changed about it      
570,5.0,                       i purchased the two man tent by accident but i kept and i bought the   man tent to use for just myself with a nice elevated air mattress  there was just enough room for the twin mattress  a side table  a fan  a little space alongside the bed  i used the   person tent as a place to store all my necessities  my first night in the tent there was an awful storm  i mean awful  thunder  lightning  and heavy rain for an hour and a half  luckily the wind wasn t bad  my tents stayed in tact and everything stayed completely dry  it is super easy to put up and to take down  i ve only used it once so hopefully it holds up for a few more camping trips      
571,5.0,                       nice tent   we have used it for a couple of years now  plenty of space inside for our king size mattress   the only complaint is the size of the bag   it is nearly impossible to put it back inside when your done   we don t even bother anymore      
572,5.0,                       this is a great tent for the price     seasons  and airy   i like the bottom vent feature  but would have liked the side windows to be a bit bigger when unzipped for summer weather   love the small opening in the corner for electrical cords to pass through   the bottom is like a tarp so you don t really need one underneath  unless you like the extra cushion      
573,2.0,                       i ve had this     years  this one is for when the kids want to  camp  inside the house  we ve set it up twice  once last night  when i was slipping the poles through the slots  we heard a rip  it ripped a hole in the sleeve  it won t affect the tent s ability to keep us dry  but it has a manufacturer defect  as opposed to design defect   torn after two uses      
574,5.0,                       we ve taken this tent out on a few camping trips so far  here is what you need to know  weather seal it  we did based on recommendations in reviews here and haven t had any issues  yes it is easy to setup and take down for a pole tent    min or less  size will fit a queen air mattress but we prefer two smaller air mattresses    people sleep in this tent very happy with this purchase  good value and quality      
575,2.0,                       i am disappointed because i bought this tent in nov      and used it for the first time june       the metal part where the poles join together on the main body pole gave way and opened up  i tried to crimp it but the edges remain sharp  can t get a replacement without paying for it as it is out of warranty  i think for a one time use for it to break is pathetic same with the self inflating mat i bought from coleman  after two uses it now deflates and we can t find the spot  and again out of its one year warranty  not a good testament of the quality of its products  it was purchased for a cub scout and that s why it hasn t been used more consistently and therefore the defects not found out  not sure i am going to continue with coleman      
576,2.0,                       first off  i m       tall and this thing is small   my sleeping pad and sleeping bag occupied     of the floor space   it may have and advertised  ft x  ft footprint but the walls angle up   so keep that in mind   secondly  the first night out camping the rod that holds up the rainfly punctured a hole through the slot that was supposed to keep it in place   i had to find duct tape to remedy the situation  see pictures    and yes  it rained that night   poor quality   item was returned      
577,2.0,                       i set up the tent in the house to inspect it prior to using it for upcoming camping trip  i noticed light coming through one of the corners in the lower wraparound tarp  discovered   holes in the crease were the tent was folded by the manufacturer  material must be inferior if simply folding causes holes  you get what you pay for and would not recommend for anything other than backyard camping  coleman  you dropped the ball on this one   cheap chinese junk  sending back      
578,4.0,                       i purchased the green version of this tent for my twice a year weekend camping trips to replace the taj mahal sized hand me down tent i had been using previously  what struck me about this tent at first was how much smaller it was than i was used to  which was a good thing  even better  i could set it up fairly quickly with an incredibly minimal amount of cursing and stomping  it rained moderately that weekend and the fly worked as advertised and i had zero water inside the tent  it also came with a small rectangular patch of tarp material that i can only assume is supposed to work as a welcome   door mat  my guess is that it would work great as a place to take your shoes off before you get into the tent  but only when it isn t raining  when it is raining or has rained  it really just becomes a convenient place for water and mud to collect right outside your door  the interior is spacious and vented incredibly well  i had no issues with condensation inside the tent and i was fairly comfortable the entire time  at the end of the weekend  taking down the tent was just as easy as putting it up  i was able to break it down  fold it up  and even fit it all back into the bag it came in  which is something i ve never been able to do  i usually revert to a nice trash bag for storage i have to say  for a weekend camping experience  this tent is hard to beat for the price      
579,5.0,                       i bought this tent for my son to use at his summer camp  camp out  it was set up inside  so i can t review how well it keeps water out  but i must say it was a breeze to set up  i made my husband go along to set it up because we have another tent that is always such a pain  and i was afraid this would be the same  and i do not have a lot of experience with them  it literally took us less than   minutes to set this up  it was super simple    i also love the blue and bright green colors  it is a nice looking tent      
580,5.0,                       this a nice tent that was easy to assemble   first time    min  second time   min   just be careful bending the poles although i had no trouble or came close to snapping them   it rained the first night i used it and dry as a bone inside  lots of ventilation     person tent great for two   taking it down  folding and back into the carry case was easy   good idea to air it out in the sun after each use where it will be stored for a while to get out any moisture that may remain on the tent when breaking camp      
581,4.0,                       intention when buying was for myself and   other but i m glad i took it out solo the first time cause it is much smaller than i thought  overall still great for solo trips  works great  the   person is more a   person with a twin air mattress  overall great for myself when camping with twin air mattress  enough room for me to set in my back pack and shoes at night      
582,4.0,                       really like this tent  we bought it for a bike trip where the organizers haul your gear  it s big enough for two and gear with no problem    would fit  but four people better really like each other  did not see it perform in rain  but it does have great ventilation when it s warm  easy to set up  as my wife and sister with arm in a sling put it up in no time  now putting it back in the bag is akin to folding a road map  takes a couple times to figure it out  key is fold it to a width shorter than the bag and roll it up  i would have given it   stars  but the stakes are pretty crappy  they say it is a backpack tent  but it s pretty heavy for that  we have a sierra design that weighs a fourth of this one and roughly half the size and we think it s heavy  i can t imagine carrying this beast for a week      
583,5.0,                       i am usually quite particular about my camping equipment  but i took the tent out for a three day trip and its performance far exceeded my expectations  definitely impressed with the sleek  simple to assemble design and its ability to keep out rain and all kinds of moisture  also  the ground vent is a really neat feature and the bag is perfect size yet just to be that much better  coleman made it possible to expand it even more by ripping a seam  just to assert their dominance as a tent manufacturer  a bold move  coleman  in my opinion  the tent is worth more than     for a one man tent  two is stretching it   my only complaint is it could be just a little bit longer  as i am only       and my feet were flat against the back of the tent  if you sleep at a diagonal it helps but that would be a bit awkward if you add in a second person  overall  would recommend      
584,4.0,                       this tent is inexpensive but well made  biggest problem  two huge windows that can t be covered to stop wind  and unless you have the rainfly on  people can just look in the window if it s lit inside  but it s plenty roomy for my needs  for certain  and like i said  it appears to be pretty well made      
585,4.0,                       i used this for the better part of last summer and it was a great tent  after reading other reviews i used some seam sealer before first use and i assume it either did its job or i didn t need it  either way the seams didn t leak the tent is very spacious for two  did not try it with three  but there seems to be ample room for a third if needed  i usually buy a three person for two people for the added storage space for packs and what not as i m sure a lot of others do as well the ventilation is great for muggy nights but i did make a mistake the second night i used it because i was on a bit of a slope and we had some sideways rain that night that found its way under the rain cover and into the tent  luckily it wasn t a lot but it was pretty unfortunate sitting there watching the rain drip in from the mesh  that was another reason why i know the seams didn t leak because all the water stayed inside  i haven t had a problem with rain other than instance so the rain cover does work  just not under those particular conditions the durability seems to be above average  i am slightly concerned the poles may break after a summer or two but as long as i m cautious and don t stress them too much then i think it ll be fine the setup is extremely easy and straight forward  i have set it up at night a few times and it was just as easy as setting it up in daylight for me  the hooks on the tent are really convenient for stretching it out to the poles and work well overall this was a great purchase for me and i hope to use it for several summers as long as i don t do something dumb and rip it or something  i really wanted the previous orange version but wasn t able to get it for the lower price of this one even though it is the exact same tent  oh well  the green looks good regardless      
586,5.0,                       this tent is amazing  we had the first time experience with camping and yes we are so satisfied the price is really very reasonable and it is worth buying we had a wonderful camping at night  and we even can sleep so good  assembling and dissembling is super easy  i really love this coleman tent of   person  for three of us we had enough room to keep all our essential stuffs that are required in night  i will recommend anyone in  buying      
587,5.0,                       really roomy and easy to setup  plenty of room for myself and my      husband  we even were able to put an air mattress inside to sleep on  great ceiling height  really liked the windows  the zippers were sturdy on the closures  it did not leak when a shower came through  protected us pretty well from bugs and such  the quality was good and lightweight      
588,1.0,                       i m a camping newbie  so i was very happy that the tent was amazingly easy to put up and put away not very happy that the carry bag arrived damaged  two slits on the edge   i expected the whole item to arrive in perfect condition for the amount that i paid      
589,5.0,                       my niece   i went on a cross country camping trip stopping at four national parks   this tent was awesome   our one night in the badlands we had a horrific wind and rain storm with no problem   no leaks   very easy to put up and take down   the only negative  which we read about several times  is that the stakes that come with the tent are useless   take extra or buy new ones   we used a queen size mattress which fit snuggly end to end with room on the sides for our gear   i m       female and kinda fit perfectly end to end so i m pretty sure a    guy may have some difficulty sleeping without his feet protruding from the tent   i will note our air mattress was very high so we probably lost some inches with the curvature of the tent      
590,5.0,                       i came back to purchase the coleman sundome   person tent after owning the   person sundome tent for the last   years  it s still going strong    this   person tent is the same design as coleman s   person version with the only difference being that this tent is  ft x  ft   ft wider than the  ft x  ft i was using before    the ventilation is good  i always use the rain fly  and have never woken up wet in the morning  i wouldn t suggest this tent for sleeping   adults    adults  and a small child is possible though  setup   takedown is easy  i set this tent up in just   minutes by myself  you really can t go wrong with the coleman sundome   person tent at a price of less than      i would highly recommend it over any other brand tent in the same price range      
591,5.0,                       used this tent over the weekend on table rock lake in the ozarks  easily fit our blow up mattress with myself  wife and daughter  sister in law also fit in a sleeping bag  a few people in our party said they wanted to get the same tent for next time  went up in no time and the instructions are swen in to the bag  definitely need to get a tarp for underneath  the floor is very thin i read some people are having trouble getting it back in the bag  on the bottom of the bag there is a tear away strip to make the bag bigger  i was able to fit the tent and tarp in the bag after that  though it looks a little funky      
592,5.0,                       i d be darned  bought this thinking it would be temporary until we could afford an upgrade  did not expect this to be as sturdy as it is  it s gone through washington rainy camping trips and arizona monsoons where heavy rain is coming down sideways and we have stayed bone dry  light weight  easy to set up and pack  i feel like i m really hyping it up but for the price this thing is wildly impressive      
593,4.0,                       my little boy and i were excited to open this coleman   person tent so i went ahead and popped it up in our living room  we are going on a road trip to albuquerque new mexico and needed something with fast set up since we will be going to several camp sites and big enough for my husband  myself  plus our three young kids      and     this fit the bill super easy set up took less then    minutes straight out of the box and a good space for sleeping   this will be plenty of room for us  as pictured here the tent fit two twin size blow up intex mattresses with room to spare for bags and what not  i think it will work out great for us if i have any issues i ll update the review      
594,4.0,                       finally got around to setting this thing up   i set it up in the back yard on a day that was supposed to rain a lot and overnight  i set it up by myself  took about    minutes  fairly easy to do but the poles are very  very long and get caught on the pole slots from time to time  i set it up on a polythelene rip stop camo tarp and put a canvas tarp inside  then sealed the interior seams  it s inverse stitch for water proofing  but i always seal anyway  and about an hour latter it started to rain   basically i was testing it in a colorado storm   the next day i checked it out and it was dry inside  no leaking was detected   we will camp in it soon so if anything changes i ll repost   but the bottom of the tent floor is some sort of water proof  plastic feeling material  i suggest making sure you scour the ground you set up on for rocks and twigs etc that might puncture it      
595,3.0,                       the tent works fine and seems to have a very durable bottom   it loses two stars for overrating the capacity by two people   there is no way a family of   is sleeping in this tent together   two people max if you put an air mattress in there   if you want to sleep on the ground then maybe three but it would be cramped   what they don t bother considering is that each person likely comes with a bag   if you re wall to wall people  where do the bags go   this is a nice two person tent   if you need to sleep four people then keep looking        
596,3.0,                       not really weather windproof but if you are not camping in extreme conditions you should be fine  had to buy more durable brackets to keep it in the ground    people fit in fine  wouldn t recommend to more serious campers but for few days in a year you will survive      
597,3.0,                       i m not a happy camper  using my tent during a rain storm and all four corners leak  it s leaking right where the black strip is where corners come together  quite a bit of water in each corner make sure to check your tent in the rain before you depend on it to keep you dry otherwise i like this tent  it s light and easy to put up by myself      
598,5.0,                       i have had tents from coleman in the past and know they are of decent build quality  i can say this tent is no exception  it is a breeze to set up  even alone in under    minutes  i bought the   person and it was able to fit a queen sized air mattress with plenty of storage room along the side for myself and my girlfriend  the second night of use the sky opened up and even in an absolute downpour not a drop came through  i like the fact that it has a floor vent to keep air flow up and even with the windows zipped down  no water came through under the rain tarp  the only thing i am concerned about in longer use is the flooring material seems a bit thin  i put my on top of a tarp and even on rough rocky ground it seemed to hold up fine but just something to keep in mind  this is a great tent although if you are backpacking definitely look elsewhere as it is not ultra portable  also this was summer camping so i have no opinion how this would hold up to snow or extreme cold      
599,1.0,                       this tent began ripping on our  rd set up  we were in great weather  no wind or rain  on the top  a hole has been sliced in the fabric that holds the support poles  one of the fiberglass poles also began splintering  we aren t rough on tents and we set them up properly  very disappointed in the lifespan of the tent  it is large enough to accommodate   sleeping pads  or   and a walkway  it was cool during the day and not too hot at night  but if it isn t going to hold up for more than   set ups  it is not worth the money      
600,5.0,                       i took this to a bluegrass festival for three days on oahu   first time i have slept in a tent in over thirty years  but this tent was fine   very easy to set up and take down   i like the two storage pockets inside  too   it was just me and my guitar  mandolin and duffel bag in the tent  enough room   two people could fit  but then i think the gear would have to stay outside   it didn t rain  so unfortunately i can t say how waterproof it is     i recommend this one    there were other coleman tents too  all sizes   people seemed to really like them   update  almost   years later  i still love this tent  i have used it   times since i purchased it    out of the   times it rained  tent stayed fairly dry on the inside  maybe a tiny bit of leakage in the seams the last time i used it  there was also condensation  but that couldn t be helped  considering the humidity  i am about to use it again next week  this time i sprayed it well with water proofing  both top  fly  and bottom i have to say it is a little tricky getting in and out of  i am       not a spring chicken    my next tent will have a better entry  with more of a cover   months later  this little tent survived a deluge over the weekend  about   inches of rain dumped on us  i wasn t in it at the time  and it came through with flying colors  just a tiny bit of seepage around the edges  amazing  the ground was very boggy  i had a tarp under the tent  and all was good  definitely   stars for this little gem ps  i would recommend this for one person plus gear  i think   people plus gear would be too crowded  if you can store your stuff elsewhere  then it would work  but i camp alone  and would not want anything smaller      
601,5.0,                       coleman is well known for the quality of its products  i thought the top of the tent was sealed  but it s not   there is a portion of the top of the dome that is mesh  which is nice if you want ventilation and to have a view of the sky  there s also a rain fly to put over the top to cover the mesh in case it does rain   this was no fault of coleman s though   just my ignorance and i hope it helps some of you better prepare by determining if this is the right tent model for your adventures  good for outdoors  good for the rain  aside from that  the tent was sturdy and i was able to put it together by myself in about    minutes  there are side pockets on the inside  and there s placement to hang a lantern from the center on the inside for light at night  the description says its a   person tent  and it probably could fit four  average  sized people tightly together without luggage  but it s good sizing for a couple with luggage  and maybe a third depending on how tall big you all are  highly recommend      
602,4.0,                       i have very little to complain about this camping tent  however  the mounting pegs bend way too easy and should be reinforced for future product releases  different camp sites require different mounting force  these pegs are not designed for tough earth that is for sure wouldn t buy again  had to get different pegs after camping trip      
603,5.0,                       this  tent has truly stood the test of time with a little tent sealant  i put tarps under and over the top and i have slept dry for days in this thing  even when it rained for   days straight after hurricane harvey  my friends always ask me how i keep my tent from being flooded  and i can say with confidence that it s both the quality of this tent and the coleman tent sealer i put inside        worth the purchase  it lasted me all festival season  i m hoping it lasts for years to come      
604,5.0,                       in terms of price paid vs weight  it s good value  i only do over night trips  so i don t really need to focus so much on the weight side  the tent s waterproofing worked well  on the first trip my carefully selected location in the dark turned out to be prone to flooding  when i woke with a waterbed feeling in the morning i expected the worst  instead everything was nice and dry      
605,5.0,                       this took about    min to setup    it took a bit longer because i had my son helping on his first camp out and we also cleared the are and put down a  x  ground cloth first and he wanted to make it all perfect    the weather did dip into the   s and we were comfortable thanks to good sleeping bags    it was quite windy and our tent stood with no issues and we were dry as well     also  breakdown was easy too   it was cold when we left the campsite and at breakdown and putting the tent away took no time at all   i kept the rain fly separate a it was frost covered and let it air out at home  this made my sons for camp out a great success        
606,1.0,                       first trip with it i noticed that the rear window zipper was snagged on the screen   not even sure how that can happen as they should be on different planes   anyway  i can t open the window because it is snagged and there is a hole in the screen   i would of tried to return  but i had already camp dried and seam sealed the tent   i wish i would of noticed before i did all that      
607,2.0,                       i m really disappointed in the quality of this tent  i decided to set it up before i took it out camping to see how easy it was to set up and put some seam sealer on it  i m so glad i did  while the tent set up was everything they said it would be  less than    min for one person   the quality and craftsmanship of the tent were terrible  the stitching was unraveling on the rain fly in   places and there was a hole about half the size of a dime where the seams met in the back corner of the tent  i wrapped it up and asked for a refund  glad i m still within the return window  i gave   stars instead of one because of the ease of set up and take down      
608,4.0,                       this tent was purchased as a gift for my daughter s  th birthday  we do a few small camp outs a year  and one big festival every year and she has decided that she is old enough to sleep in her own tent  we helped her set it up  fairly easy and straight forward assembly  last weekend on a camp out with friends at a state park  we put her in there on a regular twin air mattress which takes up all the length and     of the width  so far it seems pretty good for a child s first tent  we have not tested it out in rainy conditions yet  so i can t speak to that  but i do have a slight concern that the lower vent window  that does not close  would let some amount of rain in even if the rain fly is properly staked out  it also means that you will be nice and chilly if it is a windy  cool night because there is no way to keep the wind from coming right in over you as you sleep  great feature in a hot summer  but not a bonus for other times of year  so  all in all  a great little tent for one person  two might fit if you forgo the luxury of an air mattress  but you better be pretty friendly with each other  great for summer camping  it seems  but that little vent window brings it down a star for us  i made my daughter sleep in with us on the second night of our trip because of a very windy cold front  and i m glad she did  she would have been freezing in this tent  we were all cold enough in our tent which zips up tight against the wind      
609,5.0,                       i bought this after a fishing trip with a friend who had the   person sun dome  i use this for motorcycle camping and it has already withstood high winds and torrential rain storms  i stayed completely dry in this tent and the venting also prevents any condensation build up whatsoever  i own many high end backpack tents but this coleman performs better than any of those at a fraction of the cost      
610,4.0,                       love the ease of setup on this tent  took my boyfriend and i      minutes to set it up is all  last night it poureddddd rain on us and we did not get wet at all so the protection works well i only have   cons  the stakes for the ground are flimsy  we bent two pushing them in to pretty soft ground  also it says it s a   person tent but it s more a   person tent  we are not big people  especially if you each have a backpack for the weekend or whatever overall love it though for the price and our weekend getaways in wisconsin      
611,4.0,                       was excited to get    love the color and nothing is more important than looking good on the trail    just an old backpacking slogan    i can stand up with a slight tilt of my head in the center and i am   foot     it will fit four people shoulder to shoulder but i am trying to figure out how i am going to use it for a trip to yellowstone where  i want to fit three cots or three twin air mattresses   update on         it fits a queen sized  seems more like full  and a twin air mattress with enough space to have a small walking space  about the width of your foot      inches    the mattress take up all the space   i ll get a second smaller tent to house our gear when were are out of camp  clothing  camp chairs  tables    i also used silicon spray to water proof the tent because the mattress take up the entire floor of tent except the six inches between the two i bought it because it small and wouldn t take up much space in my trunk as everything needs  it seems well constructed and was super easy to put up by myself i ll buy new tent stakes as the ones that come with aren t great   it didn t fit back in the bag   i am going to have to work at it would recommend      
612,5.0,                       this was a breeze to set up and withstood rain like a champion   the air vents are well placed  and i was able to regulate the circulation temperature the tent is listed as holding three adults  but i would keep it to two adults or one adult the instructions were clear  and there are storage compartments for the components      
613,2.0,                       first  the tent is spacious  i can stand up in the middle of the tent  while it s technically water resistant water proof  it was also the only tent at the camp site to collapse and did so with the first gust of a thunderstorm rendering its water resistance useless  the zippers have degraded in quality since my last purchase of a coleman tent  jamming at every attempt to open or close the entrance exit  it would make a fine summer  back yard tent  but if you re planning on camping  be prepared to sleep elsewhere in a storm      
614,5.0,                       before you read the reviews  look at the price  this is a very reasonably priced tent  and its quality far exceeds its price  sure  it s not the      tents that withstand       degree weather and      mph winds that you may find at rei or other camping stores  but it is the perfect car camping tent for a family of   or   who camps a few weekends throughout the year  it is light weight  takes up almost no space in the car  sets up incredibly easily  is easy to re pack  withstands rain  it rained on me my second night using it  and high winds  camped on top of dead horse point in utah on one of the windiest september nights   and has two storage pockets and a lantern hanging hook within  i do not recommend it for backpacking as it is too big to carry in your pack  but if you are like me  and prefer camping       days out of the year from your car  this is the tent for you  i anticipate it will last me multiple years  fantastic value one note    i threw a heavy rock into the internal tent corner to anchor it down while setting up  and unfortunately  it hit another rock beneath it and slightly tore the bottom tarp  that being said  this is human error   not tent error   but be careful nevertheless      
615,5.0,                       this tent is amazing  i purchased this tent to add to my other two i have  this tent was for two adults with a small area for your personal items  i also had a queen size raised air mattress which took most of the room but still had some space to walk around in  i m      and was able to stand up with no problem  very easy to set up and ready in about    minutes with two people compared to my much order style tents which those take up to    minutes each and need more then two people  with two of the four sides screened all the way to the top makes great air flow in the summers but can be to open for the cold weather when winds are high  air will flow right throw the tent overall a very good tent and would definitely recommend      
616,1.0,                       after single   night backyard use  opened up for night    a month later to find elastic in tent fly pole had snapped  not high quality  very disappointed as we thought we d found a real winner      
617,5.0,                       i bought this back in july and only recently went camping  this tent is lightweight  setting it up was a breeze  and i love that the carrying bag expands for when  inevitably  the tent doesn t fold back to its original size  i like that there s plenty of ventilation  small storage pouches  and a place at the dome to hang a light  while it s considered a   person tent  i d say it s perfect for two people and a dog  or two  to spread out      
618,5.0,                       this is a very well constructed tent  i took my son on a camping trip recently and this tent kept us dry and comfortable throughout the night  it is a very large tent with plenty of room for   people and all of their gear  it s very easy to set up since i was able to set it up all on my own  with   adults setting this thing up  it would probably be super easy and you could have it up within    minutes  everything seems to be very high quality  i think coleman really hit this one out of the park      
619,4.0,                       easy to set up  easy to get back in the bag after taking the tent down  reasonably sturdy and lightweight  can t speak to weather proof or water resistance as i haven t used it in foul weather  very happy so far note that if you re near or over    tall this tent will probably be too short  i m      tall and wouldn t have minded a bit more length      
620,5.0,                       easy to setup  super fast with two people   easy to take down  craftsmanship is standard for coleman camping equipment  one recommendation i would make is more window vents  there are two  including the front door   before you buy  though  remember that when any camping tent product says   person tent  it s code for   person  that s why i bought the   person tent  it s comfortable for two people and for storing their stuff inside the tent      
621,5.0,                       my    year old and i took this on our first backpacking trip together  i wish it was a little lighter but overall it s great tent  we were in     degree texas heat and the tent didn t get very hot  it was very easy to set up  inside we had plenty of room to move around      
622,4.0,                       good size for two people and their gear  it goes up well  easy to fit back into packaging and is as compact as you could hope for a tent of this size  there is one open window on the roof that does not close  can only be covered with the rain fly  shouldn t be a problem  as i am sure it provides good airflow      
623,3.0,                       update       i find the  tent pole sleeve  design to be a huge pain compared to other tents that use plastic c shaped fasteners to secure the poles to the body  with sleeves the poles always catch so you spend time pushing  wiggling  pushing  wiggling  until finally you get both poles through  then repeat that annoying process for teardown  with c connectors you can connect the poles to the corners and start connecting clips in whatever order you feel like  this is probably the    reason i won t buy this tent again on the plus side  this tent has held up well in numerous heavy rainstorms  one time there were several inches of water outside but nothing came through   the floor felt like a waterbed with the inch or so of water under the tent  quite impressed  however    sides of the tent are screen mesh without any ability to close  in heavy storms with wind some mist will get inside  i got a little damp and it kept me from sleeping well  but i was mostly dry and plenty warm in heavy wind at big bend and the beach you will need to tie additional guy lines to keep the tent from caving in  unfortunately there aren t any connection points for this on the rain fly  i ended up looping rope under the fly and inside some of the tent pole sleeve openings  but it was far from perfect                          this ok tent is overpriced  my previous car camping tent was the   x   timber creek cumberland ii dome tent that cost     from academy  it worked great for about   years until the door zipper blew out  i could probably get it fixed but i decided to  level up  and get this coleman tent  i figure it costs    x more  it must have great zippers  seams  design  etc  well i must say i m disappointed  i should have just bought another timer creek cons the coleman tent barely fits my queen airbed  it has to go in sideways  long direction faces the door   which means one person has to climb over the other person  in this configuration one of the handy storage pockets hangs in your face  the other gets whacked by your feet  my timber creek tent had a clever  attic  mesh storage that was great for things like a headlamp  glasses  etc  the coleman has a small round plastic loop that could be used to hang something  if you remember to bring some string or a very small carabiner     person  is a huge stretch  it is really a   adult tent  and even that will feel a bit cramped pros very easy to set up  i like the way the rain fly cantilevers over the front and back using a pole  providing good rain drainage for the screened windows  as well as shade  the rain fly system seems to be well designed to make minimal contact with the tent for maximum time before  wetting out       
624,4.0,                       this is a very nice tent   we set it up for the first time on the campsite  without testing it first  and it went up very easily   shortly after setting it up it poured rain for hours  and the tent stayed dry  even as water was pooling in the site   all of the seams and zippers seemed to be well made   it also has a really nice look to it the only  slightly  negative aspect is that it is not really designed for cold weather   the tent is very airy and the rain fly protects from rain  but due to the open space between the rain fly and the windows it doesn t retain any warmth   this is not necessarily a bad quality  unless you plan to camp in very cold weather all the time and come unprepared   we used it in mid september and unfortunately had a spell of temps in the    s overnight   in warm weather this would be perfect overall  i would definitely recommend this tent      
625,5.0,                    recomiendo es perfecta pero es para una cama inflable queen y queda unos   x   cm disponible para usar de pie o moverse   yo me equivoqu  pensando que daria una cama queen y una full ojo para evitar mi equivocaci n les comento as  uds puedan decidir   comprar kit de anclas m s grandes para instalar la tienda o carpa y llevar un martillo         
626,5.0,                       i made a quick purchase before a camping trip and got this tent  i did a lot of research as i wanted one that would last a while  got it within   days  thanks amazon   and took it to the campgrounds  my friends and i set it up  but it took a little longer than expected  i must say as nice as this tent is  the direction weren t that direct when it came putting it together  was a little harder than we were led to believe  that s ok  once it was up  it was very room and cozy  three people can comfortably fit inside along with you backpacks  i like that it had a storage zipper for your phone  the one thing that i did not like was the entrance to the tent was a bit tight  i with it was a square shaped zippered door rather than rounded  would have been a little easier getting in and out  haven t tried this in the rain yet  but it seems to be durable enough      
627,5.0,                       purchased for my daughter and grandkids to do an overnight campout sponsored by the school s dad s club   this was her first experience with overnight camping and setting up a tent by herself   she was very happy with the ease of setting up and the tent was exactly as described and kept them comfortable overnight   i also purchased a queen sized air mattress and there was plenty of room inside the tent for the kids  their friends  and camping  stuff    take a look at the pictures with the air mattress inside along with kids sitting on a rug she took with her      
628,5.0,                       i  love  this  tent  i have been camping in this tent more times thank can count on trips ranging from my friend s backyards to the middle of nowhere in upstate new york  it has rained half of those times and every time this tent has held up brilliantly  as long as you set up the rain fly right  which is pretty easy  you will stay dry even with the windows open  the ventilation is also amazing even with the rain fly it never feels stuffy  the tent says it s for   people but if you re down for some snuggling you can fit   or   comfortably  i ve also fit an entire queen sized air mattress in here with room for gear  it s nothing fancy it s just an all around good tent that does it s job well      
629,5.0,                       i bought this a few years ago as the tent that i had was pretty old and a huge pain to set up this tent is great   it s not as lightweight as some of the more expensive tents   so it s not that greatest for lightweight backpacking  but it s durable and a great tent to bring with for car camping i had taken it on multiple trips and had always been great it states it s a   person tent  and you can certainly fit   people in it for sleeping   but you won t be able to move around much   i find it to be the perfect size for my girlfriend and i it did get a tiny rip on the bottom on the first time i used it   but that was due to me setting it up on a stick and failing to completely clear out the area before setting it up i had brough this with me to the everglades   and because it was green the tree frogs absolutely loved it   every morning i d wake up to around    tree frogs perched on it   awesome      
630,4.0,                       i got tired of asking friends to borrow there s and this was cheap  it worked for my needs but it is small  you have to subject   from the size the size they say  i m      and my mattress was pool float which is a lotta thinner than a twin i m single and short so it was perfect for my needs for this trip but idk how taller people can do this it fit my cooler  mid size  and my backpack and a dry food bag and water gallon and my walkway out the  door  was still clear i had another bag that i didn t put inside  it would have been to crowed quality was good  went up and down quick  i m in socal  summer  it didn t rain      
631,5.0,                       i love this tent so much   i had registered for a multi day bike ride  and was in fairly last minute need of a tent   i m not a big camper  yet  and had never owned my own tent before  so i  like so many of my peers as it turned out  took to the internet to buy the cheapest tent i could find   to my surprise  the first night of the ride it absolutely poured rain   while many people had leaky roofs or corners of their tents  i was cozily tucked away under my tent s rain fly  with not a single drop on me   the very edges of the tent did get a little dewy  but nothing more than that i landed on this coleman   person tent  which was incredibly roomy for one  and fit two people and their gear snugly but comfortably the tent was simple and easy to set up  and the bottom of the tent is itself a tarp  so while i still recommend buying using a tarp of your own  this tent does not come with one   you will definitely be able to sneak by without it   the tent was nice and airy and was great at keeping bugs out   it s not terribly windproof and i certainly wouldn t use it in colder weather  but its an absolutely wonderful starter tent for those of us exploring our wilderness side      
632,5.0,                       great little tent  first time i ve been camping in     years  so i bit of a learning curve  this was a great tent  we had two twin inflatable mattresses with about a foot and a half of room between the two allowing for personal bags and such  the ventilation is great  we did encounter our fair share of rain and it held up nicely  but at a certain point we used an overhead tarp  it is not tall enough to fully stand up in  just a heads up  super easy set up and break down     minutes or less with two people  would recommend      
633,5.0,                       this tent is excellent for doing some quick car camping  the weatherproof features seem to have hold up while using it during a light downpour  plenty of space with the   person option as well  surprisingly the tent is pretty lightweight when packed up in the carrying case  i definitely recommend if you re doing weekend trips and not hiking long distances      
634,5.0,                       it s great on all aspects  i used it many times already  it s waterproof  no holes or damage so far  comfortable  just keep in mind that it allows you to put   sleeping pads and there will be no more room for your belongings like a backpack and shoes  for   adults i d recommend to buy the   person model      
635,5.0,                       had my tent for a few years now and it has held up very well  when rain cover is on correctly  tent is totally waterproof  even in high wind  love the small zipper opening at the corner of the tent for electrical cords  also the ring at the top to hang a light is useful  and the two netted bags on each side  inside  for keys and phone are very useful      
636,4.0,                       i just used this tent for four nights on a car camping trip   on the second night it rained fairly steady  and in the morning  all our stuff was bone dry  including a lot of flannel cloth that was touching the tent wall   others have mentioned a design flaw in the velcro clips on the under side of the rain fly   they are in the wrong place  so you have to clip them around the tent sleeve instead of just the pole   it was workable  but they should fix it   the rain fly is otherwise very well designed      
637,5.0,                       bought this for a motorcycle camping trip   i have a   person tent but it s way to big to haul on a bike   this packs up to an easy size that can be tied down to the back seat of the bike   perfect size for   adults and all their gear   easy to set up and take down   i haven t used it in the rain yet  so can t say how good the rain fly works   i wouldn t use it on a hard core expedition  or to hike the pct  but perfect for the usual car or motocycle camping      
638,5.0,                       way bigger on the inside than we ever imagined    cots  all our gear and we ended up in this tent playing cards drinking all night with the campers next door  plenty of room for everyone  oh and the wind didn t blow us over like other tents in the campground  the first   nights we used it were sever wind and rain storms  then fish on      
639,5.0,                       my boyfriend and i bought this tent to go camping for a weekend  we bought the   person size  and i m so glad we did  anything smaller would ve been a bit cramped  we were able to fit   air mattresses inside and had a bit more room on the side  we kept it zipped up the entire time and it didn t get too hot in the tent  it also wasn t super bright when we woke up  it was great for our weekend camping trip      
640,5.0,                       i love this tent  i am horrible at setting up tents but this was very easy  first time did it by myself in about    minutes  considering the price it s a great deal and will work perfect for amateur campers or for festivals i noticed some people rated it lower due to getting wet but you just gotta use common sense  i always spray with seam seal    can will cover rain guard twice  main tent once   and i always bring a tarp to layout underneath the campsite  i ve had no problems yet  the only thing is that it s so easy because you only use   poles for the tent  it s held up fine in wind so far but if your looking for a tent to use in extreme weather this may not be it      
641,5.0,                       we ve gone camping three times with this tent now and it s working great  i have a   year old and a   year old  and this   person tent is working perfect  we use a queen sized air mattress  child sized air mattress and an adult sized sleeping pad with four sleeping bags  pillows  blankets  and enough room to put our luggage inside too  large tent but fits everything nicely  so far we ve had not problems with it      
642,4.0,                       well  can t truly say first time but last time was as a child when the parents did all the work and all we kids had to do was stay out of the way lol pros  nice clear instructions on the tent storage bag so you don t lose them  good storage bags for poles and stakes  easy to assemble for a first timer  good ventilation and condensation control vent  overall excellent design for a smaller tent cons  the rain fly was a bit of a pain for only one person to put on   this might be my lack of experience so this isn t why i docked a star   the storage bag isn t quite roomy enough to actually get the tent back in the bag easily   you have to really pack this sucker down to do it   wish they d made the storage bag just an inch longer on all the sides so you wouldn t have to take so much time when folding this and trying to pack it away   that just took way too long and wasted boatloads of time which is why i docked a star        
643,5.0,                       so i bought this   person tent for me and my fella to go camping for a weekend at a state park campsite pros we had a queen air mattress that fit with plenty of space for our belongings and to move around without feeling like a sardine  it rained all weekend  i mean it poured and this sucker kept us dry it seemed to be a well made tent  the bottom is a tarp like material  the whole tent was easy to assemble and seemed sturdy   and it packs down pretty small and was easy to store cons it did sweat with the temperature change  it was a     change after above rain shower  and anything pressed up against the side was damp  any tent would probably do this honestly the rain cover doesn t leave you much space to leave your shoes outside of the tent without getting wet   the eureka apex  xt rain cover  tent is great about this and i wish there was a door  vent on both sides but overall  as an amateur camper i found this to be a great purchase  and would recommend it to anyone looking for a well made  reasonably priced tent      
644,4.0,                       this  six person  tent was perfect for giving my kids enough space to have their two twin air mattresses and still have room for their bags and not be on top of each other   as a      adult  it wasn t quite big enough for me to stand up in  but i got this for the kids anyway  and they have no such problem it actually poured rain the first night that i used this  and it stayed reliably dry inside   can t ask for more than that the directions for this tent were pretty straightforward  save for the fly pole   it runs along the top from the front  entrance  to the rear  unlike most i ve seen  that form an arch above the entrance   it s possible that my expectations tainted my experience though i took off one star because of the instructions  the weight  and the color  meh    still  it s a great value for the price   while a bit heavy for backpacking  it packs up into a very small package  so it s great for trunk camping  which is as rugged as i like to get   i have no buyers remorse  and would definitely buy this again      
645,5.0,                       as with all these tents    person really means   person   i had myself    kids  and our gear in the tent and we had plenty of room   another person would fit easily but   or   and you can forget having room for your stuff   nice that you can stand up in at as well and has a loop for hanging a lantern inside   like the little pockets on each side which are great for finding your phone glasses flashlight in the middle of the night   easy to put up take down and comes with a nice carrying bag      
646,5.0,                       amazing tent   i purchased this tent for my son and i in order to go camping over the weekend with boy scouts   we were able to fit a child air mattress and an adult air mattress inside and still had room for a clothing bags  food box and shoes etc   we were also able to still stand and change clothes as well   it rained a bit while we were there but no rain came inside at all   everything was dry  even the corners   great tent for our first time camping   if you have no clue how to put a tent together  this is the perfect tent because it was simple and took    or less minutes      
647,4.0,                       overall  really great tent  super super easy to set up  one person could do it on their own very easily  the only thing i don t like is that it has   huge mesh windows that don t have zip up covers on them  if you want any privacy at all  you have to put on the rain fly  which doesn t seem like it would keep the rain out very well  i m not sure that   adults could comfortably sleep in here  though  my husband  daughter  and myself slept in here just fine  but another person would have been way to cramped  other than that  this tent was exactly what we needed  we ll definitely be using this again next summer  as long as its not supposed to rain       
648,5.0,                       this is a quality and very affordable tent  it does well in the weather and wasn t overly hot in the summer either  we bought this as a gift for my brother and he loved it  driving around the national park we were in  i counted over    other people using this so it s quite popular  comfortable for four people  definitely recommend      
649,5.0,                       decided to set up a backyard camp for my partner  who hasn t been a camp counselor for some years and is feeling a little campsick the tent was a little difficult to set up    but that was only because i m unnecessarily stubborn and i tried to do it without reading the directions  once i did  it was eezy peezy lemon squeezy  and it stood up to a pretty intense summer thunderstorm  with only a drip or two of water inside  this city girl is pretty impressed      
650,3.0,                       got it for a backpacking trip and it turned out to be too heavy  so i will be returning this  it s a good price and quality for a basic tent if you re going car camping and don t have to carry it on a long hike though  it s also smaller than advertised   it says the   person fits a queen bed but when we tested it there was barely enough space for   sleeping bags sleeping pads   our bags      
651,3.0,                       decent tent for the price but performed horribly when temps got into the    s  the two side windows can not be closed and are only covered by the rain fly   cold air flowed into the tent easily with no way to retain body heat   dew also soaked thru the walls of the tent overnight so i m unsure of its performance with heavy rain   would only recommend for warmer nighttime temperatures      
652,5.0,                       hiked it in for a primitive camping weekend  probably not the most compact tent for hiking to campsite  however  i brought it because i knew it was going to be a rainy trip  i will say this tent kept me and my gear perfectly dry the entire time  even after a few really heavy downpours  the dryness wasn t compromised even a bit      
653,5.0,                       it s very easy to put up  absolutely ideal for beginners  during our camp trip there was a heavy thunderstorm the tent was fine we even slept all night in the rain  it includes all the pegs you need no need to buy more  only thing i would say is that it s really only good for   people even tho it says it s for     we took inflatable mattress queen and it was just perfect for the two of us     
654,5.0,                       we immediately tested this tent in the monsoons outside santa fe   the tent was easy to put up  the rain fly did it s job well  and the air flow in the tent is good   this is a solid purchase   the second time we used the tent  outside ouray  co  it took about   minutes to put up   as others have said  this is not a backpacking tent  but it is perfect for   people on a queen size inflatable mattress  with a bit of room to spare on either side   highly recommended      
655,5.0,                       i absolutely love this tent  i got this for my son  i  and any friends or family that would love to join for campjng trips or just backyard camping  it is everything it claims to be  it is very weather resistent  it  rained some and was windy and no water leaked into the tent  it is very warm and comfortable and has a lot of neat features  it is very easy to assemble and take apart  i got a rubber mallot so the stakes wouldnt be scraped and it works great also  but i would like to reiterate again at how weather resisistent it is  i would definitely recommend this tent without a doubt      
656,2.0,                       ok coleman guys   if you guys want les returns  less negative feedback in the future please be informative when it comes to internal measurements  it says   feet  i am      and my forehead and toes are sticking out of the tent so the rodents can nibble on it at night   and i noticed most of coleman tents on amazon are misleading or information isn t there  y all drunk i am returning my rent  it s on its way  please give a redbull drink to the guy who s imputing these details  correct it please      
657,4.0,                       great tent for the price  im not sure what some people on here where talking about this tent leaking in the rain  im guessing they were just ripped my first time using this tent it was raining for two days straight and it stayed dry in there but i also made sure to put a tarp down underneath it like anyone should do with any tent  it is a little to heavy and bulky for backpacking but possible with a good enough backpack      
658,5.0,                       i used this tent this past weekend in the shenandoah valley  it poured for about an hour straight on saturday and this baby held up just fine  there was one dime size drop of water in a corner  but that was my fault for not pinning down the rain fly  strings  guides leads on the sides  the hole for the electrical outlet also leaked a few drops  but i left it unzipped  whoops    it s very roomy  i can almost stand completely up and i am       the middle section held my small lantern well  and it was large enough to fit a queen sized air mattress  two large adults  a duffel bag  bookbag  fan and some extra things here and there  great tent to put together  super easy for a beginner  like me   and i got it up in less than    minutes  i will suggest a   x   tarp underneath to help with the dirt when you pack it up and the bumps under the tent   overall  awesome tent for what i paid and even recommended it to a friend who also used it this past weekend  they loved it      
659,5.0,                       i absolutely love this tent  so easy to put together  it is designed very well to make it super simple to put up and take down    minutes tops  love the colors and everything  good job coleman      
660,5.0,                       just what we needed  we have an earlier model of this same tent but needed a second for a family camping trip  i give this   stars because coleman is good quality  we have never had ripped zippers or tabs and this tent is easy to set up and pack away  beware though  this is a cozy three person tent  my husband and i use it with a single layer queen air mattress and its enough room to keep our bags in the corners and shoes tucked away and still have room for us to be comfortable    would be a crowd in here for adults  but we took our        and   year old nieces and nephew camping and this was a perfect fit for them and their bags  great buy      
661,4.0,                       this tent was very easy to put up and a great size   we put a queen sized air mattress and had room on both sides   definitely good for car camping   i would say it would fit   comfortably    might be really tight pro s  easy to put up good ventilation and windows tarp bottomnice carrying case to keep everythings good instructions that were sewn to the bag so you can t lose them con s coleman does a great job with tents  but you can tell this tent isn t made with the best quality   we have a pretty fancy backpacking tent and it is a lot smoother and the poles are nicer   however  this is a great deal for what you get      
662,5.0,                       i m no pro camper backpacker  but this does everything i need it to   i can put it up unassisted in    minutes   i have zero problems with the zippers or wetness   nicely vented  too   small and easy to pack   for the money  hard to beat   i do agree that   people is a stretch  but   is a cinch    i bought a    tarp from harbor freight to use as a footprint   for the casual weekend with your kid kind of camping  i can t see needing to pay more      
663,4.0,                       not sure how   people could fit in this one  unless you were descended from the munchkins in the wizard of oz   i m a tad over    and i fit    barely  have an intek inflatable twin and it was a challenge to get in inside the tent and required and angular approach and stretching the door  i could set up inside but little more room for gear now the good  super easy to set up and has great ventilation  for the difference in price which is minimal i feel the   person would ve been a better choice      
664,4.0,                       i used this tent last year for a hiking trip  it s not the lightest weight tent i ve seen out there  but for a budget minded person  it works well   the tent isn t the best quality  but it works well in fair weather conditions   i was the only person in my tent  and with my gear  it was about all you d want to fit   if you have two people wanting to fit in this tent  you may need to keep most of you gear outside   the tent is very easy to setup and take down   it packs away into a small space  and has a nice  floor mat  that you can use when you go in or out to put your shoes on   in colder weather  this tent isn t much more than a wind shield  and even there  with the vent on the back side that you cannot close  its really hard to keep warm  otherwise  it s a good starter tent for camping hiking      
665,5.0,                       this tent was amazing  i used it over the  th of july weekend when i went camping and it was perfect  very nice and spacious  my boyfriend and i put a queen size mattress in there and we still had plenty of room  it was very durable in different types of weather  we had it pour on us and no water or anything seeped in which was very nice  the side windows are also very helpful when its    degrees and you need some air flow  very pleased with this purchase   highly recommend      
666,5.0,                       first weekend i took it out and it poured for several hours  the last few tents stopped the water from immediately coming in  but if you bumped the tent it would shake water inside  this tent didnt even do that  it was rock solid and very dry  aside from my shoes that i left outside   it was also very cool even with the high humidity  definitely worth the purchase      
667,5.0,                       needed an additional tent for son on our family camping trip  just what we needed  easy to put up  only used once so far  so can not address durability   however with in eye site from our camp site  i saw three other same model tents   but they were older as their color was faded  i took that as a good sign the tent will last multiple years      
668,4.0,                       great value here      bucks for a heavy duty car camping tent from a name you can trust  china lolz   anyway  this tent is well designed by the coleman company  it is  made to good specs seam sealed   perfect amount of room for     people and some gear   center height is comfortable for   people to sit upright  at the same time   for dressing playing cards or whatever  it assembles fairly quick   but  the shock cord used in the poles is very thin and will most likely fail within a couple of set ups  i intend to replace it asap    stars because of that      
669,5.0,                       so far i ve only used this tent once  but it was a good experience   tent package is a bit bulky  but you can eliminate the carrying bag and store more compactly on your own   like most dome tents setup was easy   it is well constructed and kept out bugs and rain   keep in mind that although this is a   person tent and it will only hold   people and your sleeping bags   there is not any extra room   i know this may sound like common sense  but just wanted to make it clear   you won t be able to fit your gear inside with you   for one person  this tent is fantastic and has enough room for all your gear   overall   a solid product at a great price and i would definitely purchase again      
670,5.0,                       this tent is pretty sweet  i bought it to go camping  obviously  for my wife and i  now that our son is old enough to be in his own tent i was tired of putting up an   person    room     year old tent  i wanted something light and easy to set up  this met all my needs  it is easy and i can set it up by myself in    minutes  the included canopy to go over it when it s raining or what not was a nice bonus as well  it is very lightweight and folds nice and small  the only thing i didn t like was that it says three person but it really only fits   comfortably  it can fit   if you re all touching each other      
671,5.0,                       this tent was a lifesaver for me in a pinch  the tent held up to a pretty windy onslaught  the rainfly and tarped bottom kept rain from entering the tent  very happy with this purchase  more than spacious enough for     people  tent setup was quick for even just me  i had it setup in minutes pro tip  the bag this thing comes with opens up more than how it is originally packed  don t worry about refitting it into the bag  i forgot how it doubles open  but you ll have adequate room to easily fit the tent in      
672,3.0,                       i had never camped so i didn t have any reference when initially setting up this tent   i tested it out in my backyard   wanted to nix the idea of going camping all together just trying to put this tent up   after finally setting it up  it just didn t feel sturdy enough to sustain much weather  i ended up returning and purchasing an instant pop up tent from another brand   loved it      
673,5.0,                       the first time we used this tent we got it set up minutes before the rain started   it rained very hard for about    hours  we and all of our gear stayed dry all night   we spent five nights in the tent that trip and had no complaints it s easy to set up and the directions are clear  i love that they are attached to the bag so they cannot get lost  like all tents  you really need to upgrade the stakes   the ones that come with this tent are very thin and bend easily  for a few dollars get some decent ones  you won t regret it this is definitely a warm weather tent  there is no way to cover the mesh panels on the sides top  perfect for summer camping  though all in all we are very pleased with our purchase and the price we paid      
674,5.0,                       as a beginner  this tent was perfect  very easy to set up and even easier to pack away they was enough space for   double air mattresses  i used for   adults and   children and it was a snug fit  it was a little breezy one afternoon and the tent was fine  but i haven t had to use it on a rainy day if anything  i would ve probably gone for the same tent in its dark room version just for blocking out the morning sun a little longer all in all  it s a great tent      
675,5.0,                       the tent does what a tent should do  it kept me sheltered from the wind and rain and housed whatever equipment i didn t what outside  though it is a two man tent i would suggest using it as a one man if you don t mind the extra weight  it will just barely fit a coleman folding cot  it will be poking the sides out a bit  but it will fit      
676,5.0,                       first of all  don t buy this for   people  unless you buy     but you probably already know that  it fits   nicely  it could probably fit   if they are all using sleeping bags and don t need much space for belongings this tent worked really well for us    adults and a small dog   we were able to fit a queen airbed and still had room for our stuff  suit cases  coolers  bags of snacks  etc  we used      intex classic downy queen airbed                         since the tent is more of a rectangle than square  we found that our airbed could fit loosely one direction  or tightly in the other  we chose the tighter fit  with the foot of the bed toward the door  because this gave us more room on the other side of the tent for our stuff setting it up is fairly easy  it took us a while the first time  but we were in the very  very dark  late at night  using flashlights for the directions and setup  the fact that we succeeded in those conditions should testify to it s simplicity and i m so happy i bought a tent with a rain fly  because yes of course it rained  just to be safe  we put a tarp under the tent  because i hear it s a good habit  the walls of the tent seemed to get a little moist  but it felt like condensation  overall  we stayed dry  so we are pleased with this tent      
677,2.0,                       the quality of the tent was fine what i didn t like  is that it advertised itself as a  backpacking  tent which coming in at over   lbs  and it wouldn t fit in my    liter backpack      
678,5.0,                       this tent has performed very well for me   i don t plan camping trips if the forecast is over     rain  so i never thought i would need to care how this performed in the rain   well  long story short   i took this on a mountain biking trip and got caught in a rain storm   this tent did not leak a drop and was well ventilated   stop reading reviews and buy it      
679,2.0,                       we ve had this new version for two years now   tub floor and pole sleeves are a plus   the increased roof area has meant some very cold nites  the door and window screen are about half the size of the previous version  very frustrating to look out   after two years on our last trip the zipper started to fail   overall not happy with this new version      
680,1.0,                       i liked the size for two people  it was airy and i was really liking it  until it rained  woke up in the morning with water in every corner of the tent  i was disappointed as i have always had good luck with coleman products  if it were waterproof  as was stated in the advertisement  i would have given it   stars      
681,5.0,                       nice and roomy inside    adults would be a tight fit  though    would fit okay  it s easy for   person to set up in      minutes  once you ve done it once or twice  was exposed to a light rain for about an hour  before seam sealer was applied  oops  but not a drop got inside  it s a good fair weather tent  and is amazing for the price  nothing feels cheap about it  i ve had a few nice  little adventures in the woods thanks to it      
682,5.0,                       i got this for my eleven year old granddaughter  it is a good quality as tents go these days   they are all plastic   it is not too big and not too small  has room for at least two kids  we have not tested it in the rain yet  she used it in the house and outside  with a tarp underneath  she likes it   it was a good price  too  i think i got it on sale  i am pleased      
683,5.0,                       super pleased with the purchase  took about    minutes with   people to setup  was camping in lows of     weather at night with winds up to    mph and it stood the test of time  the vents in the top allow for maximum airflow  was able to fit   queen sized blowup mattresses side by side with about   feet of room in the front of the tent all the way across  my wife  myself  and our   kids had plenty of room  other peoples tents were ripping due to the high winds  not this one  has a hook for hanging a lantern and   side pockets for keys  flashlights  etc  would buy better stakes for it  definitely recommend      
684,5.0,                       i love it  i m      and can lay down flat with no issues  i have plenty of room  and then some  for myself  my dog  my gear  fairly easy to put together and take down  the only thing i d change is that i wish i had the option for a full screen door  so i could see out while laying down    but maybe that s just me      
685,4.0,                       firstly  with any and all tents  i recommend laying a tarp down first to prevent condensation and potential tearing  no tent floor will be sufficient to withstand a sharp rock or stick if you miss it when clearing ground the ventilation in this tent is superp  it s withstood insanely hot florida summers and kept me as cool as you can really get  it s been through a literal monsoon without a single leak and kept me dry all night  the entry way is big enough to enter and exit with relative comfort and the zip up windows along with the rain fly afford reasonable levels of privacy the one improvement i would suggest would be to make the rear vent  as of now  it s a stake out or stake in setup  a zip and stake  the campsite i was at during the monsoon flooded and the water was just a hair below that vent entry  would have been a mess      
686,5.0,                       i like how fast and easy this tent goes up or down   i find it very roomy   although we use it for   camper   not enough room for even   people camping    we have one that we used evey weekend for at least    yrs with no issues   so we decided to stick with this exact tent for our grandchild    no complaints         
687,2.0,                       spent one night in the tent  woke up to it raining  within just a couple hours it started leaking in through all   corners  horribly so from the front corner that has a little zipper near the floor  as i was trying to dry up that mess and figure out where it was coming from  the top of the black tape thing in each corner   water started leaking on to my back  it s a   star because it was good during the night  it didn t feel stuffy even though the temperature was around     all night  if you buy it just make absolutely sure theres no chance of rain  if the forecast changes then good luck      
688,5.0,                       i bought this a while back but never got a chance to test it out  finally went camping at great smokey mountains national park  they were predicting possible thunderstorms so we put the rain guard on before going to sleep  so glad we did  we awoke to a massive thunderstorm at  am  the rain was so hard i thought for sure it would leak  but it did not  we made it all night and the inside of the tent was bone dry  the wet tent dried quickly once the sun came out  great tent for the price      
689,5.0,                       this is a nice little tent  especially for the price  i  the mom  took my   year old daughter camping and managed the set up and take down by myself just fine  this is perfect size for queen air mattress  all tents claim they sleep   more bodies than is ever comfortable  so this   man is perfect for   people with backpacks and a little breathing room      
690,5.0,                       this tent is perfect for backpacking  the design is simple yet the tent is sturdy and performs well in rain  it is small and light and there is enough room in the storage bag to store a footprint  the materials it is constructed of are top notch  the interior storage pockets make it easy to keep up with your gear   i took it out for a few days in florida  was pleasantly surprised at how well it performed  the first night it stormed with sustained winds of        mph  the tent weathered it perfectly and in the morning  the interior was dry  after the rain  the humidity levels rose  humidity combined with florida heat should have made for a miserable night  but because this tent breathes so well  it was very comfortable  i even had to turn off my tent fan because it was too cool  i would recommend this tent to anyone who is looking for a good quality  reasonably priced tent      
691,5.0,                       bought this on a whim and it far surpassed my expectations  i got tons of compliments on the colors to begin with and it proved to be a sturdy  badass tent on my first use  i chose the windiest  wettest week to go camping  but this tent didn t buckle or leak  my sister wasn t as lucky with her own tent       
692,5.0,                       i was expecting a lot less for the price  after a couple of camping trips  we can have it set up in a few minutes  we ve been rained on several times now in it and staid dry  we mostly car camp so weights not an issue  and it s held up very well for several seasons  last trip i saw at least   other sites with them  and i m not surprised  it s probably not the tent for carrying deep into the woods  for casual use it s a great value  two people on a double sized air mattress plus one large dog fit just right in it      
693,5.0,                       the kids wanted a tent for the yard so we chose this model  this was easy to put together  very sturdy and kept the weather out  left it up for   months and it never blew away or got any water in it  usually you can tell how cheap is made by the zippers and tie downs  but i was rather impressed on the material used  we would buy again the kids loved it     
694,5.0,                       this was really easy to set up   it s been a long time since i d been camping it did keep us dry during the inevitable thunderstorm and i liked that the tarp style bottom came up a few inches around the edges  it made me worry less about water getting in  i don t recall touching the edges while it was wet being a problem  but i did grow up camping in a frame canvas platform tents with the scouts  so most anything will be drier than that      
695,5.0,                       hauled  on the motorcycle there is room for two people but when you put a little gear in there it would be very tight  works great for one guy tight for a guy and his lady  does haul nice though   folds up nice fitting bag that s   foot long  about    minutes to set up      
696,5.0,                       first time camping and bought this tent  this tent took no more than  mins to setup as first tent pitchers  our first camping trip ended up with a full night of rain and this tent kept us dry  the bottom layer of the tent is also water proof and our sleeping bags did not get wet  i would recommend this for anyone new to camping      
697,5.0,                       i ve had this tent for going on   years  yes  i have not written a review until now  and this tent is still in immaculate and perfect shape  i ve used it a minimum of    times and there s still no perforation  holes  popped stitching  or flaws not due to user error at all  i m a     pound   foot    inch man and have a    pound dog and we both fit comfortably with a lot of extra room to spare      
698,5.0,                       i purchased this instead of paying for a hotel for me and my daughter when my son was going camping with the boy scouts   they camped at goshen this summer and it is tall enough and spacious enough for three adults to move around and be comfortable   we had two cots  queen size air mattress  a folding chair  trash  and storage area in the tent   it kept out all of the creepy bugs so this city girl was happy      
699,4.0,                       great tent for the price  no leaks so far and i feel comfortable  i can almost stand up all the way inside  i m   ft   in   the poles feel like they have the potential to break if used too roughly when putting the tent up but a lot of people swear they won t  i haven t had any issues with them though  all in all      stars from me      
700,5.0,                       still working fine and awesome and quick assembling and disassembling after four years  survived several thunderstorms at duluth and minnesota state parks     
701,4.0,                       for the price  this is an unbelievably great tent  i usually use a one man backpacking tent but wanted something i could sit up well in  along with a little more room for gear  i love it  the only thing i d change is putting in zipper closures for the side windows like there is for the front and back  when it gets cold at night  the rain fly lying over those open windows just doesn t keep it as warm inside as i d like  other than that  it s well made  very roomy for one  super easy to set up and has neat little conveniences that i appreciate  i m happy with it      
702,5.0,                       this is my first tent  so i can t compare  but it served me well on my camping trip   i bought the three person tent for two people  so we had extra room for stuff and didn t feel crowded   our sleeping pads took up the entire width of the tent  but we could have fit one more next to it  if we needed to  but there wouldn t have been much room for stuff   the bottom of the tent is thin so i placed a tarp underneath to protect it   it is hot to sleep in the tent with the windows zipped shut  which i tiried to do for fear of rain   finally i opened them and when the rain did begin  none of it came inside   it wasn t a huge storm  but it was a pretty steady rain for an hour or more   it is easy to put up as long as the ground isn t too rocky  but worthwhile to set it up in advance of a trip if you re a beginner  so you know what you re doing      
703,1.0,                       within minutes of setting up this tent for the first time and moving stuff into it  rocks had poked holes into the bottom canvas   i had previously used a cheap wenzel tent for years without issue so i was surprised how fragile this tent was i could put a tarp under it but i d rather just have a more durable tent      
704,5.0,                       i love how quick i was able to assemble this tent with my father at the beach  also it s very resistant to winds and it was very windy that day  i can t say anything about if it s water resistant since we haven t tested it in a rainy day yet  however  people say it s recommended to buy a can of seam sealer and i will do so if i expect to go out camping this fall      
705,5.0,                       august   th last year  we ve used it three times for beach camping now  it s very easy to set up and there s a ton of room inside  we were able to inflate our queen air mattress and had plenty of room on the sides for clothing and other gear  the tent is very secure it gets windy on the beach so it held up perfectly  zipper entrance is easy to use  i am   ft tall and can even stand up in the center of this tent      
706,4.0,                       wonderful tent  very easy to build and pack down  slightly smaller than expected based on reviews and appearance  fiancee and i are both   ft  and we brought both our    pound dogs  all of us just barely fit comfortably inside  even at   ft  we had to duck to dress or stand  except when in the very center spot  and then our  heads almost touched the top  however  it kept rain out amazingly  and was great with the zip open flaps and the easy build and tear down  definitely recommend  amazing for the price  just know what you re getting  if you re a normal height  rather than a hobbit         
707,5.0,                       i went camping on memorial day with this tent and it turned out to be a miserably stormy weekend  after     downpours to the point were our campsite was an insufferable mud pit  the inside of my tent was bone dry  of course  the next time i take it out the waterproofing will need reapplied  but i was very impressed with how it held up during the multiple rains on its first outing  it s important to note that this tent size can fit a standard air mattress and nothing else  if you need more room  then you ll need to size up  it has nice hanging pockets where i kept my glasses  power bank  and phone  great tent that was insanely quick to set up and kept me and my things dry      
708,5.0,                       i ve used much more expensive tents over years of camping but i find i keep the coleman stuff around more than others  while not as high tech or ultra lite as many of their competitors  they ve mastered simple  easy to use products that are both inexpensive and of good quality  i ve literally camped in a version of this tent for so long the bathtub floor was starting to get a little thin from the air mattress rubbing on it   like     years of scouts use   coleman products just seem to keep going where other stuff breaks  i ve got a     s lantern and dual fuel stove that have hundreds of hours on them and still work as good as the day i bought them this   person tent is no exception  i ve had this same tent in several models  this same footprint in a model called  traditional  is what almost all the cub scouts were issued in the    s and      s   it s still available with several names and colors but the    by    floor plan is pretty much the same this is a tent and shares characteristics of most dome tents  two long poles cross in the middle and are tensioned into an arc and thereby hold up the dome  it comes with a good rainfly that still allows the back window and front door to be mostly open during a rain storm  nothing worse than being zipped up in a tent  in july  in a thunderstorm  with no ventilation   this one has good ventilation  the top is mostly mesh under the rainfly   sun dome  so you lose a lot of privacy with it off  i keep it on for that and the random showers  there s also a lower vent you can peg open for even more ventilation  tent was of good quality and construction  all seams were even and straight  no extra material hanging off or tape not trimmed  tent was clean and smelled new  some people have been getting amazon return ones but mine was new from factory   set up is like every small dome  two main poles that hold up tent  smaller pole for rainfly  craptastic tent pegs  purchased good aluminium    ones with tent   goes up in about    minutes  i always suggest a ground tarp  i also routinely use a hanging tarp over the tent if i can  i use this with the coleman   x   screenroom  another small bag  easy to carry coleman product   great to carry in my camper for an emergency or for the kids to borrow for a weekend trip     at     bucks i should buy   or   of them and just stash them in the closet  perfect for younger grandkids to camp in the back yard  my first grandchild is only    days old         all in all it s a   star  worth the money   product from coleman      
709,4.0,                       got this for a cub scout campout as we don t camp often and yet wanted something the right size  reasonably priced and good for spring summer camping with a trial run for working out the kinks   the biggest being the rain fly  the second and subsequent setups took about    minutes each and easily done solo while i m not sure how well the open mesh sides covered by the rain fly would hold up in a big storm  it help up with a drizzle  we stayed dry and comfy if a bit warm for a wi summer night  both of us were sleeping on top of our sleeping bags by morning not sure of long term durability and certainly not a backpack tent  i d recommend buying a ground tarp and a set of good stakes just to make life easier for yourself overall a good basic tent that can easily sleep an adult and two kids with wiggle room and space for gear      
710,5.0,                       it worked just fine for a very rainy   day camping adventure  we bought this for a music festival in kentucky last september         it rained the entire time we were there and inside the tent was dry  we did not use a seam sealer or anything  plenty of room for a queen size inflatable mattress and our bags and large cooler  but  i must confess  next time we re using a   person tent and cots for more comfort  i m   ft and could stand in the   person tent  but hubby is   ft and it s not as comfortable for him      
711,4.0,                       i bought this tent for a bi anual camping trip for me and my girlfriend to share  we didn t have time  unfortunately  to set it up before the trip so we prayed for the best that nothing was ripped  the tent was rather easy to set up  taking me and her about   minutes following the easy to read instructions which are attached to the carrying bag  unfortunately the tent wasn t as big as we expected  i feel that it would have felt a bit cramped with a queen sized blow up mattress in there in my opinion  but it was roomy enough for us two and our gear using blankets as bedding  our tent has a small rip in the seams near the zipper  but other than that nothing was broken or missing  folding the tent up and getting it back in its bag was a pain in the butt though  i chalk this up to me not knowing how to properly break down a tent though and will be looking into how to do this overall the tent was easy enough to put up with us two being relatively new to setting up tents and having no real problems  we had excellent weather all weekend so i can not comment on how it handles in the rain  i will be looking into how to properly fold a tent and will update my review      
712,3.0,                       cheap and decent tent  you get a fair amount of room on the inside  as always  never get this for   people  a four person tent fits two people max  i would say this is a huge con  however that s the standard sizing in the industry for whatever reason waterproofing wasn t great  we had leaking on all sides during our whole trip  it wasn t all too bad though and we had an air mattress so we slept well      
713,5.0,                       i received this just days before the le petit le mans out side of atlanta that i was covering for an agency  this was when the remains of the hurricane was sweep up the east coast  i got it set up and then all heck broke loose  tons of wind and rain lashed us and this tent came through with flying colors  much larger than i expected  i can stand easily and i am       highly recommended      
714,5.0,                       we all know coleman makes a solid tent  i ve used this about    times    complaints  if i was pushed to find something wrong  the door zipper idea gets stuck in the fabric of the flap  but you just back it out  also  even with the rain fly  the sun still breaks thru  not very dark for an afternoon nap     
715,5.0,                       may              used this little beauty for a much needed out of the house weekend  the   th was the worst  rained in southwestern pennsylvania the entire night  my   dogs  shih tzu and    pound heniz     and i were drenched  but our tent wasn t  everything inside was bone dry  decided to keep it that way and went back home leaving it sealed up  at      am the next morning went back to our setup nothing was out of place  stayed all day and that night the   of us had a cozy night  almost to  cozy  if you are by yourself with   furry friends i do suggest going up a size  other than that you will not be disappointed  i am a    year old female and my first camping out in over    years  setup was done in less than    minutes  if you are experienced you can do it faster   i can t wait till next weekend to do it all over again      
716,5.0,                       this tent is sturdy  well made   easy to put together   even alone   i wish it came with a tarp  very spacious     person   lots of room for all the gear and dogs if you have them      
717,5.0,                       great tent  used it twice in a month and a half first trip  super easy to pitch  i had someone helping so it was definitely a piece of cake  did great in the rain  i had a tarp under the tent and it rained all day one of the days and literally only had one droplet of water in the tent  think it came through the mesh with the wind  second trip  no rain some wind  staked down well so no issuesi fit a    inch queen air mattress in it  for   people    had a little space on each side and in front  enough for some bags and room to walk love this tent especially for the price  no complaints at all      
718,3.0,                       the wind basically almost blew my tent down  even though it suppose to support up to     miles per hour winds   the wind ripped out part of the support  a  rods and their support structure   it is too late for me to return it since i have owned it more than    days from amazon   i will try to contact coleman since they give you one year limited warranty      
719,4.0,                       used this on a recent camping trip with weather       degrees  it rained the last day and we had no problems with leaks  and we did not use seam sealer  this tent is easy to assemble  however we did complete a practice run before we took it camping  the instructions are helpful but still required us to do a little investigating of out own  i would definitely recommend getting better tent stakes  the stakes included are the small metal  l shaped  ones  this model includes a hook at the top for hanging a fan light and includes a pass through for an extension cord  we fit a queen size mattress and had a   ft by   foot section of space on one side and a   foot by   foot space on the other side  it may be possible to set up   queens but they would leave no room for storage and the walls would touch a side of each mattress  i really found no cons with the product but we only used it for a single   day camp so far   the tent is very easy to get back in the carrycase as well      
720,5.0,                       great tent for two people using a queen sized air mattress with room to spare for  clothes  could almost stand straight up in the center of tent   i am   x    which sure helps when getting dressed  the construction seems good with reinforced stitching at all pressure points and the bottom material comes up really high up all sides to help keep out moisture   there are two things i always do with any tent and that is to buy more sturdy stacks as those thin metal ones can pull up more easily with wind gusts  it hasn t rained since using this tent so far  but i always cover my tents with tarps anyway as there is nothing worse than a damp sided tent in heavy rain      
721,4.0,                       i was a solo camper and needed an easy to set up tent  and this was just that  it says it s a   person tent  but i found it almost too small as a solo traveler  my small cot touched both ends  but thankfully it was not raining  or else it would have been a problem  the biggest surprise was how well it stood up to the strong winds i experienced  gusts up to    miles per hour for hours and days  can t beat the price for this great little tent      
722,4.0,                       i m preparing for a camping trip to the rocky mountains this summer  i bought this tent because it was in my price range and it seemed like a good size  when i bought it  i set it up in my living room  it took less than    minutes to set up  by myself  without reading the directions   i really like the top  it can be removed so that you may sleep under the stars  i bought the   person tent for   people  so we wouldn t be smooshed together   it was large enough for me       and my husband       to lay down comfortably with room to spare  i really like the shoe tarp too i haven t tested it against the elements yet i m still going to go over it with a sealer  water repellent and bug spray for maximum comfort  i will update after the trip      
723,4.0,                       bought this as an upgrade to my old one    person  to go camping with my   yrs  old son and   yrs  old daughter  initial setup took about    minutes  subsequent setups took about    minutes  very spacious for one adult and two children with rooms to spare for other items  there are two small cargo type pockets on each side to store small items like keys and wallets  it also has a small ring on top to a lantern  externally  tent has a separate canopy to allow air even when it rains  on the negative side  the spikes to hold the tent down is small and short  it is ok  on dirt and grass grounds  however  it does not hold well in sandy area  i had to use rocks on top of the spikes to help anchor the tent      
724,5.0,                       i prefer this to rei s tents honestly  i feel like they re extremely overpriced when you can get something bigger and of the same quality  for way cheaper  my wife and i are able to set this tent up in less than    minutes  last time we went camping it rained and we didn t have a tarp underneath so we were a little worried but no moisture or rain got inside at all  and the rain guard did its job perfectly  i highly recommend this tent if you re looking for something affordable and efficient      
725,5.0,                       we took this tent on a cross country road trip   my husband and i able to put up the tent in about    minutes  taking our time    the rainfly was easy to attach   there is a bigger  step  under the door than i m used to in tents  but i think that s a good thing   especially if it were raining    although i would still waterproof the seams  there is a hook on the inside for a light and a pocket on each side for whatever else you need to store   we were able to fit a queen sized air mattress in here with a few inches on each side   definitely not enough to keep a larger cooler or clothes   i think it sleeps   adults comfortably  so maybe   children could sleep inside without problems great tent for car camping  festival camping  beach camping  or any time you don t want to bring a large  complicated tent with you you can put it up without staking it in the ground  so if you want to buy this as a toy for kids   you can put it up inside  while we were in the desert camping  we didn t stake it down  and it was fine       
726,5.0,                       i cannot stress how hot jamaica is getting for summer     inside       so i set it up in my backyard and its our go to daily home    so cool  spacious    we were in it yesterday during the rain we stayed dry  no water came in    its worth wwaayyu more than what i paid for it  p s  currently writing this review from inside my tent         
727,4.0,                       while this tent does say it can sleep    you d be stacked in there like sardines    is probably where i d max out at  other than that  this tent is exactly what it says it is  i ve used it in pouring rain at least   times now and the rain fly kept us dry every time  it also has plenty of flaps for air flow on hot summer nights      
728,5.0,                         years later    as a single women   very easy to pop open   close   had it for   years    i m an avid camper  at least twice a month for   months   mostly in missouri    we gravel bar camp on rivers as well as nice campgrounds   been through some big storms in this tent   when the wind is really blowing   it s raining so hard you fear for your life is the only time it leaked   only from the bottom corners   never the top   through regular spring or summer storms it s been great   i did seal the seems with seam sealer stick   spray it twice over    hours with waterproof spray for extra protection took it to camp in co  ut  az last summer   it did great in the high dessert winds as well works great for   adults   a single layer queen size air mattress   with the single layer mattress you can still sit up on the mattress or even stand   if you have a deep air mattress or double layer you won t be able to fit much else   we also fit       g rubber made tubs in here comfortable as well   but it is a little tight      
729,5.0,                       my son move out of the house he s    years old now he s camping on the backyard every day and some nights   he even takes the dogs with him in there   that s what he was looking for and gave it to him for christmas   easy to put together well i didn t the kids did   he said   mom i m far away from the house and the wifi works when i am inside the tent  pretty interesting stuff       
730,4.0,                       i bought this tent for myself and it s great  it was easy to set up and looks well constructed  i chose to leave the top off it and all open given the heat in texas this time of year  it was  of course  still hot  my only comment is that if you re planning to have   people in the tent  you best really like them  good for you and your partner  bad for you and your fishing buddy  unless you are your fishing buddy are into that  who am i to judge      
731,5.0,                         of us    adults   kids  fit comfortably in this tent with a queen sized air mattress for   of us good ventilation  it took about    min to set up the first time  we aren t avid campers   but    min the  nd time with only   person we got compliments on how it looked it didn t rain so not sure about how it fares in weather      
732,5.0,                         person was the perfect size for me plus gear  twin air mattress fit perfectly with backpack and few other items  i m      and comfortably enjoyed several nights in this tent  rained   of the   days and everything was dry   no leaks  even with strong winds  small enough to pack in on a large backpack  truly enjoying this tent   nice blue color as well      
733,5.0,                       great tent   held up fine in    degree temps with rain   there wasn t much wind at all  but no water trickled into the tent   it s a perfect size for   person and their gear     will fit  but might just be a little snug   i would use it for   people if i needed to      
734,5.0,                       the only reason i didn t give it   stars is because the rain shield really only works if it goes clear to the ground   but it s my fault because i could have paid     more and had one that went all the way to the ground   but i was cheap and thought  there  can t be that much difference  but i was wrong  there is      
735,3.0,                       there was nothing officially wrong with this tent  i currently have a coleman tent and i like the construction on them   in fact  they seem to have the best bottoms  the tarp material comes up highest so you don t flood   i know this is a   person tent  but it is very small  yes  we fit a queen air mattress in it  but that s all you could fit  we returned and got a   person for the   of us      
736,5.0,                       i love this little tent  it s easy to assemble  even in the dark   and easy to take down  the   person tent i think is ideal for   people  at least for me and my boyfriend who are both over   feet tall and also have a large dog camping with us  there is usually enough room for our packs in the tent too  we ve used this tent several times now and it looks just as good as the first time we used it  this tent is perfect for its price      
737,5.0,                       we are not experienced campers  but this tent was very easy to set  held well during a moderate rain storm and provided enough comfort for two adults and a child  when it was sunny outside it had good ventilation without letting the bugs in  which allowed us to sleep very well  for us this was a great purchase suggestion  buy a cheap tarp  so the bottom of the tent doesn t get damaged from usage      
738,4.0,                       overall  this tent was amazing especially for the price  it s very lightweight and spacious  my boyfriend is     and did have some trouble with the low clearance  but the tent was wide enough for him to lay flat and still have some room so that was greatly appreciated  our biggest complaint is the ground vent on the rear of the tent  we were in camping in colorado and didn t realize it would be getting to the   s at night accompanied with heavy winds  we had to duct tape it shut the second night because the airflow was brutal  however  we live in az and this type of tent will be perfect year round  overall it was great and very comfy to camp in for   days        
739,5.0,                       i have owned this tent for two years now and have used it about    times  it is easy to setup  i normally set it up by myself and it takes me about    minutes  this     person tent is the perfect size for two people  i use two twin single person air mattress  one on either side and you have a few feet between the two so you can get up and move around  at the end of the air mattress there is also enough room to put your bags      
740,5.0,                       the first time i set this up i was alone and had never set up a tent in my life  it took me about    minutes or so to figure it out  after that  it never takes me more than    minutes to set up  even quicker with a partner  as far as usage  i absolutely love this tent  it fits a queen size mattress with plenty of room to spare  the navy color of the tent looks amazing in person  it really does keep everything dry  though i do recommend using a separate tarp underneath to save you any hassle of cleaning the bottom of the tent  i ve had this tent for about   years now and have used it around   times or so  and i just love using it      
741,4.0,                       this tent sleeps   comfortably with room for luggage  it held up in the rain but  it was a bit breezy  this tent is very well ventilated  i d definitely pass on this tent if you re planning on camping in low temperatures overall though  this tent is well made  easy to assemble  and perfect for summer camping  and as a bonus  it was rather easy to fit back into the bag         
742,5.0,                       okay so i liked the tent but it s probably not a six person tent  i did get two queen mattresses in there but a four not a six person tent for a little room      
743,5.0,                       this tent is the perfection of car camping   a huge tent in a pretty compact size   this tent is not light  compared to back packing tents  and would be really hard to cary into the woods but if your car is located within     yards of where you are sleeping then this is perfect   i thought it was easy to set up  love all the pockets and little things to make life easier      
744,3.0,                       i like almost everything about this tent  it s suitable for car camping in dry weather  i d used it in the outdoors about  x  then recently set it up in the backyard during an all day rainstorm just to hang out and listen to the rain  i quickly developed puddles in all four corners of the tent  water was apparently coming in through the seams of the tent itself    i think the rainfly was fine      
745,5.0,                       we were looking for an additional tent to fit our boys plus friends so we could now have our own personal tent   this one is durable  easy for them to put up themselves  they are        but i would say fits   boys and all their stuff comfortably    boys just fine   beyond that i don t think they would be comfortable   plus   sets of stinky feet     well    does coleman make tent deodorizer      
746,5.0,                       this was purchased to replace a similar tent that has been retired and it s nice to see the improvements made to camping gear in a decade  the additional ventilation on this model made it tolerable even in     weather  under tree canopy cover  easy up and plenty of room for a queen size air mattress  a toddler s pack n play  and all the stuff a family needs for a few days of  semi  primitive camping      
747,3.0,                       this was definitely very easy to set up however  there are some things to note  i would not consider this a   person tent      children perhaps  but two thin   ft people pretty much took up the whole tent  also  parts of the ceiling are mesh and with how light the rain cover is  i wouldn t trust this tent to last in heavy rain i would recommend this tent for spring and summer only   and only if rain is not expected      
748,5.0,                       was on the fence about getting a hammock or a tent for camping  i thought i could bring my dog to the place i went to  so i ordered the tent  he couldn t come  but not the end of the world  this is a perfect tent for a single person  or a couple  but it may be a bit cramped  it poured the last night camping  and i had minimal water in   corners  but i haven t sprayed it with protection yet      
749,5.0,                       i m from a camping family and when i moved away from home     years ago i started to camp less and less and then all my gear had been displaced and when i would go camping i would borrow friends stuff and it was just a mess i finally upgraded a lot of my camping gear and the sundome was the best desision i made i did a lot of research  many people feel like they need to get the biggest thing like the taj mahal  but simplicity and quality seemed to be overlooked i go camping with my   large dogs   lbs  and they sleep in this tent with me and it s perfect size  i even can put it up in the dark that s how easy it is  the zippers are great  rain tent and all seems have stayed in tack and with stand the elements and the comings and goings of me and my pups while camping i lost a part and emailed coleman and surprisingly they were really awesome about giving me a new piece      
750,4.0,                       photo is from guadalupe mountain national park good      minute setup   rain fly works well   great quality for the price   for motorcycles  it fits in a standard harley saddlebag  so great for traveling with bad  it s said to be   person  but only if you re shorter than        if you re   ft  you ll need to lie diagonally to be comfortable   if you re taller than       you ll need a larger tent   floor is kind of thin  so get an augmented floor tarp to add overall verdict  solid purchase for the single camper on a budget      
751,5.0,                       i took this car camping with my   years old  we got rain  not very often in so cal so i was concerned  but it worked fine it was very easy to set up  i set it up by myself  i have a   person tent    person tent and an   person tent  now   person tent for different type of camping  love coleman tents  bought them all from amazon  too      
752,5.0,                       our anniversary was  unfortunately  smack down in the middle of quarantine  we usually get out of town or at least get a hotel room to get away  but that was out of the picture this year  we purchased this tent and it was the perfect escape for our backyard  social isolation vacation   easy to assemble  cozy  and durable      
753,5.0,                       i bought this for a last second trip  had very low expectations  thought it would be a one time use and then possibly trash or let the kids use it for play   well  when a group of friends of us arrived to our campsite  it was incredibly windy  i was able to put this tent up by myself in strong winds  it has been over    years since i put a tent up and i was able to do it super easy  without reading directions  in wind  it stayed down strong  no tearing  no snapping poles  it held tight all night long  then  in the middle of the night  it poured for hours  serious rain  my friend s tents turned into swimming pools and they had to cram into their cars to sleep  my kids and i didn t get a drop of water on us  this tent stayed      dry inside  what an incredible tent  i m so in love and this is our reliable  family tent from now on  highly recommend      
754,4.0,                       just got back from a   day camping trip  set up well  pieces all fit well  stitching is quality  zipper is smooth  only problem is that s it s a little short for me  says it s a  ft by  ft  the base is that  but the sides immediately slope to the roof point  i m only      and was wall to wall  if it rained or had condensation i would have gotten wet from touching the sides all night      
755,5.0,                       very sturdy and dependable tent  camping in the bahamas for three months  we had heavy rain every day for the first month most of super expensive tents around me leaked  this one never gave in a single drop  love it  love it  love it very comfortable for one person  would be okay two  for more   probably  just for sleeping  i was using it as my room for longer time  so for such use   super comfy  very easy to set up  it s actually my second time i bought this tent  and second time i left it in the bahamas for others to use  if i ever need to buy another tent  i m going for the third coleman sundome   person      
756,5.0,                       bought this to replace a    year old coleman tent that just plain wore out  and for the price i wasn t expecting a lot   i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the materials and construction of this tent   our campsite was next to a marshy area  didn t know that when the reservation was made   yet even with the rainfly the ventilation was good enough to prevent any condensation at all   we haven t had to deal with a hard or extended rain yet  so my opinion may change  but so far i m impressed and confident with this tent the stakes provided were adaquate  but i had better spares handy just in case  and will probably permanently replace the originals you probably won t be able to stand up straight inside unless you re much shorter than i am          but for two people and a dog  it s a palace      
757,5.0,                       well worth the price you pay for it  easy to put up and take down by yourself  zippers and mesh screens seem to be well made   the only real ding for the tent is the industry standard optimistic capacity  two adults is comfortable for this tent    people would be very cramped unless they are elves bear in mind there are probably better tents in this size range  but for fifty dollars this thing can t be beat      
758,1.0,                       i had bought this tent in mid july and i didn t have any complaints   unfortunately it was lost in a fire and i had to order another one   i was disappointed that i had to order green instead of blue as blue was back ordered and i had a camping trip scheduled before it could arrive   got the tent  went camping this past weekend and we got rain   the seams in my brand new tent failed and i had water in every corner of the tent   i had even placed it on an under tarp   not a very happy camper     
759,5.0,                       we used this tent to provide a safe  fun environment for little grands who stay overnight  we set it up on the patio  and added a blow up queen mattress  voila  fun playhouse and sleeping accommodations  the   year old grandson figured out how to set it up in minutes  the   year old helped  love the built in cord for inflating the mattress  this was a great buy      
760,1.0,                       if i could give it      i would  purchased this tent for my boys scout camp  they practiced putting it up twice and when they went to camp the cords in the poles broke   useless piece of crap  i paid     for a tent i can t use   i am a single parent trying to make do this is ridiculous      
761,5.0,                       we finally got a chance to try this out in our yard  and guess what  yep  it rained   but zero problems  this really lives up to the coleman standard  we found it has plenty of room  rain resistant  easy to put up and take down  and loaded with little extra features that really put it over the top   for this price  you can t go wrong       
762,4.0,                       got this tent and used it this weekend for the first time  silly me should have purchased a high elevation tent which is better produced for weather  however  it did great in very heavy rain and wind  we had to weigh down the corners due to the basic metal stakes which really aren t the best  the only issue we had was that   of the hooks on the outside corner broke with the wind  i haven t received an email with any warranty  but it was the very first use of the tent so i am a bit disappointed in that  we tied them to the pole and it was liveable  and we ll use the tent again of course  but would like replacement options to fix it         
763,4.0,                       it s a great tent  i set it up in central texas in january and lived in it every friday through sunday monday til march  withstood storms  torrential downpours and high winds  obviously it doesn t help against the cold  though  heats up really easily throw a tarp over for bad weather and or use waterproofing spray and this tent will serve you well i got the   person and could fit a twin air mattress plus   bags  a large staff and food drinks in it still with room to sit and chill and change in the mornings      
764,1.0,                       coleman warranty response is atrocious  after one use  one of the tent poles came apart   not a major problem as the shock cord inside snapped  however  filing a warranty claim with coleman is cumbersome and annoying  worst is that after more than a month  no response  quite roomy for our family of four  one queen bed and possibly a twin could occupy the floor  headroom is sufficient  setup is fairly straightforward as tents go  compare to the instant setup models  this is less bulky and still relatively easy to setup      
765,5.0,                       ever since moving to the bay area the bf and i have been slowly but surely accumulating some much needed camping gear we finally decided to spare our friends from our neediness by purchasing our own tent  for the casual camping that we do  this is the perfect tent it s affordable  easy to assemble  and it s cute  it comes with all the necessary packaging to keep the pieces together and it has a rain guard as well definitely would recommend this for singles couples who want their own tent  but don t want to pay a lot for it      
766,5.0,                       great value  impressed with the overall quality  set it up once in the daylight and sealed the seams to waterproof it  take it down  pack it up  and make camping plans  a queen size air mattress will occupy about     of your floor space  leaving an ample amout of room for your cooler and additional gear  be advised that there are   large mesh panels in the ceiling of the tent that are covered with the rain fly installed  however if you re planning on camping in colder weather you may want to choose an alternate model without the mesh panels  they provide great ventilation  but tent wont hold much heat  take a partner to keep you warm if required   you ll have room      
767,5.0,                       for the price you are not going to find a better tent  i spent the weekend at a music festival and it rained most of the weekend  the tent was sitting in   inches of water but the bottom didn t leak at all      unlike most of my friends  tents  the walls didn t leak either  hands down the best tent that i have owned only con   door     
768,5.0,                       i was going to send it back but decided to keep it  glad i did easy put up took no time even for my husband who doesn t read instructions about ten minutes love it      
769,4.0,                       so we all know that a two person tent is actually a one person tent  right  i took this for a three night solo camping trip and it was just what i needed  but it would be a little cramped for my husband and me to camp together  and we re cuddlers  i mean  there s just no place to stash any of your gear if there are two people in this thing  still  it s a great little tent for an occasional camper like me  quick and easy to set up and take down on my own  easy to clean  sturdy  and it held up to a full night of hard rain   things got humid  for sure  but i didn t actually get wet i do wish that the window were bigger and that the door had a full size mesh window  meaning  i wish the full door had a mesh interior door  for better ventilation and views when you re inside the tent  but most people camping in a tent this small probably don t spend much time inside it      
770,5.0,                       great for all season camping  best price as listed  others from target  walmart  etc  are about double the price for the same exact thing i use this to stay upstate for  glamping  if you will  we use a coleman queen size mattress  and is pretty much at capacity along with you partner s belongings  backpacks duffles   they say   person tent  but they never actually mean it would recommend for those who like camping leisurely  none too serious like myself  since the assembly disassembly was simple and fast  great for couples  has hanging pockets to store car keys  cell phones  sunglasses and small essentials  the roof part is not required but keeps out the sun in the morning and light rain  provides a nice sunroof when off  very breezy looking into getting the camping tools set next summer      
771,3.0,                       the top of this tent is mesh   if you do not attach the rainfly prepare to be wet in the morning   even with the fly the dew has easily come through the sides of the tent by morning every night we have been out so far   i don t hate this tent and plan on keeping it  but i will probably only use it in specific situations or with a tarp stretched over it      
772,5.0,                       the tent sets up very easily  it is made very well  spacious and all the little things that make a big difference  i really like the tub style bottom  it will be great for the area that i live in  which is south carolina      
773,1.0,                       this was a replacement for another coleman tent we received that arrived damaged  item arrived damaged  which we discovered only after our first usage  we were able to repair it upon our teturn from our camping trip with extra parts in our garage but very frustrating and disappointing      
774,5.0,                       took this tent along with another old one on a weekend camping trip   tent is very easy to put up   one person can easily put it up without instructions if you have done this before   the way the poles hook in is intuitive   i generally prefer a tent that is a bit taller  but this one works fine   it was large enough my son on a twin size air mattress  a st  benard  and a neufoundland to have a comfortable night s sleep   it rained several times while we were out and the tent had no leaks  even in a downpour   the tent seemed easy to clean after the trip was over note that this is not a   person tent in any reasonable sense   if you have a family of    you will want a larger tent   if you are taking a pack of kids camping and want to squeeze and many as possible into a space  then you could proably put   kids in the tent pros      easy setup     reasonable cost     well made for the price     adequate ventilationcons      could be a bit taller     can be found slightly cheaper elsewhere if you look     no way is this a    person  tentoverall i was pleased with the tent   it is well constructed for the money   i expect to get several years of use out of it      
775,5.0,                       love this tent   easy to put up  easy to put away   we got stuck in a horrible rain and wind storm and never had a drop of water leak in     
776,4.0,                       i bought this tent amazon lightning deal i really wasn t looking to buy a tent but it was a great price  happy i purchase this tent lots of room and you can stand up in the tent easily  i use this tent for a week with three people and gear we had plenty of room  this is a typical coleman tent easy setup sense we took down and moved everyday for   days      
777,5.0,                       first  i m not a camper   i bought this after reading other reviews   this is my first attempt at putting up a tent in     yrs and even with a bad back this was a breeze   i even did it inside in cramped quarters and i had no problems   i didn t look at the directions  because i m a man s man and was still able to accomplish this feat easily   as stated previously i have a back injury and though not comfortable to get in and out  it was not difficult   room inside for two friendly friends but not so much as i would want to be in it with a buddy you ve never met my buddies so you wouldn t know trust me    i primarily purchased this tent to take with me on weekend trips so it had to fit in an older corvette  this does without problem   it also fits easily back into its carrying case without having to smash it or reconfigure your folding operations   we ll see how it does over the long haul but for the price i ll take a couple of seasons and be happy      
778,4.0,                       this is the first tent we ever purchased and it s a great product for the price  there are lots of little vents and windows that you can open close  it s a little snug for two people  especially if you are close to  ft or taller  since we aren t avid campers  we filled the tent with pillows and couch cushions for comfort    pretty sure it would easily fit a blow up mattress or extra padding you might have  over all  great first time tent buy      
779,2.0,                       first time i used it the elastic band in the tent pole broke  i fixed that  the second time a hole opened up in the top of the tent      
780,1.0,                       was very excited to try out my first tent  held up well the first time i took it out  although it is very small  it is about the size of a queen size bed  if not smaller  the second time i used it the zipper completely broke  had to sleep in the tent with the door wide open  would not purchase again  of course this happened three days outside of the return window      
781,5.0,                       this was purchased as a replacement for the same tent  we had the previous tent for   years and loved it  the only reason i bought another is because the rain fly got caught on my fence and tore as a family of   we camp     times a year  last year we camped for a week in yellowstone and the grand tetons with this tent it is easy to set up and is very sturdy  there is plenty of room for   queen size air mattresses plus your gear clothes      
782,5.0,                       for the price  this tent is amazing  i stayed a couple of night in capital state forest  super cold  humid  windy  wet and this tent withstand it all  im glad i bought it  ventilation is great  zippers could be better but as long as you arent yanking them  should be ok   recommended     
783,5.0,                       this tent is easy to set up and had plenty of room for   people  i liked the screened top  if you leave off the rain fly  so you can still see the sky when you settle in for the night  i have not tried it in any extreme weather yet but with some tent stakes and the rain fly  you should be ok in mild weather conditions  it s a bit heavy for backpacking  i d recommend for car camping type situations      
784,4.0,                       it s probably closer to a     man tent  but it was easy enough to put together my   year old son had no trouble helping me  we easily fit a full size and twin sized blow up mattresses with room to spare  the bag says it fits a queen size air mattress  but you ain t getting that puppy thru the door inflated unless you can taco bend it  the weather was perfect for our backyard camp out  so i cannot attest to it s weather readiness  but it seems like it would keep you dry      
785,4.0,                       we bought this thinking we d be camping in nice weather   of course when you assume that  it doesn t happen that way   it rained lightly  which wasn t the end of the world  but the tent material is so thin  on the plus side  it s breathable so you don t feel claustrophobic   that this light shower gradually soaked through the rainfly and the mesh screen   i really don t approve of the tent itself  without the fly  having   of the   top panels  the  roof   being a mesh screen  but it is what it is   it has a few more mesh vents on the lower half that are covered by the solid tent material  and the d style door has an upper half mesh window that can zip closed  so you don t have to worry about a  nd set of zippers for the  screen door  effect   anyway  i feel as if i m rambling  so i ll just say overall it s a great tent for dry weather  very easy to set up and live out of for a bit   enjoy      
786,4.0,                       does the job for the little one s      six year old girls   will most likely be used for indoor camping   it s the girls castle   per the info that was provided by coleman     person tent   only if you re  under   feet tall and      lbs without any gear   seams at base would require additional waterproofing seam glue  but for the price of around      you should be happy with the purchase      
787,5.0,                       i bought this tent for camping in national forest campgrounds  it is easy to set up  i used the tent approximately   times so far on two occasions the tent survived two august thunderstorms accompanied by wind and rain  everything stayed dry its everything i need for summer camping trips      
788,5.0,                       this tent was great  i am      and finding a tent that will hold me and all my stuff is a real pain   this tent is the easy fix   i slept the  ft way and had plenty of room so my head and feet weren t touching the sides of the tent   plus it had enough room for a   day backpacking trip  my dog  he is a   lbs doberman pinscher   his bead and his pack  with room to spare   the only downside is that this tent is heavy     lbs for backpacking is really heavy but for the cost and the size if you can handle the weight it is great      
789,5.0,                       this tent was spacious and perfect for my other two friends and me who went camping  if you re bringing hiking backpacks and want enough space  this is perfect  i d say     people fit comfortably  any more and you ll be pushing it  and you won t have much room for your stuff  also  don t lose the rain fly  the side windows don t have zipper flaps  they are just screens  if you lose the rain fly  there is nothing to cover the side windows at all      
790,2.0,                       at first i really liked this coleman tent  light weight and fairly easy to set up  the size is perfect for   or   camping outdoors  then i realized it s only good for dry weather  if it rains  don t expect it would stay dry inside  as i found out  recently unfortunately  puddles and soaked beddings  very disappointed  see pictures      
791,5.0,                       bought this tent for a july  th quarantine backyard date and it was the best idea ever it had been pouring rain the week before and so i was a little worried about the wet ground and rain during the weekend tent was great  waterproof and seemingly bugproof as we didnt get any bites inside the tent  well made and took a little bit of time to set up but nothing too difficult great product      
792,5.0,                       we bought this to use a shelter for my mother in law who smokes   snowy days   we put chairs and a space heater in it   worked great     
793,5.0,                       had to get this last minute for an overnight camping trip  and i was really impressed with the quality  size  and features that it had  especially for the low price  it was much easier to assemble than the tents we had when i was growing up it might be a little too big to carry around on a serious backpacking trip  but for shorter trips  it seems fine      
794,5.0,                       bigger than i thought  didn t use it outdoor yet  but look fine  my   year old son sets it up in the living room and lives in it with his ipad most of the time now      
795,5.0,                       bought as gift for  disabled  friend  said was short on the inside for him as had to be hunched over while standing in the tent but besides that he said it was spacious  easy to assemble    was great during the rain  i m giving   stars because it is as y all as advertised but wanted to mention for those w  similar needs      
796,4.0,                       it says a   person tent but as i had read in someone else s review a   person tent means   sleeping bags will lay out in the tent and that does not include gear so if you want a   person tent you need to buy a larger tent than this  fortunately having been warned and wanting a   person tent i bought this one so there would be room for   people and our gear  that worked out very well  i really liked the tent and it was easy to setup and take down  we had to take the rain fly off to get air circulating through it on a hot summer night but once we did it was very comfortable  i bought   of these  kept one for myself and another for my teen daughter and her friends to use when we go camping and gave my college age son the other  if you want a   person tent thios is a good one but if you want a   person tent get a larger tent      
797,4.0,                       have not yet taken it for a real camping trip but set up for a night in the backyard was easy enough  looks good  space inside is great  my six foot husband and i can lie with feet to the door and not have to climb over one or the other to get in and out   my main concern is the open mesh  having spent a couple nights recently in death valley when the wind was blowing so hard it was leaning our old tents over    i can only imagine how full of sand this tent would have been  there is no way to really close this tent up  heat is going to go right out and a breeze is going to blow stuff in  still as a fair weather summer tent and for the price  i am happy so far      
798,2.0,                       got this tent back in may do my friends and i could have a social distanced camp out  we didn t end up using it until last week though and when i was trying to put it together something didn t seem right because one of the poles would not slide through  i ve had a bunch of experience building tents so i was confused why it wasn t working and i finally realized that the tent came  broken  because the part what the pole has to slide through was sewn down  now building this tent at   pm might have not been the best idea but i should have had to deal with clipping the threads in order to build this tent  was disappointed  besides for that good tent though      
799,4.0,                       loved this small personal tent  easy to setup  great color scheme  haven t tested in heavy rain   but will report back if anything fails      
800,5.0,                       this coleman   person tent is a great cheap little tent if you are just using it occasionally  i bought this tent for me and my girlfriends trip to camp bisco in scranton pa  we live in atlanta    the tent worked great for our trip and kept all of the rain out  it was just big enough for my girlfriend and i and our two bags so i don t know how   people would fit in here  but it is a great   person tent if you are comfortable being very close to that second person haha  anyway the tent took no damage over the course of our trip so i was satisfied with my purchase and i think this tent will get me through a few camping trips before i have to buy a nicer one  i hope this review helps someone      
801,4.0,                       finally was able to use this camping  it worked wonderful  it was easy to put up and tear down  it did rain when were out camping and no water was able to get in  it was pretty sturdy in the rain and the outside flap allowed us to keep the window open as it helped keep the rain out when packing it up  it was a challenge  getting everything folded and get it to fit in the bag it comes in wasn t easy  you have to make sure that you slowly fold it up making sure that you let all the air out as you fold it  this way it compress really nice and will fit so much better  after we got done camping with just tried to throw it all in the bag  didn t work  after a couple of weeks of letting it air out  i took it down and folded it up nice letting the air out as i folded it  i was able to get everything to fit back into bag      
802,4.0,                       this is the first tent i ve ever owned  so i cannot compare it to others  but overall i am pleased with my purchase  my son and i used it this weekend on a camping trip  it rained and the inside of the tent did get wet  i m not sure where the water seeped in at  but all four corners of the tent were wet  it was hot out  so i didn t mind the water as much  even though the bottom of my sleeping bag was wet  i ve heard of people placing the tarp on the inside of the tent instead of underneath the tent  i may try that next time      
803,5.0,                       huge tent  waterproof  used in backyard for kids outdoor camping and was set up  twice  for a couple of weeks each time  get longer spikes  we weren t as fast as they suggest for putting it together  but after the first time it was easier  buy a battery powered fan lantern to hang from inside loop on ceiling  it s perfect  be patient and get all the air out of it as you refold it  it does fit back into the bag      
804,5.0,                       great tent for one person  i had a twin air mattress  a duffle bag and a small cooler with room to change clothes  held up to some good winds and rain  no leaks      
805,5.0,                       this is a fine little tent at a very reasonable price  the stated    minute set up time is pretty accurate and can be accomplished by one person working alone very easily  as another review noted  if two people are sharing this tent it should be two people who are very close as they will be sleeping very close to one another  one person occupying the tent will find ample space for him and his gear      
806,5.0,                       this tent saved my ass  with strategic placement also involved i woke up to   mph hail and lightning storm in north dakota on my vacation in july  all of others tents were blown over and laying in hail and water from the storm and this little coleman held up with help of me holding onto the stakes hoping i wouldnt die for    mins  worst experience of my life and this coleman made it through only tent out of   that stood in morning  great product      
807,4.0,                           for ease of set up and disassemble  poles get stuck in tent  but price is great for value  stays dry in torrential louisiana downpours  just be careful entering and exiting  the door flap falls in and drips water everywhere  would buy again  especially given how well it has held up      
808,5.0,                       great for warm weather camping  nice large mesh windows that let in lots of air and keep bugs out  without the rain fly  it s like sleeping in the open  with a queen size air mattress  there s just enough room to get around it  just about right for two  it says sleeps four  but it would be kind of crowded      
809,5.0,                       i ve owned many coleman tents  i got the   person version and it exceeded my expectations on the roominess of the interior  i ve used it in cold weather as well as down pouring rain  no leaks and withstood    mph winds at the same time   great investment for your camping needs      
810,5.0,                       perfect size  lightweight  will hold up in light passing rain and wind  cant beat the price  my bf and i are both     and we feel definitely feel cozy but still have just enough room for our duffle bag  sleeping bags  mats  and backpacks  we have used this little tent for multiple camping trips around cali all summer and it s perfect for us      
811,3.0,                       this item is great  the tent and everything all sets up great but when we opened it and put it together the item had clearly been used  it smells like camp fire and had dirt  wrappers  and receipts inside the tent  my husband had to vacuum it out and let it air out a bit  the item was new  not an amazon marketplace item so i feel pretty frustrated that it wasn t in new condition  other than that the tent is great      
812,5.0,                       i have owned several high end tents from nemo and big agnes for backpacking  after a few years of hammock camping i decided to try the tent route again for a kayak trip  this tent was       with free shipping and had a lot of positive reviews so i gave it a go  the build quality is way better than i expected to be honest  this is a very well thought out tent with all of the bells and whistles of the more expensive tents  including a door mat   it held up in the rain with no issues or leaks  you d be hard pressed to find a higher quality tent for the money      
813,5.0,                       i ordered this for a camping trip we planned for the weekend  it is very good for this price  i have never used any other expensive tents so i don t know what other features they offer  but this is more than sufficient for   people keep in mind that it does not provide much insulation from cold so if you plan to take it to cold regions  take additional insulation materials etc overall it is a great buy and this made go on many more camping trips later      
814,2.0,                       i actually really like this tent  however  when i took the long poles out of the bag  one was missing a silver piece that goes into the corner key to hold the pole in place  thankfully we had duct tape on hand which did the trick  i give this only two stars because i don t see anywhere to contact the seller to ask for the silver piece  i m now stuck with a defective pole  ugh      
815,4.0,                       fit my full size blow up mattress with about     ft at the side and   ft at the foot  easy to assemble   did it in about    mins by myself   months pregnant in the dark bc i forgot a flashlight  but i m fairly experienced with setting up tents  i did get a fiberglass splinter from one of the rods though  i did not get a chance to experience this in the rain  it withstood about    mph wind even though i didn t steak it  and was warm enough in about    f  the bottom is thick enough to withstand without a tarp under however it would prolong the life of the tent if you purchased a tarp for under like i did  decent tent      
816,4.0,                       bought this tent as a secondary tent for growing family  for the price this tent was great  just finished using it for a   day weekend and was better than expected got some light rain and no leaks pros easy setupnice tarp material for bottom is durable and water resistanteasy setupgood zipper and windowsconspoles don t seem to be super durablefly nice but small  not sure how effective for heavy rain     
817,5.0,                       such an easy set up and the   person tent was perfect for my partner and me and all of our stuff with honestly some room to spare  we didn t go backpacking with it though seeing as it s not suuuuper light but this was great for drive up camping  i love it even more than the      something rei tent i used to have      
818,5.0,                       set up the tent the first day we got it in our living room  it was very easy to put together  even with a dog who wanted to jump in the middle of it  after setting it up  we laid down and had plenty of space for   adults and a dog     person  would be fairly tight  i would say   adults and   kids is a better measurement  taking the tent down was really easy and convenient too  overall for the price  really solid tent      
819,5.0,                       i am happy that the first rent i ordered from amazon was out of stock and i found this one instead  my  yo daughter can take this down solo and needs little help with putting it up very nice inside with several windows this is a great tent    you will love it     
820,4.0,                       unless you re fitting two kids in here  this isn t the size for two grown adults  unless you re really used to roughing it   had purchased two  one for my boyfriend and i and one for his son  ended up keeping one for his son  but sending the other one back and getting the four person sundome tent for us  really like the tents  they re easy to set up and did their job just fine  again  only giving four stars because i do not feel like this is a two person tent      
821,2.0,                       while setting up the tent for the first time  one of the straps that hooks onto the tent poles ripped right out of the tent   it is still usable without that one strap  but obviously it is not a very high quality product   otherwise  it seems like a decent tent  and a reasonable value for the price      
822,4.0,                       we never did receive what we ordered originally  but after going through the replacement process the first time we decided not to go there againthere is a difference between the sundome tent and the dark out tent  both versions have minor quality issues but decent tents for the pricevery effective at withstanding rainstorm in tje mountains     
823,5.0,                       i have used this tent now  x and my most recent camping experience also included a heavy rainstorm followed by     mph winds  friends lost their tents and ez ups but mine held up amazingly well  only the stakes bent so i will buy new ones but the material held strong  no rips or tears  and the poles didnt snap despite all the bending the wind put it through  worth every penny      
824,5.0,                       we love this tent  we are not nature enthusiasts by any means so it took us a bit to figure out how to set it up but that was part of the fun  once we figured it out it was awesome  we love it      
825,5.0,                       well i go camping a lot and i figured since it is usually just me that goes i should buy a smaller tent  so i bought this and first night i had it i was impressed  the extra air flap on the back of the tent for ventilation is very nice  it allows the air to come in instead of just the air that is already in it if that makes sense  easy to set up didn t take me more than   minutes for the first time once i got it out of the bag so i am      and it is a perfect size tent for my length  have enough room to put all of my gear in the tent with me and a dog that takes up half of the tent by himself hahaedit    i have survived a really nice storm in this tent now  strong winds and hard rain and this tent still stood up to the challenge  so yes very good tent i would have to say     
826,5.0,                       don t know yet if it s weather proof because it did not rain but it s a great size and seems very well made  i can put it up myself in   min and it fits back into it s bag when it s time to go home  i used a tall twin air mattress and had lots of room inside for gear  the twin went right in the door after it was blown up  it would hold a double or queen mattress but you might have to blow a larger mattress up while inside the tent      
827,4.0,                       exchanged it for a tent that i can stand up in  and one that i can put up by myself   i am a    year old female with mildly arthritic hands and the buttons on the poles are mostly too difficult to push      
828,3.0,                       we bought this for our kids as a christmas present  i snatched it on an awesome deal  so the price was good  it assembles easily taking about   min  the tent is great  we haven t tried it out in the elements yet  but i did notice that tge threading has already come undone on the front  that s the only reason i m giving it a mid rating      
829,5.0,                       sets up well  roomy for two people and blowup mattresses  have not used in rain  but think it would be pretty water tight  i d suggest a ground cover tarp as part of this purchase  a    x     tarp worked great  we took it dow wet with few  but opened up later that day to dry and it dried quickly      
830,5.0,                       this was a great deal of the day purchase  easily fits me my wife and two little kids  it took me about    minutes the first time to put together  its really well designed  has an extension cord opening  screened windows  rain guard of course and a pocket for various things  the instructions are water proof which is important for someone like me who is going to forget how to put it together      
831,5.0,                       a great lightweight smaller tent  had plenty of room for my fiance and i along with our   large dogs  love the breathability  i will say it downpoured all day and we only got a few drops of water coming in on each of the four corners   put a viva paper towel down and nothing was damaged  highly recommend       
832,5.0,                       i bought this tent for electric forest in mi and there was an insane thunderstorm one of the nights that was shaking the whole tent horribly  the tent held up and not a drop of water  besides the typical condensation  was in the tent  i was very impressed by how much the tent could withstand especially since there had been a warning to take  non tent shelter  at the time       would recommend      
833,5.0,                       extremely easy set up  sturdy construction   i like that it has plenty of ventilation and lets air move freely through it  had   rain storm hit when using and not   leak   however i always add a can of waterproofing spray to the seams after purchasing   overall a great tent for the price  i hope it last    years like my old colman tent did  i have only   issue and that is i think it needs more spike holes along the footing  it has     on corners  then   in front by door    in back i used w vent  i think it should have them on the sides as well  still a great tent         
834,5.0,                       while i have not had a chance to use this in heavy rain yet  the rainfly is quite large  so much so i preferred it off the tent so i could see more of the sky thru  windows  at night  and the floor looks heavy duty and goes up about two inches on side walls  in all other areas  i can say this tent is superb  it assembles quite easily  i did it myself  in around    minutes with no practice  in the dusk  it takes down quite easily  again by myself  it took maybe   to dissasemble and stow  the storage bag is nice and well made  the tent stays up fine without stakes  the height at center is quite manageable  it easily slept me  with room alongside for all of my gear  and felt quite roomy  with two people  i would have left most of the gear out of the tent  and it would have been fine  there are a couple handy gear bags hanging from the sides for small items  plenty of  windows  for fresh air and views  all in all it seems comparable to much more expensive tents  and the bright green is cheerful and aesthetically pleasing      
835,3.0,                       my husband and i purchased this for a camping trip to the coast  i found that this tent was really small given that we only had a queen bed in the tent and that was literally all we could fit  no bags  nothing else literally  i am not sure how   people would fit in this tent  it was a tight squeeze with my husband and i  i am not really big on camping to begin with  and found that the lack of privacy through the mesh windows was less than ideal  when the wind blows  the wind flap would raise the size exposing everything and everyone inside the tent  i did find that the quality of the tent overall was good  however there are just some minor things i would change  we actually ended up returning this tent for the suisse sport   person tent for our next camping trip  if coleman made a tent with zip up windows  i would be the first to purchase one      
836,2.0,                       we had no trouble setting these tents but the first morning our sleeping bags were soaked everywhere they were close to the sides of the tent  we had to set up tarps over the tents in hopes of cutting back on the wetness  it helped some but almost every morning we ended up with wet sleeping bags      
837,5.0,                       easy to set up  it indicates a   person but this was perfect for   normal sized adults a queen airbed and all our stuff  can almost stand up inside  used a camping lantern fan that hung from center on a hook and worked perfect  we set a tarp underneath but probably didn t need to the way it s designed   just wanted it to be kept cleaner since it was dusty were we first went      
838,4.0,                       every time i have gone camping it has been raining very hard  this tent has kept me mostly dry  just a small amount of water was able to get in from a very heavy storm with high winds  i would say this tent held up with the best of them  this tent will not sleep   people though  it sleeps   comfortably plus a little space to put your bags in     
839,5.0,                       my son and hubby have used this once for an overnight trip   we aren t campers  yet  so we were just getting something real quick so my son and his dad could join in on mini retreat   this fit the bill   if we use it again  we do plan to treat it with water repellent   the weather was good so it was not an issue for this trip and we got it the day before they were to leave so we didn t have time to treat it this time  my husband is       and my son is an average   year old   they slept comfortably   i was worried after reading reviews an about a quadrillion   man tents about the tent not being long enough for hubbs   this one was fine and was actually roomier in general than we expected   the price didn t break the bank  so it was perfect for what we needed   i hope we get the chance to use it again      
840,5.0,                       i purchased it for a cross country car trip to save money on hotels  it worked perfectly for the application  it fit into a small space in our little toyota yaris and went up easily at night  tear down in the morning was smooth  an unexpected thunderstorm found the tent  and even with an open window  the inside stayed dry  the only difficult part was attaching the rainfly to the corners  there are little rings with posts in them for the poles and it appears these rings are where the steaks go as well  so  if the steaks were all ready in the ground and the poles up  it was difficult to get the rainfly attached      
841,5.0,                       super easy to set up  i m new to camping and was able to have it up in less than    minuets alone  great size for my gear  my sleeping bag  and my dog  could easily fit a couple or   kids  i don t think   adults would fit comfortably  hung a small lamp up top to light up the space      
842,5.0,                       a good tent  used it on a weekend trip to a national park  and a fun night in the living room  fits a queen sized air mattress too  easy setup  probably took    minutes  we got it at      which was a great deal  definitely worth the money  have not tested it against rain yet good tent  good value  would buy again     
843,5.0,                       solid looking tent  amazing deal  weather hasn t permitted us use yet  may update on first use update  tent is great  it is roomy for two  lots of space for your stuff or another person  construction quality decent  i like the little features like the mat for entrance and the lantern hook and that it is water proof  it was easy to assemble disassemble  the privacy is better with this tent than my last  all in all it was a great deal for a nice tent      
844,3.0,                       we love the size of the three person sundome tent  it held both of us the dog and backpacks with plenty of room to spare  only issue we had was the first time during set up the bungie string on the rain fly broke  we managed to get it together to use but it made set up difficult      
845,5.0,                       this tent did exactly what it was designed to do  it was easy to set up  all the parts came in the box the bottom of this tent feels nice and hardy and resilient to thorns and such  with an extra tarp below  we had no seepage of water into the tent while it was raining the rain fly worked well during small bouts of heavy rain  no problems of water in the tent the tent is pretty heavy  and i would recommend it for car camping only      
846,5.0,                       very impressed by this tent for the price  material is great  pretty lightweight  easy to set up and take down  love the carrying bag it comes in and the doormat it comes with  the zippers are amazing and don t snag at all  and i love that it has a hook at the top to hang our light fan combo from      
847,5.0,                       used this tent for   nights and it worked great  we put a queen size air mattress in it and had extra room for our bags  we used it for two people    would have been uncomfortable   its very simple construction compared to other tents of its size and it has a great price      
848,5.0,                       we bought two tents for a recent party   this one withstood a windy rainy overnight and nothing inside was even damp   the other tent we bought costing  x as much didn t withstand the weather nearly so well   it had the stitching rip out on three rainfly attachment points  two poles bend  and one connector fail   would i buy another coleman tent again  absolutely   our s performed great at a low price point      
849,2.0,                       i bought this tent last minute for a camping trip and used the water resistant spray amazon suggested while camping it rained   of the   days  the rain fly kept me dry  bit the seams where the the top half the tent and the bottom attach leaked  it didnt leak alot but it was enough for me to notice and soak some items i had near the corner  i was very disappointed considering this was a brand new item besides the leaking  it was spacious and easy to build and break down     
850,4.0,                       this is a great tent for two people  but for me and my wife  i had to send it back   i am       tall and after pumping up a coleman double stack queen air mattress  i simply couldn t fit in this thing  i had to let my feet hang out one night and the second night i simply slept sideways with my wife being very uncomfortable   if you re not using an air mattress and or your not as tall as i am  you won t have any problems   i am sending this back and getting the   person size everything else is great about this tent   it goes up easy and quick   the color is great and keeps it nice and cool   sometimes too cool  especially at night when it was pretty chilly inside   also packs up and is easy to put back into the carry bag      
851,2.0,                       first day  i put tent up  because rain wason its way let found water inside along the inside edge overall i can deal with a small amount but not every time it rainswhat happened to the coleman qualityi also used camp dry it helped some but don t waste your money on this it s going in the trash can           
852,5.0,                       we needed a smaller tent so i bought this one since we have used the   man tent in the past and i knew it would be good  this tent is super easy to assemble my    year old did it by himself in about    minutes      
853,3.0,                       i bought this tent to replace one of the same size and model that i have had for almost    years  i car camp about   to   times a year so it has been used plenty in all kinds of weather including rain  snow and heavy wind  the zipper started to go so it was time to buy new one  this tent is not the same quality  i have used it twice and the sleeve where the pole runs through near the top is already splitting  the old tent had nylon ties to hold the fly pole in place  this one has velcro straps  one velcro strap was sewn backwards so i have to twist it to make it adhere  velcro is a poor choice   dirt and whatever work into the fibers and it loses its ability to grip  when the strap comes loose a slight breeze causes it to make scrapping noises against the tent walls  also the rain fly on the older tent was bigger better  i haven t tried yet  but i plan on seeing if the old fly will work on the new tent  oh  and one more thing   the new tent has more mesh on the sides which means i have to use the fly to have privacy  before using the fly was a choice  now it s a requirement      
854,5.0,                       this is an amazing tent  we have used it for camping for the past   months in multiple weather types and it has been reliable  perfect for   people  waterproof and surprisingly easy to pack      
855,4.0,                       the size is great  there were only two of us in the tent and we had plenty of extra room  i honestly think   people could fit in this tent comfortably  set up was really simple  i d recommend buying the bigger coleman tent stakes  for    they re worth it  the stakes that came with the tent were pretty wimpy  cons  the tent has a lot of mesh at the top  so it can get chilly at night  however we did use the rain cover  and it did a great job keeping out the rain even in strong winds  but  water did get into the tent along the seams at the bottom of the walls  other buyers have recommended buying a sealer for the seams  i d suggest that too if you know you ll encounter rain  overall this is a great tent for the price      
856,5.0,                       i am      and i fit rather well in this tent  the bag kind of hangs in your face so i ll probably just fold it into itself next time  but i am very satisfied with the size of the tent  it s very easy to pitch  fairly lightweight  and not a bad size for      i posted a picture of the tent rolled up with everything because i couldn t find any pictures of that  it s a good size for bike packing back packing      
857,5.0,                       this is my very first tent  i thought it would be hard to set up but it s so easy  only took us beginnings    minutes  i do wish that the outside layer went a little lower in the front of the tent  because it stops halfway down  only allowing visibility at the top  another thing    it says   person tent but that is stretching it  i would only do max   people and they would need to be very close friends  it s tight in there  you can stand slightly hunched and fit two people comfortably with space for your things  keep that in mind  overall  very satisfied for my first tent      
858,4.0,                       this is a nice tent  to make it better i would add zip close covers over the huge screen windows for privacy  wind blockage  warmth  and rain protection  i would like larger pockets for flashlights and such and i would definately add a screen one could hang from the cieling to put things in  and  of course  as with most tents  the stakes are pretty worthless so buy some sturdy ones      
859,5.0,                       not the best picture  but i went camping with my friends this past weekend and i bought this tent super last minute  i also bought a blow up queen size mattress and put it inside of the tent and it fit perfectly fine  if you do this  then you can only fit   people in the tent with a little room left over  which i didn t mind  if you re looking to fit   people  then stick to sleeping bags   may be tight  but doable      
860,2.0,                       i would love the tent if one of the pieces weren t bent when it came in   i ordered the tent for labor day weekend on july   th and opened sept  th to find it was not workable or return since it was past    days   so i tried to put it up anyway and found the tent looked great just flapped a lot with the wind      
861,1.0,                       this is a waste of money  absolute crap and false advertising  this was described as a    by   ft   season tent  what i received is a   by  ft flimsy piece of garbage  if you want something that will rip shortly after buying get this tent  otherwise don t waste your money      
862,4.0,                       worked great for a   day weekend   size is as advertised two people without much gear fit well  easy to assemble  instructions are good   comfortable sleeping down to    degrees with a sleeping bag   rain fly works great  no water in the roof screens   floor seams had no leaks after   separate    minute downpours just getting back into camping  this is a sturdy  quick easy to assemble and breakdown   person tent   would like a little more floor space  for the money it s a good deal      
863,4.0,                       product is quality as is the case with all coleman products   well designed and thoughtful touches   easy to erect   nice cross ventilation   you will need to buy screw type stakes if you are beach camping which is to be expected   tent does flex in higher beach winds but maintains its structure   advertised as   person tent but realistically is a two adult tent with a full air mattress   light weight  can     
864,5.0,                       originally purchased this tent for a music festival  single handedly set it up in a matter of minutes  spacious and solid tent that has been holding up well  everything fits back into the bag perfectly as long as you learn how to fold it correctly  this tent was a common sight at the festival so an identifier may be a good idea  i expect to get a lot of use out of this guy  also  youtube videos on assembling this tent are extremely helpful if you re new to the world of pitching tents  would recommend this for any beginner      
865,2.0,                       this tent is certainly not as good as it seems  yes  the price is a bargain  but this will not keep you dry during the rain  there s some misleading reviews about how good this tent does under the rainy conditions  even with the rainfly on the tent  this tent allows a lot of water to sweep through the material      
866,5.0,                       i now have three tents  two are eureka s which were more expensive as one was a    man tent and another was a   man tent  this tent was a tweener that i bought for my son and i for camping trips with the scouts  the twelve man tent is like a condo unit and really to heavy to do anything but car camp  got this when our whole family goes camping  and the two man tent is more like a   midget tent  this tent however has done a great job fort the campouts we have been on so far  i always seal the seams and we had a significant rain and not a drop came inside  it is a great size for two campers  four is pushing it at least if you want your gear inside the tent  the price was great  i would recommend this tent      
867,4.0,                       is really a one man tent   very basic and easy set up   my son fit a low cot in but that and his backpack were all that would fit   he s     so he couldn t stretch out much   we inflated a double sized air mattress into the other it barely fit  but we expected that  we really like the expansion feature on the tent bag   great idea   i wish more tents had this feature      
868,2.0,                       perfect  easy setup  loved it the two times i got to use it    took it out to use again and all the bungee cords were completely destroyed and lost all elasticity  so so disappointed  was the best tent for the price and i was so bummed this happened   the warranty is unclear and i never received any contact back from coleman regarding the issue i had      
869,5.0,                       bought one a long time ago from walmart and returned it because i didn t have a chance to go  bought it again this time from amazon and it s perfect  lightweight  weather proof  camping in the rain    easy to setup  best thing of all is it doesn t break the bank      
870,5.0,                       i have to say i was skeptical of these reviews  but after spending a night in the pouring rain with    mph winds with just the rain fly and a tarp underneath  this tent was pretty amazing  the wind did catch it and flatten it a bit when it gusted badly  but we stayed mostly dry      
871,4.0,                       good at what it is  but you must understand what that really is first  like most tents actually only fits     of stated people  two could sleep in this if they are on the smaller side and don t mind physically touching the whole time or leaving gear outside  otherwise it s only good for one person  it works well enough though  light and small when packed up  but wouldn t take it backpacking  stands tall against wind and easy to set up  stakes suck though  invest in better ones before your first trip  haven t tried it in rain  don t plan to      
872,4.0,                       i bought this tent for son who is in boy scouts  there is enough space for him and all of his gear  it comes with a  welcome mat  that is supposed to be put at the door   there a loop on the top to hang a light and a pocket to put some stuff  my only complaint is that i wish the rain fly came down just a little bit more past the windows  otherwise  it s a good tent  good size and weight and easy enough for an    year old to put up and take down on his own      
873,5.0,                       its a great tent   i ve used it in the rain and windy conditions and it held up great and stayed water tight   i highly recommend it      
874,5.0,                       this is my first tent  well worth the wait  while my camping buddies in their tent got eaten alive by bugs the first night  and all their stuff soaked the second  their fault  honestly   i was gratefully and mildly guilty in my small fortress for   nights  only downside is that the tent canvas fit a little awkward around the poles and ground  but this may be related to unstable  sandy ground on the beach      
875,5.0,                       bought two of these for my boys for christmas  we haven t used them for camping yet  but i set them up in the living room and they are very nice for the price  i grew up using coleman equipment for camping and have always had a great experience with it  i have no doubt these are going to do well  but i ll update the review if i m wrong      
876,3.0,                       i am changing my rating from   star to   star   the second time i used the tent the cord inside the poles broke  of course we were attempting to set up our campsite over labor day weekend so we had to improvise  since it had been more than    days  i had to utilize the manufacture warranty to get the poles replaced or pay a     fee to amazon to replace the product   they are sending me out a new pole set  however  i am very disappointed that a coleman product would fail after only   use      
877,5.0,                       darn good size   loaded this onto my motorcycle and had a most excellent weekend getaway was your basic tent set up   quick and easy   looking forward to my next outing with it hard to beat the price   i can t speak to it s durability  as i ve only had it out twice since the purchase  but even if i get four good uses out of it  i think that would have paid for itself   the stakes are a little weak  but i don t thinks there s a tent out there that comes with stakes that don t bend lol if your looking for a tent that s wicked light for hikes or to pack onto a motorcycle  this is a pretty good tent to choose      
878,5.0,                       we got this tent for festival camping  it goes up rather quickly  and is easy enough for one person to set up on their own the first night of the festival  it stormed  while i am not suggesting anyone sleep in a tent during a thunderstorm  i will say that this tent stayed dry inside and no parts came loose  other tents at the festival were soaked inside and experienced significant structural shifts the last night of the festival  we got hit with some pretty bad winds  still this tent kept its ground and didn t experience much shift  note  that because of the large windows  there was some breeze felt inside with the cover on  but we still stayed warm in our sleeping bags additionally  it breaks down quickly  folds up easily and takes up little space also note  there s a tiny zipper entry at the bottom corner of the tent  perfect space for an extension cord to hook up power for whatever you might need inside      
879,4.0,                       nice tent  would recommend for   or   campers easy to set up  one person can do it  two is ideal plenty of room for me and my son with our xl sleeping bags should be just enough room if mom decides to join us i would not want to attempt   people really like the small opening in one corner for a power cord ok  we take our kindles and phones with us when we re  roughing it  love that there is a back window that zips open for good air circulation we ordered a tarp to put under the tent to protect it from rocks and sticks         x     blue multi purpose   mil waterproof poly tarp cover  x   tent shelter camping tarpaulin by grizzly tarps                       also ordered extra stakes to secure the tent well      coleman    inch steel tent stakes
880,4.0,                       seems to be  as advertised  held up well in light rain  not something you want to try to put up in the dark  it is small but is an emergency shelter for my small generator my only real complaint is that i paid          tax  kinda high i think      
881,5.0,                       me and my so took this tent camping in one of the worst rainstorms i have seen  i m talking about high speed winds and flooding  this tent held up like a champ for its size and price  much larger tents had leaks and problems staying grounded but we slept comfortably and dry inside our little coleman      
882,5.0,                       spacious  durable  and easy to set up and take down  it survived burning man  it was also fairly easy to clean once i returned home  i loved how i could stand up in it to change  although i m only        i was able to set it up in     minutes in the dark  and i was easily able to take it down and fit it back into the carrying bag  the mesh ensures that the tent breathes very easily even in stifling hot weather  very great value for the price      
883,5.0,                       this is my  nd coleman sundome   st one disintegrated after being exposed to strong sunlight for a whole summer  i can t blame that  this  nd one served a camping trip great  i won t look elsewhere should i need another tent for     ppl in the future      
884,4.0,                       it s got lots of the ventilation and very good quality  however  when we woke up in the morning  some condensation dripped through the screen that accumulated between the tent and the top cover  other than that  it is very light weight  easy to assemble good quality tent      
885,2.0,                       this tent is simple and easy  except for the stakes are flat which is a ridiculous design  not sure if this is a defect  but we were pretty disappointed to discover this while camping   we would have purchased stakes prior to our trip had we known they d be flat on the bottom  makes it almost impossible to get it into the ground without an enormous force      
886,2.0,                       finally setting this tent up for the first time out of the box  there is a short   inch  run  in the floor material where it looks like it was grazed by something sharp that damaged the tarp like fabric  it s tiny  but enough to let water in or maybe some tiny bugs in like ticks or chiggers  so i am not super happy about that  i ll need to find a way to patch it as i don t want to deal with shipping this thing back      
887,4.0,                       very easy setup  all you need to do is slide   poles into the tent holes and you are good to go my only complaint is that the tent bag is very small  it is hard to pack up the tent and stuff it all inside  i ended up ripping the tent bag from trying to get it all in      
888,5.0,                       my husband and i bought a colman sundome   x   tent went we married    years ago  granted we haven t used it much  it has been great  now that we have four kids  we needed more space  i did a fair bit of research and decided against my first impulse of getting a big  multi room tent   mostly due to concern over finding a single flat space to set it up in the campgrounds we typically stay at in the end i purchased another colman sundome   x   tent last week and we used it at a mountain lake for four days  i was surprised by how similar it is to our old one  i really like the things they have changed  it really sets up in about    minutes   we had three thunder rain storms and we stayed completely dry  stake out the rain fly  fyi  you can fit two queen sized air mattresses  but they are squished tight together and against the sides  this wasn t a problem for the   kids  but it would be a tight fit for four adults  we were glad to have one tent for just my husband and i      
889,5.0,                       not a   person tent but it s awesome  i used this with myself  my fianc   and two dogs  it was perfect with all of us in it  if you wanted to put   people in this tent it would be back to back and cramped  easy to put up and has the options to open  close  or remove flaps      
890,5.0,                       just spent   days in the colorado rockies with massive thunderstorms every day       storms included hail  tent was a trooper    on the last day the floor started to get damp  but please understand  these were the kind of storms that were causing great flooding in areas  in my mind  damp floors were minimal  i didn t pay the kind of money needed for survivalist living in the rocky mountains   just enough for a   day camping trip with my kid  and the tent performed valiantly      
891,2.0,                       this party of the product description is completely false as my   person dome tent did not come with these  only one door  no led s and door is not hinged   features include   doors    in front and one in back  one of those doors is coleman s ingenious and easy to use hinged door that opens and closes like a door at home  and both doors are hooded by the fly so you can keep the windows open even in rain for great ventilation and less condensation  includes an led light system that lights up the tent at night  provides   modes of light  high  low and night light  all controlled by an illuminated wall switch   runs on  d batteries   batteries not included       
892,5.0,                       my husband set the tent up with no problem   all parts included  looked great   he stayed in it the first night with our son then i took the second night   of course it rained the second night   we stayed dry in the tent   had a tarp underneath and kept it zipped   great tent      
893,2.0,                       went camping over the weekend and encountered a bit of wind and rain  the rain pennetrated the seams and dripped into the  interior  while several of the pole sections split  one of the stake down points almost came off of the corner  but at least there was no trouble with the zippers  yep  got some good zippers on this one  lasted longer than the rest of the tent      
894,5.0,                       i just bought this tent for  th of july weekend  i had no issues with it and was very pleased  it held up great in the rain storms we had and the shade blocked the sun from being too bright in the morning  i had a twin air mattress in it and still had plenty of room so i probably could have fit a bigger mattress if there were two of us  i also loved that it had a little doormat so it stayed very clean as well      
895,5.0,                       easy to put up and take down and great in summer with screens in roof and sides to cool it  has a cover in case of rain  the price was great too  can hold   so my   year old grandson had lots of room for toys and food and we had a great time camping out  we loved our new tent  great quality      
896,5.0,                       it s large and easy to assemble  i hate camping but with this tent  you will love it  you can actually stand in the middle of it  i used it for just my husband and me so there was plenty of room to move around  add a chair  two twin mattresses  etc        
897,4.0,                       the tent is awesome  love the navy blue color  very spacious  only reason i m giving this tent   stars because when we got to camp we noticed something wrong with the door  looked like something was pinching it  turns out the stitching was off and stiched the door a little as well      
898,5.0,                       i just recieved it and did a quick inspection  it seems to be really good quality and folds down to a nice size  the stakes are your average metal stakes which work great in dirt  but i will be camping in death valley this december so i m going to purchase extra stakes that work with sand  i ll update this review after i camp in it      
899,3.0,                       its a really nice looking  spacious tent and seemed like a good value for the money   the first time i used it i had the rain fly on and still had some minor leaking in each of the   corners where rain ran down the sides   for that reason  i can only give it   stars      
900,5.0,                       are you a lovely couple looking for a tent  does your spouse occasionally get under your skin  are you sick of her stealing all the sheets  look no further as you have found the best tent for the occasion  we have used this tent once for two days and it was great  it went up super easy and there was plenty of space  such an easy set up nobody will have the time to bicker  do you need two queen size mattresses to avoid a drunk friend  perfect  this tent will fit both  purchase a tarp to put under it an you are solid      
901,5.0,                       i was looking for a cost effective oversized tent for my daughter and i on our trip to rocky mountain national park   moraine campground   elevation is       and you get rain almost every afternoon along with wind   the nights get pretty cold as well this tent was easy to set up with the typical   pole crossover design   the rain fly has a single pole that arcs over the top   super big and comfortable for   people   we got daily storms  and had no issues with leaks  and the tent held up fine   i did purchase upgraded tent stakes fyi never took the rain fly off  but had adequate ventilation with it on   tent performed very well   prob too big for   people  but we like our space      
902,5.0,                       the very first time i used this tent we had arrived at camp just as a summer thunderstorm was brewing up  we set up the tent as the first raindrops began to fall  the storm intensified  becoming a heavy downpour that lasted    minutes  we were on slightly sloping ground and well before it was over there was something of a little river running through our site  this tent performed like a champ  we stayed dry all during the rainstorm  no leaks at the top  bottom  or sides  i remember my dad s coleman gear from when we went on family camping trips  long ago    nice to know that they can still be relied on      
903,5.0,                       took this tent on a backpacking trip to the enchantments this year and it was an excellent size weight with minimal setup and take down time it snowed while i was up the mountain and i was kept warm with little to no condensation on the inside of the tent the entire   day trip personal favorites   lots of vents  power  vent port  for external power usage inside the tent away from the door  front door welcome mat  height of entry and interior of tentleast favorites   zipper pouch carrying case rather than a drawstring stuffsack makes it a little more cumbersome    door as opposed to       
904,4.0,                       purchased because my son joined the scouts and we had no camping gear   this came recommended by the scout master   it s a good tent and the price is right   we ll see how it holds up but i anticipate having to purchase another one in a year or two      
905,5.0,                       i was mistook purchase   coleman sundome   person tent  i tried it once i received it   when i set up tent by   pm  my sons couldnt wait to try it out on our backyard  after    pm it was starting rain  i was stocked that i had tent in my backyard  guess what it is really good tent during heavy rain and inside of tent was still dry and we camped at our backyard   my kids and i were so excited it and happy with this tent   per youtube that coleman sundome tent is top  nd place of tent to get it   i am so please with it   i told my friend and my friend told me that he wanted this tent too  therefore  i am not going to return it cuz it is excellent tent   my first tent is in usa      
906,4.0,                       very nice tent for the price the only complaint is that stakes included are too cheap  they are pretty much useless if used on the area with small gravels  bent easily other than that i can t complain for a     tent  make sure to get a separate set of stakes      
907,5.0,                       we needed a smaller tent for canoeing  this was very easy to setup  it withstood   hrs of rain  even though we did not stake down the side ties  one neat tip  to re pack your tent  use the pole bag to measure the width to roll your tent and roll the tent over the poles  it gives a hard core to help roll the tent tighter and force the air out      
908,5.0,                       i have been a life long camper and mountaineer   for instance  i have a      tent   this one is just as good for all we have thrown at it so far  excpet for snow  i don t recommend it for snow   we wanted a cheap tent the kids could beat on at the lake and in the back yard   it s great for that and is surprising light and easy to set up   it s also held up to some serious rain  without a footprint being used   it is surprisingly good and cheap      
909,5.0,                       this tent is great  not just great for the price  but great in general   my   daughters each have a twin blow up mattress and there was room to spare for their bags too   plus  the first night we were camping it poured   all night long   they woke up completely dry  i m so glad we bought this        
910,4.0,                       it s a great product  the rainfly worked but when i went camping it was rain for two nights  the first was light rain and the second was a bit more hard  thunderstorms that only lasted max   hours  we were dry inside throughout the whole night  but there seems to be small wholes in the corners  it made a little bit of water leak inside though nothing that a few paper towel couldn t handle  one corner of the tent had a zipper to open a little space for air so that whole was meant to be there but the other corners it was so tiny you could barely see it but either way little water got in      
911,5.0,                       great for two small sized people       and     ft  we had enough room and my boyfriend couldn t stop saying how easy it was to set up  i would maybe consider taking it on a short backpacking trip  perfect for car camping though  i love how you can look up and see the stars if it s not raining   but you also have the option to put the rainfly on if the light bothers you  love the color too  matches well with the nature outside      
912,5.0,                       just used this tent camping  with my girlfriend this past weekend  cozy yet roomy  sleek looking  only   minutes to set up straight out of the box  and nice little pockets to put our flashlights keys in  all in all an incredibly worthwhile purchase already i ll update this review after more trips for longevity purposes      as of right now though      
913,5.0,                       i am truly a camping newbie and this tent was very easy to set up  i feared that it may take some time to figure out the setup  but we had it put together in about      minutes  as others have reviewed  it is a good fit for two  we were comfortable with a queen mattress inside and had space for our bags and supplies it seemed to hold up well for the two days of use  i expect the next two trips to be the true test of its durability  overall i am very happy with the purchase  edit  well  i just completed my third annual camping trip with this tent and it is still going strong  last year it rained a good bit and we stayed dry the entire time  this year the weather was much more favorable  but still were as happy with it as ever      
914,4.0,                       tent was smaller than i expected but fit a queen air mattress   no extra room for activities  getting dressed was an olympic sport   we had to leave our suitcase in the car   tent was easy to set up and had all its parts   we didn t experience any rain or wind      
915,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          it too    min to set up this tent its not an good idea for summer its winter tent i guess but it will fit for   person very easy and u will still have space for your pets or small kid too the only reason im giving   star is not enough ventilation     
916,1.0,                       first time use and the bottom of the tent is already ruined  a hole and a section worn out letting dirt  water  bugs in  not at all happy      
917,5.0,                       there was an insane storm the weekend we used this tent  heavy rain and strong winds  other tents at the campsite were blown over and away like kites  and we stayed dry inside playing chess  with three dogs  and it held its own and had plenty of room  we did move the car to block some of the crazy wind  but still were incredibly impressed with how it stood its ground  easy to put up too      
918,5.0,                       i m not sure this would fit   people  but it s comfortable for   adults this arrived and we looked on youtube for a video on how to set it up   didn t find the coleman specific one  but did find a very similar tent   for us  the video made it possible to set it up within    minutes our first attempt   the second attempt to set this up took only    minutes the screens and doors kept out the mosquitoes and other buggies  fabric seems durable   rain cover worked as advertised   it can feel a bit muggy with the rain cover  so we leave it off if the weather looks clear   looking at the sky thru the mesh screens is now possible we appreciate the small hanging pockets for easy storage and retrieval of critical items such as flashlights or cell phones      
919,4.0,                       got this this week  quick delivery  easy to assemble  easy to put back for storage   just tried it indoor so i can t rate as such  will update review once used outdoors  overall  it s a good buy     
920,3.0,                       not what they used to be  not the greatest tent   went camping this weekend and it got pretty cold for florida   moisture definitely came in the ten      
921,5.0,                       as others have stated  this tent is very waterproof   we bought it to attend a music festival where we knew we would be camping in the rain   we had a very tall queen sized air mattress  one large rolling suitcase  and one large duffle bag and still had a small amount of room around the bags   we did push the air mattress up against the wall of the tent to give more room by the door even though we knew this could let water into the tent   it poured rain for over    hours  and rained on and off at moderate to heavy levels for the next two days   the tent held up and the rain cover prevented any water from getting in on the side where our air mattress touched the side of the tent   by day   there was a small amount of water underneath our air mattress  but it was just a trickle and our bags and everything else stayed dry   we did put a tarp down underneath the tent while setting it up   great tent  would highly recommend      
922,3.0,                       this tent is for camping out in your family room only i would not venture into the outdoors with this flimsy tent if your attitude is anything is better than nothing  well then  i can not help you disappointed at coleman quality  shame on you      
923,5.0,                       i got the    person  model   set up was easy and size was good for me tossing in queen size air mattress with room for stuff still on one side and end of it   easy to store in bag due to it having a brilliantly simple little tab you remove from bottom to make bag slightly bigger after opening      
924,5.0,                       this is a fabulous tent  it took me a minute to figure out how to set it up  i ve never done a tent alone before   but once i figured it out it was a sinch  i m tall  and it s high enough to kneel inside  and very roomy  i was alone  but i had room for all my gear  including   backpacks   easy to zip open and closed  and i love the little pouch to put my cellphone   light in  even better than i expected      
925,4.0,                       easy to set up   i set it up by myself so granted it took longer than    minutes but no rods broke and it held upi got the   person tent which is very spacious   perfect for a couple and a dog or three people    people may be a little tightvery happy with purchase  exactly as expected     
926,2.0,                       i bought this tent a month ago and just took it out of the packaging this morning   after putting the tent together i noticed that there were two small holes in the rain fly  directly on the top of the tent over an open mesh portion of the tent  so that any rain water will come directly in   i have yet to try the tent out  but if this is any sign of the quality of materials and workmanship i am sorely disappointed   i would return it but i am already on a road trip and cannot      
927,4.0,                       personally i think this is more of a   person tent  at least for me  my boyfriend and i purchased the coleman   person sundome tent and it was way too small for the both of us  we re small people too   that being said  the tent worked great  easy to set up  kept bugs out  kept water out  would buy another      
928,5.0,                       setup is very easy  no problem for one person  tent seems to be of quality materials and construction  be aware this is really a two person tent if you want to be comfortable  yes  i suppose you could cram four people in there if it was life or death  seems like most tent manufacturers pull the same marketing bs  but whatever  it s a nice little tent  recommended      
929,5.0,                       we used this tent for a weekend camping trip with family and it was great  we did opt for a bigger one and were able to put our two camping totes at the foot of the queen size air mattress  and still had plenty of room for two dogs and room to change clothes and walk around the tent  i think do think that i will weather treat it next time because in the morning when the dew was on the tent  some moisture would come through and leave some items damp  that s an easy fix though  overall though we loved it and most of my family was jealous of our  condo tent  compared to their backpacking tents      
930,5.0,                       great tent  we had lots of rain the first time we used it and stayed nice and dry      
931,4.0,                       most tents are like this  but you buy one  take it out of the bag for the first time and set it up   when it s time to break it down  you roll it tight but it still doesn t seem to want to fit in correctly   you try it again and maybe after the  rd time  you re able to zip up the bag it came in   why haven t companies doubled the size of these bags  or create bags that can easily flex outside of the irritation of packing it back up  it earns its   stars   easy set up  just be careful not to snap the elastic cables running through the poles   spacious enough for two people  but i wouldn t put more than that  with some room for clothes extra stuff the one thing that i noticed about the design that other tents might not have   the tarp on the bottom comes up off the ground a few inches   that helps keep water out in the inevitable rain storm that seems to follow campers      
932,2.0,                       i would ve liked it more if it had a zipper cover on all sides rather than only two  we used it for camping so not having the option to cover two side windows made us freeze in the night and super hot in the morning  the worse thing was the two sticks  you insert across each other that holds the tent up  one of them was short a foot so our tent was uneven and one corner was stuck in the air  luckily we brought extra tent stakes so we improvised and used a tent stake as the missing foot  it was already too late to go buy a new tent but it really got me disappointed and i trusted it due to it being a coleman  what a mistake      
933,5.0,                       nice little dome tent   easy to set up for   person  quick  and sturdy out in the weather   coleman has realy improved there tents over the years   i had one in the mid    s that i used a lot  bought this one this sprig       and am impressed on how they have improved on this basic dome tent   the pole sections are just as long but with more individual segments  so they e easier to work with and pack up in a smaller  compact bag   i like how  the  rain fly cover is lifted above the tent itself so the tent is kept dryer in rain storms  also the older version i had used   poles and this new version uses     very smart   i also like the different color schemes to choose from        
934,5.0,                       we ve used this for backyard camping for our girls and recently took it out to do real camping out in the forrest  we had an unexpected torrential downpour in the middle of the night that swamped several other tent campers near us  but the colman dome tent stayed high and dry with the rain fly up  great tent for the family to use      
935,4.0,                       nice tent  upgraded from a columbia similar size   seems well constructed and like the tarp floor that rolls up sides for a few inches which provides good water proofing floor   quick assembly   not a   person   like all other reviews good for two or solo  good zippers and seals   seams that it will provide good airflow   only question i would have is driving rain getting under rainfly   will see when i use it this early spring      
936,4.0,                       the dimensions were unclear in the description as it lists multiple different measurements  its a bit small but will work fine for a single person  worth the price      
937,5.0,                       great camping and getting out of the weather it s very well ventilated as well fits a queen size bed and that is a life saver  i had the   person model btw      
938,5.0,                       i had previously had the     person one but went with this option for a little less wasted footprint   only thing i miss on this one is the overhead mesh bin   otherwise  same easy setup as always  good ventilation and really like that the tub liner comes up around the edges to keep water on ground out     
939,4.0,                       i ve used this tent on multiple camping trips  and it definitely gets the job done  i ve got some minor quirks here and there  though i love the functionality of the  air vent  in the back of the tent and the added breeze it brings in  i wish it was zip closable  there is a little draw string at the end of it  but theres not much you can do about closing the flap unless you taped it shut  also  some materials do feel cheaper than other tents  including the draw strings and on the included  door mat  that you can place in front of the tent  i love it  but it now has a tear in it after less than   camping trips  so i m a little disappointed otherwise  this is a great tent that will get you going quickly on any camping trip  easy to setup with very clear instructions  and from the outside it looks fun and simple  very satisfied it      
940,5.0,                       this is a great tent for camping in the front country  the setup is so easy  the tent is roomy  and it only takes a few minutes to take it down and roll it back up into the bag we have used this tent numerous times  and even during a storm in the north cascades  and it stayed sturdy and dry  we ve never had any problems with condensation in the morning and we would definitely buy it again as for being a four person tent  i generally always feel that tent sizes are over optimistic  for example  a three person tent is really a two person if you have gear inside  and so this would feel more like a three person but you could squeeze four without any supplies inside  there are no vestibules so keep that in mind      
941,3.0,                       fast and easy to set up  even in the dark   very specious for as many as three adults  but i think calling it a four person tent is a bit of a stretch  it fit our two standard length  army  cots with plenty of room left over  which was nice  i strongly recommend upgrading to a better set of stakes  the ones it comes with are weak and difficult to pull out  and since you only need six stakes  you can buy a set of really sturdy ones on amazon for cheap as free my biggest complaint is that if you are camping in high humidity  condensation gathers on the  rain fly  and then drips through the screened tent windows  if coleman would add a zip up cover onto all of the windows it would easily solve this problem      
942,4.0,                       i bought this tent for occasional camping trips   i do not need the most industrial  spacious  or best tent on the market for my occasional use   i ordered this on amazon as it was significantly less expensive than anywhere else i could find   after receiving the tent i set it up and let it air out for a while   setup was simple and i was able to accomplish by myself in roughly      minutes the first time by myself going slowly  making sure i had all parts   it does it s job and provides a good place to sleep in the wilderness or your back yard   it fits a queen sized air mattress with a little room to spare on each side   good rainfly and no leaks that i could find   good tent overall  i would recommend for the price when it goes on sale  as low as fifty five dollars sometimes   great tent at a great value      
943,5.0,                       great i use it for   people only with queen size mattress  and about half the room to spare for our things while camping  i would not try to fit   people it in unless you like to sleep on your bags but   should be comfortable enough  pretty good build quality  used it at least    times for weekend trips and no problems so far      
944,4.0,                       great tent that kept me dry though the rainy early summer rains of pisgah national forest   my only complaint is its a bit short as if i lay in it parallel to the walls and stretch a bit my head and feet touch the walls as i am         i setup my single size air mattress diagonal and it works out great   enough space for me  my air mattress  and clothing and gear   i use it for car camping on mountain bike road trips      
945,5.0,                       i liked this tent very well  i went for a family camping  and as expected it started raining heavily during mid night  i didn t see single drop of water inside my tent  but when it rains  water may come inside from the tent floor      
946,5.0,                       just bought and used this tent this weekend   unbelievable value at around       construction seems solid  much better than expected for the price point   the floor design is particularly interesting with the seams being several inches off the ground  not at the base of the tent several reviewers have complained about water   pick up a can of spray on silicon sealant  about   dollars    hit the seams twice inside and outside and do a light coat over the rest of the tent   should take about    minutes i went through a storm during my first night in it so severe i had to retreat to my vehicle about    feet away due to heavy lightning   it was raining so hard i could barely see the tent  followed by pea size hail   this lasted about an hour   i was in a small canyon and a stream was running right next to this tent  under part of it   the only water that got into the tent came off of me  the thing didn t leak a drop   safe to say i was super impressed      
947,5.0,                       awesome little tent  super easy to pop up  it fit a queen air mattress  my moto bag and gear  and still had some room for my to bring my shoes and stuff inside  it s pretty quiet in the wind and the expandable bag means that it actually fits in the back it came in      
948,1.0,                       tent is easy to set up but not wind resistant  the entire side kept caving in to wind and the rain cover made it even worse  if planning to use this tent in any level of wind  do not buy  unfortunately i sent it to a family member and can t return it  very disappointed with this purchase and will not buy coleman products again      
949,4.0,                       we love this tent  especially for the price  i m rating it with   stars though because a rip appeared at the bottom of the door zipper during our first use  however  coleman was very easy to deal with and shipped a new tent with no problems  we just had to take a picture of the damaged tent  provide our sales receipt  etc    we easily fit a queen sized air mattress and   large dog beds in this tent and still had plenty of room left for our backpacks and other items  this tent is great for a warm night and allows for plenty of ventilation  if  like me  you get cold easily you will not want to use this tent in temps of     degrees or cooler or  if you do  you might just need a really warm sleeping bag  i wish the fly were a bit larger extending outward more  but the current set up does provide some rain protection  like any tent that i ve had  you do need to be careful aware when zipping un zipping the door  if you re not careful it will grab the material  even with these few minor gripes  this is a great tent for the price and i would still recommend it to others who are looking for a large tent of decent quality that is well priced      
950,5.0,                       i bought this tent a few days before leaving to go camping  had no issues putting it together  i had no weather issues while camping but ive read other great reviews saying this tent is a beast in the wind rain  this tent can probably fit   people at max but there would be no wiggle room  it was just me  my husband and our two medium sized dogs and it fit is very comfortably with room to spare at the bottom     
951,5.0,                       we bought two   person tents for camping  each fit two person easily  with a queen size airbed inside and extra space for other stuff  but probably too tight to fit   persons  anyway  it is an inexpensive  solid tent  we experienced a very heavy storm one night and the tents worked fine   great product      
952,3.0,                       first trip of two weeks vacation in lake tahoe  after the first week the tend started to break down  the elastic wire inside the middle pole broke along with some other unstitched parts i m disappointed about coleman brand as i ve been using their camping gear for years and honestly this is the first time it happened  i hope it will be the last      
953,2.0,                       well  it s a coleman and for the most part  these little tents hold their own   however my rain fly had a break in a seam and one of the sticks snapped   i tried reaching out to coleman but they are a headache to deal with   my son has the   person model and one of his sticks also snapped   coleman just isn t producing high quality products as they once did      
954,2.0,                       purchased the six man and four man tent for our trip  we went on our first ever family camping trip this weekend  i had read all the reviews and was confident in this purchase  by day two of our camping trip it decided to moderately rain  the tent itself stood up fine however after about   hours of continual rain the bottom portion of the tent all the way around had moisture coming through as well as some drips down the corner seams  i made sure there was nothing pressing on the walls of the tent and had left a good foot all the way around the base with nothing near the sides  the tent then became extremely humid due to all of the moisture  i would recommend spending more money and get a better tent      
955,5.0,                       i would      recommend this tent  i ve never put a tent together  but it took me      minutes without instructions  it s a super high quality tent  not flimsy  the rain guard cover is also very simple to put together  but i think it d be even easier to put on with two people  it s very roomy  it s also very easy to pack up and put away  it s a very great deal  i m so glad i bought it      
956,5.0,                       the sundome is super easy to set up and over labor day weekend      kept us protected from the elements  rain   temps down into the    s  well placed mesh screens made for excellent ventilation and light  everything packs up nicely and is light  perfect for camping out of your car      
957,4.0,                       i bought the   person tent for myself and i was pretty comfortable  if you actually need to fit   people in here it might be tight  it fits my twin air mattress well  it didn t rain while i was out camping so i can t rate how waterproof it is  it did stay sturdy for   nights      
958,4.0,                       i bought this tent for camping trips for me and my boyfriend  it fits our queen size mattress with a little extra room for shoes  a backpack  or other small items  i think it is a bit small to fit   people  but i guess if you all crammed in there with just sleeping bags  it could work  my family had coleman tents all through my childhood camping trips  i miss the vertical door zippers  the newer dome styles have a round door zipper  it can sometimes be hard to figure out where the zipper ends up  especially fumbling around in the dark with a flashlight  it also has a tendency to get caught up on itself or on a little flap that covers it  overall these are just little problems that don t effect the overall quality of the tent  i liked the fly and how it was supported with a tent pole  there was a bit of dew mist in the morning and none of it got inside  for the price  it is definitely a great tent that will get a lot of use out of us      
959,5.0,                       this tent is the perfect choice for a boy who wants to have his own tent so he can have some time to himself  if you live in the south  you don t really want a navy colored one  as it s very hot in the summer and even hotter in the tent  you can set this thing up in about    min  if you ve done it a couple of times  overall  it s an awesome tent  i recommend using the   person as a   person  though      
960,2.0,                       first time going camping with a year and never build or breakdown a tent before  it was easy to assemble and disassemble  there is spacious room inside for a queen mattress and plenty extra room for your stuff  i love it        added on           just went to yellowstone and used my tent for the  rd time  this time we had a super strong above   mph wind and rain and my tent stay dry  there was some water accumulated underneath the tent and not long after  the water started seeped through into the tent from the floor  i just checked the description for the tent and it said waterproof  changed the   stars rating i had after used it the first time down to   stars only as my mattress and other stuff inside the tent ended up wet  ended up wiping down the mattress and tent floor every morning after rain       
961,5.0,                       bought this for camping and love it   it goes up quickly and easily   its not a big tent  my      husband was only slightly cramped but that s his normal day to day life so no biggie  its definitely not a cold weather tent   it is open  with screens on top and comes with a weather flap but all heat just goes right out      
962,4.0,                       we got hit in a nasty storm and the tent is not made for that so it took on some water but honestly storm was so bad i was surprised it didn t flood   very happy for the price        
963,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          bought brand new   normal rain and minimal wind when camping   had rainfly properly erected and staked down  but still allowed water to flow down the sides and leak into the front corners   this was first time use      
964,1.0,                       pole snapped first use  tried to use it again for a windy camping trip  literally did not withstand       mph winds  sheesh  i actually had to sleep in my friends truck after trying twice at two different times of the night to get it stable in the wind  i was afraid i d get in and it would collapse on me with the wind factor  this tent is just too tall  a shorter one makes most sense      
965,1.0,                       i do not like the fact that i have contacted the company as the box states  and still have an unresolved issue   i purchased this in august of      for my daughter s birthday party   the tent came the day before the party   we set it up and there was about a   inch gap next to zipper on the door of the tent   i took these pictures at the time   i don t think it s a hole  it s like it didn t get sewn there   we used it and it s easy to set up and would be perfect if it weren t for the hole   i can t really say it s weatherproof or water resistant since there is a hole in it   poor customer service      
966,5.0,                       great tent    this is my third tent and happy now  i put a large tarp over it for cold weather  wish i could buy a winter cover for this tent  other than that great tent        
967,5.0,                       i use it this weekend  as the instruction  it is easy to set up  take down  and fold up  the space in the tent is totally enough for   people without gear comfortably  it can be used in a rainy and snowy day without leaking  strongly recommend it      
968,5.0,                       i bought this tent for my first time ever camping  i took a solo trip to silver dollar city in branson mo  i had an incredible experience and this tent was awesome  i bought the   person tent    but i would say it would be a good   person tent  max    could you fit   people on sleeping bags in it  sure  but not much else would go in it  high quality material  so easy to put together  i cant wait to go camping again in october      
969,1.0,                       do not buy this tent  i was under the impression that coleman equipment was of trustworthy quality  i was also under the impression that coleman s customer service supports it customers  issues with their products  but i guess not  unless you want to go down a road of frustration  don t buy this tent we used this tent for a music festival  and there was a thunder storm one night  well  even though this was the very first time using the tent  the poles snapped and splintered and the inside of the tent got soaking wet upon speaking to coleman s customer service  they claimed that since this tent  isn t supposed to be used during a thunder storm   i have to buy all of the replacement parts on my own  better yet  if i want a tent that doesn t leak when it rains  i have to buy an entire new tent i repeat  this was my very first time using the tent  it should have held up fine  and since it didn t  coleman should replace my faulty tent for me  clearly  i was sold a bunk tent from the beginning  regardless of the thunder storm  that tent would now have lasted in any type of weather needless to say  i will never buy a coleman product again for the simple fact that they do not support their customers properly  if i am going to spend a lot of money on equipment  i want to make sure i m supported if and when it fails      
970,5.0,                       just used this tent for the first time and it s a great tent  basic  easy to put up take down  and waterproof  so all the folks wondering if you need to waterproof it  i d say not unless you plan to be in a torrential downpour  our first night camping  we had a steady rain all night long  nothing crazy  but steady  we stayed bone dry all night  no moisture inside at all for the money  and for campers like me that just do it for fun here and there  this is a great tent  very happy      
971,3.0,                       i like this tent but it s not the best   the material is waterproof but it feels rough on touching and looks cheap  also  i don t think this would really fit   people   it would definitely be a tight space for   people  it works and the color is good     
972,5.0,                       i went on a solo road trip for   months and called this tent home  i absolutely love this tent  i survived flash floods  freezing temps  and unbearable winds  this held up through it all  one night it rained so much the campsite flooded  i had my electronics in the tent with me  not to worry  no water permeated the bottom  sides did get wet  but all i cared about was the bottom of my tent not leaking  price point is amazing for a super basic tent  also  you can see the stars if you don t have the rainfly on  huge plus  highly recommend this tent  but just so you know there is nothing fancy about it      
973,4.0,                       just bought this tent in a hurry for a trip  the trip turned into a trip from hell because all   days had sporadic monsoon rains and the entire campsite turned into a mudpit  by monsoon rains  i mean  it s raining sideways  rains  one of the storms dropped   inches of rain in a few hours  since i bought the   person tent in a hurry and didn t have time to seal it  for a cheap tent  i was amazed how well it kept the water out with no sealant at all  however  the seam where the tent walls meat the tarp bottom leaks  unfortunately  the entire seam leaks slightly  but the four corners leak significantly  enough water got into the tent to puddle up in the four corners  however  someone had some tent patch tape and taping the four corners was enough to make the tent usable  i kept dry the entire trip  now that i sealed the tent  i will be happily using it again and will have confidence knowing i will remain dry gripes   the one seam leaks  the front door zipper snags if you carelessly open or close the door  the rain fly is a little cumbersome to attach by yourself  not impossible  just slightly annoying to do alone i would definitely recommend this tent to anyone looking to buy one on a budget  it s a great  roomy tent  just seal it and it s good to go      
974,5.0,                       this tent worked great  i bought it for just myself for a week long bicycle trip  i camped in it for   nights straight  includeing lots of rainy nights  and it never leaked  i am happy i purchased this one instead of a   person tent  because with  big duffle bags   pairs of shoes and a bike helmet it got pretty crowded inside  i can t imagine fitting another person inside with lots of gear  when it comes to tents i always buy at least one person more then the actual number of people i plan on actually sleeping inside  great tent         
975,5.0,                       easy to set up  has a lot of space  the case is rugged  the rain fly is needed if you want any kind of privacy  good air flow with the rain fly off  once rain fly is on  air flow is limited the only reason i didn t give five stars  the stakes  the stakes are junk  they bend  only good for grass  you need to buy nicer stakes  recommend  se  nrc   galvanized non rust tent peg stakes with green stopper we have used this thing about    plus time  in the  mud  deser sand  heavy brush hot  cold  dry  heavy rain  high winds    still going strong  no holes  no rips  no water has come in  ceiling or bellow  for the price is been wonderful  only thing to break would be the metal rings on the four corners      
976,2.0,                       finally took this tent out camping after buying it in december and wasn t impressed  it rained on our trip and the tent leaked badly  i mean puddles inside the tent  we even found one small hole and a few smaller pin holes in the tarp floor  most of the leaking came from the seam where the floor and tent meet  it was pretty heavy rain so i can understand some water getting in but not the amount we had  all of our stuff around the edges of the tent was soaked  the middle stayed dry  do yourself a favor and invest in a good quality tent      
977,3.0,                       i bought this to camp out in living room with the kids  this tent was big enough for a full size air mattress with room to spare  fairly easy to put up  came on time and packed really well  however it is missing   of the polls for the top cover  and the actual cover      
978,4.0,                       first night out and there was a torrential   hour down pour with    mph winds  this baby stayed dry  for the most part   there was a little rain pooling on the perimeter edges of the tarp bottom inside  but nothing a quick swipe of a hand towel couldn t remedy  i especially love how well ventilated this tent is  probably the source of the small amounts of water   one of the main reasons i purchased it  well that and the price  i had a long twin mattress that fits best diagonally and a smaller cooler in the tent with me and there really wasn t a lot of extra room  can t image fitting   people into this tent  maybe two twin air mattresses with absolutely no inches to spare  still  for the price  it suits my needs perfectly          
979,4.0,                        picture does not include rain flap great tent for spring fall camping  the tent comfortable fits two full length sleeping mats with room to also store backpacks i ve had the tent for almost a month now and it has weathered heavy rain  light snow  hail  and high winds  the one star deduction is that the sides of the tent do retain moisture  even just from morning dew   causing a risk that anything next to them may become slightly damp  the bottom and top of the tent do not have these issues  inside they felt dry in all weather patterns the tent is very easy to put up and take down  great for car camping and a mild hikes to a campsite  it would be too bulky to comfortable backpack with      
980,5.0,                       i realize this tent says   people but with   adults you d be shoulder to shoulder  for   adults it s perfect  i have owned   person tents before so i was aware the overrating of capacity by the manufacturers and wasn t surprised  it was what i expected and only intended to use this as a   person tent  fits a queen mattress with room around the sides for bags of clothes and such  easy to assemble  i set it up by myself in about       minutes  it took a few hours of pounding rain with strong winds and held firm with no leaks  i applied silicone spray beforehand but no seam sealer  and no water came up through the floor even though some water had puddled under the floor of the tent  this tent is a great purchase as long as you don t expect to fit   people in it comfortably  would purchase this again      
981,5.0,                       got this tent to camp in the back yard with my   yo daughter   she loved it     it is a nice tent and great price  i have a hard time understanding how they charge so little  looking at all the features and work that must go into making it  if you take your time and fold it up nicely  it has no problem fitting back into the storage bag  we really enjoyed this little tent      
982,5.0,                       this tent was perfect for me and my friend  there was plenty of space for the queen sized blow up mattress and our duffle bags  it was pretty easy to set up  too      
983,5.0,                       took this on a camping trip a couple weeks ago  there were   adults  tall and wide    and we were very comfortable  liked the height of it  too  it was super windy  we were right on lake michigan  and she held strong  one of the guys is an avid camper and he is begging me to keep the tent  so  i would highly recommend it      
984,5.0,                       great tent  we have gone camping now twice with this tent  we use a blow up queen sized mattress  in this situation maybe   more people sleeping on the ground could fit but i would get tight  if everyone was on the ground i could see   but again  it wouldn t be roomy  the tent is super easy to setup and take down  about   min both ways      
985,5.0,                       this is a very nice basic tent  easy to set up  easy to put away  bag expands so that it can be put back in the bag  this tent held up well in very strong wind  the wind collapsed two big tents  this one held up with the full set up      
986,5.0,                       this marks year   of using this tent  and it has been used frequently by roommate and i  gotta say i am surprised at how much of a champ this thing is based on price i expected something to go wrong by now but this thing has been through some storms with practically hurricane level winds and stayed together just fine  no leaks  no nothin  never tried it in the winter  probably not good though in terms of temperature  only piece of advice i d give anybody is to take care of it and to properly store it  if its wet  hang it to dry ect      
987,3.0,                       would ve given   stars but this is why     i ve always had high regards for coleman brand  however  i did not learn to speak or read spanish and the instructions are written in spanish  thought english instructions would be included  fortunately  i am smarter than the tent  will be able to figure it out  just disappointed that i live in the usa  and thought coleman was a pretty good bet that i would be able to have english instructions as primary  but not so  just spanish         
988,5.0,                       we bought this tent to use for our  car camping  trips during the covid      we love this tent for the affordability  quality  so far so good   and the ease of set up   the trick for us has been to take the extra care in keeping it dry and clean when we pack it back up   for us that has made all of the difference   we bought this   person tent for two adults  and it has been the perfect size for us   we love this tent  and recommend it highly    we have not had the chance to use it in rain or high winds as of yet       
989,4.0,                       a good product for the price   we bought the coleman tent kit as well but left it behind   the tent pegs in the kit are better than those that come with the tent  we did end up losing a couple in the ground   also  we camped on a very hot weekend  the ground was parched at the festival  the grass or hay was spikey underfoot  so we should have put a tarpaulin down first   we did not have one as being inexperienced to camping we thought this would be necessary only in rainy conditions   when i walked inside the tent my first step caused a sharp blade of grass or hay to poke through the thin plastic floor of the tent   we had an old strong picnic blanket in the car so we slid this underneath the tent in situ together and that seemed to protect it from further damage   it s a great little tent  two of us slept in it  i don t think it would be comfortable for   people but like i read in a previous review it is more a   man tent with room      
990,5.0,                       this is a good   to   person tent for backyard or warm weather camping   my daughters have used it a couple of times and have not had any issues with it   the window is nice and allows for a breeze   my recommendation would be to use this tent to children or smaller adults   there are not coverings for the windows  but when the rain fly is on that covers them since  writing this review we have also purchased the six person version of this same tent   it is nice because it is large enough to stand up in   we can easily fit three twin mattresses in it with room to spare   the rain fly needs to be staked in so you need some extra room for that when choosing a spot for your tent   but  it is very easy to set up      
991,5.0,                       i took it on a nearly weeklong camping trip in northwestern michigan and it kept us dry when it rained and out of the sun during the days  there s decent air circulation  fairly easy to set up and take back down  too bad my ex boyfriend got it in the breakup      
992,5.0,                       fast and easy to set up   the first night i used the tent it rained like a monsoon and was    degrees   i was perfectly dry inside and warm with a nice bag   packs up quickly in a small package   plenty of room inside for me and my gear   great so far      
993,4.0,                       picked up this tent to enjoy a late summer campout near a southern california beach   it was easy to setup and offers all the basic features common on tents of this type   it kept the ants and mosquitoes out without issues   however  the second time we used it  i noticed one of the conduit where the carbon rod feeds through had a rip  from nothing more than stretching it during setup   not sure if it can be used again      
994,3.0,                       it s a very popular tent because i ve seen a lot of people using it and using coleman s products   i did not like the fact that somehow ants managed to get in it   i think they got in through the top   they didn t get through the screen because they were too big to go through   overall  it was useful and i like the outside flap because at night  when it was raining  that flap protected us from the rain   i also bought superglue because i wanted to seal the stitches  someone recommended that  but i never got to that   and i brought it because i read that rain seeps in   as for me  on my camping trip  there was rain and it poured for half an hour and luckily  no water seeped through      
995,3.0,                       this was my first tent purchase and for     its a steal  word of warning   the idea that it sleeps   adults comfortably is a bit of a stretch  by myself it was fine   easy to assemble  disassemble  and store  i had a queen sized air mattress inside and there was no room for anything else  i will be using a twin mattress next time  but adding one other adult would have been terrible  had i known i would have spent the extra few dollars on the   or even   sleeper but   great single person tent     
996,5.0,                       this coleman tent was easy to set up and it looks great  the polyguard fabric is strong  all of the seams are tight and the zippers move smoothly  there were zero issues with this tent  all of the necessary hardware was included  a storage bag with handles was also included  i am completely satisfied with this purchase      
997,4.0,                       great for a short camping trip  very easy to set up cons  zipper gets caught on the covering flap  the tan curve at the bottom right of the door   bottom vent zipper is on the outside  why   not really   person  i think this is standard for tents  but if you can t really fit four people in here  maybe if you squeezed and had no supplies  pros  easy set up  i m a complete novice and this took only a few minutes  glad i practiced once before actual camping trip  though  my son and i plus some gear were very comfortable  great for the price      
998,4.0,                       have had the coleman sundome   person tent out   times now on weekend camping trips  tent sets up well seems very sturdy  tent seems well made and designed  sets up easy  comes down and packs easy  breathes well with rain fly on  i haven t had it in the rain yet but seems like it will be water tight rain fly has good coverage yet still breaths  for the price i would recommend this tent     
999,5.0,                       we used this tent on our first ever camping trip  and i m happy to report we experienced sun  rain  and strong winds  this definitely held up and stayed dry  there are lots of  windows  for air  and you can zip unzip the front and back for additional air  we have never set up a tent before  and by following the   step instructions  which are conveniently attached to thr bag   we had it up in    ish minutes  i would say thay   of those    minutes were us trying to figure out what to do since it was our first time  next time i forsee us setting it up in   minutes  highly recommend this tent  two queen beds really do fit inside next to each other with plenty of space for your belongings  great value   highly recommend this tent      
1000,5.0,                       i have only used this once  so far  i am not a seasoned camper outdoorsman  i only camped because i needed to do some astrophotography out in the desert at a primitive camp site  i was able to set this up at night after a     mile drive with no prior knowledge of how to set up a tent  tired as i was from the drive  the tent was very easy to set up      
1001,4.0,                       amazing tent  i loved the windows to keep the air blowing naturally  it was a perfect size for three people including space for storage  im     and i slept great  it was a little confusing remembering where i zipped it close each time lol  but that was just me always changing the way i entered and excited it  i thought i would have wanted a bigger then  but this size for perfect for me and my friends  the only negative is i was missing my carrying case      
1002,4.0,                       if you plan to bring anything at all inside this tent  then it sleeps two comfortably not three  i like this tent  it was very easy to put up quickly and take down  i have not been able to find a tarp base to fit underneath it properly      
1003,4.0,                       this little guy was easy to put up and nicely designed  i did not realize  however  that the screen vents are not covered  so if it s cold and there s any wind at all  it gets quite cold inside  this is my fault for not reviewing the details thoroughly before buying  i ll keep it around for a nice april september option      
1004,3.0,                       this product is not fit for two adults  two children or teens maybe  we used it once and had to leave our campsite and go to walmart to purchase a larger tent instead  that being said  my boyfriend is       but i am      and felt cramped      
1005,5.0,                       every year  first week in november  a group of us spend a few bug free days on the wisconsin river   up until last year no tents were allowed  only sleeping bags under the stars but with so much rain in this area the ban was lifted last year   this tent was quick and easy to assemble  waterproof  wind proof  easy to pack up and a nice size   i was in it on my own but was plenty of room for more people  easy to pack up too  highly recommend this tent      
1006,4.0,                       easy set up as all small tents  a little bit of water came in on two of the corners  by the bottom seam of the door and small leak over head  not      water proof  maybe     water proof when temps dropped below   f this tent was cold  the big mosquito neting allow air to flow inside and gets cold quick  i wouldnt use it in the spring nor the fall  this is a summer tent i believe      
1007,4.0,                       i guess the measurements are calculated from one corner to the opposing corner for length  because the tent is not long enough to lay out fully at six foot tall  more like a large one man tent for someone      or shorter  good quality though      
1008,5.0,                       this tent was very spacious and easy to set up  my boys were super excited about camping because they had their own tent  the ventilation inside the tent was great with the optional open top and the two  windows   i would buy this tent again      
1009,5.0,                       wonderful tent  the past time i set up a tent   it did not go well  in fact  that had been the case for most of my experiences with tents this tent  i ll never worry again  it was so easy to unpack and set up  and  and  i was amazed by this  they have the instructions on  water safe material stitched into the tent bag  aaaaaamazing  truly  now even when your friends borrow this amaxing tent  they wont have to fear  either      
1010,2.0,                       it s actuallt a very good tent   but do not buy this tent if you want to go to burning man   every day i had a layer of dust inside  and durning a dust storm  which happens a couple times a week min  i ended up with more than a quarter inch covering everything inside      
1011,1.0,                       string in rod broke before even got one use  ordered a replacement because i read other reviews and this is supposed to be a great tent  wonder if it was just a fluke  either way i hope i wontbw disappointed for the next  my dad has the same exact tent but   person and loves it  had it for years      
1012,5.0,                       the tent was very easy for my husband to put together  it took him maybe    minutes  i did appreciate the tarp that came with the tent because we did not get moist with dew  the doormat was a nice touch as well  there are pockets on the inside where you can store small things  keys   we were able to fit a queen air matress with plenty of room on one side and at the foot for our two bags  the tent was a great price and did the job      
1013,5.0,                       we are usually car campers  don t like how humid and sticky most tents get  but on a big trip with too much luggage decided to get this and it was great  we won t go back  it breathed well even in humid summer conditions and kept us dry in the rain  it s quick and easy to assemble  and seems durable  interior pockets and a lantern hook are nice touches      
1014,4.0,                       worked well in the mountains of wv   i sprayed multiple coats of silicone water proofing spray on the rainfly     unfortunately we were hit by a tropical storm in fl   tent had a lot of water in it   i don t blame the tent though  doubt much could stand up to that    easy to put together  easy to take down   good ventilation      
1015,4.0,                       pretty simple set up  first time setting up a tent and did it in around       minutes  set it up in the back yard just to make sure it was all good before our trip  this arrived very fast  looks sturdy  gave it   stars instead of   because there is not much room  it says   person  but im     and there is just barely enough room for myself and another smaller person and that is it  good for just me though      
1016,5.0,                       bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it  we slept out in it in the pouring rain for two nights and stayed nice and dry  the one side leaked a little bit of water through the seems but we just put a towel there and it was fine      
1017,5.0,                       tent is awesome for the price    perfect for two adults  easy to put together  durable and looks nice      
1018,5.0,                       tent sets up easily and is very rain proof   we slept in a downpour and got not a drop on us   if it is windy would recommend putting the corner towards the wind   a stiff wind could push a flat wall in   ft or so   very happy with the tent  would recommend it      
1019,5.0,                       it is a good quality tent  fairly duable  the rain shell is ok  but the mesh windows up top can not be closed on the large non door sides  for heavy rain and wind  it is not ideal  for standard stuff  it will do fine      
1020,1.0,                       i ordered this tent because of the glowing reviews of other people  one of the two main fiberglass support poles cracked lengthwise the very first time i tried to raise the tent  very poor construction on those poles      
1021,5.0,                       great first tent  although i did purchase the   person tent by accident  wanted the   persons  but need to use it immediately after it arrive so i made due  very large when assembled  friends can stand pretty much straight up and down in the middle             rained the first night i used it with moderate winds in the middle of a sand bar and it help up great  no water got in and it never felt like it was going to fall apart rip      
1022,5.0,                       so far so good  easy to put together  it perfectly fits a double    person  air mattress inside  this tent held up well in several days of rain and wind  it stayed nice   dry inside  other than the mud   damp brought into the tent from coming and going  after seeing a neighboring large tent blowing down the road like a tumbleweed i did invest in some heavy duty tent stakes  so worth the price for a few dollars per stake  i bought    this little tent wasn t going anywhere  quality product      
1023,5.0,                       have used it for multiple festivals and camping trips  including downpours and very windy beach camping  it s tall enough to stand in and can easily fit a double height air mattress  gear  and dog      
1024,4.0,                       purchased the   man as i was in need for a new tent  roomy enough for me and my pack with room to spare  only issues i had were the seams where the  welded floor meets the tent  the seams weren t well sewn  see pics   i always seal the seams of my tent but the corners needed extra attention  i put it up in my yard to seal the seems and dry and the corners still leaked two days later when we had some light rain so i got a thicker agent  couglan s seam seal  and re sealed them again  i ll just have to keep an eye on it every time i plan a camping trip  overall good tent for the price      
1025,5.0,                       this is our second   person coleman tent  we love them and they are worth the money    only thing that sucked was that the second time we set it up the tent pole went thru one of the sleaves  after examining it  it looked like the fold line had weakened the material but the great thing is that it survived two nasty rain storms back to back without any wanter let in  we were in california when a thunder storm came thru over head and rained all night  we work up dry and outside the tent was about   inches of standing water all over  it rained hard  easy set up  easy storage  would buy again  perfect for two people and your stuff or two people and a dog      
1026,2.0,                       the description of the tent said it would be a   x    tent for two people   it also stated that it would be     feet  high in the description    i am      and as you can tell i m easily      taller thank the center of the tent    yes me being a taller person i can still fit inside with my body going diagonal    all in all good material awful description       
1027,5.0,                       coleman really has it down as far as what may be needed for camping  down to the little flashlight pockets inside the tent and the rain cover for the top  easily fits   small adults or   larger adults  my boys are      and fit fine      
1028,5.0,                       this is my first ever tent as my kids joined cub scouts  it was super easy to assemble with very clear directions  i liked the size too  it was   of us in the tent with enough room  over night it rained very heavily but this tent kept us dry  just make sure to pitch ur tent where the rain water will not stand  it was very easy to put it away too     
1029,5.0,                       this a good big tent  very high and large enough for   people  however when we first had to use it we faced difficulties due to strong wind and since this is a big tent it was impossible to mount it without help of   other people and adding heavy stones inside the tent  however the tent is still great quality  zippers are great  very easy to go out and inside  also it took us   mm to fold it back      
1030,5.0,                       bought this tent primarily for music festivals in the midwest  i m not gonna lie  i expected everything that was touching a wall to be soaked when it rained  to my surprise  when the wind kicked up and the sky unloaded  everything in my tent stayed dry    i don t suggest more than   adults for the    person  model though      
1031,4.0,                       this tent has gone through a few weekends so far and has held up just fine  i was not expecting much as far as weather resistance goes but it kept me and my stuff dry during   heavy thunderstorms  set up is super easy and straightforward for   person to set up a queen airbed will fit inside  but barely i wish the top was larger so it would shed the water off further from the tent  i also do not like how small the outside boot mat is overall this is an excellent tent for packing light for weekend camping trips or for those on a budget like me      
1032,3.0,                       the tent has some nice features  the only bad thing is lack of ventilation with the rain fly on  i guess if i wasnt worried about rain i could have left the rainfly off roomy for   people with cots but sleeping bag users might bet   in it  would be very tight      
1033,5.0,                       we love this tent   it s very high quality and very durable  hoping it will last us a long time  easily fits a tall queen sized air mattress with plenty enough floor space to store bags and shoes  highly recommend      
1034,5.0,                       i got this tent to go camping for the first time with boyfriend who is an experienced camper outdoorsman  it set up very quickly  in about    min  the rain fly was a little tricky when it came to getting the pole in  but we accomplished it in about   min  we set up the tent in a wi state park and generally had very nice weather  so we have yet to see how it would hold up in less than ideal weather conditions  we did put a tarp down beforehand to protect the bottom of the tent  the venting in the tent kept us cool at night during some hot summer days  it fit a queen sized air mattress inside with about       of space at the foot of the mattress and along one side for us to be able to store our gear and have some movement space inside the tent  overall we were very happy with this tent and hope it holds up for many trips to come      
1035,5.0,                       my first and favorite tent  super easy to set up  learned in about    minutes  i already know i will be using this tent for as long as possible  the windows keep it well ventilated  and you also have the option to zip them closed with a cover as well  the rain shield attachment on top is much appreciated  keeps tent shadier as well  this is a well made tent  the bottom of it has durable material that keeps you out of dirt and potential water  it s surprisingly spacious as well  was big enough to fit   people comfortably  and perhaps   if sitting      
1036,5.0,                       very happy with this tent  compact but plenty of room for us while camping in yellowstone  very comfortable for   people and a queen matress  rained heavily a couple times while we were there  never had any issues      
1037,3.0,                       i m very disappointed with the zipper on the entrance   its worse with getting stuck than a super cheap wind jacket  in the middle of the night when your kid needs to use the bathrooom and its completely stuck    you will have some very choice words for sure        
1038,3.0,                       this is the first tent that we got it was very easy to setup just like mentioned around    min but the only issue that i found our first use is this is not water proof we pitch this tent after a rainy afternoon and my sleeping bag and other items that came in contact with the tent floor was all wet  having an extra layer should not be an issue and this is the only reason i am giving   star      
1039,5.0,                       easy to set up and take down  used it in high winds  heavy rain and snow  perfect for two folks but   could fit shoulder to shoulder  added mr heater buddy in    degree weather  so toasty  great tent for low cost      
1040,5.0,                       this tent is crazy easy to put up  it took less than    minutes to assemble and was big enough to sleep   adults    kids  and   dogs comfortably  it s reasonably priced and seems durable enough to last a while  i didn t experience any rain during my camping trip  so i can t attest to it s weatherproofing  but the rain cover seems capable of keeping the rain out  it s a good value for the money      
1041,5.0,                       the first night i used this tent it downpoured all night and the rain guard kept the tent completely dry   besides the obvious dampness that is inevitable while camping  i ve only used it on one camping trip so far  but we set it up and broke it down pretty quickly which is what i was mainly looking for  ive only had two people sleeping in at once and it was very spacious so fitting   people in there relatively comfortably seems like no problem      
1042,5.0,                       we used it to camp in the sedona forest woods  it was a very easy set up  we layed a tarp on the ground first  then set the tent over it  we used the rain cover  we got rain one of the nights and we had no issues with leaks   we fit our full size air mattress in there  it was sturdy and durable  we had no issues with it  highly recommended for the price and for two ppl  by the way we were highly inexperienced campers      
1043,2.0,                       the good points about this tent is that it is quick and easy to set up  i really do not see how this can be called a   person tent  the only way   periople can fit in here is if you like to snuggle     and i am only  ft     it is great as long as it does not rain   after putting this tent up and looking at the construction of the floor seems  i knew this tent would leak  you could see light through the stitching of the seams   we had rain every afternoon while camping in the blue ridge mountains and as sure enough the rain was pooling in all   corners  i had an air mattress so i just pile everything on the mattress to stay dry  however  a new tent should not leak like this  if you go camping more than once a year  this tent really is a waste of money  i recommend spending a little more money and get a better quality of tent unless you don t mind getting wet      
1044,5.0,                       didn t check it with water yet but other than that   this is a great tent using it a lot if you are in a sandy environment   maybe not a good idea because it s not sealed   the first layer is only with a net  and the outer layer is for the rain   so when a lot of sand and dust it will get into the tent quite easily  so just take this into consideration     
1045,5.0,                       great tent  easy to set up and very roomy  only drawback is that there are   screen mesh  panels    on each side of the tent and   that make up the top part  and only   of them zipper up  so when the night gets a bit chilly your still getting in air from the roof with the rainfly attached i use mine in the backyard for sleeping and meditating  to enjoy the outdoors  and not feed the local mosquito population   you can easily sit up in this tent and in hot weather you have great ventilation  that little vent by the floor does wonders i have had it up now for over a month and it is solid the price was perfect and for a coleman you know you are getting high quality      
1046,5.0,                       this is a great tent for   or   people   it s can theoretically hold   people  but they better be very good friends and carrying no  stuff    it s not tall enough to stand up in  but it is tall enough that i can put on a pair of long pants while bending a bit   it is easy to set up  sturdy against medium strong winds  and water proof   i have used it for backpacking  but it s really too heavy for that    there are much lighter tents available  though they are more expensive  like    times  and not as roomy      
1047,5.0,                       uses this tent for a   night camping trip  love how the sides are open  cools the tent down fast in the evenings  however it could be a downfall too  get a wind while raining and it could be raining in the window  still give   stars as it was stupid easy to set up and take down  and fit   adults and   children  plus all our luggage  perfect      
1048,5.0,                       this tent is an absolute steal at this price  the only drawback is that s it s pretty heavy if you wanted to hike with it  though i m fairly certain no one in their right mind would be lugging around a   x   tent in their pack  it s about as easy to set up as every other standard tent out there it s quite spacious inside    we were able to very easily fit   people and      lb dogs  including a full size air mattress that   of us slept on  i think   people would be possible  though it would be too crowded to really move around  i was also able to nearly stand up completely in the middle of the tent  oh and another thing about the air mattress    some smaller tents could not fit the air mattress through the door while fully inflated  but this one had no problem at all the tent kept up dry through some very light drizzle so i can t comment too much on the waterproof ness  though it seems that it would hold up in some mild storms i highly recommend this tent if you are looking to do some  car camping  or want to set it up in your backyard      
1049,5.0,                       all as described  it fit two thick grown adults just fine  cuddles all night type of room  the tent itself was very sturdy  the steaks that it came with were a little too malleable  other than that great purchase for the price      
1050,5.0,                       ordered this tent for a   day camping trip so i  wouldn t have to crawl in and out of a tent  being able to stand up to dress was appealing too  this tent fit the bill  easy to setup   took   of us about    minutes without having pre read the directions   roomy for   people  gear and queen size air mattress   i think it would be tight for   people  well ventilated so we didn t overheat when the sun hit it  was cool at night  i think it would be cold using in the fall spring months here in ne  easily remedied by having warm clothes and sleeping bags  we haven t applied seam sealer yet  we were lucky with no rain but definitely plan on applying per reviews  can t really beat it for the price      
1051,5.0,                       i got this tent for a totally last minute car camping trip  i didn t know what to expect but i found i had purchased and easy to use durable tent  perfect for its intended purpose  it never rained while i was out there  so i cant say how it will handle that but a child could set this tent up  took me about   minutes to set up and take down  it has a nice bag to store everything in and is easy to store  i m happy with my last minute purchase      
1052,5.0,                       this tent has served me well in rainy conditions  and i m very happy with it  it breathes very well  also  the tent is just big enough for me to stretch out inside  and i m       if you re much taller you might have to sleep diagonally  or it may feel like your head is right up against the tent wall      
1053,5.0,                       perfect for camping  i slept in it alone and had a thin single size air mattress  easy to set up and take down  enough space to keep my stuff organized  i would only want to share this with another person if we were going to be cuddled up as it would definitely be a bit tight  great for single use or couples  not so much two casual friends      
1054,5.0,                       easy to installworth each penny  i went with my gf to camping area by bicycles and that tent was our home for one night there  it was very easy to install and not heavy at all good protection from bugs or crawl insects      
1055,5.0,                       i finally took this tent camping this weekend and it works great   easy and fast setup and tear down   in rained all night the second night of camping and this tent stayed completely dry inside  there are a couple of nice simple features in the tent such as   hanging small storage pockets for phones and wallets and a front door mat is included   also  the door is angled so that the rainfly keeps the water from dripping directly on you as you enter and exit the tent   this is a great car camping tent for weekend use      
1056,5.0,                       this is my first tent and first time camping  like any beginner  i did a lot of research and struggled with whether i was buying the right tent  that evening was cold and rainy  i thought we were going to freeze in this very light tent  to my surprise  the tent was perfect  it was easy to set up  very roomy  got the   person even though it was just two of us  the rain was not an issue and it wasn t cold inside at all  my first camping night with this tent was a good experience and i will be using it at lease   more times this summer      
1057,4.0,                       i have not have any problems with this tent  during the first time i used this tent on it rained at least   out of   days  nothing in my tent became wet      
1058,5.0,                       says it s a   person tent  but that s if you re really sardined in there  this was the perfect size for my husband and i to have room to move around and room for our packs  etc  next to our sleeping bags  very easy to set up  the stakes were a bit cheap and bent easily when trying to put them in hard ground  but this was a great purchase for the price  hoping to use for many years to come      
1059,5.0,                       it s great  it s a free standing tent so you don t need soft ground to put up this tent  i ve taken it on three trips already  two to fishlake in utah and one to grand teton up in wyoming  we dispersed camp and it held up just fine with wind and it stayed put as long as there was something in the tent  i layered up knowing it would be cold  but my friends didn t listen  the vents in the tent didn t help as the cold wind would enter the tent through them  wish it could be closed  but for the price i can t complain much  it keeps me away from the elements and wild animals      
1060,5.0,                       i bought two of these for my scout troop   i generally buy ozark trail brand because it is generally a little cheaper  but is still pretty good   however  i pitched out the extra     and got this four man tent   i set it up when it arrived and it was made of much more sturdy and durable material   you could tell the walls were thicker   there is an extra vent at the bottom which helps with hot days   the poles are much thicker than ozark trails    another feature i like is the e port has a zipper on it   many of your cheaper tents don t have that   i ve owned many different kinds and brands of tents in my life   this one is one of the best      
1061,5.0,                       this tent was great   we had big storm blow through  the park ranger told us to get inside because of potential lightening strikes  i was sitting in my car watching  and we lost one canopy  another one almost gone  my son s tent gone  but i watched my tent blow completely flat and bounce back up twice  it was amazing to watch  and was completely dry inside  after the storm  thumbs up      
1062,5.0,                       surprisingly good  we re a film company  this tent spent a week in the rain and winds up to   mph while housing expensive sound equipment  the only thing was the seams not covered by the rain fly leaked a small amount  sealing fixed that easily  we did use real tent stakes and not the wire ones that come with this tent  all in all  a great tent      
1063,5.0,                       my husband and i decided to upgrade to a bigger tent this year and went with a   person tent so that we could both use cots to sleep on and have plenty of standing room  we were happy with the size of the tent once we assembled  just a heads up  if you order this tent  like the screen on the front door of the tent  there are screens on each side of the tent and the top cover is what blocks the screens so it is not completely open  if that makes sense   it was a little strange at first because we had never seen a tent like that but i guess for circulation it is nice  and it allows you to use propane lanterns inside  if i had known that i may not have ordered it  but overall  we are happy with the tent      
1064,4.0,                       we bought this as our first tent for our first camping trip  it was super easy to set up  easy to tear down  worked great for two nights   we tore the actual tent very slightly when inserting the poles but it wasn t a deal breaker by any means      
1065,5.0,                       probably the easiest tent set up i have ever experienced  and it actually fits back into the back with room to spare  it comes with the basic steel tent stakes that will bend in soggy ground  but if you are careful pounding them in they will get the job done relatively well  good ventilation so the dew buildup was minimal in the morning  pleasantly surprised by that  no rain test yet  fortunately   but will update if that turns out to be a disaster  but the quality seems up to coleman standards so i dont expect that to happen      
1066,5.0,                       great tent    it was easy to set up and my daughter and i used it for camping with the girl scouts it was perfect for the two of us  three people will be pushing it for sure  looking forward to using it again  we bought an extra tarp for underneath is and on top because when we went camping it was down pouring and we stayed dry as could be      
1067,5.0,                       this tent is awesome  recently went beach camping and it rained on us for   days straight  we got some hardcore nc coastal rain with some gusts of wind  this tent held up amazingly  we used an additional tarp for underneath the tent as anyone should and we were completely dry  the rain fly held up great as i thought it would fly off for sure  i would not recommend sleeping more than   full sized adults inside or   kids definitely not made for   adults but quite roomie for        
1068,5.0,                       this tent is big and spacious  its a   person tent but for me and my wife there is plenty of room  we took it out and god caught in   thunderstorms   night in a row  the tent did not leak not even once  not even a drop     
1069,5.0,                       what a great tent and got a great deal  held up to the rain very well and perfect room for an air mattress and   backpacks and still have a little room  used this for a couple summers already and this tent has held up great     
1070,5.0,                       this tent is the perfect size for   average sized people  it held up very well throughout a   day canoe trip  it didnt rain so we did not get to test out how waterproof it is  but the cover appears very sturdy and hangs off the tent so i would imagine that it would work well  it only took   minutes to set up and take down      
1071,5.0,                       got my tent today will update when try it used this weekend in northern maine rain hard all day saturday and no water got inside very good ten very satisfied   would recommend to someone or anyone that likes camping     
1072,3.0,                       inner window s zipper is not fully functional  besides that everything is ok  i took this with me to yosemite national park  perfect for two people if you choose   person s size  not blocking too many light from inside  so that means outside can see about     light from inside      
1073,5.0,                       it s larger than i thought  it works perfectly for a family with   small children      
1074,5.0,                       just used this once in july for about   days  but we are very satisfied with it  these tents tent to loosely use the term   person  have that in mind  it was just me and my husband and we had a little room for a few backpacks inside  but that is why we bought a   person tent  i would definitely not recommend this tent for the summer  unless there will be a strong breeze where you re at  it gets very hot inside      
1075,1.0,                       tent worked well   went up with the help of my wife  but the directions could have been more clear the supplied tent stakes are a joke  giving it minus one star   buy yourself a tent stake kit update   nd use   entire seam been the tub and the upper layer is leaking terribly   wife and i are both soaked   at least the dog had water overnight      
1076,4.0,                       i do not like at all that the windows do not have zippered covers over the screens  i would not have purchased this tent had i known this  screen windows only get covered with using rain guard   the front door has screen zipper covering which is great      
1077,4.0,                       i only assembled this in the house as i never used on a road trip in case there were no motels available  a little tricky to assemble at first but at least the learning curve is quite easy  looks nice in the house      
1078,5.0,                       a excellent value  not a backpacking tent   i really like it but plan more for two adults and their crap    x   foot print   i live in south florida and i use one of poles from my old tents to create a cross for the rain fly   i suggest you still seam seal it especially on the crown of the fly   the low vent really helps with onvetion and getting the hot air moving up and out      
1079,5.0,                       brought this out camping the day after i got it  and it worked great   it rained lightly during the night but we were perfectly dry inside   people and   german shepherds all fit comfortably in the tent  with room to spare   it was quite a bit larger than i was expecting and it is also very tall  so changing was easy since you can very nearly stand straight up in the tent the tent has a lot of ventilation which worked great for the summer  and also since we had   dogs and   people i was concerned about condensation building up  but it wasn t an issue   i probably wouldn t use this tent if it was very cold or windy out though   but its perfect for the spring summer fall in illinois      
1080,5.0,                       good tent bought this a few days before my last camping trip and it worked great  easy to setup and take down  i would buy some upgraded ground steaks as these bent easy in the rocky ground but other than that good but for the money  also agree with another review about the blue being a but darker for the morning light      
1081,1.0,                       we used this tent twice and the zipper broke i guess that is why you only have a short window for returns   so disappointed as we really purchased this text because it was a coleman   so disappointed      
1082,5.0,                       this tent is great for my son to take on his scouting campouts  he is    and can set the tent up on his own  sturdy material  easy set up and take down  and i love how the storage bag expands in order to make it easier to store      
1083,5.0,                       we picked the two person version up at a time when the price was under      the quality simply cannot be beat at that price  assembly is easy  has a built in tarp  slept two comfortably  really happy with this purchase have not used it in bad weather  so unable to comment on how well it d do in a the rain      
1084,5.0,                       got the   person tent for a roadtrip i went on with my gf  amazing tent for the price  im      and i could stand up fully inside  with   ppl we set it up w in    minutes  rained a couple of times but we stayed dry inside  loved how you can expand the storage bag since theres no way to get it back in as tightly as before  reliable rugged  weatherproof  and tons of space at least the   person  what else do u need     
1085,5.0,                       this tent provides a lot of bang for your buck  is reasonably watertight  reasonably well vented  quite light to carry  and very fast to both pitch and disassemble  it is most definitely not made for cold weather  but it s a great camping tent for the warm seasons edit  having taken it on a few more trips at this point  it s holding out pretty well and i m actually quite impressed by how well it stays pitched in strong winds      
1086,5.0,                       we bought this for my son to use on boy scout campouts and are very happy with our choice   it is extremely easy to set up and is very sturdy   we used this in the davis mountains in west texas where the ground was extremely hard and the winds were ferocious   several tents collapsed in the wind  but not this one   for at least two straight hours the wind blew so hard that i felt the tent folding over me  but it never collapsed on us   and it didn t leak a drop during a few thunderstorms either   the size provides plenty of room for two scouts and allows for a  rd boy needs to sleep in there too if needed   four people in this tent  even if they are boys  would be extremely tight      
1087,5.0,                       on previous occasions  i bought other coleman tents but this one is bigger also the ventilation improves a lot  i will be buying the same tent from now on like i said this tent is perfect for my day out in the forest      
1088,5.0,                       i was able to get the tent up in     mins like the instructions indicated   next time i suspect i will be faster   the  x  offers a lot of room   there are some neat features with the tent that i didn t see advertised initially  like   pouches inside the tent  say to put your keys or phone or flashlight or whatever    there are also some hooks to hang things from  like a small fan from the center top area    i have not used the tent outside overnight yet  but the bottom of this tent seems tarp sturdy   i bought a     blue tarp thinking i would definitely need to use it  but i don t think i will need it as long as the ground is basically clear of rocks and such  you can t beat the price      
1089,5.0,                       this was my first time using a tent and i had no issues setting it up  my husband and i assembled it in approximately    minutes  quality is good  vibrant colors  and durable  also  the carrying bad to store the tent is large enough that you don t have to struggle to get everything to fit back in it      
1090,3.0,                       i ve owned two of these tents and they re decent for the price  they re easy to setup and have stood up to some pretty high winds  the only issue i ve had is that both of the ones that i ve owned have leaked  i ve woken up to water dripping on me and puddles in my tent if you re a fair weather camper  this tent will probably be fine for you  but if you camp in rain of any sorts  i do not recommend this tent      
1091,4.0,                       i love this tent  i bought the six person tent to go camping with a total of   people over fall break this year up on lake ontario  we were able to fit   blow up twin size air mattresses in it as well as our backpacks  i give it f stars because we did have a little bit of a leak around the back window one night when it was windy and rainy  but other than that it was a great tent for college students who want to have a little bit of fun but are on a budget      
1092,5.0,                       we are new to tenting and this was a nice option  compared to other tents it was relatively  inexpensive  it does take a few minutes to set up  we left it up in the back yard for about a week to test out its water proof promises and it did rather well   we had a few days of rain and some wind with it  on close inspection we found about a half teaspoon of water in one of the corners   not bad considering the price   it would be nice if it came with a foot print  so far it suits our needs quite well would recommend       
1093,5.0,                       this is a great tent for two people with an air mattress for car camping   it sets up and takes down easily  and fits back in it s tent bag for small packing space   it does well in rain and stays dry  but can open up without the extra cover for nice weather and seeing stars through the roof      
1094,5.0,                       easy to put up  easy to pack  and is high enough for me to comfortably stand  not all the way up though  and change  probably too big to backpack with but i camp out of my truck so its not an issue for me  enough room for a queen sized air matress and still leaves plenty floor space for bags and changing room      
1095,5.0,                       this can be set up by only one person  great quality for a good price  easily protected us from a light rain and wind  we got the   person tent and it fits our    double  sized air mattresses perfectly      
1096,5.0,                       super easy to assemble  great materials   seems like it will last a while  and plenty of room for an adult or two kid to sleep comfortably  a little low to ground however if you have back problems  not taking any stars off for that however  it s not coleman s fault i m getting too old to bend over        
1097,5.0,                       i took it camping over the weekend and it rained every  day  everyone else s tent let water in and got everything soaking wet  except mine    i even forgot to bring a tarp  if you re looking for a small  durable  and waterproof tent  look no further  this is the one for you heads up though  if its hot outside the walls of the tent do build up condensation but its not enough to be super noticeable      
1098,5.0,                       this was a good deal on sale  even bigger than i thought  my kids and their   young ones had plenty of room for their gear  even with a queen size blow up mattress in there  it feels well made and i m glad i got it      
1099,5.0,                       accidentally bought this when i was drunk  much to my surprise  drunk me has excellent taste  freaking love this tent  can fit so many things in there i could almost live in it if i wanted  totally worth the money  excellent quality for a first tent      
1100,5.0,                       used this tent for its reviews and man it came in handy today  got a severe storm with     mph wind it didn t even budge  though i got a scare  and nothing more than a couple drops from the zipper  i do suggest using it with stronger stakes like i did     
1101,5.0,                       set up was quick and easy  have had it rain yet while using  but i also bought the sealer so don t anticipate any issues there  only negative is with every tent ever  they never fit back into the bag      
1102,3.0,                       the tent looks great  we have not used it yet other than to set it up to look for any problems   x  is very big with plenty of room and is about   ft tall in the middle  setup is pretty easy  wish the bag was bigger  very hard to put back in the original bag  planning on buying bigger duffle bag to fit everything as well as some tools  tent does have a small fingernail sized cut on the front wall near the coleman name  going to put small patch over it  easier than sending it back     
1103,5.0,                       i used this to camp in utah  it was a pretty nice size for two people with sleeping bags and pads  but we could not fit our suitcases in the tent  isuppose if you just had a pay pack with stuff  it woullf fit just fine  i know of another camper s tent that collapsed twice in the hardcore wind we had in zion nat l park  but this tend held up just fine  i will be using this again  for sure  and i am happy i bought it  the only reason i didn t give it   stars was because the tent became a bit stuffy  even though it was cooler outside  other times  it was freezing  so there wasnt a good temperature balance  that may be how all tents are  this was my first time camping      
1104,5.0,                       i love how sturdy it is  and usually when i get tents from other sellers  i find many rips and loose stitches in the tents  coleman s has been the most reliable when it comes to quality camp equipment  highly recommend      
1105,5.0,                       this tent is an excellent value  easy to set up  very sturdy  it is a good one person tent  i thinks it would be a bit tight for   adults i went camping in california by a lake and one of the nights the wind was really strong  yet the tent did really well very happy with it        
1106,2.0,                       would be nice to know the dimensions of it when it is ready to be  backpacked    all i saw were the overall tent dimensions   the weight is fairly well hidden too   it is too large of a bundle so it is going back   might be fine for car camping      
1107,5.0,                       it is great on assembly tear down time  less than    minutes  had mild rain at night  so couldn t really fully test the fly but there was no problem  kept bugs out as well  highly recommend      
1108,5.0,                       great tent for   people  can fit a    high queen air mattress with plenty of space for bags  if you re over        though you won t be able to lie straight as the tent is only    at the very floor and the walls slope in steeply      
1109,5.0,                       love this tent  fits a queen size mattress  withheld heavy ongoing rain for    hours with no water inside whatsoever  easy to put up and comes with stakes  the clips and sticks on the tent is not rei quality  bit the waterproof capability and ease to put up makes this a great budget tent  i was impressed      
1110,5.0,                       i bought this tent for a specific event that lasted a week during the summer  i also used it for one night during cold rainy weather  the tent has performed great  the tent has good ventilation and also seemed to keep some heat inside with the windows closed  the tent held up well during rain and wind on several occasions  the   person tent offers just enough room for two people and their gear  it is on small side  and easy to pack  which is what i needed   the thing i liked best  was that it seems very easy to set up and take down  i used the tent for a total of seven days  and i could not always get it dried before packing  there are no signs of mold or fatigue  i expect this tent to last for a long time      
1111,5.0,                       purchased this tent as an intro to camping this summer  very easy to set up  and a delight to sleep in  we had a bit of rain in our trip and i stayed bone dry in the tent  no leakage  perfect tent for summer fall camping on a budget  definitely not a backpacking tent  just a little too heavy for those looking for a lightweight tent   but a great starter tent for those looking to give camping a try  one note  tent doesn t come with a footprint  so i d recommend picking up a tarp to lay on the ground first  worked great      
1112,5.0,                       i used this tent during a cross country camping trip  it is lightweight and easy to assemble  it easily fit two people  it held up well during my    ish day trip  i would recommend it for leisurely  recreational uses  this tent has great airflow and is thus  great for summer camping  but if it s colder than    degrees  this tent is not appropriate  i used it in    degree weather for one night and froze      
1113,5.0,                       very easy to set up  i ordered this for a trip to new zealand  i liked that it was small enough to fit in my suitcase  the instructions are sewn into the carry bag so you won t loose them  i was able to set it up the first time in less than    minutes  the floor is very sturdy and stayed dry  one of the two main poles had a loose fitting on one end that i had to keep reseating  otherwise it worked perfectly  it rained several days that i used this and i can report that i stayed nice and dry inside  i used a blow up mattress which took up most of the room so  this is a  close  two man tent or a spacious one person tent  loved this tent and will miss it  found too many pretties to fill my suitcase on the way home so the tent was donated to a charity shop in wellington nz  would buy this again next time i want to go camping      
1114,5.0,                       traveled with this tent across flights  in a carry on bag   and it was one of the simplest tents i ve ever put up  had zero trouble and everything worked quite perfectly  even for   people it provides a good amount of space and is not terribly heavy especially considering everything it packs  and the price is great  would highly recommend for anyone looking for a lightweight  affordable tent  i guess i just wish there were add ons to buy  e g  pads  to make the sleep even more comfortable yet advantageous in size  weight  and affordability      
1115,5.0,                       giving this   stars based on brand  past experiences and inspection unboxing  i purchased this as a gift for my son for christmas  we are looking forward to using this for the upcoming camping season     
1116,5.0,                       i ve used this tent for three years on sandbars while canoeing on the wisconsin river  it s held up shockingly well  and proven a perfect tent for sandbar camping  i m ordering another today a few weeks ago i was solo  well  with the gsd  in the tent when a harrowing derecho howled straight down the river ahead of a large storm  sending the canoe spinning across the sandbar and turning the tent into a burrito with the dog and me folded flat in it  it lasted nearly    minutes  and i was pretty sure the tent would be destroyed  but after emerging from the mess  i was shocked to discover it had survived with no damage at all  given how much the upper part of the tent had been flapping  just imagine tying the tent behind a pickup and driving down the road at    mph for a half hour   it was a bit unreal that it survived i loved this tent before the derecho  and i m freakishly sold on its value now  heartily  heartily recommended  major kudos to coleman  well  whoever they sub this stuff to  for striking on a design that deserves to stay on the market forever the attached image shows where the canoe ended up  it started on the other side of the tent    which in the image isn t fully re tweaked      
1117,4.0,                       good tent for the price   it rained on us one night and water came in through a couple areas   it s mostly as the rain was sideways and the rain fly doesn t go as low as needed to keep that kind of rain out      
1118,5.0,                       i can t imagine any other tent being this easy to set up  i haven t touched a tent in over     years and when i set this up for the first time on the camp site  it took me about    minutes it a great size for two people  sleeping mats and extra space on the sides for luggage and other things  you will find yourself hunching over while in the tent      
1119,3.0,                       the door has a flap of material that constantly gets snagged when zipping it shut or open  since i bought this for my   year old  this happens constantly and seems like a hugely annoying design flawotherwise i love it like all my other coleman tents  easy and quick to put up take down  seriously on that flap though  why  i m cutting it off     
1120,5.0,                       good tent for the money  a little too big and heavy for backpacking and camping  this is more for a drive up camping spot type of trip however  everything works just fine and still recommend if you need an affordable durable tent      
1121,5.0,                       i recently had a camping trip in which i knew a couple months ahead of time   in the past  i ve used others  tents but this time i needed my own   i had some time to do a little research and read some reviews   this one has great reviews and the price was right  so i jumped my camping trip was two nights and   days   it rained both nights  solid showers   the inside of the tent was bone dry also  this tent was a breeze to set up    did it by myself in    min   udpdate  i m reading other reviews about it not handling the rain   i can t figure it out   how could i have gone a weekend of rain and the tent stay perfectly dry  but others got wet   i have to wonder if they didn t set it up correctly      
1122,2.0,                       we bought this tent to go camping and when we arrived at the campsite  the netting looked like it had been repaired  see posted pics  we had no choice but to use it and probably not able to return it since it has been used  i will think about it and see if i will ask for an exchange   the tent itself is a good tent  we own another exact size from coleman called monterey  we still have the monterey but the rain fly eventually has become unsewned and i had to replace it  we own many coleman products so we were a little surprised the tent showed up like that      
1123,4.0,                       just went camping and this did its job  in sun and rain  didnt realize the roof of the tent itself is vented  the rain cover worked fine  but it got very cold at night because the roof was only screen  fit my friend and i fine for sleeping  but wouldnt fit extra bags or gear too and sleeping comfortably      
1124,5.0,                       i bought this tent for a weekend excursion and was not disappointed pros    build quality is a    very easy to assemble  even for first timers    navy grey was identical to the picture on amazoncons    nonei will mention that it is near impossible to fit everything back in the bag once you take it out  but that s okay i m sure some people managed to get it back in there      
1125,5.0,                       great tent  easy set up   my seven year old granddaughter helped me   there were three of us that used the tent   i put a queen size mattress in it and still had plenty of room for clothes  a chair   my grandson slept next to mattress  i  able to stand up also  good product      
1126,5.0,                       i finally decided to purchase my own camping gear and stop borrowing from others  as soon as i got it  i set it up in my kitchen  it was incredibly easy  i was able to do it alone and it only took about    minutes  it s very roomy  i set up a full size air mattress and there was plenty of room left over  though i d say it fits two people tops  the carrying case is also very handy and the directions are attached to it so you wont lose them  it seems to be constructed very well and i like all of the venting options  we ll see how well it works for camping on the beach  can t wait to put it test  update    years later  and this tent is still going strong  after multiple beach  woods  and desert camping trips  this tent has never failed me  i love it and can t recommend it enough  it s like my home away from home      
1127,3.0,                       took our new coleman tent camping this weekend we bought coleman because that is what we always buy because it last and it is made well  coleman has proven over and over to be a great brand for trusted products and a company that backs that product we like the tent but feel it is best served for two people which is what we needed it for  myself and my wife  rained last night and it was totally dry inside  you should use the rainfly  if you get a heavy dew it will come in and if it rains you will get wet if you do not use the rainfly easy set up in about    minutes with two adults   stars because if you put   people in it there will be little room for clothes etc  our queen air mattress fit great with space for everything else  there is no way two queen mattress would fit  maybe two doubles would  we were disappointed that you could not zip up the windows  they are mesh with no flap to zip up  if it is cold you will not want this tent  this is made for warmer weather  a lot of air flowed through  we set it up on a windy day and it kept collapsing on the side that the wind was coming from so i added additional stakes and rope to secure it and it stayed then all in all it is worth the        but i should have bought the sturdier instant tent for an additional          
1128,2.0,                       i like the shape of this tent  and the floor area is nice   good air flow and ventilation   zippers seem to be sturdy and are easy to use   the disappointing part was that when the first good downpour hit  all the corners leaked at the seams and made puddles of water inside the tent   this happened within two weeks of using it   very disappointing       
1129,5.0,                       great tent  but not exactly     percent waterproof  i don t think i have ever found one that is though  an extra tarp rain fly solves that problem  overall  roomy tent for   people with gear  fits a queen air mattress just fine with room to spear in the   man tent  i d purchase again if i had to      
1130,5.0,                       easy to assemble  watertight  with excellent ventilation   the kids loved camping in it in the backyard  i only wish i d sprung for the blackout version  because this one not only lets in all the light but seems somehow to diffuse and amplify it   great for waking up at the crack of dawn  but not so much if you like to sleep in      
1131,5.0,                       love this tent so far  it easily fit   grown men  probably could have fit one more  it is very easy to put together  and we did it at night with only little lanterns  the top protection cover comes in handy for the rain  also  the netted  windows  were needed for ventilation because it could get hot in there if they re covered  overall  this is a great product and a good price      
1132,5.0,                       first camping trip   nice sized tent   i had a queen size mattress and sat two chairs inside and still had a little room   it rained a little and i stayed bone dry   i probably tracked more water in than the weather did   great buy      
1133,5.0,                       we upgraded from the similar smaller coleman   person sundome tent that we won years ago in a contest   we loved the design but couldn t stand up in the   person   we just used the new   person tent on a trip thru eastern oregon and idaho   it performed well and was quick and easy to set up and take down   we did not have any experience with rain but it appears very well made      
1134,5.0,                       this tent has been all over colorado and always serves us well  easy to set up  keeps us warm  durable  and looks cool  unless you have really specialized tent needs  just go ahead and buy this one      
1135,5.0,                       it didn t rain on our trip  so i can t say anything about how it would hold up in inclement weather  but as a shelter in mild florida spring time  this was perfect  it fit my husband and me very comfortably with a queen sized air mattress  and it was very easy to pitch  we were first time campers  and we had such a good time that we decided to make it a lifestyle  we are looking forward to making many more happy memories with this little tent in tow      
1136,5.0,                       roomy  comfortable  weather resistant  it held up well to rain and wind during our camping trip   however we did use an extra tarp below it   easy to set up and take down  i recommend this tent      
1137,4.0,                       i ve used various tents in the past from hard core backpacking tents to family goliath s  many of the tents leaked   some worse than others   but they would let in enough water in just the right places to make a good nights sleep near on impossible if it happened to rain  i m not talking torrential downpours either     just enough to soak the fabric  our llbean   man seems to be an exception   the eureka   man was a disaster    i d tried sealants and sprays which helped  but never perfectly  the eureka had a drip that came from the peak of the tent   how does that happen   so it was with a bit of anxiety that i picked up this coleman  i expected it to leak if it rained so i crossed my fingers that our upcoming camping adventure on the coast of maine would be dry then came hurricane arthur   who soaked us in over    hours of constant heavy gusty rain  it had all the makings for a veritable disaster  i thought we were done for  but as the rain fell i was pleasantly surprised to find that this tent was proof against the water  condensation from our breathing   yes  seeping raing   no  it s hard to imagine a worse test for a tent than a hurricane  and this tent survived with grace thumbs up for coleman   nice job      
1138,5.0,                       good basic tent  held up well in    degree weather      
1139,5.0,                       i was really impressed by the quality and look of this tent  i bought this for my wife and she is pleased  i m a regular camper and i will be buying one to replace my worn out tent  for     it is amazing      
1140,5.0,                       went backpacking for  weeks on the at and this tent was excellent the entire journey   everything stayed dry even though there was heavy rain every afternoon  very impressed and happy to keep everything dry  i will be purchasing a lighter tent for next thru hike only because the   pounds is a little heavier than i would like   i can use those extra lbs for other things like ace bandage and first aid for twisted ankle and bandages for injuries to the feet from river beds       
1141,5.0,                       ordered this for my camping outing  upon setting up the tent i was very surprised and pleased with the quality of this tent for such a reasonable price  very pleased with this purchase      
1142,5.0,                       really appreciated the extra room in coleman s   person tent  over the weekend   last year       we tried their   person hooligan tent and yes   it was just too crowded for us   also  the sundome is much lighter and easier to set up and was very waterproof for the few short rain showers that came   it actually got down to    degrees the first night and i was quite cold   nothing an extra blanket could not have handled  though   no problem after first day  was a great memorial day weekend        with our son and family update  with a  x  durable truck tarp under our amazingly water proof  coleman   person sundome tent   memorial day        both were put to the ultimate test  we were in a severe flash flood  resulting in a    river running under our tent    amazingly no water in tent  i was walking in my tent for    minutes like that  very strange feeling   before going to a small shelter to wait out the storm  felt sorry for the others         
1143,4.0,                       this tent is wonderful if your a beginner or casual camper whether car camping  walk in s  or backpacking  my favorite   set up is a breeze  plenty of room for   with pockets for storage and a loop to hang lanterns  it also has   vents which work great plus a partial mesh upper body   rain fly is adequate and a  snap  to put on  the floor is extremely durable  much more so than my more expensive tents  my girlfriend who has been doing research in various state parks this summer has kept dry during some nasty rain in this tent this is not the lightest tent nor the warmest    but if your on a budget and are camping in warm to mild temps this is hard to pass up      
1144,5.0,                       i was going camping for the first time in a long time and needed a tent  i wasn t ready to drop a few hundred dollars and i didn t want anything two difficult  it had to stay dry in inclement weather so i bought this tent  it was perfect for what i needed  sleep two people comfortably and dryly    i like the produce because      i was able to set the tent up alone  quickly  and without needing instructions      the tent has great ventilation  no buildup of moister inside the tent      easy to take down and put back into it s easy to carry bag very light      it fit my queen size air mattress easily and slept two comfortably  it can sleep four people in sleeping bags side by side    i would like to be able to standup instead of crouch  but then i think points   and   may adversely impacted   i had no weather problems and stands up to rain  i don t know how it does in downpours    the item was shipped and delivered on time as i expect from amazon      
1145,4.0,                       this tent was great  the only thing i would say is it did rain during our camping weekend and we did feel moisture inside the tent  it wasn t a ton  but it was enough to make our blanket a little wet where it was touching the side of the tent  it was heavy rainfall though  so it held up quite nicely in my opinion  very easy and quick set up as well  it fit our queen air mattress and all of our belongings quite well      
1146,5.0,                       very good house i m impressed by the size of it i got the  person tent   after we went camping i saw the same tent but with the dark thing inside   now i m wondering if i should ve get that   it s not a big deal i think part of camping is seeing the daylight at  am hahaha      
1147,4.0,                       you may not think this is a great endorsement but i am not a camper   even so  this tent is easy to assemble and disassemble   every time i put it up it rained and generally it rained hard   it stayed dry inside   even when i did not put the top on quite perfectly   it has good little added touches like a place to hook my lantern   for someone just getting into camping this is a good product the only things that keep this from being a five is that this does not fit four adults comfortably and it is difficult getting it back into the carrying pouch  but it does go back in   i have only been in there with my two sons and my wife   so it is just an estimate  but i would think that three adults should be able to fit easily but four would be a tight  uncomfortable squeeze   there is room for my blow up mattress and one person to sleep on the side and room on the end for storage   i like it a lot      
1148,5.0,                       this was the perfect choice of tent for my outing with my spouse  pretty spacious in the inside  easy to setup in just minutes  sturdy and no water went into the tent during a one night shower  definitely recommend if you re on a budget      
1149,5.0,                       a super easy tent that is big enough for   fluffy adults  we didn t have any rain so i can t review its wet weather fitness  but for dry weather this tent was a real bargain  perfect for one person and gear or two people who really like each other      
1150,5.0,                       this tent was super easy to put up  in the dark  no less   it ended up raining for most of our trip  but we stayed nice and dry  the vents also allow a nice breeze to flow through so you don t feel like you re suffocating      
1151,3.0,                       i bought this based on my previous experience with a similar but larger model  this was one of the easiest tents i ve ever put up  the only problem was it leaked a little around the seams on one end   i have since used sealer on all the seams and am optimistic it will be ok in the future   i do have to give it a lower rating because my older coleman held up a lot better and leaked only after    to    camp outs   even with three stars i would purchase again   but i have to be honest about the leaking      
1152,5.0,                       took this camping and was thoroughly pleased  i did receive it with one of the poles not fully together  once i restringed it and tied a knot in the end it was functioning properly  i love the option to open up the airflow or make sure it s closed up and not drafty  this will also be perfect for backpacking      
1153,5.0,                       we bought this for a grandsons eighth birthday  he opened it last  was not too excited but he also got a sleeping bag  like his brother got two months earlier  then a camping trip was planned with his scout troop  they put the tent up in the house and we received a picture of two happy boys on their sleeping bags  in the tent  jackson s grin was priceless they camped with their grandpa  so room for all three  they liked the tent  i think it will be a gift he will remember his mom did use seam seal on the seals where the sides meet the bottom  as another reviewer recommended  but it did not rain so no test there the tent came in a box  so was in excellent shape  a lovely lime green coleman tent      
1154,1.0,                       after using the tent for the very first time  while putting it away the cord in the main tent pole snapped  i contacted their support team to avoid having to do an amazon return  the pole should not break so easily  it is not durable at all  it took them an entire month and me following up with them for them to just give me a link to buy a replacement pole for more than half the cost of the tent  and now i can t return it through amazon anymore      
1155,1.0,                       this product leaked at every seam the first time i set it up  and it was a very light rain  coleman has gone down hill in quality in exponential amounts  i will never buy or use another coleman product ever again  this leaky tent ruined my sons birthday camping trip      
1156,5.0,                       three people  if ur having a threesome  otherwise  two adults and a child at best other than that  this is an excellent tent  easier than other tents to set up  about five minutes   quality materials  great zippers  has two  windows  u can open  and a rain fly down rain when i camped  so can t attest to how rainproof it is  but i don t regret this purchase one bit  i m confident it will see many more camping trips     
1157,5.0,                       i recently purchased this tent and have only set it up in the backyard to be sure it will work for an upcoming campout  my initial impression is this is awesome  it s marked as a   person tent but it s really only usable for an individual if you plan to have packs and equipment in the tent  setup was super easy and tear down even more so  love it so far  can t wait to take it on a boy scout trip      
1158,5.0,                       i love this tent  i have a family of    and my son is only    i m so glad we got the   person  there s plenty of standing room inside  and we were able to easily fit a queen air mattress and a cot  it was easy to set up  appears well made  and i probably saw   of the same tent in the campground  i m very happy with this purchase      
1159,5.0,                       holy cow where do i begin lol  its super spacious  i ordered it for just my wife and i and she loves it  not a single drop of water when we were in the middle of a storm on the mogollon rim  payson az   and its very compact so its easy to store  highly recommend this product     
1160,5.0,                       nice tent  gets the job done and is a pretty decent size this is the tent i use for backyard camping with my kids  it comfortably fits   adult  and   kids    or   adults  anything more than that would be stretching it it is easy  as tents go  to assemble  the bottom is durable and the tent is well made  personally i take a wool blanket and lay that in the bottom of the tent when using it and it makes it just that much nicer it does get hot inside if you put the rain guard on  i had it out one night when it was about    degrees in the evening  and we were all sweating with the rain guard on      
1161,5.0,                       best  deal  ever  this thing will fit   people snug    with extra room  it absolutely stormed  wind rain thunder stormed  twice while we were camping in the ozarks and not  one  drop  of  rain  got in this tent  the bottom is a built in tarp that tapers up at the edges when the tent is set up  solid tent good for wet  dry  warm  and cold conditions  lots of ventalation  a  deal     
1162,1.0,                       this tent is so teeny tiny  no way it could fit four people in it  it barely fit me and my husband  i returned this item  i got my money back immediately  the tent would absolutely be great for one person      
1163,5.0,                       super easy to set up and take down and actually fits in the bag that it comes in  i have used it very many times for road trips across the us  it s a coleman tent  super basic and it is what it is  kept me dry and shielded from rain  i always use double protection which is tarp on top and tarp under when it rains  and wind      
1164,5.0,                       easy to assemble and comfortable size  we bought an additional tarp to put under the tent  which you may want to do if you might be caught in heavy rain  it rained the first night we used the tent but with the tarp and rainfly we were completely dry inside      
1165,5.0,                       awesome tent with easy setup   took   adults about    min for setup and stake down   our first trip of the summer ended up being not an ideal situation for testing out a new tent as a random beach storm cropped up out of the blue and decided to cause all sorts of havoc to the other tents around us   our little coleman did the job and kept us dry through the night none of the lines broke and all of the pegs stayed in place   i would totally recommend this tent to anyone who needs something reliable and easy to set up   we have been on   trips since the first one earlier this summer and the only thing i have noticed is a little ware on the zippers but nothing out of the ordinary for heavy use their are a few cons but i won t knock any stars off for them as they don t affect me or the style of camping i prefer   it is not a cold weather tent     the sides of the fly do not go to the ground and the windows inside are too big   if you are looking to camp in colder situations this is not the tent for you   it is also more of a   man tent not a   man tent  but as my little bro is the only one willing to camp and not sleep in hotels this is not a problem for me      
1166,5.0,                       i purchased the   person coleman sundome  went camping in a chilly rain and had no issues  very easy to set up  loved the windows and even the ventilation flap  the rainfly kept us dry and relatively warm  this is not a winter tent  but worked well in the fall  loved the simplicity in taking it down and storing it  can truthfully say i ve never had a tent that was so easy to put away back into the bag  folds perfectly and everything fits with ease  the bathtub design and tarp was sturdy and strong  overall  i would definitely recommend this tent      
1167,2.0,                       moisture go through tent  i would ve return it but while i was camping the second day got stolen by an american family in great canyon national park  i camped and traveled around    countries  and is first time that happened to me  tent is ok for summer for   person  enough space for   adults and backpacks   but not for all the other seasons      
1168,5.0,                       this is a fantastic tent  well made and worth every penny  i went camping this weekend with my young sons   over night a wind storm kicked up   this tent was not phased  held strong      even though it was not staked down as i was on a platform   did not leak  kept the wind out and was large enough for the   of us and all our gear      
1169,5.0,                       first tent i ve ever set up  and alone at that  but it was for a music festival  i set it up and the second night and horrible storm came a brewin  the evacuated the whole campground and forced us into our cars for the next six and half hours  when they let us back into the site everyone s tent was flooded  except mine  b      
1170,5.0,                       i got this  it fit my queen blow up mattress and then there was still a good amount of room left over  easy to assemble  only used once so far but seems sturdy   i would recommend  good for the price     
1171,5.0,                       great tent for a great price  i got this tent for the kind of camping we do most often  which is car camping  i have great backpacking tents for hiking  the coleman tent feels like a mansion in comparison  the poles are fiberglass  i prefer aluminum usually  but they are thick and substansial  i think there d be little risk of breakage like thinner fiberglass poles i ve used in the past  setup was easy for the most part  but definately easier with two people  the included stakes are on the flimsy side  but can be easily replaced wit the plastic  or thicker metal kind  all in all  a great tent for the money      
1172,5.0,                       just got this tent and set it up in    minutes  first time   it should take about   minutes the next time  now that we know how to do it   thoughtfully constructed   rolled it up to fit back into bag and it took up less space than originally packaged  even though there is an option for making the bag bigger   room for two twin air beds with two feet in between   very well ventilated  so a great tent for warmer weather   we are going to the beach  so we ll see how it handles wind  heat  and rain      
1173,4.0,                       easy set up and light weight  not much options to additional storage in side but very good quality and stood strong during high winds and stayed dry during a rain  this is a perfect tent for the casual camper but maybe worth  spending a little more  money for more heavy duty tent for longer and frequent  trips      
1174,4.0,                       i love this tent  easy enough to set up with just one person i m    lbs and      the rain fly was the only slightly tricky part due to me being vertically challenged  my only complaint as that it will not fit back in the bag no matter how hard you try  you think they would make slightly bigger bags for the tent so you don t have to purchase something else to store it in  love the clip at the top for a fan or light  plus is has the power cord port which is great for where i camp most which has electric sites      
1175,1.0,                       this came without the required poles   coleman was no help   coleman for decades was the way to go for good reliable gear   no longer   to many coleman products in recent years fail the field test   this one never made it to the field      
1176,3.0,                       this might be a great for summer but did not keep us warm in     at night  easy up and easy to put back into bag   not sure how   people could sleep inside  we barely fit   but had cots      
1177,5.0,                       received item fast i had to try this item several times to give you an honest review  at first it took me awhile on how to set by myself  once i got used to it was an easy set  al lot of room just for one person with a queen size air mattress  very nice in a thunderstorm  also a windy night      
1178,5.0,                       super easy to set up  literally put it together by myself         female   for reference  in my apartment living room        would recommend if you camp alone  also if you re short like me  you can stand up in the middle      
1179,5.0,                       this tent is exactly what we were looking for  it s light  durable  and easy to setup and take down my family are not big campers  but this tent has been great for a few simple overnights or afternoons in the yard      
1180,5.0,                       i gave this tent to my newly married daughter and her husband  this will give them an inexpensive way to enjoy the outdoors  they were so happy with this gift and are excited to use it      
1181,5.0,                       for     this tent exceeds my expectations   i will probably only use it a few nights per year  we fit a queen air mattress in   one that is      high   a bag did get wet in a heavy rain because it was up against the tent  it wasn t soaking wet  but damp   thats fairly normal for tents from what i hear though   the ventilation is nice   easy to setup and put away buy a separate tarp for putting underneither it      
1182,5.0,                       i ve used this tent a ton for colorado camping  it is waterproof which is a huge plus when you can t always know the weather  the one i bought was the   person tent  and it can fit two people comfortable  but is ideal for a one person tent  you can also fit three if you pack like sardines      
1183,1.0,                       this is supposed to be rated highly for wind  we were using it the first time in windy conditions and one of the poles broke  and part of the seams started to rip  all the other tents around us were fine  so i know the windy conditions weren t that bad  we bought this more than    days before first use so now i can t even return it  i expected much better from a coleman product      
1184,4.0,                       i would honestly say it s more of a   person tent      is pushing it   it got super cold overnight when i was camping  and this tent has open ventilation in two side  which you cannot close off   the rain tarp that goes over the top covers the ventilation  but the cold air still gets in   super durable tent though and really easy to set up and take down   one of the awesome features was the ability to expand the bottom of the tent bag for storage just in case you didn t roll the tent up perfectly      
1185,5.0,                       haven t tested it in the rain yet  but i already love this tent we thought we had a   man tent  so upgraded to a   man  when it came time to donate the old tent  we saw the package read   man we set this tent up and it was huge  got the queen size mattress topper in there  two camp chairs  and the dog bed  i hope it rains next time i camp so i can hang out in my tent      
1186,5.0,                       didn t camp in it yet but i was able to assemble it by myself in about    minutes   looks bigger than i expected for a   person tent and a queen sized mattress will definately fit inside  as suggested by other people who purchased this tent  i will buy better stakes to take on my trip      
1187,5.0,                       i ordered this after looking at loads of other tents  this one was a great price for its size  it was able to fit a queen air bed with a little room to spare  if your looking at the door of the tent on the left corner there is a utility zipper opening to allow you to run an extension cord for power in the tent  it has a piece in the center of the tent on the inside in order for you to be able to hang a light of fan from the ceiling  it has plenty of air flow though the tent with the windows and door it was so easy to set up and take down  it comes with a storage bag for all the metal parts and stakes and a large storage bag to store the tent tools and tent itself  i personally really like coleman products i find they are good quality enjoy     
1188,1.0,                       i researched and decided on coleman because of its name and the reviews received the tent in one dayboxed welldirections basic but seemed easyon initial unfolding of the poles the elastic broke inside the polenow its uselessmy   year old grandson and i are very disappointedone of the main part broke on the first tryterrible qualitynot sure i will trust the coleman brand again     
1189,5.0,                       i purchased this tent for my    year old son who s a boy scout  he says that it is very easy to set up and take down  he didn t even have trouble putting it back in the bag like most of the tents he s had in the past  it hasn t been tested in the rain yet  but i m sure it will hold up  so far  we are very satisfied      
1190,4.0,                       we just use this as a backyard tent for the grand kids  i set it up and took it down by myself without any trouble  i cannot vouch for durability or how well it would hold up in rough weather      
1191,5.0,                       just used it for the first time for   days in shenandoah national park for a car camping trip   easy to assemble and fairly commodious for a   pax tent   didn t get a true test of waterproof status  is any tent truly waterproof      but it did well in pretty strong wind and a very chilly night  below freezing    haven t backpacked with it yet but i will soon      
1192,4.0,                       if you set up all the flaps you won t have any dew in the morning  and it secures down to the ground pretty good comes with ties and stakes in the bag and wraps up very compactyou really don t want to fit more than   in here  but i m      and i fit  my twin air mattress literally fits in it perfectly length and width edge to edge     
1193,1.0,                       i ordered this tent brand new  and when i received it and unpacked it set it up  it was wet and dirty   as if someone had already camped in it the night before  no joke  still water on the rain tarp and mud caked to the sides  super disappointing     
1194,4.0,                       this tent was easy to put up  it took about twenty minutes to do by myself with two small children running all over  collecting firewood   comfortably fit myself and two small children  you might be able to squeeze in a third child  but not very comfortably  if you have two adults and more than one child  definitely look at something bigger      
1195,5.0,                       l am very impressed with their quality  i bought it for my son s   th birthday in may       it is end july       it has moved from my lawns to a shady place on my deck  we enjoy our time there      
1196,5.0,                       i bought this tent for my daughter and me  she is only   but the two of us had plenty of room  once i set it up the first time it was much faster and easier the other times i set it up  goes up quickly  sturdy  and i protected us against the rain      
1197,3.0,                       for the price  it is not a bad tent that i can abuse   so far it is holding up   i did felt a bit of moisture in the tent camping in late fall in the sierra  but i did not expect a perfect tent      
1198,5.0,                       easy to set up and take down   took it camping  it rained several times  my stuff stayed dry   i was able to have the window open under the rain fly and didn t get water in   it was a great tent for me and my backpack   i am   ft and was able to sleep comfortably without turning diagonal   the door zipper gets caught on the little flap at the bottom of the door sometimes  but not a huge deal  good ventilation   i like the pockets on the sides and the loop to hang a light from at the peak      
1199,5.0,                       i love our tent  i bought on cyber monday for a great price  i just sleep my husband and i in it  but i fits a queen size air mattress and extra goodies around the mattress  we had some really bad wind one night and i was really impressed how even though it has a super open design it still protected us and kept us warm  easy to put back in the bag and super easy to pop up and down      
1200,5.0,                       used the tent  bunch of times  no conplaints  only suggestions i have for buyers is to buy a tarp to place underneath it the tent since it can get moist at night  furthermore  buy a few more sturdier stakes  the stakes they provide aren t as strong as said to be  tent took me   mins to set up and tear down     
1201,5.0,                       withstood light rainstorms and strong windstorms during it s first camping trip  once it was properly bolted down  i didn t have to worry  very easy set up and conveniently compact  the hardest part was getting it back in the bag  but that s true for all tents i ve had      
1202,5.0,                       i write this review having returned from a   day festival in which i used this tent  due to placement the aforementioned tent was set up in a mud puddle the feet of festival attendees churned the ground into a thick muddy slurry as the rain continued to fall  tent after tent bowed out  one after one people giving up  all their gear soaked  despite this placement  being set up in the rain and receiving a beating  with no prior waterproofing spray by myself the fly worked brilliantly  this tent remained impressively dry  with hard gusts  off and on rain  someyimes harsh  and muddy soupy composition of the earth ot was placed on  it rationally  should  have leaked  in the many years i have camped and used coleman products i have always been impressed by them and this is an amazing value      
1203,5.0,                       took this badboy out camping at the yuba river in ca  is crazy dusty over there in the summer  but this did the job  and managed to keep dirt to a minimum  fits   comfortably  with some room for gear  had a double airmattress  and it fit perfect  will most likely waterproof it before the next trip  as it will be during springtime  and i m unsure how this will hold up in rainier weather      
1204,4.0,                       got this on amazon prime day  so far so good  i ve taken it out in the texas heat and in some serious rain storms  and it s held up well  the only issue there is some tearing on the sleeve where the poles slide in  not currently a big deal  but i definitely don t see it as a long term tent because of that  oh  and it s not a backpacking tent as they try to make you believe on the case for it  it s heavy  but great for car camping  packs down pretty small  tried to upload a picture but amazon didn t like that  so  sorry kids      
1205,5.0,                       great tent  i set it up myself in about   minutes  comes with good quality tent stakes  i bought mine as  damaged packaging  but it was fine  the tent itself has a small flaw where the sewer missed the zipper leaving a hole near the door  i recommend you open and set up your tent before leaving to look for this sort of thing  i will fix mine on the sewing machine but duct tape would do  very well engineered and easy to put back into the bag  shocking   only one thing you should know  there are lots of windows  don t plan on changing in this tent unless you have the rain fly on  i love my new very well priced and compact tent  almost forgot  the floor is a robust tarp like material  quite sturdy      
1206,4.0,                       i am not a camper  i bought this tent so that we could camp out in our backyard with our daughter  for that  it works perfectly  the setup was quick and easy  best with two people   we were kept dry and bug free the entire night  breakdown the next day was just as quick and easy as setup it was the perfect size for two adults and one child  if you have more  or larger  people  you might want something larger  also  if i was going to be using this with greater frequency  i would invest in higher quality stakes  the basic metal ones that it comes with are easily bent and broken overall  this is a great starter tent for basic camping      
1207,3.0,                       i really liked this tent  but l used it just three times and one of the tent poles cracked the second time i put it up  the third time  the tent pole actually broke  the elastic broke and the pieces came apart  it was a challenge managing to get it usable for the night  i enjoy the tent and it s features but i can t give it a great rating      
1208,1.0,                       the tent is roomy and good for dry conditions it is not a good tent even for the slightest of rain as water easily seeps through the seams  looks like they have just stitched waterproof cloth together without due consideration for the holes they are creating while stitching   for its price it might be reasonable   but not the quality expected being branded as coleman    i have bought this tent twice with the same problem both the times   the first time thinking i was unlucky just to get a defective piece       
1209,5.0,                       i bought this tent at the beginning of the year and have used it twice  once in feb  and once in aug  it was very easy to set up  with two people it took less than   min  the tent was very airy for the hot weather and held up during an afternoon thunderstorm  neither the wind nor the rain was deleterious to the tent  in feb  when it was    degrees the tent also did well  it kept the cold wind from entering with the rain guard on  the tent is also very easy to take down and store  if you fold it right it will go right back into the bag it came in  the only negative would be the stakes  they are not very strong but they have worked so far  i would recommend this tent to anyone wanting a nice sturdy tent for two not four  it s a great tent      
1210,4.0,                       i ve owned this tent for   years now and camped with it multiple times   the biggest pro is that it is absolutely waterproof   we camped through    straight hours of rain followed by another   days of off and on rain and the tent did not leak once   since leakage reviews are probably the number one thing people are looking for when looking at a tent  i wanted to emphasize that off the top other pros very roomy   fits a queen size air mattress with plenty of room around the floor for shoes  lanterns and other assorted things two adults would end up having in a tent during a rain storm pockets on the inside to hold little things easy to assemble   my husband puts it up by himself in about    minutes     in the dark  cons only one door  and the door it has likes to flop back inside the tent once it s open more than halfway overloading the inside pockets  which is easy to do  will pull the tent wall down enough that rain will blow in under the rain flap   so if you re camping in the rain  be careful using the inside pockets all in all if i had to buy another tent i d probably get this one again  though i d really love a second door      
1211,5.0,                       i purchased this tent for our first camping trip  we are very satisfied and happy with the tent   very easy to set up  i could setup the tent just within    mins for the first time   very thoughtfully designed tent   spacious  it easily fit a queen airbed as well as plant of space to store our personal belongings and other gears what i most like about this tent   rain fly  screened opening on two sides  mat that can be put outside the tent  the small opening for electric cord  zipline that can be opened closed from inside outside   two mesh pockets to keep flash light  and other small stuffs   bonus carry case  easy to store the tent when not in use it was an awesome camping with this tent      
1212,5.0,                       this is the best tent you could ever want  it is easy to put up and completely water proof  after a rainy night this was the only tent that did not have any water in it at our last boy scout campout      
1213,5.0,                       i bought this for a music festival this summer and it is huge  like amazing for a   person tent  i could probably fit      people tightly  it stands super tall too  i put it together by myself and it took about    minutes  with help  i imagine it would be a much shorter time      
1214,2.0,                       ok so technically   people fit in there but barely  it was so tight in there  it says a queen size bed would fit in it  there s no way  we tried to sleep in this tent  it was super cold that night  we ended up sleeping in the car with the heat on  i would recommend it for one person in the summer time      
1215,5.0,                       i bought this tent while it was on sale  i don t usually write reviews  but i am very impressed on how this tent held up  while camping  two nights there were severe thunderstorms  and i was very nervous how wet the inside would get  the inside was dry the entire time  i heard other campers saying how they would never go camping in a tent with the weather that we had  but i have to disagree  additionally  this tent is very easy to set up  one person could set it up by themselves easily  and it folds down decently      
1216,5.0,                       great tent  for just myself and my two dogs  it was plenty of room and more  a queen air mattress fits perfectly and you can blow it up outside of the tent  it didn t rain  so can t speak to that yet  but i sent the tent up in my backyard a night it rained and it was fine  i hate the bag that it comes in  i cannot get my tent to fold perfectly back in that bag so i m using a duffle instead      
1217,2.0,                       the tent was fairly straightforward to assemble  but the stitching on the corner strut pegs was lacking  two of the four pegs ripped off  requiring duct tape and big rocks just to keep the tent stable enough for camping  once stable  the tent did it s job  although it was small for my      height  it protected me from snow  sleet  and rain  it was on sale when i bought it  so it s what i would expect from a     tent      
1218,5.0,                       great purchase  super sturdy  very lightweight  and on my camping trip with light rain  it held up great  highly recommend      
1219,5.0,                       this tent is the best   was scared to buy a tent online but came in packaged well set the tent up outside and it poured for two days while i had that tent set up  like down poured horribly and not a single drop of water got on the inside  i was so happy since we were going to be camping in rain most likely  have used this tent a lot and take pretty good care of it and it keeps everything out if you set it up right and close all openings  definitely would buy this tent again but would probably upgrade to a bigger size  very happy with this tent     
1220,5.0,                       this tent is great for bang for ur buck took this to catskills backpacking  assembled in a few minutes while other were struggling to their expensive tent like tnf one  then rain came all kept their backpacks in my tent because i have extra space in it  while they didn t and yes it is waterproof so all good  highly recommend if you don t want to spend fortune      
1221,5.0,                       i camped in this tent for a women s wilderness weekend  it was super easy to set up we had crazy weather for the weekend  non stop rain totaling    inches and wind that broke many other tents and canopy s this little tent held up like a trooper  the wind blew the corner in and it popped right back out i had little to no rain or dampness in my tent  i was completely amazed great tent for the money  i did buy some better tent stakes for the four corners of the tent  but used the stakes that came with it for the included doormat and canopy ties      
1222,5.0,                       love this tent so much  have used it a bunch camping now and it s so easy to set up and store away  big queen air mattress  dog bed  doggy  and my   ft boyfriend and i fit like a glove  highly recommend    also went camping in the rain  dryyyy the whole time        
1223,5.0,                       a really nice little tent  bought for my    yr old to have some privacy with her friend while we camped for a week  very easy to set up  and roomy for    then they got a third girlfriend to stay the last night  and they were all happy  colman quality  fantastic price  i know people also want to hear any low points  if the can let s had a lot of gear  that could be a problem if more than two  the girls were definitely snug with their stuff and the two sleeping bags  they had one duffle bag each  when there were three of them  they said things were damp in the morning  i m thinking condensation  cos it hadn t rained  my comment to colman would be maybe more window      
1224,5.0,                       easy set up  takes just about   minutes after the first time  zipper design could be better  but if you expect the weather  tounge  nonstick out at that point it s easily overcome had a couple nights of heavy rain  no leaks i have a large inflatable queen air mattress and that is definitely too big for this tent  you better be really friendly and able to get dressed laying down if you sleep   in here  too heavy for back packing  but great for light camping and excellent for kids backyards      
1225,5.0,                       haven t had to deal with rain yet but this tent has been more than up to the task  packaging is good  and setup is super easy  will take    minutes at the most we have the four person version and it is just large enough for a queen size mattress as advertised  and about a foot at your feet and one side       
1226,5.0,                       perfect size for me and my daughter to camp outside in the backyard   i m short so there is plenty of room for me to sleep and move around and to fit our extra stuff in there too   we hang a flashlight from the loop on the  ceiling  and it has worked perfectly   the   pouches that hang are great for cell phones  kindles  and to hold my glasses while we sleep   i love that it has a little  doormat  included that way you don t have to step directly on the ground       
1227,3.0,                       this tent is super easy to set up and take down  it worked great for my fall camping trip to the ocean  my only complaint is it is quite small  i purchased the   person tent for myself and my   y o son  i had a queen size air mattress in the tent and that is all you could fit in it  our bags did fit down the side but it was difficult maneuvering around in the tent   i am     tall and i could not stand up fully in the tent unless i was directly in the center  this is a great tent but i wish i would have bought a   or   person tent      
1228,2.0,                       i love coleman stuff  but not this tent  do not buy if you might experience rain  the fabric was waterproof  but the seams and the electrical flap seeped significant water into the tent during roughly   hours of light moderate rain on the first use  maybe use as a day tent  pretty easy to set up with good space and ventilation      
1229,5.0,                       great tent  bought this so my wife and son and i  and two pitbulls  could sleep in our backyard  perfect for camping out during the pandemic  i wouldn t hike the appalachian trail with this tent  but is perfect for my needs  great deal      
1230,5.0,                       this is the perfect size for one person   i can stand in it  i m       and easily get dressed   it comfortably fits my cot  a table  a portable toilet  and all my gear   set up is simple   one person can do it  but it is much easier for   people to set up      
1231,4.0,                       this is a good tent  fits a queen size air mattress with a little extra room to boot  it s not as light in weight as other higher end tents but for the price this tent is good      
1232,3.0,                       as shown in the picture   taken without the rain fly  the upper portion of two sides of the tent are fully vented and do not have a zipper flap to cover them   if you have heavy dew you will wake up to wet sleeping bags   as shown in picture   the rain fly covers these areas so downward rain does not enter  however wind will whip the rain right into the tent under the rain fly   coleman s website states this tent is rain and wind tested but they don t say it passed the test   person tent pros easy set up   two people with a little practice can have this tent up in   minutes or less light weight   weight about   pounds with all accessories can easily fit two twin size air mattresses with a little room to spare cons fixed vents that cannot be covered allows dew and blowing rain to enter tent      
1233,5.0,                       we fit a queen air mattress and a child s air mattress in and had room to spare  you can stand up in it   i m      on a heavy dew morning it did drip inside  haven t used it in weather yet  might invest in spraying it with some stuff to make sure it keeps the wet out      
1234,5.0,                       great tent  bought for my   year old son to have his own little tent and its perfect  he sets it up and uses it for boy scouts campouts and in our yard all by himself  seems to be holding up really well too      
1235,5.0,                       great little tent  not for two people unless you both are     pounds  i am way more than that but still fit  i put an xl air mattress in it and it had enough room for all my gear  great tent for the price  i would buy a coleman tent again      
1236,5.0,                       this is the perfect tent for   adults and two dogs  labs   there are reviews that say it fits a queen air mattress and that is true if you do not want to have any room for movement   i found getting two cots was a much better experience   it rained a bit on our first use   we did not have time to seal the seams before use but it was all good no leaking      
1237,1.0,                       bought in april  first time use in the north woods of wisconsin  started setting up tent and found it had numerous holes in the mesh netting  obviously i got a defective tent  luckily i brought duct tape or probably would ve been eatin alive by the mosquitos  will update if they take care of their defective tent      
1238,5.0,                       easy set up  pockets on the wall to keep phones and such of the ground  and some genius added a seam in the bottom of the bag that you can cut to make it larger knowing that we would never be able to get it as small as it was when we bought it     
1239,1.0,                       love the tent and set up was a breeze  however we tented out for   nights and the second night it rained  the seam of the tent leaked in water and the floor was wet and the sneakers and clothes under the seam were drenched  quite disappointed as it seemed like a nice quality tent      
1240,5.0,                       i ve had the same coleman two man tent for roughly    years  still in perfect condition  traveled all over the us with it  finally decided was time to upgrade to something bigger  the coleman   man tent is perfect size and easy to set up  really like the extra venting my two man tent didn t have  also like the zipper design and the higher tub area  well thought out  purchased one of those coleman comfortsmart deluxe camping cots and fits perfect in this tent with about half the tent left for bags of cloths n other stuff  room to move around in this  i ve had good luck with coleman so hope this stands the test of time like my first tent      
1241,3.0,                       i used this for the first time over the weekend  i will say it is quite snuggly for two people but will do the job  i did not like that there was a leakage  less than    hours on light rain it was leaking where the zippers were  i cannot find at all where it was coming from  it soaked it a good portion of my comforter  i had to keep putting my boyfriends bathing suit bottoms to help not soak  it completely      
1242,5.0,                       love this tent   set it up by myself in under    minutes with no issues  went to a show and while gone  a massive storm rolled in causing us to get stuck at the venue for over   hours  once i got back to the campsite  about     of the tents on the campground had    inches of water inside   but not mine   i was ecstatic    side note  there was about a half dollar sized amount of water in each corner of the tent  however for the amount of rain we got i am shocked that s all there was  best tent ever      
1243,5.0,                       great value for the price  i looked at other tents and this was the best quality and size for the price  if you re going to festivals this is all you ll need for     people      
1244,5.0,                       pandemic got ya down  trapped at home and bored    heres a solution  get this tent  pop it up with it s easy setup  put it anywhere zip the door  pop in some earbuds  get a book  movie and some junkfoods and you can be anywhere else     thank you coleman      
1245,1.0,                       the string inside these tube pieces broke after a few uses rendering this tent useless      
1246,5.0,                       my situation  i was taking my   year old daughter car camping for one night for her first time  i wanted something that was simple and that i could put up by myself that wasn t cramped and that would keep us dry if there was a light drizzle  oh  yeah     and i wasn t thrilled to spend a couple hundred of bucks for something that could get used once   i bought this model rather than the similarly equipped   person model just for the extra space  even though we re really only     people  this thing was everything i wanted it to be  sturdy  spacious  it was great  even unexpected little extras  pockets inside for stuff  hook for a lantern  zipped entrance for an electrical cord  door mat  my little girl loved being in charge of opening and closing the windows and on our trip  it rained  of course   soaking rain that lasted for several hours  the tent did not leak even a little bit  my daughter slept through the whole thing  i couldn t believe how well made this     tent was if you don t have any special needs  needs to be especially light  needs to be a winter tent  needs a vestibule for a backpack   this is an excellent all purpose tent  i would tell any of my friends taking their kids camping that they re crazy if they spend a dollar more than the price of this tent      
1247,1.0,                       this product is ok  but what would make it an excellent product is if amazon would pay its workers a livable wage in every part of the world and stop supporting the ccp in their quest to eradicate hong kong s democracy      
1248,4.0,                       nice tent  roomy and easy to set up  the green makes it bright inside  nice for the money  but the money is not much so take that into consideration  the poles are much more fragile than the other four tents i own  one family camping  three backpacking   be very cautious when setting it up  once up  it is a very nice  sturdy tent  the extra square of material is a door mat  at least that is what we think it is since it is not shown on the box or on the directions   which can be staked down      
1249,4.0,                       after taking it out january      th and the   st out on the north shore  tahoe  only because i am diabetic and i need space so that i can put a cot in it for me  were car camping it is very spacious we had a fresh    inches of snow come on us one night and it held up very well i would highly recommend it for a family of three for small kids worked really well in this tent there s a lot a room and again it is very comfortable  it may be a three season but it held up very well in the snow that we were in and it was again very comfortable in the snow insulated fine     
1250,5.0,                       i was able to put this tent up alone without any problems  the first trip i took this tent on we had some serious rain and it held up without any leaks  i d recommend putting down a footprint or tarp so your tent last as long as possible  the only think i wish this tent had was a vestibule so you could avoid putting your boots inside the tent when it rains      
1251,5.0,                       i m very pleased with this little tent  used it for the first time this weekend  and it worked perfectly for my girlfriend and i  enough room for us both  along with a couple bags  simple  and not too bulky when put away in the convenient carrying bag  i was concerned about getting wet  after reading reviews   as there was some rain in the forecast  but forgot to pick up a tarp to put underneath wasn t a problem  as the bottom of this tent is heavier duty tarp like material and the seams were sewn on the inside only to prevent seepage  the sides weren t damp on the inside either  and the rain fly kept water out while allowing some air in  it was breathable and comfortable in the morning when it started getting warmer overall  this is a great tent for the money  don t really have any complaints  for two people and some supplies  it works great and it comes with a small rectangular mat for you to place your shoes on  has access for electric cord  and two small hanging built in storage spaces  we hung a flashlight from the hook at the roof  which gave us enough light to get settled in at night  i am happy with this purchase  and would suggest this tent to anyone looking to comfortably sleep   people for a great price  i don t intend to use it too frequently  but hopefully this will hold up through the years      
1252,5.0,                       we purchased this tent in       it s been through rain  high wind   survived being put up and taken down by a cub scout pack for training and i still have no complaints   we just took it camping  crammed   adults  a   year old and two   year olds in it  it was tight but we fit   i treated the rain fly and seams when we first got it and it has never leaked   about as easy as they come as far as setup   for the price it s about as simple and reliable as a person can hope for   if you don t need a ton of space  this is an outstanding purchase      
1253,5.0,                       good size packed and opened  love that the bag is expandable so you can actually get the thing in there after the initial unpack loud in wind though like any tent      
1254,5.0,                       setting up was easy  with the help of another person  there was still space for   people and a inflatable queen mattress to fit in  first time camping ended up  nd day for rain pour so it was put to the test and passed with flying colors  the rain fly nicely attributed for dryness and to peek out through the screen during the rain  my only complaint is the stakes  they suck  otherwise great tent       
1255,5.0,                       we looked at tents for weeks before purchasing this one  we went camping with my dad who has a much more expensive backpacking tent and even he was surprised at how simple  large  and sturdy this tent was  it rained both nights and we were bone dry  i did seam seal it before we went and that is something everyone should do before using their tent  just in case  i bought this tent with the idea that we could upgrade to a nicer one later on  but honestly  i love this and don t see that happening anytime soon overall  very sturdy and large for a   person tent  easily set up within    minutes      
1256,5.0,                       really nice tent   the kids put it up in short time   has a window in back to zip etc     has a little plastic ring in center of ceiling to hang a light  and has a storage bag hanging from the inside side   they got it folded   back into the carry bag in short time too       
1257,1.0,                       i bought this tent expecting that it have space for   persons as advertised and for the quality materials that coleman uses  but i am very disappointed with the product  it is a tiny tent just for   persons  and one pole got broken during the assembly of the tent for the first time      
1258,4.0,                       nice tent  it hold two twin air mattress with maybe a foot of floor space in the middle  it kept us dry in yellowstone   that includes snow and a heavy downpour  the high winds  we added some  bracing by tying down the center piece a little bit more  the solid white piece in the picture   it even held up to some serious winds in yellowstone  a great two person tent  we packed all our camping gear into one checked bag and this one fit the bill      
1259,1.0,                       we purchased this tent   weeks ago for a camping trip that was last week   we had   night of rain  and i am sorry to say  the tent did not hold up to coleman standards   the tent leaked water at all for bottom corner seams  leaving puddles in our tent   our sides of the tent  where anything touched  were also wet   waiting to hear from coleman warranty to see if they will replace      
1260,5.0,                       set it up in less than   minutes    person size  including the fly  hosed it down to check for leaks and none found  even the floor stayed dry  lots of vents and options for light and airflow  very light and yet uses strong materials  fantastic value        
1261,5.0,                       santa brought this for our kids this year   the tent was super easy to set up   took less than    mintues   it was also super easy to tear down   about    minutes  we are not big campers    the inside is spacious and there are lots of neat features  plenty of hooks anf pockets to use   it also has a window in the back and a low to ground air vent   the quailty is top notch and seems like it will last   we also like the design of the rain guard      
1262,5.0,                       i used this tent for   days last weekend  temp s down in the high    s and heavy rains  i was comfortable every night and i just had a few water droplets in   corner  tent came through with flying colors      
1263,5.0,                       very easy to set up  this was my first time setting a tent up and i got it in under    minutes with the rain cover by myself  since i go camping in florida all the vents and screen windows on the tent make it breezy and cool in the humidity heat  i got a   person tent and it s very spacious and tall super lightweight and easy to fold up and store  i haven t used it in rainy conditions yet so i ve yet to find out how it does with water resistance but i m very satisfied already with the quality      
1264,5.0,                       good tent  it s a   person tent  but it would be tight for   people  we had a queen size air mattress inside and it basically took up the entire space with some room to spare for our gear  good ventilation  we used it in the spring time  so it was warm enough for cool weather  mid   s mid   s  and under some shade breezy enough for warmer weather  mid    s   i would recommend  this model is just a bit older  but still works well  cheaper than costco      
1265,5.0,                       so far so good  used it once and it was great  i waterproofed it with spray even though it s water proof  you should do this with every tent   havent been rained on yet but i love this tent  bout a      minute set ups     
1266,4.0,                       this tent may not be water proof but it holds very well in a small rain storm  water starts coming in from the bottom after   hours or so  but i didn t buy it for that purpose so overall i d say i m pretty contempt with my purchase it was worth the money  btw if you like extra space  buy the four people tent for   people    people fit but you d be in a sardine can     
1267,5.0,                       the only warning for those who buys small one   ppl  it is really small     i didn t realize it until i assembled it  queen mattress fits and noting else  was really tight    lol but it is completely my fault    otherwise      amazing product  was raining   days  was completely dry inside  to assemble took like      min  quick and easy     recommend      
1268,4.0,                       the tent is great  i upgraded to this tent because at    tall i was having difficulty finding a good tent long enough for me  it rained really hard last night and i woke up this morning to a dry tent  the only   things i would change are   the zipper flag gets stuck in the zipper sometimes and   it comes with those flimsy tent stakes  overall it s a great  spacious tent though      
1269,5.0,                       very easy to set up  and comfortable to lie in   good ventilation and the storage pockets are so convenient   i haven t tried it in the rain or extreme cold  however  this is not really a four person tent  unless all you have are sleeping bags and lie still all night   i had me and my two kids  three people  in the tent and there was no room to spare   we will be ordering a second tent for the next time we go camping      
1270,4.0,                       very first night we used it  we experienced a severe thunderstorm  no leaks  we stayed totally dry  the only reason i don t give it   stars is because one of the tent poles was broken when i took it out of the bag  it was missing the metal piece on the end  so we just stuck the pole into the ground      
1271,5.0,                       perfect for camping   easy to put up and down      
1272,2.0,                       loved everything about this   person sundome tent except it has a ground vent in the back of the tent that cannot be closed  great for when it s hot  terrible for when it s cold  they should have made it with a zipper and flap so you can chose to close it  poor design to eliminate the option      
1273,5.0,                       we loved it  we did a family camp out in the back yard  i am not a camp in a tent kind of girl but my daughter wanted us to  my husband and i had it set up in probably ten minutes  there was room for my husband and i our   year old and our dog and we slept comfortable  i was not thrilled about sleeping in a tent thinking bugs would get in that it would rip easy  i was wrong  the tent was well made  the colors were nice  and not one bug got in  very happy with the tent      
1274,4.0,                       i just set the tent up in the back yard today  i have a   person tent and it was challenging to set it up by myself  after recruiting my teen daughter it went very quickly  i ended up buying kiwi heavy duty repellent and thoroughly sprayed the tent  all the seams  and rain fly  i used almost the entire bottle  i let it dry in    plus degree heat outside  which would not recommend spraying it indoors  it is very caustic  after   hours it was dry and the true test will be our upcoming trip soon  i will re post a new review after we use it      
1275,3.0,                       i really want to like this tent  but the weathering system it has isn t as good as advertised  it s roomy for my needs when camping  but there  as it arrived  is a thin section of bottom flooring where water has gotten in  and even with scotchguarding  condensation seeps in from the top rain covering      
1276,5.0,                       great tent for the price  survived two camping trips  on one particular trip  a very strong thunderstorm came through the campsite and took us by surprise  we took shelter in a building during the storm  granted  the campsite was protected by a windbreak on all sides  but the tent didn t have so much as a drop of water even though there were sustained winds of     mph during the storm      
1277,3.0,                       unfortunately this tent had been used   there was sand and popcorn in it   worst of all when we got to our camping site one of the tent poles was in pieces   the cord had snapped      
1278,5.0,                       i am not a camper  but i bought this for backyard glamping   very easy to assemble and take down   nice size and convenient features with the cell pocket  lower window for ventilation and awning over the entry      
1279,4.0,                       my boyfriend and i took this tent on a practice camping trip before our week long camping trip  it rained pretty hard that night and the tent held up well  zippers worked  the electrical zipper is a nice addition  however the rain did leak in from that corner of the tent we liked that the waterproof tarping on the bottom goes a coupl inches above the bottom of the tent  we had to sleep on some water  and it didn t leak i think this is a pretty sturdy tent  worth the money and i can see us using it for many more camping trips      
1280,5.0,                       size  i had never been camping before  from what i d read online  it seemed like a   person tent was really more of a   person tent  so i went for the   person tent  i have to say  that was one of the best decisions i ve ever made  a   person tent is meant for   people to lay exactly inside with no room for movement  if you need to sleep with someone else in a tent  get a   person tent ease of use  i was astonished how easy the tent was to put up  the other tents on the campsite used a similar design  so i guess tents are just brilliantly designed in general these days  but we put this bad boy up with   people in    minutes in the dark  the rain cover is double sided  so you can have air flow through the tent  which i found out is very important it also rained while we were up there  and while other campers were putting down tarps  i of course had not thought to do that  luckily  this tent kept out all the rain and the water from the ground  though the ground did get colder  no tent is going to help with that though  it s enough that it kept me dry great tent  i will use it as long as possible  then likely buy another one exactly like it      
1281,5.0,                       first  it is easy to put up  i did it myself the first time   it helped that i looked up a video on how to do it    we had no special weather which to test it out in  it was dry and cool but i think it would be good in the rain and wind    it is the perfect size for two adults  and one dog   to have a queen size and another air mattress in it with room to spare  we could stand up in it to change  etc   one of us is   ft  tall   the door opens widely  and is easily zipped unzipped  the back flap is good for ventilation  the rain fly is nice too  the top sides of the tent are mesh but the rain fly fully covers  you could choose to not use the fly too   we definitely recommend this tent      
1282,5.0,                       we actually haven t gone camping with it yet  but set it up in the yard when we got it   this is exactly what you d expect from coleman   great design  materials  and quality of construction   we re going to sleep   people in this   person tent  and it has plenty of room for   to be very comfortable in there   looking forward to using it      
1283,4.0,                       great tent but we did have a bit of dew come inside  maybe we weren t using a great tent tarp but if you use in bad weather be sure to get a decent tent tarp      
1284,4.0,                       only reason i m giving this one   stars is because i received the wrong color tent  this tent itself is great and i was especially thankful for how well the rain flap worked as it rained the first night i used it  the stakes it comes with aren t great  but they did the job   i would definitely advise ordering some sturdier ones  overall very happy with the purchase for the price      
1285,5.0,                       this really is a nice tent for only about       i have already used it once and was very happy   it will be used about a dozen times this summer and i have no fear it will hold up after it s maiden voyage   happy with the product      
1286,5.0,                       i will say this tent went through the biggest derecho that hit ludington michigan and still managed to stay completely dry on the inside  i mean this tent really is the best tent i have ever owned  i went around our campsite advertising this tent just because it was so dry when that rain hit  only tent on the campground to stay completely dry  im telling you its really that awesome      
1287,5.0,                       needed a slightly smaller tent for outings with my husband or my children  but not both  we have a coleman red canyon for whole family excursions   took the kids up to northeastern pa for a quick run  and this tent performed flawlessly  i m not a very experienced camper  but i realize that setting up a new tent in    the dark     the rain     with tired hungry kids is surely not the best way to test out new gear  however  that s how it worked out  so i want to let you know this tent is legit  it s easy to set up  only three poles and one of those is a fly  the stakes are a heavier metal  not plastic or aluminium  and it took me and a friend under ten minutes to get it up and with rain fly on  speaking of rain  i added a footprint tarp and a groundcloth inside the tent  just in case   and we were bone dry through three days two nights of steady showers  mist  humidity  and puddles  the rain fly guyed out beautifully and kept great air flow  two gear pockets and a center hook kept our stuff neatly off the ground  we had room for two alps lightweight pads and a lightspeed xl   there was a little less than a foot of space down near the door edge where we kept our boots  bags and other stuff  i don t know how long this tent will last  but it was inexpensive enough that if i get a couple years out of it  my children will probably abuse the tent more than myself   i ll consider it money well spent  first trip was flawless  despite not optimal conditions  so i m a fan      
1288,5.0,                       i ve had   tents before this one  this one wins hands down  i think it took    minutes to set up  came down just as fast  the green is virtually invisible in the forest  love that  the air movement from the lower back wall is great to keep the air moving  no lingering dog smells anymore  so the tent is great for    but i got it for   or    i can put a cot across the back  or a cot on each side  a chair  a folding side table and gear  plus a medium sized dog  i ve had   room tents  small dome tents  mountain tents   this one is just right for me  small enough for guick set up  large enough to go  glamping  for me oh  and the rain cover is angled so you can still see out  but no rain can come in on all   sides it also has a corner wall zipper for your solar panel cables or electrical cords  i hung a light from the hook on the ceiling  the light reflects wonderfully from the white rain fly and tent sides  enjoy      
1289,5.0,                       i bought this tent for my second ever camping experience  it was easy to assemble as well as disassemble  the tent is all mesh on top half of two sides  so it wont probably wont be great for     f  for me  the coldest it got was mid   s  so it was pretty comfortable  and as the convention goes  for the tent size  get   size more than what you need  i got a   person one  since i wanted   people to comfortably sleep in it      
1290,5.0,                       i took this on a weekend camping trip with some friends and it worked wonderfully  it only took a few minutes to put up and tear down and it was easy enough i was able to do that by myself  we did get rained on for a couple of hours  and while my friends tents were getting water in them  this tent stayed completely dry inside  this is supposedly a four person tent  but once we got three people in there with their backpacks it would have been impossible to fit a fourth person      
1291,5.0,                          person  version was great in low temperatures    f  and rain   stayed dry  and with sleeping bags  warm     adults    child fit easily   could have had additional child without space problem   well constructed  no issues noted on first outing      
1292,2.0,                       unfortunately  the support poles on this tent snapped broke in our first use  which i admit was windy  and we are trying to contact coleman for replacements  we have trusted coleman tents for years so this was disappointing      
1293,4.0,                       so far this has been a great tent  i generally use a smaller  higher quality tent when backpacking  but for camping this is acceptable  only used   times  once in  regular  rain  and it held up well  i did waterproof this tent  especially the seams before use      
1294,3.0,                       got this tent on prime day the tent is great for what we payed for  however if you are buying for camping be weary it is very heavy and you will need buy different steaks as they are super cheap and bend the poles are pretty cheap as well they catch on the fabric when you put through which is annoying and and they seem like they will wear and break quickly  the tent is also very thick and large meaning it isnt ideal for backpacking however i dont think that is this tents intent  everything else is pretty tent like and normal      
1295,5.0,                       i bought the   person tent for a camping weekend  i used it as my own personal tent with a single air mattress  i could not imagine   people sharing this tent  what really impressed me about this tent was the fact that it stayed dry inside when there was a thunder storm and hard rain coming down  the tent set up easy and it dry s quickly too  i would recommend this tent to my friends and family     
1296,5.0,                       perfect tent for beginners  i am first timer and installed it very easily  installation time is around    minutes  i was initially thinking of buying an instant one but made right decision  instant one is easy to install but packing it can be painful   also quality can deteriorate for instant tent given their dynamic nature  this manual installation is much better as both assembly and packing is very easy   quality of this tent is very good  overall very good for normal weather      
1297,5.0,                       i got this for our   year old son today  it s very nice and an awesome size       
1298,4.0,                       easy to set up with one person  leaks around door when it rains if zippers are at bottom of door   make sure rain fly is on and staked out and put zippers at top of door  did not have any leeks the last rain doing this  otherwise great tent      
1299,4.0,                       the only thing at all i wish was different is the front door    i wish there was the option to have a mesh opening all the way to the floor  so you could lie down and look out at the view   the windows are decent sizes but up high but  nice overall tent    the   man version is very roomy  lots of headroom   the floor feels very sturdy and has a  bathtub  design      
1300,5.0,                       good dry tent have gifted at least    and the chihuahua and i use one   tried and trued design you can move it fairly  easily  and pick the whole thing up and shake it out  it s pretty ventilated and dry i haven t had any leakage lol get out there     
1301,4.0,                       i have used coleman before  this product in good in almost all terms  except won t withstand wind probably because the rods are into semi tent and does not cover the whole area     
1302,4.0,                       between my dog  my gear  and myself  we barely had any room  i would not recommend this as a two person tent  however as a one  person tent  it worked ok  would probably be ok if i didn t have hiking gear  but as it was  it s a bit on the small side  we called during a large storm and the sides got pretty wet inside as well  it s not a bad tent  but can t expect too great for the price for the price i paid      
1303,4.0,                       for tent camping this was great  it kept the temperature slightly higher than what was outside  however  this is only for summer camping as most of the top is mesh and breathable  so the cool breeze came in at night and it was chilly  early summer nights in colorado can still be pretty chilly  especially in the mountains  the quality of the seems  zipper and placement of ties and anchors seemed really good  it was a windy night when we set it up  it was challenging but once we got it up the wind did not collapse the tent and it seemed like it was durable      
1304,5.0,                       this truly is a tent that s easy to put together  we only go camping once a year and i  ms  not so handy  put it together with the help of two little kids  it took about half an hour  it also actually fit back into the bag it came in once we put it away  it s a simple  no frills tent that s perfect for those of us that camp every once in a blue moon  at      it was a great buy      
1305,4.0,                       to coleman and every other tent sleeping bag company    why do you make your bags so small    we do overnight and back yard camping and the worst part of every experience is trying to get the tent back into the bag  our fun trips end in frustration as we sweat to get two people to jam the tent in and try to force the zipper up  this makes no sense  just make the bags bigger  we would be much happier and i can t imagine another inch or two of fabric would cost that much      
1306,5.0,                       i recently bought this tent because my dog tore up my last one  i set it up in my back yard and camped with my kids the first day i got it  i was impressed by how dry the inside of the tent was the next morning because it had rained all night  the tent is good size for   people  it is easy to set up  and it holds up well to the weather  over all great tent      
1307,5.0,                       have only gotten to use it a couple of times  pretty easy to setup by yourself  very roomy inside  bigger than it appears or than what you might think  could likely fit three grown men if you tried  floor space seems slightly bigger than a queen air mattress  it does sit high so windy conditions will push it just a bit  but it stayed up well during an overnight at the beach where the wind was heavy      
1308,1.0,                       we took all the precautions necessary to keep this tent in good working order   we only used it in our back yard for occasional camp outs   after a year  it started letting water in   we tried patching and then scotch guarding it   two years in and you can see light shining through the bottom and sides of the tent   huge puddles of water if there s any kind of rain shower   very disappointed as this was a father s day present from my son to husband      
1309,5.0,                       i m    years old  found the tent it be easy to put up and take down  nice interior size  can easily place a double or queen mattress inside      
1310,5.0,                       got this tent for a recent backpacking trip i went on with my two dogs  me and the dogs fit comfortably  i have large australian shepherds     pounds each   it also rained the whole night  and this tent kept us completely dry  easy to set up and take down  would highly recommend this tent      
1311,5.0,                       we loved how light weight  easy to put up  and sturdy the tent was  we endured the rain and wind in hana  hawai i and the tent held up well  only a small amount of water came in through the front door      
1312,5.0,                       i bought this tent for a   night backpacking trip with the guys along parts of the appalachian trail   in trying to lighten our load  this is the only tent we brought for   guys   the tent comfortably slept   guys without feeling cramped   on the last night of the trip we were caught in a heavy constant rain   i was very pleasantly surprised to awake to find myself completely dry    just wish we hadn t left our shoes outside the tent before we went to sleep  the tent was easy to set up quickly and folded up easily to fit back in the carry case  something that can not be said about many other tents   if you are looking for a camping tent  i highly recommend this tent  it served its purpose well and was literally a fraction of the cost of the competition      
1313,5.0,                       first time camping  practice at home putting it up with my    year old son  took us a minute to figure it out since i believe it could use better instructions but was very simple once we knew what we were doing  very spacious  it rained a straight    hours and the tent did amazing  very satisfied customer      
1314,4.0,                       it s easy to set up  and relatively lightweight  i was able to fit two single air mattresses and a couple of small backpacks easily  three people could probably sleep comfortably in the tent  but four would be awfully tight  we were caught in a rainstorm  and the tent remained dry with the exception of a small seam at the base of the door  this is an easy fix the biggest problem is the stakes  they are terrible  too thin and too flimsy  it was difficult to stake the tent properly  without being staked  the tent  collapses in a heavy wind  we were packing up  and the wind made emptying the tent a challenge the tent is decent  but expect to buy replacement stakes and maybe waterproof the seams      
1315,1.0,                       it s good and easy to install tent but have one big problem  sides are build with open mesh without any way to cover it  it means at night wind just blow cold inside not to mention morning fog i emailed coleman for help but looks like representative had no idea what he was talking about   he wrote zip cover on but tent has no covers or any zip basically you buying good tent to shield you from sun or rain  for wind  cold or fog it s useless     
1316,5.0,                       i ve only used it once since purchasing  so far  but i couldn t believe how easy it was to set up  take apart and repack  for the price paid  around      i could not have been more pleased with my purchase  we used it for a   day music festival  so it wasn t exactly the wild outback  but the included rain fly and seams sufficiently withstood several hours of rain and the inside remained bone dry  we had   people in sleeping bags with our duffel bags and had plenty of room to spread out  you could fit a third person and small bags but it would be a squeeze  in summer heat there s no chance that   people could have fit comfortably but i suppose under colder conditions you wouldn t mind being packed a little tighter      
1317,3.0,                       great tent overall but i will say not very water resistant  i gave it a two on water resistance because it leaks in all four bottom corners of the tent when it rains      
1318,5.0,                       saw this on an amazon lightning deal and got it pretty cheap  my brother has had a   person coleman tent for about   years that has held up great  and this tent seems to have the same quality craftsmanship  i wouldn t recommend this if you are backpacking  because there are far better options out there that will take up less space and will weight less  however  if you are staying at campgrounds or are on a budget  this will be a good purchase      
1319,5.0,                       my husband and i love this tent  great size  easy to carry  lightweight  easy to pop up  we fit our king size mattress in it  great for us and our dogs  love being able to open the windows at night  great breeze that comes through  we got a lot wind at night and it held up really well  i d recommend buying better stakes  doesn t do well on gravel bring a broom or extra tarp      
1320,4.0,                       the first tent i ve ever bought and i ll swear by this tent it is spacious inside has great ventilation  feels sturdy and looks very nice  i got the navy blue tent  the bag has even has a zipper to fit the tent in case you don t roll it up the same way   i don t know anyone who ever has so this is very nice  my only issue is that the stakes are actual garbage they have a blunt end instead of a point i bent ever single one of them with     rubber mallet swings other than that it s very nice     
1321,4.0,                       this tent is easy to put up   by a novice  it has been through several rains and does not leak  no bugs get in  i would say it sleeps   adults reasonably comfortably  with   blow up twin mattresses  leaves a little room left over for  stuff   i don t think a queen sized blow up mattress would fit   if it did  it would be wall to wall  stretching the tent to the extreme  overall a good purchase for the price  spoken from alaska in the fall  temps   s day    s night f       
1322,5.0,                       this tent was super easy to set up  i did it by myself with no help in about       minutes  fit my full sized blow up mattress perfectly  can accommodate two people but fits one person very comfortably      
1323,3.0,                       the tent looks sturdy and weatherproof it came with instruction   all of the pierces  if you want to bypass reading you can watch a youtube video on how to assemble      
1324,4.0,                       just received product  i have not use it yet  it seems to be the perfect size for my family and sets up easily  the tent poles seem to bow out a little too much   i will have to watch this   otherwise the tent is great      
1325,4.0,                       we used this tent for the first time this weekend  and it was pretty great  easy setup  we did put a tarp under the tent for added security  it did not rain  but the tree we were under was consistently dripping water  all day  even worse at night   and the tent did not get wet inside  i was slightly worried because the whole top of the tent is basically a window  and the rainfly covers it  so i wasn t sure how damp everything would get  we folded up our bedding during the day and all was fine  nice sized tent as well for just two of us  and a queen sized air mattress fit including room for our bags  i would recommend to anyone looking for a good summer tent  it s definitely not for cold weather      
1326,5.0,                       i love this tent  easy to put up  good thing bc my directions were in spanish  perfect for   person plus luggage or to people for just sleeping  i was worried about rain but we got very heavy rain for a few hours and stayed dry  i love the tarp bottom that continues up the side wall about   inches  it s got a zipper about   inches long at the bottom for easy access of a extension cord  that was a cool surprise  every thing felt quality  no problems with any zippers like i have had in past tents      
1327,5.0,                       can t say much about it as we used it only one night  but i like this tent  it s very spacious  we could fit a queen size inflatable mattress and there was still room left  can t wait to use it again     
1328,5.0,                       i just used this tent for my first ever camping experience at a music festival in maryland temperatures were between the   s and the   s  there was a massive thunderstorm  and even some high winds  but we stayed comfortable and dry about    other groups were using the same model at the festival  and they all had the same feedback  when some of the fields flooded  the high waterproof section on the base kept out a few inches of water      
1329,5.0,                       outstanding tent for an affordable price  great to have for yourself and maybe one other person along with your belongings  if you have a small air mattress then it will fit  but it has to be smaller than a queen size  otherwise you won t have much room for yourself or your camping gear  comes with a nice sun and rain dome and a nice waterproof tarp floor      
1330,5.0,                       worked great for my camping trip this summer  in fact i went full board and put a queen blow up mattress inside    fit perfect  was so relaxing   great tent   tx      
1331,1.0,                       definitely not a   person tent  it is a   person tent that can only fit a queen bed  literally there is no other room and the ground vents are covered by the queen bed  so airflow sucks  when i lay down on the queen air mattress  my head touches the wall and so do my feet  wall to wall and i am       thats ridiculous      
1332,5.0,                       bought it for boy scout and is a great tent to start with   the size allows plenty of space and easy setting   good center space to move around without any problems      
1333,3.0,                       it was ok for summer  forget about fall weather and any wind  good for the koa or backyard  not for real outdoor exploring  but it s cheap and useful for one summer      
1334,5.0,                       been using this tent happily for over a year   have owned a number of tents   i very much appreciated the quality of design and construction of this one  proven durability in hot dry  and cold wet climates  good stake down options for windier environments  great ventilation for warm nights  and night sky viewing   i would buy another of these  if i thought i could use one        
1335,5.0,                       this tent is great  fyi it will fit a queen air mattress   it fits almost exactly and leaves room for nothing else  what else do you do in a tent beside sleep and   stuff      
1336,3.0,                       if you don t seam seal every seam it leaks badly   i sealed and sprayed after testing it in the backyard in a rainstorm  the rear vent  in my opinion is not the best idea as it cannot be sealed   the rain fly does not proved adequate coverage for rain at an angle or heavy mist with gathers on the mesh and leaks      
1337,5.0,                       bought this tent for summer camping purposes and thus far have taken it on   trips and can say we absolutely love this   we have been able to comfortably fit    albeit small   people in this tent and have absolutely loved the quality of construction   at the price point i don t think this can be beat and this is the perfect tent for camping with friends and family   setup is quick        minutes  and the equipment seems to be made of quality materials that will last      
1338,2.0,                       tent arrived with a massive tear in the carrying case  after    minutes on my order details looking for a way to contact the seller the only option i could find was to return the whole thing which i can t do because i m taking off on a week long camping trip  all i wanted was to contact the seller and ask for a replacement case  set up the whole tent and it looks great and roomy enough for a double air mattress and a little bit of storage space on either side  i m     and can lie down very comfortably  easy set up and lots of nice features like ground ventilation and water proof flooring      
1339,5.0,                       i was intimidated at the idea of using a tent with poles  it was super easy to assemble and take down  it would easily fit   people    adults and maybe   kids       
1340,5.0,                       this little tent did the trick  i felt comfy and safe and what a breeze to set up alone   it was a bit windy so i noticed that created a little challenge since it is a bit taller but i made it work  there was no rain on my trip so i m sure how it would hold up but i hope to try it out in different weather and see   great little tent for the price     
1341,4.0,                       definitely not for   people loleasy to setup  i did it alone and it only took about    minutes   but not so good for desert windy areas   i have everything spread into the walls of the tent to weigh it down since it only has corner holds in the base  if you re not anywhere near wind you re good      
1342,5.0,                       i have two of these tents for car camping in northern california   we use four camping pads that fit side by side all the way across with a little overlap   we don t camp in the rain but we do camp on the coast when the marine layer can come in overnight  the outside of the tent has been wet in the morning  but dries out once the day warms up   if the weather is warm we leave the top off so we can see the stars as we go to sleep the tent stakes that come with it are not very strong so they re not able to be used if the ground is hard and compact   i bought stronger tent stakes to use with the tent which worked out fine because it takes a lot of hammering to get them in the ground where we camp in big sur   this is a good easy to set up tent for a family      
1343,5.0,                       i just used this on a weekend camping trip  we were lucky that it didn t rain  so i can t speak to the water resistance  i do wish it was a few inches taller  i m     tall and the tent is     at the peak   but overall i am very pleased with it  all of the zippers worked very smoothly  i like the   storage pockets on the inside and the ring at the top of the ceiling to hang a lantern      
1344,5.0,                       for the price  this is a good tent  the bottom is  looks and feels like a tarp  but it does the trick  easy to put up and take down  held out rain just fine  if you are looking for a tent that is light and doesn t take up much space in the trunk  this one is not for you   but what do you expect from that price      
1345,2.0,                       you get what you pay for  i have always purchased my tents from rei but was looking for a cheaper option this time around  but a seam was ripped right out of the box and the material is chintzy  the design is also poor  i couldn t get the floor to sit flush on all sides  if you re looking for a tent to last more than one summer skip this one      
1346,3.0,                       we experienced  a huge storm the weekend we bought this tent  the tent was leaking and my son s pillow was soaking wet  so sad it s not super waterproof as one of the reviews said      
1347,5.0,                       great tent using it for motorcycle road trip definitely a good by only one thing was i disappointed in is the tent stakes that coleman provides are cheap so get a better set before heading out      
1348,5.0,                       used for music festival  we were able to put our very large queen air mattress in it  this left about one foot on one side to spare  but it worked for us  easy and quick to put up  great purchase      
1349,5.0,                       i got an amazing price on this tent during black friday  my husband and i have had the   person version of this tent for    years and we still use it   coleman just makes a great product   i bought this   person tent for my    year old daughter and i also bought the   person coleman for my    year old son for backpacking  i got them both for really great prices and couldn t be happier   just a sturdy and reliable product      
1350,5.0,                       this tent was easy enough to put up for first timers  once it was up  i found it spacious for my cot and   sleeping bags  it was quite comfortable and though it rained  only had a little seepage at the bottom corner i did purchase an extra tarp to lay down before putting it up and felt this was a good investment for a cleaner tent when putting away plus it helped to have an extra water resistant tarp underneath  overall it worked great and i loved the light breeze that filtered through the windows   which you can adjust      
1351,2.0,                       purchased this tent because it s small and only will use occasionally but once we finally took it out this weekend  i noticed the zipper had a defect right out of the box  i still used it becuase i had no choice but disappointed that it is defective but not sure i will go through the hassle of returning  buyers just beware      
1352,3.0,                       i got this last year for      hmm price gouge      
1353,4.0,                       i ordered this tent at the last minute before a camping trip after i remembered that my old tent was no more  i personally would not try to fit three people in this tent  but i tend to like to have some space for myself  it was large enough for a queen sized air mattress and two backpacks  i think it would be a little too cozy to try to fit anything else in here  that being said  the tent is fine  it s easy to set up  and kept the bugs off of us in the woods  if that s all you need a tent for  then this should work just fine      
1354,5.0,                       product was very affordable and delivered within   days as advertised   bought due to numerous reviews that tents stayed dry   tent is super easy to setup and easily fits back into the carrying bag   we didn t get any rain or significant rain but very pleased for a camping trip in the    degree weather   i will say that the material would weep dew onto your sleeping bag if the bag contacted the wall of the tent   i am going to purchase a few extra poles and more stable tent stakes  but overall  very pleased with the tent and if it keeps us dry during the next rain storm  an excellent purchase price      
1355,5.0,                       this tent is perfect for two people  it set up super quick and easily  the two of us had plenty of room for us and our stuff  so happy i downsized  we have an   person tent  for the trip      
1356,5.0,                       we bought this tent for my   boys for their birthdays this summer  they got to use it for the first time a few weeks ago and loved it it was easy to set up  my eight year old got the tent set up without help before my husband could even get his tent set up  it was very sturdy and water proof  it rained during the camping trip and the boys stayed nice and dry in their tent we usually only buy tents with a rain fly that goes all the way to the ground  but i would definitely buy this product again and will recommend it to friends      
1357,1.0,                           zero stars      tent came broken weather worked out finally for us to open it up for use  broken pole support that holds tent upright sorry to find out when we did  between rain  too cold out  work  kids    errands  failed to check product once arrived  lesson learned     
1358,4.0,                       for the money  this tent is hard to beat  it s easy to set up and has plenty of room for two people  but i think that  while it can accommodate four people  it might feel a little crowded  at least in warm weather  i would highly recommend treating the seams with a seam sealer product  my daughter and her girlfriend used it on a recent camping trip the first time out  and it rained overnight and the flooring inside the tent was wet  i didn t think this would be a problem with a brand new tent  but apparently  it is  seam seal it prior to using it  youtube has videos on how to do this       
1359,4.0,                       i bought this so my granddaughter and i could camp out in the yard   very nice quality and easy to put up   my only complaint is the pole has snagged the fabric on the loop that holds the pole on top and has torn it somewhat   it isn t in the top of the tent itself so it doesn t cause it to leak   this happened the first time i put it up so i was a little disappointed in the design   otherwise  we ve enjoyed it   adequate amount of space for two people   i also like that you can leave the top piece off and gaze at the stars and still have the mesh to guard against mosquitoes      
1360,4.0,                       acceptable value     
1361,4.0,                       bought this tent so i wouldn t ruin mine during a desert camping trip  it held up great was very cozy i took off one star because one of the rods didn t fit properly  no matter what i did i couldn t get it in  but it was the rod that kept the rain flap up so it didn t affect me too much  also because of the lack of windows in it  i know it s a cheap tent but it would be nice to see out of it in more than one direction      
1362,5.0,                       i was surprised how great this tent is so much that i bought a second one   get one if you plan on going camping   its aesthetic  roomy  comfortable  light and easy to pack   makes getting a camping set up easy and affordable   i mostly like how easy it is to set up and doesnt have many convoluted parts   anyone can figure this tent out      
1363,5.0,                       i love this tent       
1364,5.0,                       i ordered this tent so that my son and my grandson could do some backyard camping  it is easy to set up and take down  roomy enough for two and comfortable      
1365,5.0,                       just used it this weekend and its perfect for me  my dog  and my single air mattress   i have no idea if it leaks because we had no rain   takes me about   minutes at most to set up  leaves about    inches space between the mattress and the door so i had plenty of storage room      
1366,4.0,                       i love this tent  i had a   man tent but got tired of getting dressed laying down  i was a little hesitant to buy this one due to the low price but decided that the coleman name made it worth the risk  it is very easy for one person to set up  very good ventilation on hot days  nice wide door  plenty of room for   people and their gear  stayed dry during the rain  this would not be a good tent for cold weather due to all the ventilation but a great hot and cool weather tent      
1367,5.0,                       great   person tent for summer camp outs   kids just used it in the backyard and it was perfect  has a rain tarp but it didn t rain so i can t comment on that  fits nicely in the carry bag with little effort getting it back inside      
1368,5.0,                       my hubby got this to go on a father and son camping outing with our son  my hubby is     and he said it was pretty comfy and not a bad but at all  was easy to put up  quality was great and kept the rain off them  fit   adults comfortably  and   small kids comfortably      
1369,5.0,                       of course the first use became a real test   rim of the grand canyon  subzero temps and winds that wouldn t stop   this tent was not made for this  but it held its own   i did have to throw a cheap tarp on top to try and hold more heat and block more wind   it is not possible to totally seal the tent from the inside  it s meant to breath  however it really did the best i could expect from it in a turn of weather     fit people inside with a queen airbed      
1370,5.0,                       decently easy to set up  nice features on the inside   vents for warm weather  hanging pockets  center ceiling hook for a led lamp   i ve had easier rain flies to set up  but this is about standard   note this is a   season tent  so it would be a poor choice for very cold weather  but an excellent choice for hot nights      
1371,5.0,                       absolutely excellent quality   used it for a week in pennasylvania mountains  poured rain for hours a couple nights and lots of wind  tent did not leak and held up excellent  zipper is strong too      
1372,5.0,                       used this for camping in our backyard  it was my       year olds first time camping as well as my first time and this tent was perfect  we even left it up and the next day there was a terrible  windy thunderstorm  i was sure the tent would have blown away and gotten water inside  the mesh inserts were left open   but it held up perfectly and kept the water out  if you are using an air mattress  don t expect the be able to fit more than a queen  we used one and the kids were squeezed on the ground on both sides with their sleeping bags      
1373,5.0,                       so far  so good  the tent is easy to assemble  i was able to do it by myself  the second night of camping it down poured and the tent did well with keeping water out  a little bit got through around the bottom  but not enough to worry  the tent was a little smaller than i imagined  if you are sharing the tent with another person  i would go to the next size up  not enough room for two people to sleep  comfortably   overall  i would recommend this tent to others      
1374,4.0,                       so far this has been a good tent  easy to set up and take down  even when windy  ventilation is quite good  and easy access  only had it in light rain so far but stayed dry  waiting for a heavier rain to see whether its really going to keep us dry  great buy  especially for the price      
1375,5.0,                       we ve used our tent three times since purchasing this summer  love the canopy piece is removable for more air circulation and star seeing  living in portland  we ve also used while it was raining  which it held up exceptionally well  i recommend getting this three person tent for two people to allow for having your bags and misc supplies in the tent at night and give you enough wiggle room  also appreciate the mesh pockets in the sides of the tent for easy access storage for our headlamps and phones      
1376,5.0,                       we bought this tent for a cross country trip in august        camped in deserts  beaches  forests  etc   this tent held up great and was very easy to set up   there were only   of us  but the   person tent was perfect for our   cots and plenty of room to move around   also  plenty of headroom   we have used it several times a year since      with our most recent trip on          still looks great and no damage   have been lucky to only have a couple rainy days  so my water resistance rating may not be very accurate   would highly recommend      
1377,5.0,                       like others  i have not been camping since i was a kid  i bought mine early this summer and the best thing about it is that it is easy up easy down for one person to handle  since i typically go camping alone that is worth the five stars  i have so much room with my full size air mattress to keep all my gear inside  i have been in rain  no leaks  not heavy winds  but some wind  never felt as if the tent was going to blow away  i recommend this tent to anyone        
1378,5.0,                       got this for a backyard campout  first i need to say it was very spacious  i can fit   queen mattresses side by side and a twin mattress on the bottom of them  with a corner for your gear  is great in the rain  only   drops got in the tent  the window was hallway open  it was very easy to set up  the only hassle was putting it away  we had to fold the tent and rainfly very tightly so it would fit in the bag  other than that  it was great  with the hole for the cords  we easily were able to watch a movie  we chose the lego movie everything is awesome   with the tent        
1379,4.0,                       great little tent for backyard camping however when they call it a two person tent that s exactly what it is  you can t fit much else in there  full on camping trip that would require backpacks  lanterns  food and other camp gear will not fit comfortably inside the tent with two people   this can be a problem if you don t want your items to have condensation on them the next morning because you had to keep them outside the tent      
1380,5.0,                       this is a great tent for the price  we bought the   person size  it sets up well and is great for your basic campong needs  it isnt very heavy when it is packed up  it vents well  the bottom seems pretty water resistant  we bought it to fit our queen size air mattress  once we put inflated the mattress and put it on the corner  there was just enough space to put our bags in  so if you ware looking for more space with an inflatable queen mattress  you may consider the   or   person size  anyway  this is a great tent overall      
1381,4.0,                       would have given this   if it had a little more room  definitely a   person tent  fit our queen air mattress with about   inches or so if space for belongings  perfect for my cub scout and me for our camp experience  also   our tent was one of    out of     that stayed dry though   days of rain  worth the purchase although we may need to get a bigger size as he grows      
1382,4.0,                       we ve used this tent twice so far   i really like how simple it is to set up   some have complained about it being warm  but it s a tent   they aren t exactly warm   i have two issues with it so far ne  it didn t fit back in the bag  ok  that s expecting a lot i know  tents never go back in their bags right   but then the zipper on the bag broke after the second use   lame   i already ordered a bigger back so i could fit it and the tent poles and everything in so i m not going to make a big deal of that two  the tent poles don t easily slide through the holders   they get hung up on the fabric a lot and this last trip i actually noticed a couple of small tears   not cool   i will see how it goes with our next camping trip in a couple of weeks   if the tears get bigger  i may have to send it back other than those two issues  it s a great tent   we easily fit our queen sized air mattress in and had about   feet of space on either side of it for all our crap   we can stand up in the tent as well   the flooring also seems very sturdy and nice      
1383,5.0,                       i purchased this tent to compliment my camping gear also owning a large sized pop up tent which is huge to transport   the blue color is very attractive and the set up for the first time was easy   this is among the best products branded under coleman      
1384,5.0,                       we were finally able to go camping in this tent  we love it  this   person sundome tent is easy to setup  as well as very spacious  its    x    and  is    tall in center  i m      and can stand straight up  it has   very large panels that are mesh and a small mesh vent on bottom center of panel  the only thing i would change with this tent is make the door a full screen door  not just half screen window      
1385,2.0,                       this tent is ok if your not going to do any camping in the wind  i used it for the second time this weekend and we had a bit of wind at the gorge   well all the rain fly hooks snapped off  and one of the tabs for the piles completely broke off   i m not sure this tent is even usable again  i ll probably give it to one of the homeless people downtown and look for one that actually won t break after   uses     
1386,5.0,                       i bought the three person coleman sundome tent for our first camping trip together this summer  based on the good reviews it had   i am so glad i purchased it my son is four years old  and it was a perfect size for both of us   i set up the tent all by myself and took me about    minutes  just like it says in the product description   if i can do it  anybody can do it it is a great value item  and i highly recommend it to anybody considering purchasing a new tent   when we went camping to crater lake  it was sunny  so i have not experienced rain with it yet also  there are two mesh pockets inside the tent  they were perfect for storing his story books  my watch  and headlamps   there is a hook inside for you to hang a lantern too   nice features      
1387,5.0,                       wonderful tent  slept in this tent for a whole month  still looks brand new  never had any problems     
1388,5.0,                       described as     dryer than previous coleman tents  i expected some leakage  but used it  without sealing seams    consecutive rainy nights on oregon camping trip and was surprised that it stayed completely dry  i was careful to pitch it on higher ground and used a tarp underneath  my companion s coleman   person tent  did leak  fortunately they slept on an air mattress  it doesn t provide much warmth though  needed extra blanket      
1389,4.0,                       after having taken a few trips with it  i can say confidently that it s a decent tent   stood up to rain and wind just fine   only thing that would make it better would be the inclusion of a big window on the side   also   be forewarned   this tent is exactly big enough for two people and at two people it s quite snug   if either person in your party is a little heavy set  or you just like a bit of room to spread out  i would strongly advise getting a larger tent   this is  exactly  large enough to fit two average people inside of      
1390,5.0,                       nice spacious tent  it comfortably fit   people and two    lb dogs plus suitcases with extra room still  set up and take down was fairly easy and quick     
1391,5.0,                       good for casual camping   easy setup  i used it the first time in the woods after dark   sturdy enough  packs up easily  well ventilated but also well protected from rain by the cover fly   seams and zippers seem good so far   i m glad i got this one   note the dimensions carefully   they are accurate as stated  but it s really just big enough for me  i m not very tall  plus my baggage  or two people with no baggage inside      
1392,5.0,                       i bought this as an inexpensive canoeing backpacking tent and i am very pleased   it fits in my dry bag when i go canoeing and i am sure it will do for my occasional overnight backing trips   it fits   people great with plenty of room to spare  it can definitely fit   people  i have used this only twice one night it rained and i had no issues  i did spray some rain sealant on the tent previously to make sure it was extra sealed   if you need a     person tent to be able to take with you on a canoeing or backpacking trip where you want to travel lightly but not spend a lot of money this tent will certainly work for you      
1393,4.0,                       i have camped in my tent in florida state parks and it served me well   plenty of room for me and a queen size air mattress along with other goodies   i like the storage pockets on each side of the tent   the rainfly also works   it rained twice during my camping trips and things stayed dry inside      
1394,5.0,                       loving this tent  i had a smaller version that i really liked  but we needed more room  my   year old son   i had it up in our driveway in   minutes  i was able to get it up   back down   in the bag by myself within    minutes at the camp  we haven t had it out in rain  but here s to hoping we don t have to      
1395,5.0,                       easy to set up and take down  inside is spacious  i only used it on an overnight camp and it was windy and raining all night and we stayed dry  it worked great      
1396,5.0,                       i wanted an inexpensive tent for my recent hike in camping trip   this worked great   easy set up and reasonably light and compact   found it had numerous nice touches  adjustable ventilation  multiple hooks inside for hanging light items  and small mesh pouches for storing my glasses   very happy with my purchase      
1397,4.0,                       i m pretty happy with this tent  it s very durable  although it came with a missing part which was extremely inconvenient when i realized that while i was out camping  also  this tent is probably best suitable for just   person  lastly  it didn t come with instructions which was very difficult      
1398,2.0,                       i bought this product based on the testing that was done  it showed it as almost leak proof  it was not  set aside the fact this is tent number two because  the first one was shipped with a knife gash in the original packaging  the rain fly is what failed on this tent  it has a seam near the top of the tent which leaked on both sides that had that seam  on a positive note  our camp site was at the bottom of the tent area where the water run off was diverted to from the other sites and the bottom held up to a two inch deep torrent of water running through the site  i didn t feel the rain was heavy enough to cause the rain fly to leak but at least the bottom kept water out      
1399,5.0,                       stood up to a serious thunderstorm on the first trip out   no leaks and seems durable enough update several years later      both of these that i ordered are still in great shape although i can t say that i ve used them enough   not ideal for backpacking although i ve done it without much of a problem   good for car camping since they don t take up much room in the trunk   it s actually a great affordable in between tent if you are a car backpack camper   the picture was from my favorite campsite ever   arapaho national forest in colorado  near lake granby      
1400,3.0,                       it s an ok tent   about what you expect for the price   if i could do it again i would spend more for a better tent   bag ripped first use  zipper got stuck in the fabric  causing a small hole   if you only plan on occasional use  it s good enough      
1401,5.0,                       i bought this for my wife and i s first camping trip  boy am i glad i bought the four man tent  once we put our blow up queen mattress in there was just enough room for the two of us to be comfortable  anyone to try and put four adults in this tent would end up with an uncomfortable trip  the tent performed great  and seemed to be well made  definitely easier to put together than most other tent s i ve used before  we got lot s of compliments on how great it looked from her family  we were quite pleased as well  i wouldn t hesitate to recommend this tent to anyone considering purchasing it  one thing though  definitely buy a nicer sturdier set of stakes  the ones it comes with are very small  and i wouldn t feel comfortable with them holding it if the wind were to kick up      
1402,5.0,                       what a great tent for under       fits a king sized air mattress with plenty of room for gear  used several times  easy to setup and take down  a bit drafty at night but i kind of like that  hasn t been rained on yet  otherwise it s a great  just a tent  option      
1403,5.0,                       this tent would be a tight fit for four people  with gear  but other than that the tent was great  it was perfect for our camping trip  i can t wait to use it again  super easy assembly and tear down      
1404,4.0,                       this was the first tent i ever purchased and was for my first camping trip as well  this tent is probably sized per the industry norm  but it s a fairly tight fit for one person               with an air mattress and backpack  i m not sure how two people would comfortably rest in a tent this small  it s a good tent  easy to assemble  keeps the rain out well  will purchase a   person   tent in the future      
1405,5.0,                       awesome and easy to set up    this was my first camping trip and it felt like a miniature room it was private and very sturdy  i like that you can hang things like battery operated fans or led lights etc inside  it fit our queen over sized air mattress perfectly with room on the sides for a cooler and   tote   backpacks  a radio  shoes    gallons of water and   medium bucket      
1406,3.0,                       it s a good tent and all it s good for camping it s a two man tent but i think only one person would fit in it is very small that s the only thing i didn t like i should have just got a   man tent  but it was perfect for me because i was by myself     
1407,1.0,                       seems like a nice tent  however  when i went to go camping finally after purchasing this tent a while ago  after setting it up i realized it was missing its rainfly  the top was all mesh and open  and i was far from civilization  a huge thunderstorm came in  and i was forced to cover one side of the mesh with a raincoat  it was very wet and cold because this tent was missing the top      
1408,3.0,                       i m a petite woman and considered the tent to be small in size  personally  i would have preferred more room inside the tent  i bought this tent to use individually  for one person  and thought that a two person tent will provide plenty of space    i was wrong  if you re simply looking for something to sleep in and you re under     feet tall  it might work out great for you  i used my tent to change clothes and store a few bags which made it feel crowded and confined  i ll recommend it for two children  but not adults    star for decent quality and easy set up      
1409,5.0,                       i have used this on three trips now  holds up very well in all weather  can easily fit two twin size blow up mattresses in it and three people as well  easy set up and easy to clean up as well      
1410,4.0,                       this seems like a decent tent  looks fine for the price  not easy to put up for one person  i had one like this    years ago so i know how to put it up but i think the poles could break if you try as a first time putting it up alone  it is better to put the poles together and through the tubes and on the holding points at the back end  then  open the entrance flap and have a person step inside the tent and lift it up  the other person can then secure the poles to the tab in the front   it s much easier that way      
1411,5.0,                       for someone who had never camped before this was a real beautiful experience   i shared the tent with my four year old son for   nights  and it was quite comfortable   the only thing is that the instructions were not too clear to follow for someone who never erected a camping tent before  and i had to resort to a video on youtube to see how to      
1412,4.0,                       just bought this tent and took it out this weekend  was warm and dry so i can t speak on how it handles the rain or the cold  but it handled some very strong winds like a champ  the ventilation is great  and if you don t need the rain fly it s great to see the stars  it s super easy to set up and take down and it packs pretty light  i would say it is a little tight for two people but still manageable  overall a great tent  really glad i bought it      
1413,5.0,                       used it for several campouts and it is easy to assemble and no issues with the weatherproofing      
1414,5.0,                       great tent fit me and my girlfriend on a queen inflatable mattress comfortably not much room for anything else but thats all we needed it was really easy and quick to assemble and set up  will probably buying  will gladly accept one to review another for additional family members     
1415,1.0,                       the tent looked great until i opened it  then i found someones half eaten lunch wrapped up in the top part of the tent  the mold was so bad  i had to throw out part of the tent  i dont know if this was done on purpose or just gross negligence but it sure was disgusting      
1416,5.0,                       great tent   very easy to set up   the color is really nice and doesn t seem to fade at all in the sun since using this several times   it is pretty waterproof   we ve made it through   bad rainstorms and nothing was wet afterward   plenty of room for for us    adults and   small children    it s easy to break down and put back in the bag for easy storage   coleman is a great brand   this tent will last us many years to come      
1417,2.0,                       had it out about   times  dried every single time after taking it out  now it s starting to disintegrate  getting holes in mesh and in the tent itself  don t think it will make it much longer      
1418,4.0,                       i do love the tent  i only went   stars because one tent pole was broken on delivery  and even though the tent is  under warranty  coleman warranty department did not respond to calls or emails  fortunately with a bit of research i was able to fix it for         
1419,5.0,                       use this product to camp in my backyard my kids and i had lots of fun easy to put up easy to take down     
1420,5.0,                       easy to assemble  can choose to have lots of light come in or not  quite spacious  fits   rei queen sized air mattresses    quite satisfied with this choice      
1421,5.0,                       just got this tent and used it one weekend so far  it was very easy to construct and i was surprised by how spacious it is  i am      and i was able to stand up in the middle of the tent the material is clearly not the best quality but that s to be expected for the price  it rained pretty solid for several hours and i was surprised to find the inside was completely dry      
1422,5.0,                       this is a wonderful tent  the price  is very comparable to others   my family is extremely active in scouting   i have gone camping with this tent numerous times now  it has held up wonderfully even through rain and colder temperatures   i highly recommend this product for anyone that needs a smaller tent for backpacking or hiking   it is lightweight and very easy to set up even in the dark      
1423,5.0,                       haven t taken it into the wilderness  but my trial run in my yard was a success  very easy assembly  i m sure someone who has never put up a tent before could figure it out  i left it up for a few days to see if i would need to seal the seams   through   rainstorms  the inside stayed dry  i had an extra tarp under  to accurately simulate how i do it while camping   and i had no problems with moisture seeping through  i m still going to seal the seams  though  i d say   people plus gear would fit very comfortably  but i like my space    people could fit  but there would be little room for much else      
1424,5.0,                       we got it for backyard sleep outs  but in reality the kid has it set up in the bedroom and loves it   easy to set up  two people could easily fit      
1425,3.0,                       roomy but relatively difficult to put up and impossible to out back in the bag  to me  a good tent can be bulky it s easy to put up and install  this is not      
1426,5.0,                       perfect for one person  or for two who really want to sleep close together  easy set up and well constructed      
1427,5.0,                       i have used this tent every night since i put it up  i nailed it to a platform on the farm and haven t taken it down since  about   weeks now   opening the  windows  provides such a wonderful view and it feels heavenly waking up in the outdoors  i would recommend using a thick blanket or comforter for a comfortable rest if you don t have a sleeping bag  we haven t experienced a really strong storm yet  but i don t think it will be an issue      
1428,3.0,                       i used this tent three times and the fabric is starting to tear in places   i am very careful with it and it still hasn t stood up well   i have an   person tent that i have been using for over   years that has no issues   the fabric just isnt woven well      
1429,5.0,                       i purchased this tent for a cross country road trip with my son   we camped in yellowstone national park for three days   the tent was easy to set up   it rained hard the first night and we stayed completely dry      
1430,4.0,                       this is an outstanding tent for the price   easy to assemble and appears to be made with quality  only problem was the rainfly pole cord was broken  i had to contact coleman about it and they sent replacement pole kit out to me a few weeks later   i had to fix it myself  little aggravating but sometimes things happen  i d purchase again and we know now that coleman stands behind their product      
1431,4.0,                       a lovely little tent for casual car camping  survived two days in pretty torrential rain with minimal seepage  this is a great starter tent  big enough for   comfortably   or   with room to spread out and store gear      
1432,5.0,                       wish the stakes for longer  only one camping trip so far and we had stakes pull  up during wind storm at cheyenne mountain state park  the stakes were driven into permanent gravel campsite  what we needed were ropes to tie  on to rings that the campsite provided the stakes should work at other sites  more of a lack of preparation on my part      
1433,5.0,                       easy to set up and tear down    person can do in windy conditions save yourself a headache and buy more sturdy stakes  the thin metal ones don t do well in gravelly areas  good size for two plus gear  would recommend      
1434,5.0,                       took this tent camping  it poured rain all night  the next morning it was still raining and i crawled around on the floor looking to see how much water came in during the night  literally  not one drop leaked in  i have a north face tent    but it leaks      
1435,5.0,                       used the item for camping recently with heavy winds   no problems  no issues    but i wouldn t recommend it for so called   people inside the tent  maybe kids   but more like   adults   if there is something to be improved  maybe provide a net or pocket on the inside top of the tent for lamps or placing personal items      
1436,5.0,                       absolutely pleased with this tent  i went camping with a couple of friends  i shared this tent with another person and it was perfect  i am a tall person        so this size worked perfectly  i am glad i did not go with the   person tent  we would have suffocated  sarcasm   my friend brought tons of stuff for our camping thus filling our tent up but we were both happy at how much space we had for being the two of us  i think if you actually have   people in this tent  it wouldn t work      
1437,5.0,                       i m posting this review as a two parter  part   will come sometime in early august for those interested  and i ll try to make the entire review as thorough and specific as possible  as i personally appreciate a good review  i ll also divide into sections  set up  so  first off  i ordered it a few days ago and just got it today  i put it together in the living room the first chance i had and as far as difficulty  it was pretty easy  there are just two main poles that you insert after you ve staked your tent corners  took me about       minutes i m not a tent expert  but i have set up a few    i attached the included rain fly after i pitched the tent and  again  it was very easy  although the instructions recommend doing this while the tent is still laying flat  either way  it fits perfectly on top and makes a nice sort of awning over the front and back  space  it s   by   feet  so as a   foot tall person  i fit pretty nicely long ways and even more comfortably diagonally  i bought this for a weekend camping float trip with my girlfriend who is about      and i m confident that we ll both sleep comfortably with some of our stuff  don t worry about those negative nancys saying  i m tall and there s no way this is  x    i measured it  and it indeed is  stuff  it comes with the usual gear  tent  poles  rain fly  stakes  instructions and a bag for everything  now  the stakes are a little scrawny looking  but i m sure they ll hold up just fine for our intended light use  i wouldn t mind having some beefier ones  so i may pick up a set before the trip  on the inside  there are two high hanging mesh pockets  plenty of windows with a little vent area towards the bottom as well as a sweet  huge  open mesh top for clear weather nights don t worry  the rain fly covers this top very nicely   there s also a good zippered electrical cord port on the front left bottom corner if you re at a site with electricity  the bottom of the tent is a nice tarp like material that actually runs up the sides about   inches or so   overall  i m very satisfied with the size and quality of this tent  given the cheap but not too cheap price  i m going to get some water proofer for this baby and i know i ll be juuust fine  part   of this review will come after the trip when i actually use the tent towards the end of july and i ll try to keep it a little more simple by just telling you how the tent treated me  i will say this  if you re on a budget and looking for a decent tent  this one is worth it      
1438,5.0,                       just used this while camping for a week  it was great  it rained quite a few times and we stayed dry  the tent seems bigger than it says and was super easy to put up      
1439,5.0,                       my kids uses this tent for scout camp outs    or maybe my husband does  i don t know    someone in my house uses this for scout camp outs and they like it  it sets up quick and easy and comes down  when ready  quick and easy      
1440,5.0,                       very easy to setup  enough room for   adults inside   the poles are thick and sturdy  they withstood quite a bit a wind during a rain storm   tub bottom kept us dry during the rain   the rain fly is huge  you won t really have to worry about leaking seams because it will shield your tent from most of the water i m terrible at folding things  but i was able to stuff the tent and everything else back in the bag relatively quickly only down side is this thing weighs a ton   definitely of no use if you re hiking  but that s not why i bought it      
1441,5.0,                       went camping with the chance of strong storms  was sceptical because how good could it be for the price right  very impressive  even during the hard rain we kept the windows open  the rain fly goes out far enough to allow the windows to be down rain or shine  very impressed with this tent  would recommend it and buy another easy set updries fastcomes with everything      
1442,3.0,                       set up on the old walnut farm  im not sure about this  for the price i guess its ok  ez to set up  the directions are sewn into the carry bag but if you need directions maybe you dont need a tent lol  i will keep it but i wouldnt buy it again if offered  enjoy         
1443,5.0,                       it s a great tent and very easy to set up  my only complaint is getting it back in the bag  that part is not nearly as easy  but maybe with more practice i ll get better  the rain cover can be set up pretty quickly  woke up to rain coming in the tent and was able to get the rain fly on before everything got soaked  it would be quite cozy for   people  i use it as a   person tent      
1444,5.0,                       exactly what we were looking for  very quick and easy set up  says   person but could easily get   people in if needed  this one was for the kids and they loved it     
1445,4.0,                       would have given it   stars but the stakes it comes with are fairly worthless   order some real stakes when you order this tent   i also wanted to add definitely not for cold weather alot of the air vents have no way to seal off so if its a cool windy night pack accordingly     
1446,5.0,                       okay  yes  we camped in the backyard  but still  the tent was comfortable and easy to set up  maybe we will graduate to real camping some day      
1447,5.0,                       finally took it out for a weekend camping  we went prepared knowing it was going to rain  it turned out to be a full scale thunderstorm  luckily  we put a tarp underneath  and woke up with just a tiny bit of water in the tent  i can t complain about that given how bad the thunderstorm was  the product claims to be able to fit in   people  that might be very tight though      
1448,5.0,                       i purchased this tent in a rush when i noticed a hole in the rain fly of my good camping tent just a few days before i was supposed to leave on a trip  this tent performed perfectly on a   night trip to the beach  we had heavy rains on the first night and not one drop came through the floor or roof  we didn t experience any heavy winds so i can t speak to that  but what i expected to be a one time use tent will now serve as my primary car camping tent      
1449,5.0,                       bought two for the kids   we are regular campers and these are perfect for the semi tropical   spring and summer camping trips   very happy with purchase     
1450,4.0,                       very easy to set up   wish it was a bit larger but its my first experience with a lightweight and it is amazingly light  yet seems durable and fine for one person and a small air mattress   next time  that will be in my gear      
1451,5.0,                       simple and easy to use  takes a beating from the kids too      
1452,4.0,                       roomy but not for extreme weather   just bring a light nylon tarp to cover tent more completely than the limited fly if heavy rain is possible  and of course use heavy stakes to anchor tarp and tent   easy set up with lots of room inside for me with plentiful space for luggage  ice chest  lights  and beach chair   airy and sturdy just the right size for car camping by myself or with my wife      
1453,1.0,                       i would have given   stars buuut     while my husband and i were camping for our   year anniversary  it rained on us  typical florida weather   we thought we would be safe since the bottom of the tent is made of tarp plus we had an extra tarp under it   probably should have put that extra tarp inside the tent since water came through the stitching  we had to use tissue on the corners to absorb the water throughout the night while sleeping on bare floaties to prevent sleeping in wet blankets      
1454,5.0,                       loved using it in big sur for my first camping trip as an adult  realistically  though  this is more of a   person tent and it s more of a couple s tent at that  i d have a hard time sleeping with someone i m not comfortable cuddling with in this tent  otherwise  very easy to set up and a great price point      
1455,3.0,                       setup was straight forward  we swam sealed the tent it rained both nights we camped  rained hard the second night  the second night we had water seep through a few spots on the tent  a couple spots seemed as if it was just coming through the material  and another leak was by the seam at the top of  little window near the floor  it didn t leak enough to get us wet  but still was some water in the tent     
1456,5.0,                       so easy to put together and survived the rain storm we had over the weekend  sold as a four person tent and fit a queen air mattress with room to spare      
1457,4.0,                       it s nice  compact and light weight tent for it s size  it s waterproof and didn t got any issues while camping in rain  very easy to setup  i m give   instead of   star as entry place of tent is having very small shading to prevent rain to get in while using it during rain and also due to small shading can t leave footwear outside when it s raining      
1458,5.0,                       first time i went for camping and we did struggled for    mins  but then we are pro   now i can take this with confidence because we had a heavy rain and wind that evening but not even a single drop that leaked through the seam   pretty solid tent   we did buy few extra mats and a sheet for bottom but overall this is great      
1459,5.0,                       i haven t used it yet so take my stars with a grain of salt  i put much research into this purchase and chose this tent carefully so i suspect it will be just fine now  if i could just figure out how to fasten this to the base of my backpack any suggestions      
1460,5.0,                       went camping this past weekend  got hit with rain but the tent stood up great  another tent i had didn t fair as well  this tent has plenty of space  one night we had   adults and a dog sleeping together and there was still room for more  happy i made the purchase  easy to set up and take down      
1461,2.0,                       we unboxed the tent and set it up in our living room this weekend  unfortunately  the zipper on the door snagged and the whole thing will not come together  it was a christmas gift and the return date expire   days ago  totally bummed  it looks like a great tent  but with the zipper busted  it s not functional  wish we would have tested it out sooner      
1462,5.0,                       we purchased this for our son who had to quarantine during covid in       little did we know that we would test the weatherproof ability and water resistance  he ended up having to use it during a week of solid rain  the tent help up wonderfully  no leaking what so ever      
1463,5.0,                       bought it because we were going camping and it was going to rain that night  the reviews said it held up great in the rain  and it did   even though it has a window you can t close and it was very windy  no water came in the tent and it held up great  the fabric really is waterproof  great product      
1464,5.0,                       i had a smaller   person model  now purchased this one  still a great quality  no issues  just keep in mind that it s ideal for     persons  you still can fit   persons there but you will have no space for your belongings      
1465,5.0,                       my daughter and i went camping this summer  and this tent was the perfect house away from home   kept the rain out  it was a bit cold windy in ohio  and this little guy kept us warm   fits a queen size air mattress with room to spare   hole for the power plug was a nice touch put this tarp under it  and you ll be loving life  dry top        super heavy duty orange truck tarp   x  feet       
1466,5.0,                       just received this tent and as its been    yrs since i put up one  took me about    minutes by myself  next time i bet i could do it in ten  looks great  feels sturdy  i am a casual camper so this tent will be great and a good price too  air ventilation is great even with the rain thing on  i have  adults    child and a small dog in it and we have plenty of room  four adults would be too close quarters for me but you could do it i suppose  love how you can look up and see the night sky in this tent  awesome      
1467,4.0,                       had a hard time picking a tent as i intended to use it primarily on my patio which is roughly   x     my criteria was a quality tent that i could fit at least a twin air mattress in with room to spare  and that i d be able to stand in without bending over  i m        i also very much liked the cord access port and the bathtub style bottom  which aren t features of all tents   though they should be  i would have preferred a tent where it could be rigged with the rain fly and still allowed you to be able to see out on all four sides  with the rain fly on  it affords a view out the front and back  but not the sides  without the fly  the entire upper     of the tent is nothing but mesh as to waterproofing  i attempted to apply a waterproof coating as soon as i got it  however it was an exercise in frustration as the coating beaded up on the material like water on a freshly waxed car   instructions said to dampen material  then spray on to coat  and then wipe with a damp cloth  this simply pushed the waterproofing around and as far as i could tell  none of it stayed on the tent because the factory coating repelled it   a difficult  messy  tiring job that was a waste of time as far as i can tell poles are substantial  and tent is cut and sewn precisely to ensure it s all fairly tight when set up i set it up by myself and it was a bit tricky  particularly getting the rain fly flopped over the top and secured before it slid or blew off   doing this in any sort of breeze by yourself would be very difficult as it acts like a kite and slides very easily against the material of the tent  until you can get some hooks on it to hold the upwind side d style door is ok  the zipper seems well sewn and though there was one rather tight spot in zipping it up  it s not bad and not a problem  the door does have a little flap over it to deflect rain  which might be handy  a little care to ensure it doesn t get caught in the zipper is needed  but no problem the guy lines that hold the fly down are essentially what makes the tent stable in any wind  the tent itself is only held down by the four corner stakes  which go through split rings at all four corners   the fly is also attached to the main cross poles holding up the tent by two hooks on all four sides of the poles  and then held down by attaching an adjustable line to the split ring at the base of all four corners   the guy lines at the sides of the fly serve both to stabilize the tent and hold the fly out for better cross ventilation   ventilation is also aided for warm weather by a small vent that can be staked out near the bottom rear of the tent with the idea that it will draw air in from near the ground and through the tent and out the top and sides it s plenty roomy for two people i d say   i have a twin air mattress and can also fit a small table and have plenty of room left over  it would easily fit two twin mattresses and likely two queens with a bit of room left over   you can also find a   x    or   x    tarp to use as a ground cloth   i bought a   x    tarp and double it over and it fits the footprint well it has a couple good size pockets that hand off the side walls that could hold some gear   and it has a single loop at the top of the  roof  for hanging things   whatever you re wanting to hang has to have a hook on it  i have a lantern that has wire handles and it s impossible to hang it from this loop   i found a plastic hook that came with a package of socks i think    ha  and with a wire pipe cleaner i bent it around so it would go through the loop and provide a hook to hang the lantern   it would have been a lot better had they included a hook at this spot for hanging things it does have little toggles and loops that make it fairly easy to roll up the window covers on the front and rear and then hold them neatly when you want the tent open the electrical access port is on the front left of the tent when facing it and consists of about a   inche diagonal slit with a zipper  you pass your extension cord or whatever through the slit and then zip the opening shut against it  since the slit is elevated a few inches from the ground this creates a nice drop loop for the cord so no water can follow it into the tent   by zipping the opening closed against the cord it also leaves very little room for bugs to get through   it s great to have a heavy duty extension cord and a power strip in the tent  can use corded lamps  electric heaters  charge your phone  set up a radio or laptop  etc   i hope to splice into my cable and run an extension out to the tent and have a tv out there too   really roughing it  another little extra that is practical is that they provide a sort of door mat made of the same material as the floor that can be put either inside or outside the door to try to catch dirt or provide a place to take off shoes boots i ve set up this tent once for three days and the first night there was a steady rain for perhaps   hours  not a drop of water leaked into the tent though there was some slight condensation  but not enough to run or drip   it seems to shed water very well  the next day  a lot of water droplets remained on the rain fly   but simply snapping it made them roll off   since i was at home  i got out my leaf blower and that got rid of every single drop as they easily blew off all areas of the tent where they hadn t already fallen off due to gravity   it s a very handy way to dry a tent  if i had a cordless blower  or even a corded one if there s plug ins  i d take it along if car camping       
1468,5.0,                       i have added this to my emergency kit for off roading  i have been caught in situations that would ve kept me overnight in very cold places      
1469,4.0,                       this is my  nd sundome tent  and i am very pleased with its performance   i had the last one for over   years and only got rid of it due to a cross country move and needing to downsize   it s a good size for   people with gear   would be a very tight fit for   people   easy to pitch by myself in about    minutes  though the included stakes are flimsy   i also got the tent kit with steel stakes and mallet  which made all the difference   my last sundome had the full screen door   this one only has a window at the top of the door  used this for a week of camping in az and ut  so far very happy   hope it lasts as long as my last one      
1470,4.0,                       i purchased this for a homeless woman and her dog  it s a great affordable tent  but the  front bottom ripped in no time  i m not sure why  still   it s a great tent for the price  but you have to be careful with it      
1471,5.0,                       unfortunately i haven t opportunity to used it but i ordered the same in different size and is was great  i just want more room for my backpack because the   people one is just to adjust     
1472,5.0,                       it was very easy to setup alone  even though this is the first time i am setting up a tent  i wanted to give     stars is as i would have expected a fly trap that was slightly larger  this is meant mostly for times when it rains only slightly      
1473,4.0,                       so far seems very water resistant like people said  it s roomier inside than you would think  so all and all so far appears to be a great deal on a good little rent  however the only criticism i would offer would be it could use a few more stakes around the base of it  other than that would buy it again      
1474,5.0,                       some of the poles must be threaded through fabric slots which are not the easiest  it has large screens  so it could let in a lot of cold air  for summer  camping  this is a great tent      
1475,5.0,                       great durable tent  we got caught in a pretty bad storm right by a flooding creek continued to stay all night and didnt get wet even a little      
1476,4.0,                       a bit of a tight squeeze for two  will fit a inflatable queen  wall to wall  however  it is a tight fit  i was comfortable  bf not so much  served its purpose and worth the price      
1477,4.0,                       this is not the highest quality tent available in this size range but it is the best value  by far   coleman s  bathtub  floors seem very durable and the nylon fabric which makes up the walls and fly is similar to that used by eureka and other manufacturers   the fiberglass poles are very light  however  so it remains to be seen whether the tent can withstand a strong storm   great price  though  amazon note  i purchased this tent from amazon for        in may of       my assessment of the value of the tent is based on this purchase price      
1478,5.0,                       i now have the room for my cot   the first time i used it one of my troops set it up  i am very pleased with the roominess and ease of packing it up  for years i have used backpacking tents and then moving to a three man tent  after camping for over    years and now not as young as i was i decided to sleep more comfortably   i like this tent      
1479,5.0,                       this is a perfect fit for my wife and i and our   kids  fits a queen size air mattress and a twin mattress with loads of room left  plenty of air ventilation a must for any camping trip  probably not a great tent for winter camping considering all the ventilation  recommend to all      
1480,5.0,                       we are very happy campers  our tent was perfect found nothing wrong with it   easy to set up easy to bring down  light and sturdy  we had a good night      
1481,2.0,                       my tent arrived today and i set it up to make sure everything was in working order before my camping trip and this is clearly a returned product as there are leaves and grass inside and hair on the screen  pretty disappointed that this wasn t properly cleaned before sending to another buyer  especially during covid      
1482,4.0,                       arrived yesterday afternoon  undamaged and in an decent cardboard shipping box  contents were   new  undamaged  coleman reusable zippered carry case same color as the tent  green   opened the zippered case this morning  and sorted all the accounted for contents like the ad displayed tent was up and going in about    minutes or so  had to cut out half the tent floor for my local moccasins rattlers etc  lol they d get an tad perturbed  lol  no troubles encountered as expected  coleman is age old for camping campers   think i saved about      lol    but i didn t have to travel  etc       
1483,5.0,                       easy to set up  i wouldn t risk putting up a tent without a tarp underneath because it definitely leaks a bit but i m really happy with this purchase      
1484,5.0,                       i love how easy this was to set up  alone  in the dark  right out of the amazon box it was up in   minutes  the bag says it expands but you ll need a seamripper to do it  it doesn t extend via zipper like other tent bags      
1485,4.0,                       great tent for the money but takes two people to set it up   you probably can set it up with one person  but it would be a challenge   vent on the bottom helps with air movement but it still will get stuffy in a humid climate   tent fan is recommended      
1486,5.0,                       went camping at glacier national park this week and got caught in violent lightening and thunder storm and a deluge of rain   this sweet little tent did not budge in the wind and not a drop of water got inside   terrific tent for the money      
1487,5.0,                       i will not deny that it was a bit complicated to put it together it must be said that everything arrived and the tent is wide  between a bed and space to put other things  we slept in it and i do not bother the clarity  only the cold      
1488,5.0,                       first camping trip with this tent i was in a storm with heavy rain  small pea size hail and     mph wind   the tent held up exceptionally well   i was with other campers that had high dollar tents and we were all surprised by this tent   i stayed dry all night   the only thing i had done was get some longer stakes      
1489,5.0,                       i took this tent camping in california and it worked perfectly  it was easy enough to set up  held up in the wind  lots of wind   and kept us dry i guess the only down side would be the weight  i packed in the tent  food  whiskey wine and it was pretty close to feeling like a full army ruck load i also recommend bringing something specific for hammering the stakes in   i used a rock and ended up bending a couple of them  those are the only part to me that kind of feels cheap  almost like soft aluminum not worth taking a star  i would recommend this tent     
1490,5.0,                       sets up super quickly and easily  can t be the price  don t know how it does in the rain  but we typically camp in the desert so hopefully we won t need to deal wtih that  more like a   person tent than a   person  but we just use it for two people and a dog      
1491,1.0,                       i m surprised at the seemingly lack of quality control  in my past experiences the coleman brand has always been a good quality item  so i purchased this believing that was still true  the first thing i saw when i unboxed my tent was that the seam in the carry bag was torn   as i was going camping the next time day and it was repairable  i didn t think to much of it   but when i set up the tent i saw that one of the seams in the tent was also poorly sewn  resulting in a gap in the tent seam  i m surprised at not one but two flaws in a brand new purchase  i would not purchase this brand again      
1492,5.0,                       this tent is perfect for one person   my husband and i could not fit into this tent   i bought a  twin  air mattress and it was a good size  since i like having room to put other things in the tent   the first time i used it   there was snow and then rain all night   everything inside the tent was dry the next morning   thank you coleman easy to assemble  can be done by one person in about    minutes       
1493,1.0,                       this is an entry level   person tent but the quality is very poor  didnot keep us warm under    f  even when me and my son stuffed a ton  the frame broke in   use      
1494,4.0,                       never hooked these up or even camp before so in the beginning  i had a little trouble   but once i did it the first time  it was not a problem hooking it up by myself the second time around     
1495,5.0,                       sets up easily  comes with stakes  enough room for a queen size inflatable mattress with about    inches left for my flip flops and flashlight beside the bed  pockets on two walls hold my phone and my kindle  plenty of air movement with the rain fly on  just the right size for one or two adults to sleep  not too enormous      
1496,5.0,                       this tent was even more spacious than expected and very quick and easy to set up  it only took   of us about   minutes to get it up the very first time we opened it  all our friends admired it and wanted one like it as well  cannot speak to the waterproof aspect  as it did not rain  but the rain cover was easy to put on and added some shade from the sun      
1497,5.0,                       purchased for my kids to camp in our yard with and it s perfect size   quality tent and easy to assemble     
1498,4.0,                       i m a bit disappointed   i got a   person tent hoping it would be more roomy but there is no way you could fit four ppl in here comfortably  unless maybe it was four very skinny shorter ppl even then it would still be snug in my opinion  it is very good quality and was easy to put up i just wish it was bigger  would not recommend for larger taller people      
1499,5.0,                       first time in this tent and i we had a four hour thunderstorm with tons of rain   not one drip in tent  very nice  i did have a grabber tarp underneath as a ground cloth      
1500,5.0,                       this tent is great  one thing that i will say is this is a decent size tent and my partner and i and our   kiddos could fit in this easily with space for the dog  the only issue we had was figuring out how to put on the rain cover      
1501,5.0,                       best bag for your buck out there  been on   camping trips since purchasing    of which were pouring the entire time and this tent held up perfectly  i did purchase the coleman weatherproofing seam seal and sealed all of the seams twice since no tent at this price is      waterproof  do yourself the favor and purchase the seam seal and your trip will always be dry      
1502,5.0,                       it is perfect for   person with a airbed has room for personal staff   two persons with a full size airbed will sleep good but no room for personal staff      
1503,4.0,                       as others have said this is a tight   man tent   it would be impossible for me to fit inside laying down front to back and i m not sure a cot will fit without hitting the walls side to side   otherwise it s a cakewalk to setup and take down   i have one sleeve on the poles that split immediately but seems to still hold up   was thinking about size to take on the motorcycle and i think this will work well   i d buy it again for what i m doing   good value      
1504,5.0,                       great tent for beach camping  the higher lip on the door helps keep sand out  i haven t used it in the rain but it held up really well in a windstorm  the stakes are flimsy metal ones  so i would definitely recommend stronger ones  especially in the sand   over all a really great  easy to pack tent      
1505,3.0,                       easy to set up by yourself and take down  however a string in the pole snapped on the second use of this tent  stayed almost all the way dry during    hrs of rain had little puddles in all corners  just the corners  need to replace the poles and i think it will still be a good tent      
1506,1.0,                       very easy to setup until the elastic band in the pole breaks  we had to piece it together with multiple people so the pole would not separate in pieces  also  the cover for the zipper to prevent rain from getting in is so flimsy that it catches everytime you use the door unless you keep it out of the zipper path so it s a cheap tent but expected better     
1507,5.0,                       this tent is definitely a warm weather tent but that is what we wanted so we are very happy   it has the coleman quality we have come to expect and the price on this particular color  which is also great  you can t beat   thanks      
1508,5.0,                       i m giving it   stars because it seems to be a great little tent although i have yet to actually use it  i m carrying it on my rv in case kids or grandkids ever need it and want to use it     
1509,4.0,                       it s nice  but it s just a little small i m   feet tall and if i go full starfish when i sleep  i can t spread out all the way  it would be difficult to put even a twin blowup mattress in there  nonetheless sleeping next to someone but  no water in the tent and it poured on the night of first use    huge upside  it s well made      
1510,4.0,                       took this camping with two children   for that it was great   easy to setup   only two adults will fit comfortably   i like this tent and would upgrade to a bigger size of the same brand    our first camping trip was rainy and it seemed as though rain was leaking in from a bottom corner   i am planning on getting some kind of sealant for the corners      
1511,5.0,                       i am thrilled with this tent   my      husband and i needed something for an event we had to fly to  then camp out of a rental car and it was perfect   it was light weight  small to carry in a checked duffle with room for sleeping pads and bags  my husband lightly touched on both sides but said he was very comfortable  we did not have to use it in bad weather so i don t have any experience with that   it seems like excellent quality  the zippers all work well   i bought a cheap shower curtain to use as a ground cloth      
1512,5.0,                       so happy i bought this tent   per the reviews we got hit with a bad storm  and i stayed dry   it s easy to set up and put away too   lots of room too      
1513,2.0,                       i like the size and color of the sundome but it s made poorly  mine came with a hole in the mesh pocket and crooked screen windows  there is a large gap where the fly doesn t cover the screen windows so expect no privacy  the rain slashes in  this is a fine tent for good weather or backyard camping      
1514,5.0,                       bought it for my first trip to yellowstone  it durable and good quality  easy to setup in    mins or less  spacious for     persons  the ventilation mesh is very good  used in windy and cold conditions  had to buy an extra tarp knowing it might be little wet on floor during cold nights  excellent product  would definitely recommend  value for money guaranteed      
1515,3.0,                       i feel the dimensions are off   i didn t get my tape measure out but i m      and i had to sleep diagonally in this tent   it did not feel like    x      this only fits two small skinny girl teenagers comfortably with some gear   one adult with gear the only way to get three people in here is with three children and no gear      
1516,5.0,                       this tent was worth every penny  super easy to set up  there was two of us but it could be done with one if necessary  weather water proofing was amazing  it poured rain our first night camping and not a drop got into the tent  absolutely no leaking at all with the rain cover  we were able to fit   twin size air mattresses comfortably and with room to spare for gear  i have always been happy with coleman products and this tent has been perfect      
1517,5.0,                       very nice tent  cheap too  imo  it is extremely easy to assemble    people have a decent amount of room inside as well  there are hanging zip pockets inside the tent to put phones  wallets  etc  i really like the fact that there s more than    window  as well      
1518,5.0,                       easy set up lots of room for two people and i like that i can stand up in the tent   it says   person but really   person is more like it and it would be a tight fit   i used cots to sleep on for two people and it give lots of room to store all your gear inside with room to walk around   i guess you could fit six if you just slept on the ground but that s all you would fit in the tent   we had rain and it kept us dry      
1519,5.0,                       excellent product with great quality  the space inside the tent is more than enough for   people  it will be just enough for   people  but i can t imagine    tent s fabric is excellent  we had   full days of rain and the tent maintained intact      
1520,4.0,                       easy to set up  however  first use noticed manufacturing flaws at corners which allowed for bugs to get in   stayed fairly dry and very beathable in rain   the zipper leaked water into the tent  it is pretty heavy but over all for the money good pretty good      
1521,5.0,                       we have used this tent twice  and so far  so good   the first time it was my husband and i along with our   and    year old kids   there was definitely room to spare   the second time i went camping with my college girlfriends   we fit a queen and full air mattress inside  two moms  two kids  and we were all pretty spread out   it s a pretty basic tent  nothing fancy   but the price is right  it s super easy to put up  and it is a great option for family camping   i would absolutely recommend to others      
1522,5.0,                       a great tent      not sleeping   adults   maybe  spooning    lol  but it will fit   std queen air matresses easy set up too      
1523,5.0,                       i have used this tent dozens of times and never had any issues   the setup is simple  fabric is strong   i have never gotten wet   i have slept four  ft men in this on one occasion  don t ask   but it is large on the inside      
1524,5.0,                       to be honest  it still has not gone through a rain test  however  the fact of the matter is that it seems like a really decent tent especially considering the low price   love it      
1525,5.0,                       this is the perfect tent for a casual user  i can t speak to how it would hold up for a more serious camper  but after using it a few times a year  i m very happy with it  it could sleep three people but there would be very little room for anything else  as it is  it hold two people and their gear very comfortably  i knew that going in and was not disappointed  but if you actually want to sleep   people and not have to keep your stuff sitting outside  choose a four person tent      
1526,5.0,                       haven t tested it in the rain yet but it looks pretty strong and we ll built easy to setup and very roomy for     adolds depends on your gear     
1527,1.0,                       not a good tent  i bought it in june      didn t  use it until august on a two week camping trip  the zipper came apart  wouldn t stay closed  now i can t return it  time limits up it s cheaply  made  so i m  stuck with it  they have your money  they don t care      
1528,4.0,                       the tent does what it says  its easy to set up and good quality and kept us dry  however in yellowstone where we camped it got unexpectedly cold  like   f    degree celsius  and the large ventilation is great for warm summer evenings but in near freezing conditions this tent is absolutely not appropriate  the vents are way too big and you will have a cold flow on you the whole night  we literally almost froze because it was so cold in the tent  no difference between outside and inside temperature  so if the nights are cold where you camp another tent would be a better choice      
1529,5.0,                       i thought that upgrading an extra foot or two would be a nice change of pace  from my  x  coleman tent  turns out   x  is almost a little too extravagant for one  i use a queen air mattress  but it s really more of a full size  and keep a large duffel in my tent with me and there is still plenty of room for more  easy set up  lots of cords to tie the rain fly down  and as always very waterproof  i d still seam seal the fly and the windows in case of a driving rain  but the tent held up great      
1530,5.0,                       we took this camping over easter weekend in florida  it rained on and off for our entire saturday and the inside of this tent was bone dry the whole time  only water bugs that got in was from when we would open the door to get in and out  good price as well  saw this for nearly double the   in stores  worth the money  you should buy this tent      
1531,5.0,                       easy setup     
1532,5.0,                       very good for its price  i bought a   person tent  but wasn t sure if it ll actually be big enough for   adults  turns out it is  this is a pretty good basic tent overall  doesn t come with tarp  we bought one separately      
1533,5.0,                       i bought this for field school  i did buy some coleman s weather proofing coating also because the reviews mentioned i would be best to purchase it  when  it rained nothing got wet  it had plenty of space inside for my stuff  pretty easy to assemble     
1534,1.0,                       i ordered this product for my husband as a valentine s day gift  we are horrible with surprises so we opened our gifts early  today we planned to go camping and while setting up we realize that the cord linking the poles came broken right out of the box  i was devasted  this was our first time camping in over   years   needless to say  we returned home      
1535,5.0,                       had one that unfortunately became damaged in storage  got another because it s good for one person  at least normal sized people  no way two adults wound squeeze in with any other gear  great tent and good price  one recent trip it poured hard overnight and didn t leak a drop      
1536,5.0,                       usually tents are awful to put back in the bag neatly and correctly but this tent is just as easy to put away as it is to put up  i am beyond satisfied with my coleman tent      
1537,2.0,                       a portion of one of the rods was cracked   i checked to see if all the parts were there but didn t notice the crack so when i set up the tent at the beach last weekend  i had to use and pray that it wouldn t break   had to pack up early because i was sure it would collapse     
1538,5.0,                       love it  fits a small air mattress and my bags  it s a bit snug for two people but would be amazing if you want to solo camp  it also fits inside my canopy perfectly     
1539,5.0,                       this thing is awesome  it easily fits   people and all your bags and shoes etc    people will fit if you guys are comfortable sleeping that close together  the top is open mesh and awesome for star gazing when weather permits  if not  the rain fly covers it all up and gives you privacy when you need it  use seam sealer or waterproofing just in case  it s just a smart thing to do  set up is super simple    posts    stakes and you re done in less than    minutes  it even comes with a little mat to place outside the door to leave your shoes on  this is a great purchase      
1540,4.0,                       this tent was a little small for me  i m        and my it was tight  easy to set up  good for light weekend camping  great for kids and backyard camping  i didn t experience any rain so i can t comment on its ability to be rain resistant or rain proof   i just need something a little bigger and thicker material to camp weeks at a time      
1541,1.0,                       i bought this tent for my vacations and when i get to the place    surprise missing one of the stick  very bad finished no way to secure on the floor  the tent fell on me twice  thanks god the place have a little store and i had to buy extra sticks and cut them  because it wasn t for my tent  to keep the tent half straight  i always make sure to buy a good brand   because i don t like this type of  surprise     i guess coleman is not         suppose to be easy setup and take me two days to sleep with half of the tent up       
1542,5.0,                       it s evident that a lot of thought has been put into the design  based on the design of the rainfly  entrance door  pockets  etc   overall something that is compact for traveling  and reliable to set up when needed      
1543,4.0,                       really great tent  went on a camping trip in the mountains and it held up in the rain for awhile but it did start seeping through the seems a little so i do recommend buying a seem sealer  it got around    at night too and i woke up freezing so its not good for colder weather unless you have a super warm sleeping bag      
1544,5.0,                       oh this was a great buy  i went on a trip to the city of rocks in nm and my tent did fantastic  we had high winds and an unexpected rain storm on our first night and this tent held up its no issues  i hardly even noticed it was raining because the tent didn t move and i had no leaks  i also had another person with me and she was   ft  in and i m  ft   in and we still had space for another person plus all of our stuff and two plastic totes   i would definitely recommend if your going on a hike or camping trip      
1545,5.0,                       used this twice so far to hike and camp out  easy set up for a novice like me  keeps the dew ground mositure out  we also have the four person tent and the first time out it thunderstormed and poured rain all night  we were dry and it wasn t a humid situation inside the tent  either  that s why i bought this  for solo or two person hiking  definitely recommend      
1546,4.0,                       this tent did amazing i purchased the only con i have to say is the zipper on the doorway kept getting caught on the zipper flap  not a big deal but very annoying when on hand is occupied holding a flash light and you re one handed will update once it is used when it is raining     
1547,5.0,                       the coleman   person dome tent is a   star tent  i took this tent on my   day camping trip to bear canyon lake in arizona  the tent did great in rain   hail for almost  hrs everyday going into the evening   i didn t weather proof it before i left for my trip  i would highly recommend this tent to anyone      
1548,4.0,                       great tent  purchased this because i needed a quick and cheap solution  stayed out and dry in    degree rainy weather for   days straight in the texas piney woods   very impressed something this cheap in price held up so well     
1549,5.0,                       i did t even look at instructions and was able to put this together in like   minutes   i had a helper but could see that   person could do it just as easy  it s a great size  haven t tried it out yet but looks great        
1550,5.0,                       we took the   person sundome tent to acadia and spent   days  the tent held up perfectly through the last night of rain  we put a queen air mattress inside and had about   ft on one side left for gear  it was tight but exactly what we needed  if you want more room with an air mattress  would recommend the   person tent      
1551,5.0,                       awesomeness tent  this is my first tent and it is a phenomenon tent   it rained saturday night and we did not get drop of rain inside and the rest of my friends tent were either got rain inside or was a fail they had to sleep in the car but i was amaze how it held up so good with the wind and pouring   great product i would      reccomend anyone who wants a high quality product         
1552,5.0,                    la carpa es ligera  resistente  f cil de armar  se aprecia resistente  tiene bolsillos interiores bastante  tiles  la ventilaci n es apropiada  me gusto la compra y pr ximamente la voy a usar en un campamento de pesca         
1553,4.0,                       iv e had the tent for almost three months and it s been on five trips so far  the tent seems to be holding up good minus the fact that one of the poles bungee cords broke after my last trip   the one other complaint   tho minor   the door zipper gets caught on the door flap when zipping the door closed      
1554,5.0,                       i recently bought a couple of these  and think they re a great deal for the cost  they set up fast and have great ventilation  they also have a lot of little extra features   like net pockets on each side to put your keys  cell phone  or whatever  a center hook ring to hang a light  even a little  door mat  to leave your shoes before you go in      
1555,5.0,                       two people can put up in      minutes including the rain cover  queen air mattress will fit turned sideways otherwise zipper was hard to get to  easy to get back into bag even for us impatient folks   three people would be pushing it unless the third is a small child      
1556,5.0,                       had some last minute changes to our trip  and had to buy this the day before and get it shipped to my friend s house  we were hoping that it would hold up and come with all the parts  and it did very easy set up  small and light for transportation  we encountered a bit of rain  and it held up fine  but we haven t used it in very heavy rain so i cannot attest to the tent s functionality in that case  it gets really hot in the sun  but i think any tent would in     degree  tennessee humidity  haven t used it in any extreme setting easily fits   adults for    bucks  it s a nice  usable tent for warmer outdoor usage  would recommend if you re just starting out camping or just need something that will provide you basic shelter      
1557,5.0,                       my    year old daughter used this on a camping trip with friends  she was able to set this up with a friend and there was enough room for two of them and their personal belongings  it packs up pretty small and it s light to carry      
1558,5.0,                       this is the first tent for our family  it was very easy to assemble and put back in the bag   it was easy enough for me and my   year old to assemble by ourselves   i had my wife help me put it back and fold into the bag   it was spacious enough three people  i think four people would be a bit of a stretch      
1559,4.0,                       easy set up and take down  roomy inside  and seems relatively durable   the tent is remarkably light  but is a bit too bulky for a backpack  the only thing i found wanting was that it comes with a cheap  zippered bag for storage  rather than a draw string or compression bag made from the same good material as the tent      
1560,5.0,                       used this tent on colorado elk hunt  overnight temps dropped to    degrees and    inches of snow fell   used a small tarp that kept most snow sliding away  it did not get crushed by snow and slept perfectly dry  i would not recommend you do that but i thrived      
1561,5.0,                       this is a great tent  super easy to put up and seems very sturdy  have not had it out in bad weather yet so can t speak to that       
1562,5.0,                       what a great tent  my son went camping for the second time with this tent  they expected heavy rain fall that lasted over   hours  the tent was completely dry on the inside  truly weather resistant      
1563,3.0,                       good tent  super easy set up  but it s quite small   i m     and i just barely fit in it diagonally   don t think i could have gotten another person in with me  unless it was on top  lol    anyway  it s well constructed but i really don t see how you can fit   adults in it  certainly   children   good tent otherwise      
1564,5.0,                       we got this tent for my daughter and she loves it  it s a great size for her and a friend to play in  she hasn t tried it outside since it s still cold out   but it works great inside  i would definitely recommend it  it s bigger than i thought it would be from the pictures      
1565,5.0,                       my boyfriend and i bought this tent for a cross country national parks trip and we are so happy we did   we arrived at most of the campsites late at night and with the help of two headlamps  we were able to set this tent up with ease  even after never setting it up before   all of the parts pack up easily as well   we also purchased a tarp footprint to go under it and i am very glad we did   it helped keep us dry and the bottom of the tent clean   would purchase again      
1566,5.0,                       at first the shape of the tent looks a little odd  the door is on the long side which seemed unusual  but it was a very functional and practical piece of equipment  lightweight  easy to put up and put away  not even   minutes for each task   fits a queen size air mattress snugly  great air vent on the back side  originally i meant this to be for myself alone  but my camp mate forgot the cover of his own tent and we had to bunk together  plenty of space  it rained and the tent didn t leak even though i hadn t treated it yet  it looks slightly different from the photo  not that this is a bad thing  very pleased with this purchase  awesome value and quality      
1567,5.0,                       this is exactly what i was looking for   coleman is known for the quality products  and this one lives up to their name   it s the perfect size  and keeps you dry   it s a snap to put together  and looks good too   it is a little difficult to get it to fold up to the size of the bag  but all tents are like that   it s hard to get the air out and get it just right  but regardless  this tent works just fine  and holds up well too   i ve had mine for a while now  and it still looks brand new      
1568,5.0,                       great tent for summer camping   my wife and i are newbie campers and this tent is very easy to set up and disassemble   we did supplement the included stakes with some screw in stakes from w   m r   but other than that  it s a great little tent      
1569,5.0,                       if you re looking for a small tent yet with ample space  this is the one to get imo  i went with a   person tent for the extra space  it s very easy to setup  and you can conceivably put it together by yourself if you re camping alone      
1570,5.0,                       great value  coleman has always been the go to for my family s tents and quality hasn t suffered over the years at all  we make use of this   person tent at least       times a year  stitching has held up  zippers haven t broken  the material itself is as tough as you would expect  and i say this as someone who sometimes is too lazy to put it back in the bag  far too often it has weathered the outside conditions while i ve delayed cleaning and storing it  so knowing that it spends at least   month a year outside  whether at a campsite or in the yard  it s holding up fantastically      
1571,5.0,                       bought this for a   day camping trip  good for one person and gear  had pack  gun  boots  air mattress  and jump box in tent  easy to setup      
1572,5.0,                       easiest tent to put up ever   i ve put up plenty and did this one in the dark in    degree weather in less than    minutes  easy to take down and like all tents don t easily fit in the original packaging but still fantastic     
1573,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          pictures from the leak shown here  luckily had paper towels to soak up   oz  worth of water so we could bailout our tent  never  thought i d say that  also the rain fly was seeping through  dripping down onto the mesh walls and sprinkling us on each drip  a shame i ve only used it once and can t return it due to the time i ve had it      
1574,5.0,                       took this tent to sequoia national park still in the box   easy set up   rained the first night and no leaks   even without sealing   not designed for colder climates  but fulfilled our needs perfectly   saw about five of the same tents throughout the campground      
1575,3.0,                       purchased the tent in december for summer camping trips  it s a   person tent but it s good for   person   love the light weight  easy setup and compact size when packed up   first time using the tent and it rained   we got puddles at all   corners  looks like the water came from the seams where the green tent fabrics meet the gray base tarp   we didn t use the tent till june  so the return period is closed on amazon   not sure if coleman could help us      
1576,1.0,                       the tent is easy to set up  if anything is touching the walls of the tent  water will enter the tent  the cord in the pole broke the second time we used the tent      
1577,5.0,                       i bought this for a camping trip with friends  i wanted something easy to pitch myself  this was the perfect tent and was very good quality for the price  looking forward to using this for years      
1578,5.0,                       great little tent  fit me inside        with plenty of room for all my gear  not quite tall enough to more than crouch though  but could change clothes fine inside  good air flow  didn t get too hot in the    degree weather   and no bugs got inside  also kept dry in the rain  easy to set up too one small problem however  the stakes you put in the ground bend very easily  i was somewhere with harder earth but still think they bent too easily and i had to be gentle with them  not a big deal though and there were extra might be a little cramped inside if you have   people though  probably be fine if they were smaller people or you didn t have much gear with you      
1579,5.0,                       just returned from   day camping trip  this tent performed very well  however if you thing you are going to sleep   people in this forget it i had me   dogs and a single inflatable mattress and was quite comfortable  it would sleep two people  comfortably   no leaking in rain and very well made and easy to set up and tear down      
1580,3.0,                       nice tent  worked great  but i would recommend you only by it for yourself     people is very tight   when your   ft   inches  i did not fit in there very well at all      
1581,4.0,                       spent a week in this tent and it was perfectly sized for one cot  plus a fair amount of gear  it was tall enough to dress easily  not full standing height   it was also decent for my wife and i on a queen sized air mattress  it kept me dry in a light sprinkle  and was nice and cool through some hotter conditions  good value for a car camper      
1582,5.0,                       very nice tent  quality material and stitching      
1583,5.0,                       really a great tent  i was surprised on how easy it was to build for the kids  roomy and waterproof  no problems with it at all      
1584,5.0,                       this tent is easy and quick to set up  very good quality  small but roomy for two even with backpacks inside  fits my needs  just what i expect from coleman      
1585,5.0,                       perfect comfortable space for   people i used on a camping trip through different weather conditions and it worked well in all of them  inclusive one day was extremely windy but the tent could hold it the friend that was traveling with me will buy the same tent for herself after seeing what it can handle totally recommend      
1586,4.0,                       survived a monsoon rain with minimal leaks  did leak in the corner but i feel like that was more due to the tarp  and was hard to put everything back in the bag after disassembling but overall for the price is a good tent      
1587,4.0,                       there are no zip up flaps on the sides  under the white part of the rain fly   the slightest wind and it will be drafty  not for cool or cold camping trips  fits   full size air mattresses and one cot  that makes it comfortable for    anymore will get tight  the center is the only thing at it maximum height  a foot off center  you will have to start leaning if you are tall  the floor is good with no tears from the cot feet on very soft soil  keeping that in mind  it was still a very good quality tent      
1588,5.0,                       excellent little tent      
1589,5.0,                       i had no experience camping   i purchased this tent for my son s boy scout trip after reading the positive reviews   it took me longer than expected  about    min   to set it up but that was owing to my inexperience rather than the instructions or the manufacture of the tent components   i did take other reviewers  advice and sprayed the tent with kiwi heavy duty water repellent  another excellent product    i m glad i did because it rained the whole weekend   we stayed dry   i liked the various pockets and air flaps   this is a well designed tent  easy to set up  and easy to pack in its bag      
1590,1.0,                       my husband and i purchased this tent for a weekend rally  it poured during the event  and though there was about     cup of water on the floor we stayed relatively dry thanks to our air mattress that kept us off the ground  the issue was with the pole string breaking before we ever got the tent home  thankfully it only the rain cover and it was after the rain had ended  built we were very disappointed with the quality of the tent      
1591,5.0,                       love this tent  we ve taken it on a few backpacking trips and my boyfriend doesn t seem to mind hauling it up  it is very tall  it wouldn t even fit in my   l pack  but his pack is much bigger than mine  it is easy to set up  easy to pack up  when we took the rain fly off  we were able to watch the perseids meteor shower through the screen  the  front mat  isn t attached to the tent  but it does come with stakes to stake it into the ground  not a deal breaker  just an interesting feature      
1592,5.0,                       really liked this tent  easy to set up and take down  for the price it was perfect for my needs and one other person  only issue is the zipper on the door sticks a bit but again it was not even     so very pleased with the overall quality  recommend      
1593,5.0,                       this tent is amazing  set it up in the dark  we had an old one that had like   poles or so and was a pain  so we feel pampered now lol we use it for two adults  two children and two dogs      
1594,4.0,                       it s easy to set up and tear down  it has a nice rain guard thing so the window doesn t get too wet  the only thing that i didn t particularly care for is its weight but this is more of a car camping kind of tent so i shouldn t be complaining      
1595,5.0,                       even though the rain cover covered the windows on the side i would have preferred an additional zipper to seal windows all in all excellent tent very pleased      
1596,5.0,                       great tent   we fit a full sized air mattress with our gear and a lot of room to spare on a weekend camping trip   this tent could accommodate a queen mattress   we were stuck is a major thunderstorm with a steady rain and occasional downpours and stayed completely dry   i like the floor material which is thick and strong   extremely quick and easy for one person to assemble   this tent is a great value      
1597,5.0,                       great tent  i used this throughout yellowstone  tetons  and along a few passes in the rockies in mid july  this tent vents well  the rain fly worked flawlessly  and i had no water getting into the tent even through the ground was soaked  the little door mat seemed silly at first  but worked very well and helped keep the interior clean  setup is easy  read the instructions    the rain fly is not too hard to setup either  though they could provide better instructions as there are several velcro straps that need to be secured  the tent stakes they provide are ok for soft soil  but will leave you frustrated on rocky soil  if you plan to camp on hard rocky terrain  purchase some pointed  nail like  tent stakes  you need   i would not consider this a   person tent  it will sleep   adults comfortably  the sleeping space is close to a queen size mattress  i used a full size air mattress   with gear misc stuff this tent would get quite crowded with more than   the only gripe i have with this tent is the durability of the top fabric arches  the top most arch has started ripping  i don t know if i simply had a defect in my tent  or if that specific spot is a weak spot  it is the tent fabric that encases the top most pole at the peak of the arch       
1598,5.0,                       tent fit a double air mattress with room for a twin air mattress or two people in sleeping bags  most imporatantly  it keep everything inside dry during a torential downpour that lasted two hours  the tubbed flooring has a plastic rubberized feel to it which was exactly what was needed  no leakage from the floor  nor the front door or any seams my only down side is i didnt realize how cold it would be at night and this tent is more for warm weather because of the two permanently vented windows easy set up  too  did it myself in under ten minutes i give this tent   stars cause it was everything it claimed to be      
1599,4.0,                       nice little tent  very easy for one person to setup in a few minutes  lots of ventilation  the whole roof is essentially a mesh screen underneath the rainfly  nice little vent near the floor on the rear of the tent  i haven t been through any nasty weather with this  but it felt secure in some wind gusts and i would be willing to try a rainstorm with it this may be my own fault  but when a tent says  two person   don t expect it to fit two people  i m      and i could barely fit sleeping diagonally      
1600,5.0,                       light for a tent that isn t for backpacking  great for my son and i to go camping  designed well  to have some room to move around i recommend only using it for   people      
1601,4.0,                       a  four man tent  is quite a stretch  but it went together easily and kept the two of us dry during a long steady overnight rain storm  this was my first camping trip in many years and it was great not to look like a novice while my friend and i put the tent up   the lip at the doorway keeps the water out  but does make the entrance and exit a bit challenging for this    year old  but of course  you are not going in and out of the tent a lot  and i was glad that the water stayed outside because of the lip  this is a great value  and i recommend it to anyone wanting a comfortable two person tent for casual camping      
1602,5.0,                       we wanted a roomy tent for two  so we purchased the   person tent   it was so easy to set up and take down   it all actually fits back in the bag if you fold it back up the exact way it came      
1603,5.0,                       been using this tent for   years now  and it never lets me down   good ventilation  easy to assemble and disassemble  plenty of space   has   pockets for your little stuff  and a zipper on the front in case you want to run an electric cord   no fly is nice for sleeping under the stars without the mosquitoes taking a tithe of blood  and with fly is good for a wind and rain break      
1604,5.0,                       i took it out for a veterans camping trip   it held up to its previous reviews  it is spacious for two with room in the middle to keep your gear  easy setup and take down      
1605,5.0,                       so easy to assemble  lightweight and very roomy   we put a queen air matress and a blow up chair in there with room left over       
1606,5.0,                       we have grown up on the coleman brand for everything outdoors  this tent is the perfect size  it is very roomy  and can fit a queen size air mattress  for those of us with bad backs   it is very durable and easy to put up  we had it put together in about      minutes   we love the extra compartments and the removable roof cover  so you can get more fresh air  or simply star gaze      
1607,5.0,                       bought as gift  looks cute  friend likes it    i don t really know a lot about tents but they have used it several times already      
1608,4.0,                       this tent is almost perfect  but the integrity of the tent doesn t hold up too well against strong wind  the poles facing the wind tend to flex  collapsing part of the tent  i was able to tie them together and this fixed it  otherwise  the tent is very good and easy to set up      
1609,3.0,                       it s your typical coleman tent  you couldn t use this tent when it s too cold out as the mesh siding would let in too much air  but it s the perfect tent for a family outing at the campground  it offers plenty of space and has convenient pockets to hold your valuables  set up was easy and break down was even easier  this is the perfect buy for a quick camping trip     
1610,4.0,                       good tent  about a   minute easy one person setup  brakes down small enough to strap under or onto a backpack  good ventilation  large enough for   and a couple packs  or one with a good amount of gear  features in description work as described  used seam sealer and some water proofing spray and it held up fine for a   hour rain and a couple sprinkles over a weekend  wish   windows had zipper covers included instead of just mesh so setting up rain guard wouldnt be a must      
1611,4.0,                       i really liked the tent  i bought the   person size  i was able to fit two twin air mattresses and still had almost half the twin airbed room left  it was the my first time buying a tent  it was very easy to setup  only took    mins  the only thing i did not like is the stitches between the main  door  zip and the tent started breaking and the hole kept getting bigger each time i used the zip      
1612,5.0,                       awesome tent   my husband and son needed this for boy scout camp and it was in their words  awesome    my husband said this tent went up in   minutes  no fuss at all   it has great viewing for the evening to look up at the stars  and is all around very well made   they were able to put two cots on each side of the tent and still had room in the middle and it was nice to store things beneath the cots   the tent i am reviewing is the   person tent   would recommend      
1613,5.0,                       this is the second time i purchased this exact dome tent   my girlfriend and i love it  plenty of space for   people and keeps dry during heavy rain falls  i lived in this tent for   month on an island in nicaragua  so i am pretty sure that qualifies me as a good   honest reviewer        
1614,4.0,                       i have used my tent out in the desert a few times now out in the california desert and it has worked well so far  it sets up quick and hasn t started falling apart yet  so it has that going for it note that this is listed as a   person tent  by   person tent  coleman means   single sleeping bags side to side tight  and none of your gear  i would consider this tent big enough for one person and their stuff to be comfortable  maybe two if you like to get cozy      
1615,5.0,                       we absolutely love this tent  light weight  easy set up  very roomy  held up amazing in wind  and easy to re pack in carrying bag     
1616,5.0,                       so far  this has been an excellent purchase  we had some issues with the package drop off with fedex  they dropped it at the wrong house  and the neighbors kept it  of course  there was no way to prove that  but amazon replaced it after speaking with fedex  they were so helpful  i ordered this on a deal of the day  and they even managed to replace it without having to charge me original price  thanks amazon     as far as the product goes  my husband and son have used it  and it s been wonderful  i ll add pics off camping adventure soon      
1617,5.0,                       as an inexperienced camper  i have been very pleased with this purchase the tent is small  very compact  and incredibly light   i bought it for my    year old son  and we had no difficulty setting it up in less than ten minutes   first night in the tent was surprisingly dry and completely bug free only minor gripe is that the stakes that come with the tent are very small  but if you purchase the coleman tent kit  that i did as suggested by amazon  that fixes that minor issue excellent value  great tent  great suggestion by amazon      
1618,5.0,                       i am looking forward to my first camping trip   i was so excited when i received my tent that i set it up in my bedroom to test it out   i was able to set the tent up in about    minutes   remember  i m a novice and have never set up a tent before   i m sure it would take other  more experiences folks  a shorter time   i laid out my things inside and settled into it for the night   it is airy and nice   i would highly recommend   i can t wait to get out in this tent      
1619,5.0,                       this was a birthday present for my    year old grandson and my present was the hit of the day   he set it up that day with ease and camped in his back yard a few nights later and now i m the grandmother of the year   thank you for a great tent      
1620,4.0,                       easy to set up   downworth the money     
1621,5.0,                       bought this years ago and finally used it  takes   minutes to set up  works well  provided adequate shade and it looks nice      
1622,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i m in my tent now  has been raining for   days now  tent is dry on the inside  love this tent  real easy to set up  took me    mins  i would highly recommend       
1623,4.0,                       love the size and color of this tent  the problem i have with it  is the side windows do not have zipper closures  they are wide open screens  the rain guard  covers them but i wish you could close them      
1624,5.0,                       great tent  my   year old and i set it up  very easy  we camped in it for   nights in michigan s upper peninsula  fit me and my two boys very comfortably  withstood some pretty heavy rain one night with no leakage  other days the temps shifted between    degrees during the day and    degrees fahrenheit at night  very minimal condensation  this was a last minute prime day deal  and i m so glad i bought it      
1625,4.0,                       love this tent  especially for the price  it is definitely bigger than your standard two person tent  such as a eureka   person tent     x    could easily hold two people and some of their belongings   so it was much roomier than expected  which is awesome  plus i love how the bottom is actually made of tarp  what you see in grey there  so you don t have to lay down another tarp on top of that  the only thing is that there are two mesh windows underneath the rain fly that can t be closed off  as well as one on the backside  so the tent wouldn t be as warm as others  just bring a a blanket or two and some sweaters and you ll be fine  definitely a sturdy tent that s easy to set up  so all in all a great beginners tent  especially for the price      
1626,5.0,                       we have not used it yet but from what i can tell the tent is well made and sturdy   a good tent for the price and very roomy for what i bought it for     old people who values their space   hahaha     
1627,3.0,                       i have used this tent   times  for a total of    nights on the last trip  we noticed two seams had a small tear in there  our new air mattress was slightly larger and mad the tent very tight  this is not a   person tent  you have enough room for   people to sleep next to each other  and maybe   inches before you hit th side of the tent  and its only about   ft long  no room to put belongings or anything else really  solid tent  never got wet  kept bugs out but i would only recommend if only one person will stay we thought  wed only be sleeping in it and it didnt matter  but it did  too small for two people      
1628,5.0,                       can t beat the price  we have the   person tent and it s been on   trips so far and it seems to be holding up pretty well   we haven t experienced any significant precipitation but have used this last weekend when it was a little cooler and the morning dew our breath condensed on the inside of the canopy didn t drip into our tent and brushed down the side just fine without leaving the area wet    as far as i could tell  pretty happy with the purchase      
1629,5.0,                       this is perfect for us to put a full sized air mattress inside and have room for our packs and whatever i haven t tested it unprotected in the rain so i can t comment on how well it handles that but it is quick and easy to set up and has great air flow i wouldn t use this for four people unless they were children   i also wouldn t try to use this tent in cold environments as the inner vents in the top can t be sealed with a zipper only by pulling down rain shield to cover it but for what it is i love it      
1630,5.0,                       it took a while to get the installation first time but works really well and it s easy once you know how it will be done  stable and has enough room for      adults      
1631,3.0,                       small hole when arrived but kept it because we were going camping the next day  did not know it had a hole until it started raining for two straight days  never went camping again and it sits in the basement     
1632,5.0,                       but not sure how long it will last  we used it for the first time and notice the seams or knitting is starting to not look as tight  not sure if that s the design but maybe it s been stored in the warehouse too long  not sure      
1633,3.0,                       this tent was super easy to put up  my husband was busy unloading so i decided to try it on my own  i was done in about   minutes or so  really the only down side is the windows  not enough for hot or humid weather  little to no breeze even t night except from top  i wish the door opened with a screen or a back window for circulation  this tent is better used in cold or really windy weather  i felt like i would suffocate in the humid night air  great as second  storage  tent     
1634,5.0,                       home sweet home i set it up on one site and then wanted to move picked it up and crossed the road with it to another site  light enough for one person to move and roomy enough inside for        
1635,4.0,                       i thought that maybe this   person tent  very well reviewed and very affordable as well  would be big enough for my wife  two young daughters  and myself   if we didn t have anything else in the tent it might have been   more realistically i might consider this a    or even   person tent  especially if you want to put any thing in it with you  like your backpacks  stuff sacks  etc   that said  it s a quality product  and very well made for the price   it s sturdy  and easy to put up by two people  but i think one person could probably manage it as well      
1636,4.0,                       i used the coleman sundome for the first time during an august camping trip  the tent is made of good quality material and is easy to assemble  it rained the second night of the trip  but the tent remained dry  the tent also accommodated a six foot long air mattress  but you would have to be good friends with your  tent buddy  in order to feel comfortable sleeping in what is described as a   two person  tent   otherwise this coleman tent is a good value at a very good price      
1637,4.0,                       it is nice tent and was able to set it up in the living room to ensure everything checks out like no tear or missing part  i am      and can stand comfortably in it without kneeing when inside the tent  it is about   x   around and maybe     tall in the middle of tent  would recommend to put tarp under the tent as the floor feels thin enough something under may tear into it  i do feel it is worth money for occasional camping  the fabric on the tent feel similar to north face or columbia rain wind jacket      
1638,5.0,                       worked like a charm it rained hard and was cold and i was completely dried     
1639,5.0,                       pulled this thing out of the box and used it the same night we got it  i was able to set it up with minimal help from a   year old in less than    minutes  take down was just as easy  it rolled up nicely and fix perfectly back into the bag which is often a problem with tents  can t imagine getting a much better product at this price      
1640,5.0,                       high quality  spacious and robust  accidentally planned a camping trip while to weather was raining and windy but this tent endured it  we were worried at first thinking about the waterproof and the winds  but some how the night went well  although the camping was the bust but the tent was really helpful  i would absolutely recommend it for anyone who is looking for a   person tent      
1641,3.0,                       this is a great tent  however i did wreck it on a trip recently by driving a pole through the sleeve it runs through i can still use the tent but there has to be a better way to support the poles other than the sleeve  just upgraded to the   man version for my next trip    hope it lasts longer than   camp outs      
1642,5.0,                       roomy  good size  nice quality  the first one i was sent had a tiny hole in the roof on the seam  but no bugs got in  they sent me a new one real quick  does good in the cold  bring extra layers if you re dipping below   s  breezy if you take the rain cover off  love it and spend extra for the blue cause its rad      
1643,5.0,                       this is a very nice little tent  i haven t had to take it anywhere wet yet  but we took it camping a few weeks ago and had no issues  setup is quick and easy  there are actually instructions printed on a large tag attached to the tent bag  so you won t ever lose them   and breaking down the tent was just as fast  we fit   adults on a queen mattress and     yr old in here with all our bags  but that was pretty tight  if you re going to put   adults in here  i don t think the mattress would work out      
1644,5.0,                       impressive  i was concerned being the price point was so cheap  great tent  we used seam sealer and it stayed bone dry after two good rains  we bought this and a colman three man  both were great  i would say this is not a   man tent though  we did get a queen air mattress in it  it is okay for two adults      
1645,5.0,                       i love this tent  it s a perfect two person tent and the set up is so quick and easy  if you have two people and stuff with you  i ll admit there s not a ton of room  if you re sleeping alone in the tent  you ll have sufficient room for your stuff  but if there are two people  there s not much room for packs  i did just do a trip with a friend and we slept with our packs at our feet  which was fine for us but maybe not for everyone  if you re car camping  though  and can leave your stuff in your car  you ll be plenty comfortable      
1646,5.0,                       great tent  very unexpected for the price  was able to withstand several strong rains without any leak  which was surprising given the affordable price  other tents that i got for the same price always leaked      
1647,1.0,                       ours didn t come with any stakes    we opened the box indoors to check everything  and sure enough  no stakes      
1648,5.0,                       this inexpensive tent will make camping fun      
1649,5.0,                       my kids love it  we were able to assemble it in a half hour or less  the  rain shield  came in handy as it was beginning to rain just as we were finishing setting the tent up  all the parts seem sturdy and high quality  so we give this tent an  a        
1650,5.0,                       i think i purchased this for      so at that price  you can t beat it  also held up pretty well in rain    after two nights of steady rain  it started to leak a little at the bottom seam in one corner  but it wasn t anything massive      
1651,2.0,                       i set the tent up inside  the next day one of the hooks  to attach onto the poles  had already ripped  cheap material  thankfully  my skillful fiance knows how to sew      
1652,1.0,                       i uses this tent twice and the wind ripped the rainfly   the company told me they do not warrant weather effects   this is a tent that is intended to withstand at least reasonable weather   when asked about a replacement rainfly they told me they do not make a replacement rainfly for this tent  so this brand new tent is now useless   never buy coleman again     
1653,5.0,                         were bought  my sisters got a little wet inside and the wind pulled up one end of the tent  mine was right beside hers and not a thing happened to mine  nice tents  just wish i would have ordered at least both a foot taller and a few feet wider      
1654,4.0,                       pros  it is easy to set up and take down  i got the   person size and you could easily fit   or more cons  it is not a cold weather tent  water seeped through the bottom of the tent into the blanket we used as a cushion     
1655,5.0,                       i really only needed a   person tent  but i like to have extra room  this was great  it was easy to set up  i had an issue with the rain fly on top but once i figure out the orientation it was a breeze to set up      
1656,5.0,                       received product super fast and just in time to take on camping trip  tent is very roomy  i m           lbs  and i had plenty of room to share with someone else  easy to assemble     less than    min   lightweight and small package  but not small enough or light enough for a backpacker  overall  great tent  rain cover kept me dry during a weekend of camping in the rain  can t beat this deal     way worth the      something i paid for it  remember  this is easily a five star tent if your only paying what i paid     less than      if your looking for super light weight and tiny package  look elsewhere for more money      
1657,5.0,                       this is a great product and larger than expected  i bought to use when camping with the gf  but accidentally brought it on the  boys  trip instead of my four man tent  against my will haha  i had to share it with my buddy since we were hours out  but  it fit two     men no problem  feels like it will hold up excellent in the wind as it was blowing     knots and it stayed perfectly upright as i slept      
1658,4.0,                       instructions tell me not to leave this tent set up for long periods of time  so i m going to do an experiment  mostly in the shade  i ll leave it up till it dies  like a homeless person would  i think it ll last at least   to   months all this is in honor of the ridiculous amount of homeless humans in my country    usa     
1659,5.0,                       took to burning man  did awesome  ended up cutting a big hole in it to add an a c unit  we really put it through the trenches and it survived  not sure how it would do in the rain now but haha  glad we got it      
1660,5.0,                       i ve taken it out when it was pouring raining hailing and it did amazing  great room and setup  would highly recommend      
1661,4.0,                       even after using the seem sealer it leaks a little bit  maybe they all do  i haven t purchased a tent in years  it s good enough i guess  keeps the mosquitos out so that is a huge plus      
1662,5.0,                       arrived quickly and as described  easy to set up and take down   husband had it done in no time at all  good quality and size  fit a queen size air mattress perfectly  with some room to spare for bags and changing  etc  excited to continue to use it      
1663,5.0,                       my wife and i take this tent    person  out as our summer lake tent  it fits us and our two medium sized dogs very comfortably  have had some windy nights in this tent and it withstood high winds pretty well  overall it s a great tent for the price  for recreational use in nice weather      
1664,4.0,                       tent was perfect for my husband daughter and i  had a queen mattress in it  but that took up most of the tent  had some windy conditions and the tent held up really well      
1665,5.0,                       so easy even a blonde who never camps can set it up   getting it all to fit back in the original bag is another story but whatevs      
1666,5.0,                       love the tent  not a hiking tent  unless you split the weight with someone  i used it on bicycle ride across georgia  waterproof  me and my bike fit it comfortably      
1667,2.0,                       i used this tent three times  and after taking it down the last time i noticed one of the poles had broken  i have had many tents before  and have another one i use regularly  but and have never seen a pole snap before  i might have gotten a lemon but i m not too happy about the quality      
1668,5.0,                       easy set up  easy pack up  fits   adults easily or three kids  snuggly  for a backyard sleepover  this was purchased for an    year olds birthday gift  meets expectations  coleman will not disappoint         
1669,4.0,                       it was very easy to set up even for a first time user  it really held up in windy conditions and was water resistant  however  overnight the bottom of the tent seemed to let the in  overall i would recommend this tent for campers who don t want to spend a lot of money and get a good quality product      
1670,4.0,                       i bought this tent a few weeks ago for a camping trip at crabtree meadows in the washington jefferson national forest in virginia with three friends  we got rained on quite a bit for about the first    hours  plus temperatures dipped down to just above freezing at night  this tent kept me and one of my buddies bone dry  i m not sure i d want to squeeze four people in there  but it was certainly comfortable with the two of us on a queen air mattress and a third person probably wouldn t have been too uncomfortable  but the big thing was that this tent kept us totally dry with no leaks whatsoever  my buddy even commented that he woke up the first night while the rain was coming down super heavy and he was feeling around the corners checking for leaks and there was nothing  the tent is easy to set up and break down and pack up  i absolutely recommend it  i give it just four stars only because there s no way i d want to put four people plus gear in there      
1671,5.0,                       very pleased with this tent  it is easy to set up as it only has three poles  two poles going across and one pole for the rain fly  some important things to note    when rain fly is not on  anyone can see right into the tent as the sides are mesh screens  this allows the tent to breathe very well  the thick plastic flooring of the tent comes up the sides about three inches and then seams off  this prevents water from coming in  the tent is six feet in the center so standing is not a problem at all  taking the tent down and packing it up is very easy  i did it by myself  everything fit in the original bag without much effort  just roll it up tight  i would suggest having two people to put it up  not      necessary but makes it much easier   tent is large inside  i was worried about purchasing a four man tent as they looked a bit small  i m glad i went with the six man  great purchase and i can t wait to use it again      
1672,5.0,                       bought this tent for my daughter who joined scouts bsa   its held up well so far  several campouts  and has kept her dry  dont expect the lightweight of a backpacking tent  it s light enough for a moderately sized    year old to carry on her own  however      
1673,5.0,                       i love this tent  easy to put up and take down  did not leak in rain  plenty of room for my queen air mattress  my gear and my dog  good ventilation  too      
1674,2.0,                       i have bought coleman branded tents before  as our tent needed to be replaces i came across this tent  with the reviews i thought it would be a great lighter tent than our four person tent  once i received the tent i did a dry test and it assembled quickly and everything worked fine  once i needed to actually use it for camping i was mistaken  it began raining a little bit and water began to seep through the ground and all across the stitching  hopefully they have fixed this since and others do not have to deal with this problem      
1675,5.0,                       my husband and i  who had never been camping  were able to put this together  by ourselves  on the first try  it rained that weekend too  and no water got into the tent      
1676,5.0,                       took me just    mins to put up and put down   easy to store as well and light weight for sure    roomy for what i need it for    fits me and my dog     lbs akita    and still got room         
1677,5.0,                       i got the   person tent and it was easy and fast to set up  holds well in light rain  was comfortable and easy to disassemble and put back     
1678,5.0,                       massive well made tent   so far just tried indoors with my   year old   will the backyard next weekend and go from there     
1679,5.0,                       this tent is very easy to setup and is an excellent quality  the first night i used it  it rained and not a single drop got in  the bottom is a built in tarp like material  back in boy scouts  we had to use a separate tarp  but not with this one      
1680,5.0,                       i love coleman tents   i bought this for my    year old son for backpackinging around after highschool graduation   we wanted a sturdy and reliable tent without spending a fortune   our family owns   coleman tents and the oldest is    years old and still in great shape and still being used   never had a problem in any weather  these tents are a great value      
1681,5.0,                       super easy to put together  even for beginning campers   very cozy for my wife and i  can t speak for the waterproofing since we havne t used in the rain yet  but so far works great      
1682,5.0,                       nice tent   we love it   used for three people and fit all of our stuff with room to spare   air moves through nicely for warm weather breezes   may not be for cold weather camping   love the waterproof bottom  i had to use a tarp under my older tent   great price      
1683,1.0,                       overall a nice tent  but quality control is lacking  one of the roof seams wasn t properly sewn and there is a     inch gap on the roof  didn t use until after the return window  would recommend setting up in the first few weeks to make sure everything is manufactured properly      
1684,5.0,                       this product was great  i got it for a camping trip with friends  i had not even taken it out of the box when i got to the campsite  was easy to put up and take down  it was just me in the tent and i had a folding cot in there and it there was plenty of room  i am looking forward to using it in the future      
1685,5.0,                       great little tent  i bought these for my daughters first camping supplies  they have used it and love them      
1686,5.0,                       there are a lot of diverse reviews for this tent  but i can tell you from experience of going camping for days on end in very bi polar weather  that this tent is absolutely awesome  very sturdy set up  high quality material  and plenty of room if you want a roomy  quality made   coleman is quality  and able to withstand just about anything tent  this is the tent for you not to mention a very simplistic set up   yet effective       
1687,5.0,                       we have purchased many products from coleman in the past and have loved them  this tent is no different and we love it  we got this tent because we were looking a mid size tent that had some room but was not too big and this is a great tent that fits our criteria  would definitely reccomend getting this tent and any coleman product      
1688,5.0,                       it s smaller than i was expecting but that s on me  i didn t pay close enough attention to the measurements  it s definitely enough room for one person  might be a little tight for two but it s just for me so i m happy with it      
1689,5.0,                       nice tent good size perfect for our father son conamping trip and my wife and daughters girl scout trips  seems good and sturdy hasn t been windy when we was in it but it did rain pretty good and us and our stuff stayed dry  so out the box is weatherproof atleast for now and seal it later  great product definitely reccomend      
1690,5.0,                       have only used it twice but has been an easy tent to pitch  roomy enough for my needs  have not experienced rain storms  yet      
1691,4.0,                       i lived in this for over four months on the street   it did really well   but during the last month the zipper started to go     
1692,5.0,                       this tent is great   perfect size for    as long as you don t add a blow up mattress   if you add a blow up mattress  i suggest a full or just a twin   easy set up  easy to take down by one person   great occasional use tent      
1693,5.0,                       very nice tent  worked great with a queen air mattress and and still had plenty of room for luggage  slept in it one night in pouring and did not get wet  we love this tent and couldn t be happier with it     
1694,5.0,                       this tent is so spacious  good quality  lightweight  and easy to setup i m pleased with my purchase      
1695,3.0,                       it worked well  stayed mostly dry during heavy rain  but arrived with misaligned stitching on part of the bottom that left a fist size hole   duct taped it and too lazy to return     
1696,4.0,                       bought this to have a bit more room when car camping   i normally use a  man because it has a really small footprint but i enjoyed being able to stand up when changing clothes in this one  and my back appreciated not being on the hard ground   bought a tarp to fit under as well      
1697,5.0,                       i ve only gone camping once when i was around    years old  after lots of research and looking at reviews i got this tent and honestly i am so happy i did  the set up was quick and easy  so was the clean up  it fit two adults no problem  i like the shade cover that comes with it and i like the little windows as well  that can be zipped up  the windows really help with ventilation   we kept them unzipped while hiking and swimming etc  and then at night we zipped them up  definitely would recommend this tent  not to mention i ordered it on a thursday and it same that sunday  so the shipping was really fast even though they said it would take about a week      
1698,5.0,                       perfect for two adults  leave the rain cover off for a perfect view of the stars  five minute easy set up and take down with nice carrying case  this well made tent lived up to the coleman reputation      
1699,5.0,                       this is a great tent for one or two people  four people would have trouble getting in there with any gear i have used this and similar coleman dome tents for years and they are easy for one person to set up and they will keep you dry  this color combo is very attractive  too      
1700,5.0,                       haven t taken it outside yet  just set it up and did an indoor camping with my toddler  it can be set up by one person it just takes a little longer      
1701,2.0,                       upon assembling this tent  there was a stitching design flaw which did not not allow me to slide the pole on one side all the way through  i had to cut stitching with a knife to rig the pole through  very disappointing  on a positive note  it rained hard that night and it held out the water very well      
1702,5.0,                       holy easy to set up  we are coleman fans  but our prior tent was too large  it was a  hand me down  and served it s purpose  but we needed something smaller  this is perfect size for   people  who bring a lot of stuff camping  we slept very comfortably  this is technically a   person tent  but it would be a little cramped with   adults   i would say maybe   adults and one child max  highly suggest this tent for   person camping      
1703,5.0,                       i love this tent  it s extremely high quality and easy to put together  i ve had it for a couple of years and it s held up really well      
1704,3.0,                       this tent is not suited for actual camping   it is difficult to setup  poles don t remain connected  and the rain cover is so thin  regardless of it being setup correctly  that it was close constantly went through out our camping trip      
1705,1.0,                       i bought this tent for a camping trip and received it the day before we camped which was perfect  but when we got to the camp grounds and set up the tent i noticed that there was bird poop on the tent   now i don t have a problem buying something used but when i m expecting my purchase to be new  because no where did it indicate that it was a used item  i don t expect it to have bird poop on it      
1706,5.0,                       i did a beta test in my back yard last night before a camp out in a week  it took my daughter and i about    minutes to put up the first time  i imagine it will get quicker with practice  plenty of room for my family of    six people would be tight  loved all the vents  nice and airy  no inclement weather so we will have to wait and see on that one      
1707,1.0,                       the tent ripped at the seams in three places the first theme we used it  not happy at all  all of the seams look terrible  the quality of the tent is so poor i would rate it zero stars if i could      
1708,5.0,                       i bought six of these tents in total to donate to my boy scout troop the tents are easy to set up  easy to take down  and pack up nicely  they re sturdy enough for a bunch of       year old boys to drag around various camp grounds   and the bright green color makes them easy to spot after a day of hiking      
1709,4.0,                       overall it worked well both times i ve used it  it was easy to set up and it had plenty of room for a queen size blow up mattress    backpacks  and our    lb dog  my only complaint is that there was a small section where the stitches had ripped out along the front zipper  i noticed this the very first time i used it   it isn t bad enough to justify sending it back  but it s the reason i gave   stars rather than        
1710,5.0,                       overall it s a great rent for the value  it s not the largest tent in the world but for two people this is really all you need unless you have tons of gear you want in the tent with you  not too heavy but the tent itself is great quality material      
1711,4.0,                       i love the size and the color  very easy and simple to put up  even by yourself which is what i did  fits me        and my dog    lbs  perfectly with extra room  although it wasn t very warm at night  that can be fixed with more blankets and such  definitely would recommend and buy again      
1712,3.0,                       took out for   days and the corner where the poles mounts into the ground   the fabric ripped apart  other then the corner ripping up after its first outing it was a good tent affordable and works great  the   person tent was big enough to not feel cramped  the zipper gets caught on the tents flap a lot so you have to be careful  would love to get a replacement for this       
1713,5.0,                       i was a little worried setting up a tent for the first time  but it was easy as pie  the tent has ample ventilatio  i cannot say whether it can withstand a rain since i was camping in dry summer  the only issue i found with the tent  as others have said  is that it may not be spacious enough for   people  it s perfect for   people      
1714,5.0,                       great little tent   it s of course a  one dude  his dog and his gear  tent  not a   person tent  but that exaggeration is industry wide   this tent is great to set up and withstood two nights of heavy florida rain      
1715,5.0,                       went camping using this tent the other night  and it started raining an hour after we set up and continued until we left the next day  this bag did a wonderful job of staying dry  even submerged in about   inches of water  in the morning  there was a little bit of water in the corners of the tent  but i was expecting worse  it is a good size  not too big but fit   people and a german shepherd just fine      
1716,1.0,                       tent ripped in   different spots on the seam when i used it the first time  never had a problem with any coleman tent before  also  the zipper is very flimsy  it came off the track when i tried to unzip the door best thing about the tent is easy setup and water resistant   it poured the night i camped unexpectedly      
1717,5.0,                       this tent was nothing short of awesome   bought it last minute for a weekend camping experience and i couldnt have been happier with it  worth every penny if you are looking to get this  you wont regret it  make sure though that you understand when it says   people    it means maybe   grown adults  aka  my fiance and i like space and it was perfect for the two of us      
1718,5.0,                       we used our tent for the first time last weekend  so easy to put up and take down  love the little door mat  so the inside of the tent doesn t get dirty  the windows are great and provide a nice breeze in the tent  inside is very roomy  for   people    luckily  it did not rain  so was unable to see if it kept us dry      
1719,4.0,                       this was a good quick cheap tent to buy in a pinch  my first tent and it worked out  i wouldnt say it can comfortably fit   people by any means   maybe   comfortably and   uncomfortably   but its nice and roomy for one person      
1720,4.0,                       easy to set up  wife took out and did get rained on   it did as well as any other tent we ve had before     
1721,4.0,                       we love this tent  perfect size for two people with some room in between  a few minor drawbacks compared to our previous tent  a small flap on the door sometimes interferes with the operation of the zipper  secondly  the air vents are located rather high and the fresh air does not circulate quite as freely through the tent on warmer nights  finally  our previous tent door had the hinge on the bottom instead of the side  the disadvantage with the side hinge is that the person on the opposite side of the tent has to gingerly step over the person on the opening side to get out of the tent at night i ll still give this   stars as it is a very well made product and suits our needs well      
1722,5.0,                       i m a tent person  and that tent has always been coleman  historically  i ve always purchased a   or   person sleeper  set up is always easy  and i know what i m up against every time  love the colors on this one  perfect for my little family         
1723,2.0,                       thought the tent would be a little more sturdy  did not like how the side windows are open with no option to close them  even to block out sun  entrance too high  easily tripped over  not level to ground  very light and flimsy  maybe it s supposed to be but not what i was looking for  also did not like how the zipper worked  kept getting stuck in material  will look for more heavy duty tent      
1724,5.0,                       set it up in the dark by myself the very first time and only took ten minutes  nice and tight and easy to pack away  got it on sale and hope that it s as waterproof as the larger version that i also own      
1725,5.0,                       i bought this tent for my family of three hoping it would be a little roomy  it is awesome  you can fully stand up in it if you are under      we had more than enough room  it only took us about    minutes to put it up  the directions are not the easiest to understand but it is pretty intuitive  we love our new tent      
1726,4.0,                       have used it several times camping  the ground vent and windows do not have closable flaps so this is definitely a   season tent  very cold when it was in the   fs at night   rainflies work well  floor is sturdy but made in a woven pattern so i doubt it would keep dry if the ground is wet  recommend using a tarp under the tent if you re concerned about rain  overall very easy set up and take down      
1727,5.0,                       bought this to use for car camping     queen size air mattresses fit fine   easy to set up   used on a dry weekend so i can t speak to the waterproof aspects  but we enjoyed it and the kids loved sleeping in it      
1728,5.0,                       we bought two of these and really like them   we camp often and these are quick and easy to set up   i like this model over some of the similar coleman tents because i can stand up inside   it folds up fairly small and lightweight   it has kept the rain out well  but is not really designed for very cold weather in that the design allows quite a bit of airflow from the outside  coming in from under the fly   fine if you have really warm sleeping bags though   i like that the plastic bottom comes up the side a few inches  because that helps keep the tent dry in the rain as well      
1729,5.0,                       i bought the coleman   person sundome tent for a   day motorcycle trip to se minnesota  it met or exceeded all of my hopes  very quick and easy to put up and take down  before the trip i was thinking i should have bought the next size down   person  but  with the threat of rain  i found that the  x     person held all of my gear and left me room to move around  i also appreciated the extra height  can t say enough good about it      
1730,5.0,                       i m a casual camper so this was perfect for going with my friends  it fits more than   if you squeeze people in and don t mind being a little crowded but it s a great tent and worth the money      
1731,5.0,                       arrived late but it is durable  it s been setup in the back yard for   months and has weathered many severe thunderstorms      
1732,5.0,                       very impressed with this tent  living in maine you never know what kind of weather you are gonna get so having a durable  waterproof tent is important  you can easily open and close the windows and front door without catching the tent itself in the zipper  a major pet peeve of mine   very happy with my purchase and plan on buying a second one when i replace the kids tent      
1733,5.0,                       used this tent many times since purchase and is a very good deal  never shared it with a second person though  dipped the rainfly in silicon disolved in mineral spirits and works great in heavy rain      
1734,4.0,                       great little tent   about   inches short than advertised  which meands my head and feet touch the sides  otherwise fantastic   super easy to setup  good ventalation  and ove the tiny opening for extension cords   i d recommend setting it up for a bit before use as it needs some stretching to sit properly      
1735,5.0,                       easy to set up  a challenge to put everything back in the bag but doable  why don t rent companies only give you set up instructions  i m sure they have a procedure to fold it correctly to fit it back in the bag  why not share that info we were caught in a windstorm and it stayed together but the poles will collapse under high winds and the tent is on top of you  when the winds died down it went back to original shape and worked well      
1736,5.0,                       i have used this tent several times over the summer   it has kept me dry during strong storms   it is easy to set up  tear down and store      
1737,5.0,                       i took my new tent out for test drive last weekend  it was super easy to set up by myself and there was more than enough space for my backpack  tool kit and air mattress  it rained the second day and i had no leaks at all  coleman delivers a really great product      
1738,5.0,                       my grandson and i got this for camping in the back yard  the first time i put up  tent  i had to use the video  the second time  was a snap  it fits in the house too  roomy for   people and a small dog  very airy and the rain guard is a nice feature      
1739,3.0,                       didn t use it  never opened it but it looked like i received an open box purchase with no pricing reduction  the bag had already had a strip to expand the bag ripped off      
1740,2.0,                       just got this out the string on a pole snapped  it s not even large enough to fit a queen sized mattress  yet it says   people which is larger than a queen mattress     
1741,5.0,                       great price  one of the cheapest tents i could find and it holds up against pouring rain  i m happy with it      
1742,5.0,                       i use this regularly  i average about two camps  boy scouts  per month  i ve had this for a couple of years now  my son needs a tent soon  so i ll probably get him this one  i mean his own  my tent is mine   these are perfect one person tents  with just me and my gar it is comfortable and the only thing is that i have a lighter tent when we have hike camps  so this is a bit heavy if you are going on a long trip i will recommend to friend and will buy one ore for my son      
1743,5.0,                       i m a first time tent camper so i was just a bit nervous about how easy this would be for me to set up   the tent went up in a snap   probably only took me about    minutes and i m sure the more i do it the faster it will go up   plenty of room for me and my dog   this was a great purchase      
1744,5.0,                       it rained decently hard one night of my four night trip   in the very corner it seemed to have either leaked in or there was some condensation build up  not much but just a little  i also recommend the coleman camping kit  the stakes are much more reliable and sturdy than the ones given with this tent  they couldn t hold the pull of the tight rain fly and would pop out      
1745,5.0,                       this is a simple square tent  but it works as well as you can possibly expect   easy to assemble  good looking and it simply  feels  well made   if the forecast calls for rain  the rainfly does it s job perfectly   when the rainfly is off  the ventilation is as good as you can ask for   rain and bugs   out   fresh air   in   good looking   yes the only complaint is that the storage bag they give you is borderline undersized and requires that you need to spend a ton of time making everything fit   i understand that the hardcore camper doesn t want to carry any more materials than absolutely necessary  but let s be honest  this is a tent for the casual camper   however  bigger bags are not hard to get  so you can always get whichever one fits your need      
1746,4.0,                       super easy to set up  good size  the seam holes are a little big like the reviews say  it rained on my trip so i got a tiny tiny bit of water in from the holes but nothing crazy  i wouldn t buy the seam sealant for just a few nights      
1747,5.0,                       the day after it arrived we set it up to make sure it was all in order before actually using it   we went on a   day camping trip and the tent held up very nicely for me and my boyfriend   it was very windy some of the nights and rained about half the time but we stayed dry and secure   there was more than enough space for two people and all our gear   sure me being     couldn t stand up all the way in the tent but enough so that i had no trouble changing clothes also the tent was very ventilated which i was thankful for   the tent is still in new condition and we will be using it again this summer  so far so good      
1748,5.0,                       this was a christmas gift for my   year old son  he is in boy scouts and needed his own tent  price was great  arrived quickly during holiday season and best of all he was so excited  he quickly set it up on his own in his bedroom and slept in it that night  in past   months of owning he has camped several times and we have had zero problems      
1749,4.0,                       the quality is better than i thought   i got a chance to test it out recently at a turtle watch   it happened to rain that night  and the wind and rain were moderate but the tent held firm  i stayed very warm  dry and cozy the entire night  although i found a small amount of moisture in one corner of the tent i would recommend however using a tarpaulin be layed out before the tent is set up to help reduce the amount of cleaning that you may have to undertaken  very little sand got on my tent  and most probably that s what helped reduce the amount of water i got inside   in anycase  set up is easy and so far i don t regret the money spent on it      
1750,5.0,                       this tent for   is ideal in size quality sturdiness   you can set it up with your eyes closed     it s that easy         love it   adrian     
1751,5.0,                       easy to put up and take down  plenty of room for two adults  totally waterproof and did extremely well in windy conditions      
1752,4.0,                       i recommend buying a tent where the rain fly goes all the way to the ground  this one does not  allows heavy wind under and allows rain to beat the tent    corners seeped water in during downpours   but not bad      
1753,5.0,                       i was dumb enough to agree to a backpacking trip during a rainstorm  we reinforced this tent with a tarp on top and a tarp on bottom and it kept us dry during heavy rain there is enough room in the tent to accommodate maybe   or   people if you really cramp together  two to three people with their gear should be able to fit comfortably the size of the tent is not convenient for backpacking  but i made it work      
1754,5.0,                       the tent is great quality and easy to set up  takes about    minutes    as you know a   person tent really fits   people comfortably  but it has worked well for my son and my this summer      
1755,5.0,                       wow   this tent was much better then we expected   for the price we were pleasantly surprised at the size and quality   we took a chance with this tent as we are not avid campers   we are merely parents who wanted a tent that didn t leak and was large enough   well our family of   fit in here just fine   plenty of room and the sides are fun for the kids to look out of   would definitely recommend this tent   great buy      
1756,4.0,                       i really have no major complaints about this tent  as always  coleman delivers a high quality in the construction of the tent itself  i go camping on weekend trips in the woods and music festivals  the places i like to camp often have summer downpours so it is worth it to me to get a tent with a good waterproof design  the  bathtub  bottom of this tent and the welded seams provide high quality water protection  i only gave     stars due to  as others have said  the very weak elastic bands used in the poles  it looks like they could snap or get severed very easily  for this i wouldn t recommend using it as a backpacking tent unless you have backup elastic bands  but the tent itself is solid      
1757,4.0,                       windy day in colorado and the tent blew away  i would give it five stars but it wasn t      weatherproof     
1758,5.0,                       purchased this for a young boy scout to be able to pack in his backpack and put up quickly by himself  after several months of camping  he s very happy with this tent  goes up in about   minutes  small and compact  sleeps   comfy  one does well with room for gear  has kept dry in rainstorms  only one incidence of water infiltration but it was a torrential storm that sent    of flowing water through camp   glad we made this purchase      
1759,5.0,                       we had a blast using this but bring some thick blankets for night time  can t wait for summer camping trips   great buy and great brand     
1760,3.0,                       oncethe rain cap is on the tent becomes extremely hot inside that was the only thing i did not like about it it needs more ventilation the door should ve had more net space instead of just at the top other than that it s a great product     
1761,5.0,                       this tent was easy to put up took about five minutes   it rained on us heavily for two days and nights and we stayed bone dry  i was able to get a queen and a twin size air mattress inside   the floor of the tent is heavy duty and no moisture seeped inside      
1762,5.0,                       easy set up  down side is that you must put the cover over your tent  not optional  or you will not have privacy  the side windows do not have a zippered privacy cover  this is a great tent  sleeps   adults comfortably  at most      
1763,4.0,                       bought this for my son camping trip for he will stay in his own tent this year   very light weight and compact      
1764,4.0,                       great for one person  two would be too tight  i m       plenty spacious pretty easy setup  i hate feeding poles thru casings  but this tent s not too bad  i was in very mild weather on the ca coast     degrees at night  almost no wind  very compact and lightweight when it s packed up  easy to disassemble  good choice for me      
1765,5.0,                       this tent fit myself and my friend  both our packs  and shoes rather perfectly  i couldn t fit my sleeping pad in it once both our bodies were inside  but the ventilation is pretty good from what i could tell  i didn t notice any condensation or uncomfortably excessive warmth buildup from breathing inside it  very easy to set up  and take down  as well      
1766,5.0,                       this is a great size and roomy for   people    could fit but it would be tight  it was very easy to put together and has held up great so far      
1767,4.0,                       definitely worth the purchase  great brand  rained the night we camped and no rain came in at all      
1768,5.0,                       this tent was perfect for me and my three grandsons  with plenty room to spare   easy to assemble and disassemble  great value and a good looking tent      
1769,3.0,                       small  i m short     and i couldn t stand up to change  so frustrating  to change i needed to lay down on my mattress  i got the tent for   ppl when it was just for my husband and i  imagine if i would have gotten the   ppl tent  looks like  the green is a pretty color  mmm yeahs that s about it      
1770,5.0,                       can t go wrong with a coleman tent  i already own a   person tent  my kids wanted to have a tent in the apartment  so this was the perfect size  the price was good and it came right on time      
1771,4.0,                       pretty easy to assemble but the rods do get hooked up as you feed them through the plastic hooks etc  pretty painless but not quite  star     
1772,5.0,                       this was well worth the money i spent on it  it was comfortable for   people to spread out with room for gear and a place to hang my lantern  you could fit in   average sized individuals  while there is enough room for   people to play cards inside while there is light rain outside exceeds quality expectation for the priceeasy to assemble  no more than    minutes  and is light  easy to pack good ventilationrainfly was handy for light drizzles but would not recommend for camping in heavy rain without using seam sealerthe zippers don t snag great price  good value  i ll be using this tent for several years hopefully shoe   cord access portseasy to assemble     
1773,5.0,                       if you need a cheap camping tent this is the one  it has a rain blocker that can withstand a bit of a downpour   you can comfortably fit   adults in this tent  i m a tall guy         and i fit inside   i would recommend this tent for a casual camper      
1774,2.0,                       i ordered the blue tent and i received a used green one with random parts that aren t even for my tent  i very disappointed that i cannot get the proper unused product that i paid for      
1775,5.0,                       wow  what a great tent for the price  we wanted something for the backyard for the kids  they absolutely love it  easy to set up     minutes      
1776,4.0,                       this tent is a great size  we slept two people and a small     lb  dog with room to spare  my only complaint is that it could use more screening venting  i could see how it might get very warm if not set up in shade      
1777,4.0,                       we bought this for a weekend trip great weather till the last morning   a little rain but we were comfy and dry      
1778,5.0,                       love this tent  i absolutely love camping  especially in rainy weather  and this tent never fails me  i also love that i can set it up on my own  as a woman  its a bit empowering    i can fit a queen size blow up mattress in here with room to spare  comfortably  it fit another person and my dog just fine      
1779,5.0,                       this was a birthday gift for my grown son  his kids have been having fun camping in the backyard      
1780,5.0,                       very useable three season tent  i e   not for blizzards and gale force winds  quick and easy to set up  ideal for one person with cooler and other gear  good visibility without fly  good air circulation with or without  zero complaints      
1781,1.0,                       we took this out to use it and discovered only when we went to set it up that one pole was broken   a disaster given we packed it with us to use and it was brand new      
1782,5.0,                       i love it  we had a speedy camping trip with below    degree weather and a light sprinkle all day  held up nicely and no leaks  great ventilation  so bring blankets if you plan on camping in the cold  the zippers aren t the greatest  so handle with care and they should stay in place  other than that  works great and kept us dry      
1783,5.0,                       i looked at this  then thought i d go to rei to find something higher end  but ended up spending money on amazon instead  because it was about     of the price   the tent is an amazing  simple  entry level tent for campers  highly recommended  looks really good too      
1784,5.0,                       this tent is a great buy   it easily sleeps   people   i like that you have the option to see through it or not   the tent was easy to put together and take apart      
1785,5.0,                       bought this tent for a camping trip back in the summer  set up was very easy  less than    minutes  also very roomy  we were able to fit a queen and twin blow up mattress along with a fan and   backpacks  the weather was nice so i can t really say how it holds up in inclement weather     
1786,5.0,                       it rained or misted the entire   days we were camping  no leaks however  definitely use an under layer like a tarp  the bottom is not as tough as others say      
1787,4.0,                       nice quality tent   used it on a snow caving trip with the scouts where they got to sleep in snow caves and the adults where in tents   i m   feet tall and did end up sleeping sideways a bit but i had plenty of room for me and some stuff   might fit two smaller people was easy to setup and i could see it handling some weather   probably a   season tent but it worked well enough in the snow too      
1788,5.0,                       for the price this tent is as good as it gets  easy to set up without a second person  once you get the hang of it   zippers work very well  although perhaps not as hearty a tents costing three more but plenty adequate  the size is generous for two persons and gear  i love the open view without the fly and the fly is nice if the weather makes it needful  the head room is way better than most tents in this class  the overall design of the tent is well thought out  i m a happy camper      
1789,5.0,                       great tent   here s a tip for all tent buyer  if it says its a   man tent  its really a   man tent   once you put your gear in the tent  there s no way to ge the company s recommended bodies in there unless you re backpacking and leaving all equipment hanging in a tree overnight      
1790,5.0,                       highly impressed  especially at this price point  kept us dry with   nights of rain  bigger inside than expected and set up was a piece of cake      
1791,5.0,                       went camping for the first time in over    years   the weather was perfect so i can t say anything about water resistances or weatherproofing   i can say that it was extremely easy to put up and take down      
1792,5.0,                       this tent is of excellent quality   it is easy to set up and take down and serves the purpose   the floor is a bit noisier than expected when moving around  but otherwise great product for the price   i don t know how it does in rain as it stayed dry all night   four people would be tight   it was just me and my son and it was perfect size      
1793,5.0,                       great basic tent for light camping and glamping  used it once so far over a weekend in southern indiana  went up easily with two people in no time at all  everything looks and works great  rain slick kept us      dry in a light drizzle and packed up no problem  i agree it could accommodate four  but is more appropriate for a couple  great deal for weekend warriors and couples who are getting into camping  as i am       
1794,5.0,                       perfect tent for any family or boy scout  i could not believe how light weight it was  it was very easy to setup  the material is excellent as well  the zippers look like they will last  i leave in the caribbean and we need tents that can take rain  this one fits the bill  plenty of room for all my family stuff when camping and i can carrying with the other equipment without a large footprint  weight       
1795,5.0,                       much bigger then expected  very well made  haven t used outside yet but kids loved it  easy to put up and take down      
1796,1.0,                       we love the sun dome and have purchased it in the past  however the door zipper broke  ripped at the seam  on our very first outing  duct tape repair the first time using  not acceptable      
1797,5.0,                       love it  so perfect for   people and dogs      
1798,4.0,                       the title says it all   this isn t the best tent on the market  but it s well worth the price   it is a quality tent  made well with good material   i see no way four people could ever sleep in this tent at the same time   it has enough room to fit a full size inflatable mattress and my gear  with a little room left over   i really like the  ceiling  height of this tent as opposed to others i ve seen   i am       tall and can nearly stand up straight pitching it isn t as easy as some other tents i ve used  but it s not too difficult for one person to put together  i live in alabama and would consider this a   season tent   if you live in a colder climate  you may want to consider another tent for the colder months of the year there are better tents out there  but not for the money      
1799,5.0,                       awesome tent   it states for   people  but that might be a stretch   i bought this tent for quick camping trips with my wife  and its great   setup takes less than    minutes by myself   and less than   minutes with a helper   it folds down super easy and quickly as well   whenever i get a new tent  i always cover it in scotch guard   and this one was no different   first night i used it   we got heavy rain at night  and not a single drop fell inside the tent   very happy with it      
1800,5.0,                       bought this tent for our first dad daughter camp out with some friends  we set it up at home first to be sure all the pieces were there and no defects  all was good  out at the campsite  the tent was easy to set up  and fun for a seven year old    no rain or wind  but lots of humidity   dew and the tent kept us nice and dry  good amount of room on the inside  good ventilation  overall  we are very happy with this tent      
1801,5.0,                       used this tent a month ago and it worked very nicely  it did not rain so i am not sure about weather resistance  but overall i enjoyed this tent and it was easy to set up  the only thing is that i could have used additional stakes  just to be extra sure that the tent is secured to the ground  found the stakes creeping out of the ground a couple times on a windy day      
1802,5.0,                       coleman all the way baby    i took this tent camping for   days and it held up great  it kept all the bugs out and is easy to set up  i picked the navy grey color and it looks really nice in person  great colors      
1803,5.0,                       great purchase for a first time tent    i used it this past weekend should have better heeded other reviewers open up the vents so condensation does not form inside   great for   big men and a third would not have been much of a problem    well   we woulda been super warm    it is an easy up easy down tent like i said  first time tent owner here    i put a tarp underneath used a mylar blanket between my sleeping bag   the tent floor i was warm all night got down to     maybe      hanging pockets kept electronix safe  no other issues looking forward to getting good use of ot this product      
1804,5.0,                       we finally had a chance to sleep in the tent  a coleman queen sized air mattress fits perfectly inside with no room to spare  i m       and i fit inside  although my head and feet touch the walls   touching the inner walls of the tent may be an issue if it rains hard  i haven t tested its rain resistance yet the tent goes up quick and easy  if you re just camping in the backyard or where it s not windy  you don t even need to use tent pegs  my granddaughter and i slept in it last night and we had plenty of room  for two adults  you may have to leave your other gear on the outside  the tent s ceiling is mesh  so if you leave off the rain cover you can star gaze  other than the mesh ceiling  there are three large vents on the sides  and two interior pockets for storing glasses  a small flashlight or other small items you might need      
1805,5.0,                       we camp a few times a year and this tent really hits the mark  it is very simple to set up  though two people make faster work of it than one  we fit an entire queen sized air mattress in the tent  with room to spare for moving around  for storing our bags  changing  etc  last summer we even had our   month old in there with us  in a bassinet we ve been through some pretty intense rain storms with this tent  and have  always  stayed dry  both us  and our stuff     the bathtub floor makes sure of that  and we ve never had any of the seams or windows leak on us currently we are on our second one of these  the first one lasted six or seven years  which when considering the price is a great deal  when this current one is ready to go  a zipper and a pole broke on the first one   we will certainly be buying another      
1806,5.0,                       this tent is probably the easiest tent i ve ever set up  the total time to get everything set up took about    minutes in terms of space  we were able to fit a queen sized air mattress  some bags containing our stuff and still have enough room to  walk around  inside  the tent itself isn t very tall  so you might not be able to walk around  if you were actually looking to fit   people in here  i wouldn t be too worried overall  this is a fantastic tent for the price  i d highly recommend this to my friends      
1807,5.0,                       everything about the tent is exactly as the seller states  that s two people on a queen size mattress comfortably      
1808,5.0,                       nice and roomy  sleeps three comfortably with one queen air mattress and one twin with room for a chair and bags  will fit two queen air mattresses if you don t keep your clothing bags inside the tent      
1809,5.0,                       we used this tent for trip to joshua tree  this tent helped us to get through the windy season in california  as long as you have a solid foundation on all four side  the flexibility of the tent will relief the wind power to blew off the tent  however  the iron stick is too fragile for the solid sand ground  be sure to bring spare or find softer ground before hammering to the ground      
1810,5.0,                       i love how easy it is to assemble  it takes   person less than    minutes to do it  i put an inflatable full size mattress inside the tent and there was still plenty of space for other things  the mattress fit a little snug when laid out vertically  in front of the entrance  so we had to lay it horizontally instead  overall  really happy with the product      
1811,5.0,                       this tent goes up really easy and quickly  the big plus is that it kept us dry during a rainstorm  easy to take down and fit back in the bag  definitely recommend      
1812,3.0,                       like most coleman products we ve owned  the quality is good and the set up is easy  but  it s a tight fit for   people  if   adults stayed in this tent  it would look like a clown car   i would call this a   person tent maximum and even that is generous  yes  it holds a queen air mattress but when the mattress is in there  it pretty much takes up the entire tent      
1813,5.0,                       i ve had this tent now for several years  and it s been great   i ve taken it to moab  big bear  and other local campgrounds  and it s been a champ   solid  durable  and wonderful rain resistance   the zipper which was my biggest worry has held up like a champ  though i am gentle with it   interior space is great   fits   sleeping bags and a bag of gear just fine   plus you can t beat the price   really happy i bought this      
1814,5.0,                       this tent is great for our family of    held up against rain and wind  plenty of room for air mattresses      
1815,5.0,                       bought this tent for camping in the pacific nw during the summer  i haven t been camping in ages and wanted something that wasn t too expensive but easy to setup and not too fancy  it fit three taller than average women  a medium sized dog  all of our stuff  and a space heater comfortably  fairly quick to setup with two people and to disassemble  and i was happy that it easily fit back into the carry bag at the end of the trip      
1816,5.0,                       i spent a long time reading reviews on different tents and decided on this one and i am glad i did  we set it up in the back yard to test out the durability and see if there were any leaks since here in florida we get massive thunderstorms daily  it did not leak at all  it was super easy to set up and super spacious for two of us  we were able to fit in an air mattress and still had room to store our gear in a corner  i couldn t wait to take this camping  we left it up in the yard all week so we could camp again on the weekend  but during one of our daily storms a tree fell and crushed the tent and everything we had it  so it sucks to have wasted      but this is the same tent i will be buying for my camping trip later this year      
1817,5.0,                       this tent really deserves a   star rating  we ll made and super easy to install spacious inside      
1818,5.0,                       great tent  easy to set up  comes with everything you need  plenty of space  i used it in some light rain and experienced no leaks at all  two of the walls are almost completely mesh  not a big deal if you have the rain fly attached  but still  there is a small gap if you are nitpicky about privacy  it also lets in some breeze  which can be good  if it s hot  or bad  if it s cold       
1819,2.0,                       i was surprised at how roomy this tent was  my wife and i took it for a weekend camping trip in the poconos  unfortunately it rained all weekend and we got a decent amount of water in the tent  we had puddles in three of the four tent corners  we had even put down two footprints  we also had some rain dripping through the top of the tent even though we had the rain fly  while this was a nice tent overall  i do not trust it enough to use it again if it rains      
1820,5.0,                       we didn t have any heavy rain  but it did seem to be water resistant  as for ease of putting it up  i put it up by myself faster than groups of people put up their tents  very well made     
1821,4.0,                       my boyfriend and i bought this for festival season  and it s a great little tent  perfect size for us   some of our luggage  and it s decently vented   one of our previous tents got waaay too hot with the rain cover on  i also like the deep floor   another past tent didn t have that and got soaked when it rained  i d definitely still waterproof the seams of this tent  though   that s always a weak point  and buy better stakes because the ones they give you kinda suck      
1822,3.0,                       the top of the tent is open mesh with only the rain fly as a cover which doesn t seal  it s a very out in nature experience  i had to inflate my queen size air mattress inside the tent as it wouldn t fit through the door      
1823,5.0,                       this tent is super simple to set up  and after waterproofing it  makes it the perfect summer tent  we are able to leave for our campground of choice after work on a friday  and since we can set it up so quickly and effortlessly  we can still have a relaxing night stay our first night with no stress of setting up before dark i would recommend a tarp for underneath to protect it further  but i believe this is a normal procedure most campers take regardless of what s included in this package      
1824,5.0,                       this tent is amazing for the price  just enough room for two people  setup is quick and easy  take down is just as easy  sure  it s  ot the hampton s but it is a great little tent you could take there      
1825,5.0,                       i just completed a week long camping trip using this tent   i traveled with my boyfriend and our two dogs  each    lbs    the tent was great as we all had plenty of space plus room for leashes  shoes  etc   we did not run into rain but we did have a wind storm   the tent did great   it is easy to put up     takes about    minutes   the directions are very clear   the stakes worked great for us  good quality in my opinion    no negative comments about this tent      
1826,4.0,                       i really like the darkroom technology but watch out for manufacturers defects in the poles  my first tent was a dud      
1827,5.0,                       two people can assemble this tent in about      minutes  i fit a queen sized inflatable bed  also coleman brand  and there was about two feet on the side to fit backpacks and other gear the tent doesn t hold in heat well  which makes it ideal for hot summer nights  i can t speak to its ability to keep out water because i ve only used it during dry weather disassembling takes about the same amount of time and it all fits conveniently into a small provided bag      
1828,5.0,                       great value  as expected from the long time coleman brand   went up easy      minutes by myself   rain fly included worked well   sturdy tarp like floor kept us dry   get one      
1829,5.0,                       bought this for a recent camping trip  got the   person tent  its easy to put up and really sturdy   its great for   people but not much more  with   sleeping backs we filled up the inside floor space  not much room for keeping our packs      
1830,5.0,                       love this little tent perfect for   might be a tad tight for   maybe not    set up   take down easy and fast  idk if its waterproof or water resistant as i ve only gotten out a few times   no rain either time      
1831,5.0,                       fit two of us              on a queen size air mattress with room for our bags and space between the air mattress and tent sides  kept cool despite the summer heat  was relatively quick to set up  even with limited light  stayed secure despite a couple good gusts of wind the first evening  quick tear down pack up  too  limited head space made sitting up the most you can do if you are above a certain height and want to change in the privacy of your own tent instead of the campground facilities showers      
1832,5.0,                       this may be a smaller tent but it worked perfectly for our three day camping trip in the woods  fits a queen size blow up mattress just right and even weathered a horrible thunderstorm in below    degree temperatures  didn t have one drop of water in the tent at all      
1833,5.0,                       i love the tent as it s super light and easy to carry around  two people can easily fit into these and it has enough head space while sitting inside it  the installation of the tent was super easy and took    minutes to make it  it is good investment for camping accessories      
1834,5.0,                       use for family camping with cub scouts   light weight   easy to set up  nice size  not too big   easy to pack up  too     
1835,5.0,                       arrived right on time  not used yet   but looks excellent and so east to take along and compact air mattress is nice too      
1836,4.0,                       i m new to camping  but this tent is a good one   it s easy to set up and take down   it has plenty of room for a queen size air mattress  cooler  a tote for food and a few small bags      
1837,5.0,                       just got this tent delivered  haven t used it outside yet so my review is just on the appearence of the tent for now  it is much larger then i expected  definitely can fit a queen mattress in it  i tried  and still have some room left over  the rain cap is very nice and looks like it will deff  keep the rain out  the   top panels of the tent itself are made from  mosquito netting  which will keep the air flow going through the tent even if all the windows are zipped and the rain cap is on  will be putting the seam sealer on it to make sure it doesn t leak through  all in all  so far i m very happy with this tent and am excited to try it out in   weeks        
1838,2.0,                       updated   unfortunately the quality on this tent has gone way down  in less than   years and only a few trips we have   broken poles and bent hardware  in addition the rainfly doesn t come down as far which leaves the family feeling exposed to the elements  i m very disappointed  the old model was great but i can t recommend the new one original  love this tent   bought it almost    years ago and used it for many adventures   it poured rain the  st time we used it but we stayed nice and dry  same as every time we camped in the rain   it is luxurious for   or   people and we can comfortably sleep our family of   with most of our gear   i m      tall and i can almost stand in the middle  it s that huge   for car camping i can t think of anything better      
1839,5.0,                       if you re a new to camping like me  you ll love this tent  will be taking it on many weekend trips this summer  there was plenty of room for two adults who wanted room to stretch out  super easy to assemble  we bought stakes separately but the ones that came with the tent would have been fine on their own      
1840,2.0,                       the tent is fine in terms of quality  the con is i am  ft  in tall and when i laid down my head and feet touched both ends  if my husband had been with us on the trip we wouldn t have been able to use it since he is over   feet tall      
1841,5.0,                       great little tent  i got it on sale for festivals  my boyfriend and i fit in it fine  it really won t fit   people and their things  but i knew this when buying it  perfect for   people and their suitcases  easy to set up        
1842,4.0,                       good tent  fits a queen size air bed length wise  good air flow for warmer nights  not great during cold nights      
1843,4.0,                       i haven t camped in many years and needed a tent for a hiking weekend  after reading countless tent reviews on amazon and other sites  i purchased the coleman sundome   person tent  it is easy to put up and take down  it s roomy for  one  person  with room for twin air mattress and gear   two could sleep with on a air mattress  three or more people would be squished  it did not rain while i was camping  so i can t say comment on it s waterproof but did spray it with kiwi camp dry  heavy duty water repellent in the event it did  i would buy it again if i need a one person tent to sleep  if you want a tent where you can have a chair or be able to move around due to inclement weather  then this is not your tent      
1844,3.0,                       the tent is a great product  but the bag that they give you to store the tent is a joke  their is no way your going to get it so perfectly folded to get it back into that little bag they send it in     
1845,1.0,                       so long story short i went camping for the first time this past weekend and decided to purchase this tent  i decided to go with coleman because of their reputation but was very disappointed  the first night it rained and my tent started leaking  my gear and other items got wet and it was a mess  not reliable at all and now it seems like i m stuck wit it because i missed the time period to return it  not fair at all      
1846,4.0,                       bought this tent as a backpack camping tent   short hikes   and found the tent to fit all my needs   the tent is small enough to make it easy to transport but big enough that i was able to put all my stuff inside once it was up and leave me enough room to sleep comfortably and move around   i would have given this   stars but i m a little concerned about the bungy type cord inside the poles  not very much elasticity in the cord so when i was assembling the tent it made things a little difficult as the poles would come apart   if they should fail i will update this post and my rating      
1847,5.0,                       quality made  easy to set up and very sturdy compared to the off brand  easy set up  tent i previously purchased  i was actually able to fit the tent and poles back into the bag which never happens  strongly recommend coleman      
1848,5.0,                       tent used for short trip in  adirondacks    used drop cloth   purchased three person tent and it was easy to set up take down and store       
1849,5.0,                       did some late summer camping with this tent  it rained most of the night and we didn t get wet  the large amount of screen on top made it cooler than we would have liked  it would be great for warm nights      
1850,5.0,                       this tent is exactly what i needed  its also easy to set up  my   year old and i did it in the middle of the night in windy conditions  if there is no rain you dont event need the tarp cover      
1851,5.0,                       super easy to set up and take down  great size  bought the six person tent and was able to fit our huge queen size blow up mattress with lots of extra room to spare      
1852,5.0,                       it was a very good tent  so far we have used it once outside  it worked very well  so far i have no complaints      
1853,2.0,                       brand new out of box and there was a support strap that had pulled from seam  also another spot let water in above the waterproof floor line at this one corner  this is a cheaply made tent and not the coleman quality i had as a kid  this would make a great   kids play in back yard  or summer and fair weather only tent      
1854,5.0,                       great tent for a younger couple  a full size memory foam mattress topper fit perfectly in the tent  but i have no doubt it would fit a real full mattress too     
1855,4.0,                       so far  so good   only used it once but it was easy to put together by myself  no help   cant talk about the rain resistance since it never rained while using but i did an extensive research and checked a lot of tent reviews and it seems that this one will do in those conditions   also  it will fit two people with tween airbeds or a full airbed   i read reviews that claimed that a queen mattress will fit but it doesn t   and it you try to push it  you will have space for nothing else inside the tent      
1856,5.0,                       i would only recommend buying a water sealant spray to play it safe  it rained overnight and we were totally dry inside  sleeps   people with absolutely no issues      
1857,5.0,                       first night i used it it took on a full force thunderstorm and im glad to say i did not get flooded one bit it will be q great starter tent for sure     
1858,5.0,                       if my    year old can put this tent up  so can you   he took this to camp and i was amazed at how easy this went together   no practice necessary      
1859,5.0,                       just used this on a camping trip in the mountains where it rained for the majority of the time i was there  it performed perfectly  not a single drop of water penetrated the tent and i had plenty of room for me and all of my gear plus room to spare  the tent goes up very quickly as it only has the two main poles  plus the rain fly pole  the bath tub bottom did the job of keeping out the water that was running by my tent and the fly did the job of keeping the rain from getting into the tent as i entered and exited on many occasions  i used this for just me and i could see it being something that is very useful for two people if you are smaller or if one is tall or big like i am  and one person who is smaller  like a child  if you were to try and use this for two grown men  you have no room for any gear or bags  etc  i was very impressed with the performance that i received after only one use  i will be bringing it out again this next weekend and i will update my review should the tent under perform this next time around  i do not expect that to happen though      
1860,2.0,                       we are on our first camping trip using this tent  the tent was great without windy conditions because it s roomy and easy to assemble as well as visually appealing  however  we are camping on ocracoke island  so it gets very windy  this morning i noticed several holes in the screen from the velcro hitting against the tent  i hope they will do something about it      
1861,3.0,                       the quality of this product is very good and the tent well constructed   the only reason i am giving this a   star rating is because there is no way you can comfortably fit   people in this tent   my son  our cots and gear take up the entire tent   i suspected that manufacture s are embellishing on their tent capabilities so i ordered an extra large size just in case   this tent is really a two man tent      
1862,3.0,                       had a year in it when we set it up we seen  where the window mesh meets the tent meterial   it wasn t seen together     
1863,5.0,                       easy to set up by yourself  but faster if you have a second person helping you  i really love the storage bag it comes with because its big enough that you can put the tent back in it without it being perfectly folded or rolled up  i was able to comfortably fit a queen size bed  a twin size bed  and   folding chairs inside and still have plenty of walkway space      
1864,4.0,                       took my tent to the beach  i liked that it had a raised entrance so it helped keep the sand out from the blowing wind  i haven t used it in inclement weather yet so i will have to wait and see how it stands up to the elements      
1865,5.0,                       this tent rocks   i took it to the   th anniversary of the sturgis rally in south dakota and slept in it for   nights   it was easy to set up       minutes   roomy for me        lb man   with a single air mattress and my gear  and did not leak despite weathering two storms   in fact  one of the storms was so bad that the tent  without me in it  was only saved from tumbling away  like some others did  by the fact that i had tied one of the rain fly cords to a fence post   the tent was blown over on it s side  with mattress  sleeping bag  and gear inside   and was only anchored via a single rain fly cord  despite this rough treatment  the tent didn t rip  no cords broke  and the poles were twisted but popped right back into shape   remember that i had to flip the thing with my air mattress and gear bag now resting on the door side of the tent  which was facing the ground   of course some rain got in the top mesh when it was blown over but  as luck would have it  the cord that was attached to the fence post actually pulled the rain fly tightly over the mesh   after the storm passed i just had to mop up a bit of water with a hand towel  re  anchor it  and i was comfortable for the night   in the past i have abandoned cheap tents rather than pack and haul them home  but i definitely packed this one and will use it again   it s a keeper  note   i hadn t staked out the rain fly cords yet when i took the photo      
1866,1.0,                       frame supporting tent broke when my granddaughter accidentally hit her head    years old     
1867,5.0,                       casual campers will love this easy to set up tent  plenty of room for three with bags  rained all night and i tried to get water to come in with no success  dry as a bone  well done coleman      
1868,3.0,                       cheap normal colmen tent but we are on year   and it s been working out  good for state parks and back yards not for back packing      
1869,5.0,                       easy to put up   lightweight   good material   we bought the tent for   persons and it s quite big enough with sufficient room for   people to sleep      
1870,5.0,                       this has been my summer tent so far and has really exceeded all expectations  it has seen two pretty severe storms and only had minor water in tent after the second   the water inside was actually my fault due to having rain fly too far open   i am excited to try it out with fall coming up and then winter   love the deep tub floor also  keeps everything nice and dry      
1871,5.0,                       we have used this tent in the rain and heat  it was good quality and worked very well      
1872,2.0,                       warm weather   summer tent only   not sure why they just wouldn t give you option to close up all of the screens   had to send it back because i camp year round      
1873,5.0,                       coleman s sundome tent is the perfect match for the hiker camper bicyclist in all of us  this is my second sundrome tent in the past seven years  i found it durable  light  and affordable for its  x  size  it s wind resistance is remarkable  as a bicyclist touring the country and setting this tent up constantly from campground to campground  the tent really stays tough      
1874,1.0,                       so i initially rated it super when i stood this up in my basement and i thought what an amazing tent this was  when i was packing it back to go camping tomorrow the zipper broke    how is this possible  such cheaper material     
1875,5.0,                       family of four easily fit in this easy to set up tent  we haven t used it in the rain yet  but it s exactly what we need for a family our size      
1876,4.0,                       i like the actual tent  however it was kind of hard to setup as a beginner  i m more of a computer savvy person but i go camping and i was in the boy scouts  i can generally put up a tent  however there were no directions included and one of the stakes had dirt on the end overall good tent  but someone didn t clean this well and it must have been returned without the directions      
1877,4.0,                       good quality tent  kept my daughter dry  only complaint was that the queen size blow up mattress was too big  they made it fit  if this is a two person tent i wouldn t want to see a one person       
1878,5.0,                       very lightweight and super easy to set up they say    minutes setup that s even a stretch i was able to set it up in   no problem   fantastic quality      
1879,5.0,                       super easy to pitch  and it actually fits in the bag  fit two people and a dog comfortably  would be tight with three people but it s doable  the stakes it came with were not so useful  we bought better stakes and it worked much better  kept bugs out well  has a little hanger in the center for a light and two pockets on either side for small belongings      
1880,5.0,                       i took this tent to special camping for my son  it was easy to setup and easy to fold  we re planning to go more camping this summer and i hope this tent do it s job  perfect size for three of us      
1881,5.0,                       i am very impressed with this tent   for the price  i wasn t expecting anything special    just something to get us through the night   however  we ended up being in a severe wind storm with strong gusting burst of wind   the tent held up great   all night i thought it would surely tear apart or collapse  but it held strong   for the price  i am very impressed and would recommend it to others      
1882,5.0,                       awesome tent   would buy these again and again bought eight of these tents on cyber monday and got an amazing price on them   use them for our scout troop   love these tents   have been using this brand and model from coleman for over a decade now working with boy scouts   have used these in three different scout troops  and they have always worked well   they are big enough for two boys and their gear  and we have used them on week long camp outs and they work great they work great in all seasons  have even had boys stay in these when we were doing winter camping our tents were on top of four feet of snow like them so well that i have two of my own that we use as a family when we camp   they are quick to put up and easy to take down   one person can set up the three person tent in about five minutes with practice i really like the fact that they continue to manufacture the tents   if something breaks or is lost  this happens with boy scouts  you can order replacement parts or purchase the tents again also because they are not huge they are quick to take down and fold up   the large cabin tents can take       year old    or    minutes to get folded up   these can come down in less than    minutes good construction  and have held up to monthly camping trips for over a year with limited shown wear and tear      
1883,2.0,                       update  put my linenspa    hybrid mattress in tent and my feet and head touch sides of tent and i m only           mattress measures    x     i m sadly returning tent  just plain wrong specs on tent measurement      
1884,3.0,                       the main thing i don t really like about the tent is you pretty much have to put on the rain cover because it is just open netting on top  so if you have an unexpected rain and don t have the cover on  you will get soaked      
1885,4.0,                       my very first tent and bought   person tent definitely not meant for   people it was just enough room for myself  my  suggestion would be for people who like space to get     ratio  so if you looking for a tent for   people get a   person tent  otherwise i had no other issues with this tent easy to install just watch video in item description     
1886,4.0,                       very good for the price  very satisfied with coleman product had many over the years      
1887,4.0,                       bought for camping with my son s boy scout troop  my husband and i used a queen air mattress and had room to put our backpacks beside the entry flap inside  as well   we were camping in the yellowstone region in wyoming during mid july for a week  it was easy and fast for set up  the tent withstood a variety of weather to include intense sun  wind  rain  and hail  we were dry and comfortable the entire week   the tent is low  so you cannot completely stand up inside  also  there is very little overhang so not much protection from rain when entering exiting the tent  but for the price  it s a great tent      
1888,5.0,                       id say this is a good tent from temperatures from      f  the open design doesnt trap heat very well so its more of a summer  spring tent  hooks up easy though so i like it     
1889,5.0,                       enough  room for me and   cats in case we have to evacuate again      
1890,5.0,                       great little tent  bought it for just myself and it has lots of room  it fits my cot  a folding chair  and a small heater all with a lot of room to spare  i set it up in my backyard to try for a few nights  all three nights it has rained poured  even into much of the day s   it has stayed perfectly dry and not a drop of water inside  lastly to answer the  does it fit three people  question  the answer is yes  but three people side by side  i would say it fits two comfortably  overall a great tent      
1891,5.0,                       used once didn t rain can attest to ability to keep you dry  was easy to set up i was able to set up by myself in    minutes      
1892,5.0,                       it was very easy to set up and it easily packs  i ve used it for car camping in western nc in the fall and it holds up well in the climate for that time of the year  granted we only got a bit of misting and it never got below   f  it is a great buy for the value with that said      
1893,5.0,                       nice little tent  it fit my queen size mattress  but no room for much more  i bring things in plastic tubs and just left them outside of tent  it rained while camping  and the mosquitoes were some of the worst that i have seen  but i had no leaks and no bugs      
1894,5.0,                       like everything about it  haven t tested water proofing  i will update when i get a chance to      
1895,5.0,                       got this for     during a amazon lightning deal  finally used it and it took    minutes to set up  the whole tent constists of   poles    poles it you want the rain deflector  the easiest and simplest tent i have had     
1896,5.0,                       holy cow   what a tent   it s compact  easy to set up and take down and it survived horrible weather last weekend   when i say horrible  i mean huge thunderstorms with giant downed tree limbs all over town   it was bad   despite the terrible rain  high winds  etc  and no additional waterproofing on our end before use  i know   dumb  right    this tent was nice and dry   we did end up with a tiny pool of water in one corner after all that   it was about the size of a half dollar coin   i couldn t believe it   in addition  i was worried it would blow away blow down in the middle of the night because we just used the standard tiny stakes that come with the tent   it help up perfectly   i can t say as much for the other   person tent that was camping in the next site over    i probably will invest in better stakes for future adventures and just because i d always rather be safe than sorry  i will probably go ahead and do a little extra water proofing even though it didn t seem to need it  for the price  i d say you d be hard pressed to beat this tent   we are happy campers         
1897,4.0,                       got this on a wednesday for a weekend camping trip starting on that friday  thunderstorm battered through that friday night  and although there was a slight leak in two corners  it really did stand against a crazy thunderstorm    i m talking about pelting rains full of gusty storms  quite impressed  but still had a couple leaks  so   stars instead of         
1898,5.0,                       this tent is amazing  it s a pretty standard dome tent design  so you know it s lightweight and easy to set up  in fact  it s so easy  my   year old was able to help me get it up our first night camping with the tent  it poured rain all night  this tent handled it like a champ  the rain fly kept the rain off the top  and the box style bottom kept rain from seeping in  we stayed warm and dry all night thanks to this tent   adults will fit comfortably with plenty of room to move around and have your bags and stuff    will fit in no problem  just without much room between sleeping bags    adults and you re kinda squeezed in  without room for bags and whatnot in the tent  it is nice and roomy  and tall enough that you don t feel claustrophobic i got this tent on sale  seems to go on sale a couple of times a year  and i couldn t be happier  i d happily have paid full price if i wasn t able to snag the deal if you re looking for a   person dome tent  this is definitely the one to get      
1899,5.0,                       color blends in with nature  just the right size for two people  smells good inside  repacks to almost same original dimensions  good cross ventilation  rain fly makes it look good  so put it up all the time      
1900,5.0,                       went camping in death valley national park for one night  just me and my dog  since it s dry  didn t have to put the rain cover on  but i was still protected from wind  even though the mesh was exposed  great tent  although i like to stretch out  a blow up queen size bed fits in there perfectly  so two people can definitely fit  i unroll the deflated bed into the tent  stick the automatic air blower in the socket  and let it do its work  once it s inflated  it takes up all the room  and i like it just fine i don t have any problems rolling it up and putting it back in the bag  the stakes work well too  haven t needed to buy extras yet  just remember to bring a mallet or hammer for the stakes  so far so good i have a major pacific coast camping trip coming up so we ll see how it does in rain      
1901,4.0,                       coleman makes really good functional gear for the price  this is my second coleman tent and it works great  super easy to set up  one of the metal stakes bent during the first set up and that is my reason for   instead of   stars  it s not made for backpacking but i can actually fit it inside my pack  especially when i pack it separately from the poles      
1902,5.0,                       we used our coleman tent for some cold weather camping along with some mummy sleeping bags  we had a great time      
1903,4.0,                       it s a tent  it ain t no shelter half or a pair even  but it s easy for an old gimp to put up and put his grand urchins in on a wilderness camp out   hard to make a good recommendation on it though  someone  we won t mention any names  left the air mattress pump at home  for a hint  it was the only adult on the trip the tent  it did the tents job i reckon   i was to soar to appreciate it fully      
1904,4.0,                       i like this tent so far  great for car camping  easy to set up  i like the roomy interior and the port for bringing electricity into the tent  i have used it in a heavy downpour and it didn t leak  tough floor  tent stakes are fairly weak  the rain cover vestibule area is not very useful for other than peaking out the top window when it is raining  when opening the door  it falls inside the tent  which causes you to think about it because the zipper gets stuck every time due to this unless you pull the door out and fold it outside  annoying until you get used to it overall  i do like this tent and don t regret buying it  good value      
1905,1.0,                       i bought this item for my son for christmas so he did not put it up until the following summer  when he did he found by the zipper there was a rip  since i had lost the window to return it my only option was to write this in the review     
1906,5.0,                       it was very easy to put together and had nice vents and a bottom in the tent   pocket on the inside of the tent to hold flashlight   nice and compact  great backyard tent      
1907,5.0,                       i didn t expect such a great item but i was surprised by it     very light  good quality and easy to put in up i not even read the instructions    i used for a   days camping trip and i love it  not to mention is very spacious inside definitely recommend this item      
1908,5.0,                       purchased this for my eagle scout son   he is giving the tent a good workout   the quality is good  no leaks so far   i recommend this tent      
1909,5.0,                       what an awesome tent for such a cheap price only about a ten fifteen minute set up time with plenty of space and  storage  with the small pockets definitely buy if you are looking for an affordable  yet sturdy  tent i was able to fit five people at one point  but it fits four very comfortably      
1910,5.0,                       this is a great tent   very roomy and well constructed   i was able to set it up all by myself without any problems   it has good ventilation   i am very impressed with the amount of room   although i have not had it out in the ran yet  it looks like it will do a good job of keeping me and my equipment dry      
1911,5.0,                       bought it for my grandson for his boy scout camp outing  he really likes it  plenty of room  easy for him to assemble      
1912,1.0,                       sick and tired of these duel layer tents unless it is perfect outside this thing is useless     
1913,5.0,                       this was my first time pitching a tent  so it was a challenge for me  and i was by myself   i like how quick   easy it is to assemble  a group had the same tent at a festival i went to and pitched theirs in like    minutes      
1914,5.0,                       nice tent  not for weather below        it dropped to    one night while camping and since there no way to close two of the vents i froze my balls off  guess i won t need that vasectomy after all      
1915,5.0,                       used it for a weekend of camping luckily unlike last year there was no rain but the zipper held up it was easy to put up so far so good     
1916,5.0,                       the hardest thing about this tent is puting the poles at the ends of tent  o heres a hint  fold top in the tent and fold in  rds fits fine w o exspanding bag        
1917,1.0,                       on my  rd weekend camping trip the zipper broke  the plastic tenth bent and now the tent cannot be zipped up   return window on amazon is closed  i ll contact coleman and follow up my review regarding their response      
1918,5.0,                       i loved this tent   it rained heavily the second day of our camping trip  and mine was the only tent out of   to stay completely dry inside   it probably helped that i put a tarp underneath the tent before i set it up   i also used a queen sized intex air mattress  which was just the right size to fill every corner of the tent   it effectively turned the tent into a bounce house now  if you are expecting to fit   adults in this tent  you are not going to have a good time   i am      and had to sleep diagonally to be comfortable      
1919,5.0,                       super quick and easy to put up and take down  size is as advertised  really good tent for the price     
1920,5.0,                       the tent is really comfortable  i got the   person tent but was actually using for   people so lots of space  really steady and small pockets inside the tent to put keys and phones  the net is very clear that you can see the entire sky from inside your tent and won t feel like there is a net between it  totally worth buying  value for money      
1921,2.0,                       the top tore on second use   material too flimsy  in heavy wind and rain  water will get in like a mist  many tie down cords are a hassle to setup and take down     
1922,3.0,                       great tent except for the cheap tent fly zipper that fell apart after   months   coleman is now owned by  newell brands    i have  been waiting to hear on my warranty replacement request for three weeks        
1923,5.0,                       very happy with the tent  was very easy to assemble  sturdy  was able to hold off high winds at night i was able to fit a queen size air mattress into it  with ease i would not say this is a   person tent however  more like two grown adults can fit into it  but none the less a great tent      
1924,5.0,                       great tent for the value  this was extremely easy to set up  i would recommend getting the   person tent if you are debating between this one and the   person tent  this one allowed there to be space on both sides of the sleeping bags for clothes  etc  it does not come with a mallet hammer  but we used a rock to nail in the sticks to the ground  just saying in case the ground is frozen  it may be more difficult  highly recommend        
1925,5.0,                       easy to assemble and break down and with no additional waterproofing held up well with no leaking during a weekend of rainy weather  i would not put four adults in this tent  you could probably squeeze three adults or two adults with two children  i use it with two adults  two small dogs  and our gear and it is perfectly comfortable for us      
1926,5.0,                       very roomy for   adults  easy set up  pitched it by myself in under    minutes  don t forget to purchase a tarp to keep the bottom side clean  it rained for one whole night and it was bone dry inside      
1927,4.0,                       we used this tent only once so far and that is what this review is posted as  this was easy to put up and take down  it is huge inside  especially for just the two of us  it vents well and was sturdy  only drawback is the zipper  there s a little flap on the outside of the zipper   presumably for rain events   but it gets caught in the zipper when you open or close the tent  so far that s the only negative i ve found  happy so far with the quality and price we paid      
1928,5.0,                       we bought this tent for all of our webelos scouts as they start the arrow of light path in their last year of cub scouting  the boys loved them  they went up easy  each boy put up their own tent  and taking it down wasn t a hassle  fits   person comfortably  a single air mattress or cot   backpack   shoes  super light weight  plan on buying these again      
1929,3.0,                       the simple d form tent is nice for quickly setting up but the fiberglass pole positioned at the top of the dome tent split the first time i set it up by myself coleman customer service was very responsive and helpful to ship a repair kit to me      
1930,5.0,                       we have used this tent once  and have zero complains thus far  it worked great  we fit ourselves and our two large dogs in it  along with our backpacks      
1931,4.0,                       this coleman product is very well made   however  it may be more aptly described as a one person tent it is really small and was not adequate to serve as my earthquake preparedness shelter should my home be uninhabitable      
1932,5.0,                       absolutely loved this tent  we took it camping for a couple nights and it worked great  super easy set up    it hardcore thunder stormed one night and we were super dry and cozy      
1933,4.0,                       solid   compact when packed  easy to erect  no zippers have broken yet     since i don t camp a lot though  i don t really have the knowledge to compare it to other tents      
1934,3.0,                       easy to carry and set up  even with windows unzipped still got pretty hot and stuffy during mid day heat in california  and with windows zipped it did not protect against the cold at night  water seeped through bottom a little bit during rain but rainfly did protect roof and sides from water  all in all  great for shorter camping trips in moderate climates      
1935,5.0,                       i bought this so my kids could have a fun campout in the kitchen during shelter in place   we have a travel trailer so they can be a  play  room when we camp      
1936,5.0,                       easy to set up  easy to take down  i camped across the country in this baby with just me and my dog  and we enjoyed this tent completely  it kept us dry when it rained and had a lot of vent options for when it was ridiculously hot  it s even got a little hanging mesh pouch inside for anything you might want close at hand  it doesn t pack down terribly small  but for the casual car camper it s perfect      
1937,5.0,                       this is my third tent of this exact design   have used it many  many times over a period of years   two favorite features   the bathtub bottom that makes a groundcloth underneath unnecessary  and the center height   i use this tent for just me  though i ve occasionally had someone else join me   it provides good space for my gear   packs into a very small bag      
1938,5.0,                       i bought this for myself  it fit my queen size mattress and   end tables comfortably  it rained and my tent didn t leak  it was windy   about   mph winds and the tent didn t budge       
1939,1.0,                       i don t know if i got a lemon  but the very first time i used this tent the string broke inside the poles  maybe the string was really old  but it s a good thing i set this up in my living room first      
1940,5.0,                       goes up quick  very roomy  floor tarp material comes up pretty high  saw some rain with no issues  rain was never heavy and i didn t treat the seams  for the size  price  and ease of use it s worth five stars  a more thorough review would have included more exposure to rain      
1941,4.0,                       looks good  good size  good all around and easy set up  first time camping but it got the job done and it comes with extra cover for rain  only thing is ventilation is not good with cover on so thats why only   star  beside that  awesome for the price      
1942,5.0,                       this tent worked out  great  i purchased for an outdoor overnight girl scout leader trading  this tent was easy to put up and packed away after just as nicely  it rained part of the night and the rain fly did a great job  everything inside stayed dry  i am pleased with my purchase and looking forward to our next adventure      
1943,4.0,                       i used this tent for a weekend camping trip in vermont in july   it rained over night and there was some moisture that blew in under the rain cover but it was just on the insides of the tent   one thing i d be concerned about with this is the amount of people this thing claims to be able to hold   it s really better for   people and their stuff   i don t think you d be able to fit   adults in it comfortably  maybe that s just me  i did enjoy using this tent   set up was average  no better or worse than any other tent i ve used   i d recommend it         
1944,4.0,                       it s a good overall tent  it was a little challenging putting it up by myself  but i managed in about    minutes  it got down to the mid   s at night  i had to get my heater  it does have a zipper opening for a cord      
1945,5.0,                       great tent   have used it many times and it is easy to set up and kept me dry in a pretty heavy rainstorm   definitely would recommend   fits   adults very comfortably   had   adult men in the tent and it was a little tight  but doable   don t think   is doable without being uncomfortably crammed into the tent      
1946,5.0,                       this is an excellent little tent  i took it out for two nights in south florida  setup was simple and fast  unfortunately  it rained heavily both nights  which put a damper on my plans  but the tent didn t leak at all  i stayed completely dry both nights  however  i think it s a bit over rated as a   person tent  i could see two people sleeping comfortably  but three would be a squeeze in my opinion      
1947,5.0,                       great price and great tent  easily fits   and for basic camping  not backpacking  it works  plus it fits right back in its carrying case while tents i have had in the past seemed almost impossible to put back in their original packaging      
1948,5.0,                       this tent was well worth the price  i used it with some eurmax tent stakes as the weather was expected to be very windy during my camping trip the tent was able to withstand very strong winds and heavy rains  no damage to the exterior at all the tent is very roomy for a single person and can easily fit another individual   bags very happy with my purchase      
1949,4.0,                       this is a wonderful little tent   i bought it this summer to do some backyard camping   it was perfect for that   pros   light weight  easy assembly  sleeps    spacious feelcons  very light weight    a strong wind will carry it away    the tent isn t fully covered without the rain cover   half of the top of the dome is mesh   it wouldn t do well in a heavy rain      
1950,3.0,                       took it out for the first time on a camping trip to davidson river   first two days were great  third day it rained on and off again for approximately   hours  water came through all four corner seams near the bottom of the tent   not exactly pleased with this as the seams should have been more properly sealed      
1951,5.0,                       the tent was good enough for two of us and our   year old daughter  it was very easy to put  no hassles at all but needs two people  very comfortable inside with good rain protection  it rained for us during night but we were sleeping in comfort  the material is good and it s compact  i will recommend it      
1952,1.0,                       we purchased this for an anniversary camping trip  the first time we set it up we noticed a large hole in the side where bottom meets the side  we ordered it well in advance of our trip  so unfortunately we cannot return it  very disappointed  it rained the several days  so we had to spend money on alternate accommodations as the hole would ve allowed rain to run right in      
1953,5.0,                       used it once for island camping  works great  we did get some minor rain and stayed completely dry inside  it also held up to some serious wind we had the following morning  very satisfied for the price     
1954,4.0,                       i actually like this product  i haven t got a change to use it for camping or outdoor yet but i did tried assembly it at home  super easy to follows  it did take  a bit of time for me since i m a  first time tent owner  its roomy  it look like fit for two people and some personal items  i give the rating a four stars  for now until i actually use it for real      
1955,4.0,                       this is durable great for two people with a full size large blow up mattress  it could use hooks for hanging things but but over all a well made user friendly tent     
1956,5.0,                       bought it to fill up with sand and leave it on our backyard  for the kids easy to assemble  the color  green  is exactly as shown big enough for   adults  about       kids very happy with this purchase      
1957,5.0,                       i ve used this tent about    times with no issues   goes up easily   spacious   it s never leaked the center sleeves for the polls seem like they could rip if you re not careful   thankfully mine has held up it s not suitable for backpacking   the included carrying case is about     long x    wide update  i ve had this tent for   years  maybe     trips per season   and it s still working like a champ  if you re not backpacking  i highly recommend this tent      
1958,4.0,                       very spacious inside  fits a queen size inflatable mattress and still have a lot of room for other stuff  can fit standing up  inside with no problem  nice color  easy to put away      
1959,2.0,                       pole with elastic broke during the first use  makes the entire tent rather useless      
1960,5.0,                       it says two person  but it s tight for two kids  one grown only  it was cold when they camped and the smaller the tent the easier it was to keep warm      
1961,3.0,                       zipper teeth broke off the first day of use   can t zip closed   total waste of money      
1962,5.0,                       i m very happy with this tent   i used it once  we got a heck of a down pour that night  did not find any water intrusion in the morning   kids have used it a couple more times and it s still working great      
1963,5.0,                       large  well put together  easy to open and easy to close  what more can you ask for      
1964,1.0,                       used this tent twice  once in the backyard and once at an actual campground  i m super bummed because this tent got a rip in it very easily  the rip is perfectly slit about   inches long  i am not sure if there was a weak spot in the fabric or what but i am very upset with this product because it wasn t my fault  great looking tent and even more amazing company  coleman      
1965,5.0,                       this tent was easy to set up  we arrived to our site at sundown  but still managed to get the tent up quickly  we got some rain overnight  but the tent stayed dry  it was easy to re pack too  fit   adults and a toddler and our pack perfectly      
1966,4.0,                       i m a somewhat intermediate camper  i ve camped before  but it s been a while   so while i don t know much about tents  i know that i love this one  especially for the price   it is a bit heavier and longer when broken down than i had hoped  but overall  no big complaints   its easy to set up by yourself  and the tarp bottom seems like it could take some abuse and still be just fine   coleman always seems to make good quality stuff  and this tent is no exception   i d call this a perfect starter tent      
1967,4.0,                       overall this tent is great  the only downside is since it s a darker tent  it gets warm inside quicker  otherwise  set up is quick and has survived a few summer thunderstorms with no problems      
1968,3.0,                       i ve only used this once  we were expecting rain so  having read some poor review on here  i spent a lot of time making sure it was setup correctly  even so  with a constant    hours of light rain  there were puddles inside the tent that absolutely were not condensation  we weren t swimming in there  but it definitely isn t waterproof      
1969,5.0,                       my   yr old daughter had the tent put together in a matter of minutes  it was comfortable and plenty of room  very pleased      
1970,5.0,                       i didn t experience any harsh weather or rain during my camping trip  however this was very light weight  i was thinking it would be a little bigger but it was very durable and sturdy  fits two people     
1971,1.0,                       within an hour of having this tent pitched it leaked in all four corners with light rain  i had also water sealed with coleman sealer the weekend before so it was double protected      
1972,5.0,                       light weight  easy to assemble  and easy to put back in its bag  we were first time campers and found this tent to be a breeze      
1973,5.0,                       you can not go wrong with coleman  i ve boughten many coleman tents  anyways upgrading to a bigger and bigger since lol  i went camping with this tent and i love it  it s humungous and actually always be to stand up straight  i m  ft tall  thanks      
1974,3.0,                       i was excited to try this tent out based on the reviews  however  i was somewhat let down  the first time i ever opened the box and put it together  i was at my campsite  set up was simple enough  however one of the clips for the rain fly was missing  i had to tie it down which was somewhat of a challenge  the stakes provided are pretty average  i would definitely recommend buying better stakes  another issue is the size  the tent is described as a  x ft tent  before leaving for our trip  we inflated our air mattress to measure it    feet x   feet  to make sure it fit  we knew it would be a tighter size  but there should have been room on all sides of the mattress  we inflated the mattress inside the tent  and it was pushing out the sides of the tent on   sides with roughly   inches of extra space on one side also like all the other reviews  people talking about water sealing the seams  i figured straight out of the box  for two nights  if it rained we would be fine  naturally it rained the first night  unfortunately water came in at the bottom seams  brand new tent and the seams leaked i don t plan on returning this tent because it still is a functional tent  the setup is fairly straight forward and if it doesn t rain  it keeps bugs out  i suggest not using an air mattress with this tent because it truly isn t  x  feet  sleeping three people in this tent is a huge stretch  two people is fine  i would recommend this tent for people planning on using it for maybe one night  without an air mattress  it is a perfect tent for kids wanting to sleep out in the backyard or something like that  i plan on doing more research and finding a better quality tent for our next trip      
1975,5.0,                       speaking to the tents durability  i can say you will not be disappointed  i used this at a festival where it downpoured the first night  leaving our campsite with a half a foot of water in some areas and lots of mud  while it was a bit shallower where i was  i was pleasantly surprised that i never had a problem with water getting in the tent like everyone in my group did  and the stakes stayed in the ground even in thick mud and heavy winds this is a great little tent   though the inside footprint is only a little larger than a twin air mattress  so i d recommend it for one person  unless you are very comfortable with the second person      
1976,5.0,                       very nice and cozy      
1977,5.0,                       we just did a camping tour down the eire canal using this tent   it was easy to set up and take down   it also did great in three nights of heavy rain   it did not leak   the size was good as well  my wife and i  had a double air mattress and all of gear in it   plenty of room      
1978,5.0,                       bought it for my   year old as a play tent  it s very easy to set up and it has enough air flow  love it so much      
1979,4.0,                       love it   the only issue is the cheap plastic clips and the weak stakes        
1980,5.0,                       great quality tent  super easy to put together  after the first time i can throw this thing up by myself in under    minutes  our second camp out it rain half the night pretty steady and we woke up bone dry  the stakes it come with are ok at best  splurge for the tent kit that comes with heavy duty stakes  mallet and mini broom  they will fit in the tent bag      
1981,4.0,                       i have this tent for a while now and i was impress on how easy this thing to put up  i haven t had any issues with this tent except for the front zippers  most of times when closing and opening that extra material that covers the zipper always get caught  no big deal for me as long as you re doing it correctly  the price went up for some reason that s why i give it a four star      
1982,4.0,                       i bought a couple of these tents and had them shipped directly to a program in se missouri for homeless veterans  so  i can t actually review  however  coleman makes excellent products      
1983,5.0,                       this is my first tent i ve ever used and i don t think the direction were that clear on how to set it up  overall that tent was nice and cozy      
1984,5.0,                       it heavily rained the first night of our trip and i kept expecting to feel drips but everything stayed dry  easy to set up and break down but i couldn t get it to fit back in the bag  stayed warm but not stuffy  definitely better suited for a comfortable   person with an air mattress sleep rather than four but i expected this  great purchase      
1985,4.0,                       i wish i had more room  its a bit tight with   people and   packs  i had to leave a lot of stuff in the car that i would have liked to have had in the tent with me  but it rained hard all night and it didn t leak at all      
1986,5.0,                       this tent is very well made and looks so nice set up  very happy with it      
1987,5.0,                       edit  now owned it for     years    no issues  took it to colorado for use on a   day overlanding offroading trip where we were met with heavy rain  moderate wind  no leaks  no issues pros  easy to set up  really big  fits a queen sized air mattress with room to spare   looks and feels sturdy  waterproof  very breathable cons  none really for price and purpose of the tent  heavy for backpacking or schlepping this long distances  this is a car camping tent get a tarp to put under it  the one i got which fits perfect is  grizzly tarps gtrp      feet x    feet  the rods fit right in and it protects the floor of your tent      
1988,5.0,                       great tent  i have used it for our camping trip for our family of   and it worked great  like the pockets to store my small stuff  it was good with windy weather      
1989,5.0,                       inexpensive and so easy to put up  it literally takes just a few minutes   we ve used this several times and are really happy with it   we ve been lucky that it hasn t rained on any of our camping trips so far  so i can t comment on that   this is a great little tent and a good value       
1990,5.0,                       not much of a camper  but this was easy to set up  even a novice could do it  however  really  only sleeps and houses   comfortably      
1991,5.0,                       very pleased with this tent   very easy to set up  it held up through a bad thunderstorm where it rained all night   no leaks  the tent stayed dry      
1992,1.0,                       does not mention on amazon that product does not meet prop    and could cause birth defect     days past my window to return   gave as a gift and person was upset about the prop    etc and i looked on amazon prior   i picked that tent because i did not see the warnings         
1993,5.0,                       this is a great tent  and very breathable which is great down in the south  we are happy with the quality  and it s also very quick and easy to set up  it s a little  light weight  but has been holding up well so far and endured one day of intense winds without issue      
1994,1.0,                       broke when it got here  the box tape wasn t even glued to the box so the  post office had to inform me of how it was received from the shipper  go camping easter break   and it is ripped  here i am camping with my brand new broken tent    and im sure cause of the price and im using it im stuck with it so yup    thanks for that  ants in my food this morning but hey    the tent is pretty      
1995,5.0,                       bought several of these for my bsa troop   covid has taken us from sleeping     per tent on campouts to   per tent and so we needed some tents and hammocks   these are great tents for a good price      
1996,5.0,                       i bought a tarp that i placed underneath the tent  the tent was easy to set up but i recommend getting better stakes if you want to use them more than once  tent kept us dry the whole night while it rained      
1997,5.0,                       great tent  it kept bugs out and wasn t super hot inside  our last night camping it poured the rain for hours and we never got wet  had an extra tarp over it just in case    but all in all it was a really good tent      
1998,4.0,                       i just got this tent in the mail and i will update once i go on my hiking adventure here in the next few days  out of the box  it s huge when it s packaged up  much bigger than other two person tents  this is a big deal for me because i am a hiker and not much of a camper and this sticks up out of my already large hiking pack  i had to improvise and roll it up differently and put the stakes and other parts in other compartments  again  i ll update this review after i get a chance to use it      
1999,5.0,                       went camping this weekend for the first time with this new tent  best tent i have ever had and i have had a lot  there was severe thunderstorms and torrential downpours for about   hours straight  we stayed completely dry the rain tarp works like a charm  the other campers tents were leaking and blowing away while ours remained intact and i slept right through some of the storms      
2000,5.0,                       comparing to the tent i owned before  this is better quality and it took about the same level of efforts to set up  less than    min  overall pretty happy  especially if it lasts more than   uses  only used it once so far  the inside space is tall  and i can fit two queen mattresses in it  with room left for bags and stuffs  there are two pockets hanging off the wall  makes it easy to put my wallet  phone  keys in      
2001,5.0,                       pros cheapeasy to assemblesuper cool extension cord access port  perfect for when you need to wire in power i actually managed to get it folded and packed back up into the original tent bag   amazing cons i m not sure if it was condensation or a slight leak through  but near the bottom of the tent on one side got a bit damp overnight   nothing serious though  as the rest held up through the nightly rain   i will place a towel there next time to see overall   entirely pleased for the great price      
2002,5.0,                       very roomy feeling interior and super easy to set up  we didn t encounter any weather other than wind  but it held up well on a windy night      
2003,4.0,                       got the pleasure of sleeping in this tent during a california winter storm  each night i got about   cups of water accumulation each night if you only need it for fair weather use  it s great      
2004,5.0,                       first time ever camping for both my husband and i and we loved it  easy set up and take down  zipper kept out mosquitoes and we had power right in to charge cell phones  hook in center for our fan  great little tent      
2005,3.0,                       this tent is spacious and goes up easy  unfortunately my very first time putting it up  one of the poles poked easily through the sleeve to raise the tent  creating a hole  i was barely applying pressure when this happened   the fabric simply ripped on the end of the pole during my very first use  i am disappointed by this and would spend more money in the future on a better tent  it feels like the tent poles are too thin sharp for the fabric  slightly thicker poles would be a better design      
2006,4.0,                       a full size mattress fit very snug and was hard for the tent to close   but otherwise an awesome tent for an overnight camping trip       
2007,3.0,                       pro   tent is sturdy  with stood large windy storm in the desert as well as held its own in zion canyon in the massive floods of july     cons   usable space is much less than dimensions   i m     and my head and feet were touching opposite sides each night   the ventilation is poor   only comes with   flimsy stakes when    are needed for proper mooring decent in a pinch  but not a great year to year option     
2008,2.0,                    desde que la compr  no la hab a usado  el fin de semana pasado la utilic  y hubo lluvias  el agua se filtraba y ten a que estar secando los charcos para que no se me mojar an las cosas  las filtraciones se debieron a imperfecciones que pude observar en la costura  mis amigos tienen una de estas y no les pasaba  obviamente esto no es normal         
2009,5.0,                       great     person tent   i m a new camper  but it took me less than    minutes to put it together and was a comfortable size for     people   plus it was lightweight on my backpack      
2010,5.0,                       took it on an overnight hike on the at in      with   other buddies the first time  the skies opened up before we could put the tent up  luckily we had a tarp and we set up the tent in the pouring rain underneath a    x    tarp in no time  kept us all dry throughout the night   oh and we slept on a slight slope as well  also camped out in below    weather and withstood the elements as well as any tent  not mountaineering  could  i ve car camped in it multiple times  just a tad small for a full grown family  college kids  but does the job  the floor is water resistant as well  so far no leakage  if you plan on long hikes  maybe not the best idea to bring it along  it is about a good      lbs  overall  well worth the money as a family tent      
2011,4.0,                       prior to buying this tent i went to you tube to see how to set it up   it was easier than i thought   the only time i needed the instructions was for the tip cover for when it rains   it only took me about    minutes to set up   i give it   stars because it was difficult to place the tent back in bag  the instructions given are sewed into the bag so you will never have to worry about losing them      
2012,5.0,                       this tent is easy to set up and works fine for occasional camping trips  it kept me dry during a rainstorm  it is a great value for the price      
2013,5.0,                       love this tent  too heavy for backpacking but perfect for campsite camping  much larger than i thought it would be  very easy set up  very sturdy  had it camping for   nights this summer and i can t wait to take it again next summer  highly recommend as a starter tent      
2014,4.0,                       decent tent   just not a     minute setup   think more like    if solo and staking it all down    worked well for camping in    degree weather      
2015,5.0,                       i got these for my grandchildren s birthdays   the loved them  nothing like having your own tent      
2016,5.0,                       the tent was easy and quick to install  it was a dry night so not sure how it would do in heavy rain   but likely to stand wet events only drawback was that it really only fits two adults  in the          lb range  fine for us but good to keep in mind      
2017,5.0,                       i m not a camping enthusiast  but this tent works well for our family of four   i think four adults would be a tight squeeze  but you can do it   it is easy to assemble and just as easy to disassemble   its just what we need      
2018,4.0,                       good tent but like all budget tents invest some money in some decent stakes that won t bend  first tent i ve been able to get back in the bag      
2019,5.0,                       this is the first tent i have ever owned  the size really surpised me  it is pretty big  myself  wife  and   yr old child plan on going camping soon  i set it up at home and it looks amazing  the setup cant be done alone  unless you want to risk braking the poles   the zipers look solid and showld be handled with care  keep in mind that the tent will not go back in the same bag it came out of  i would recoment puting it back in a large doufle bag so you wont have any problems  the stakes are worthless so i went to a local hardware store and bought    inch nails to use as stakes  i spent about   bucks on them  good  luck      
2020,4.0,                       the set up and tear down is a breeze  perfect for two adults and one child  the zipper pretty annoying if you aren t careful while zipping it closed  other than that  this tent is working on its third season  no holes  no rips  buy a tarp to put under it     
2021,5.0,                       not as big as advertised no way you could get a queen air mattress in it but over all great by very nice     
2022,4.0,                       good tent for the price  used it during a down pour  slight bit of water did seep in from the sides but nothing to flood the tent  expected that considering the amount of rainfall  good tent for nice forecasts or light rain    people are tight in this great for one person      
2023,5.0,                       i love this tent  very spacious  and easy to set up  when i went to a music festival it down poured for   days straight and the inside of my tent stayed completely dry  the air flaps windows that you can zipper open or close to your liking are a serious plus  you can literally set this thing up in    minutes no joke      
2024,5.0,                       i m an experienced camper   bought this one for       will fit two adults but not with their gear   that will have to hang from the tree   performed very well in the rain as we received    overnight and stayed bone dry   certainly light enough to hike with and easy to erect   it has a tarp floor  so i don t know how long that will last  but i put a pond liner down for a drop cloth to protect it   i m waiting for it to come back to     and i ll buy two more      
2025,5.0,                       perfect small little tent for   people  could fit   kids or   adults  easy to unpack n set up easy to take down n pack      
2026,5.0,                       put the tent up in mammi s living room for the  grandkids to play in  what fun  when the kids went home we put the tent away  easy to get outeasy to put up   it did take two people but was very easy  the tents long polls are all strung together on a cord you just put ends together  the tent is very well made      
2027,4.0,                       used one for  a few days in suburbia woods last year  not a bad tent  honestly   shrugs      
2028,5.0,                       i got this tent today  first  i am amazed by the inside space and height  this is what we were looking for  i hate crawling inside the tent  i want to walk    we also happen to have   queen air mattresses  so we put then in  inflate them to their fullest capacity and they all fit  leaving enough space for our backpacks and extras  see the image second  as they said  it is super easy to setup  my   years old girl and i set it up in less than    minutes  we didn t even need to consult the manual  see the image  we set it up right in the middle of our living room       
2029,5.0,                       only   queen size air mattress will fit inside but two adults can sleep comfortably on   twin matresss or sleeping bags  not a ton of leftover room for bags etc but this tent is very easy to assemble  great for beginners or quick trips     
2030,5.0,                       i m not much of a camper  but got this one for a camping trip on the beach  was very spacious and high  easy to install and pack away  has my recommendation as a noon camper      
2031,2.0,                       disappointed with the quality     of the   corner seams leaked steadily during a day of light rain   soaked through   towels   rest of the tent was fine  but   bad corner seals will be enough for me to return   i am an avid camper with plenty of experience  i am confident this was a manufacturer issue      
2032,5.0,                       quite possibly the easiest tent to put up and take down   it fits perfectly back into the bag everytime we take it down  easily fits   adults with large sleeping bags  i would highly recommend this tent to anyone looking      
2033,4.0,                       i enjoyed the larger space than my last tent  i also appreciated the ease of setting up the tent  unlike my last tent this style did not have an entrance over flap with roof and sides  although even being a small space i could put wet shoes etc outside the tent and they would dry  it saved dirt  sand  debris outside the tent      
2034,5.0,                       we put it on backyard and we put queen size mattress inside  it was great camping night     
2035,5.0,                       excellent tent  light but strong  it stood up very well to rainy weather and the ventilation was more than adequate  the zippers are well made  and setup was very straight forward  i would highly recommend this for the casual camper      
2036,5.0,                       cute little tent and kids love to play in it   bought for my granddaughters   easy to set up and take down   don t know about weatherproof or water resistance since we ve only used in good weather      
2037,5.0,                       very easy to set up  i ve used it a couple of times and it seems solid with no problems so far  definitely not a high end tent  so don t expect a      rei tent  but it s a good value      
2038,5.0,                       easy to set up and was exactly what we were looking for quick camping trips      
2039,3.0,                       i bought this tent a year ago and used it last summer and this fall  overall  easy to assemble  sturdy  and durable  though i haven t been in wind or rain  very roomy  can fit at least an adult and three kids comfortably  only problem  right after my second use  i was disassembling  and the bungy cord that holds the main rib pole together snapped in one of the poles  luckily it was only one month after the limited year warranty and coleman is replacing it      
2040,5.0,                       used it at the camp site  very good  liked it   if you are camping couple of times a year or     person amazing product  especially price is very good        
2041,5.0,                       it is bigger than other   person tents  easy to set up  it comes with a small tarp to use at the entrance of the tent  good quality      
2042,2.0,                       didn t realize this would be so heavy   it spacious for   people but inconvenient to handle  the tent poles were wonky though they held themselves well the first night  rain fly worked too  packing it back into the bag they provide was a huge pain  not a simple fold and stuff packing  should have given a size adjustable stuff sack to make life easier  i have to return this product simply because of the weight and the packing inconvenience     
2043,5.0,                       i bought this for use on the beach  not camping  so keep that in mind  we took it out on a misty  very windy day and it was solid as a rock and moisture free  big enough for two tall people  i m      and could stretch out for a nice nap   caveat  not a lot of place to put stuff  like a beer  for instance      
2044,5.0,                       i have used this tent several time over the past few months   it has done me well   easy to set up and take down good for one or two people   more than that would be a little tight   enjoy      
2045,5.0,                       used it once with my grand children in my back yard  we loved it and are planning a real camping trip      
2046,4.0,                       very nice tent  however its more of a   person then    fits a queen and a full air mattress inside      
2047,5.0,                       solid  only disappointment was that only a portion of door unzipped to be screened in window      
2048,5.0,                       bought this as a gift and feel it was well made and a good value  no complaints      
2049,5.0,                       we have used this tent twice so far   the first was a   day rock festival   no problems with set up or packing it   it didn t leak during a small rain shower   the second time was for a   night boy scouts ordeal   no problem either   easily accomodates a queen sized air mattress with room to spare  very good quality for the price  like most tents that state   person  it is roomy for    comfortable for   and a tight fit for   adults      
2050,5.0,                       cant say it was easy to install for one person  esp a   ft   female  but i love it  very lightweight and convenenient      
2051,5.0,                       i use this down in south florida  easy to put up  comfortable inside  i recommend limiting it to   people  you can fit   but occupants will be stepping over each other to move in and out  with   you can have plenty of space to get in and out without stomping on toes and fingers      
2052,5.0,                       this is simply the best standard tent ever   we bought this to replace our    year old sundome tent   you know it is a good tent when they ve been making the same model for that long   improvements that i noticed over the old model are  better ventilation  better door shape  better carrying sack  better rainfly  comes with a little shoe mat   i ve had several other brand tents and this is by far the best i ve had   stands the test of time      
2053,5.0,                       i had never been camping before  and this tent was one of the first things i bought for my first experience  it was a good camping trip except for one small part  it rained   hard  whole night  and the tent held up  in spite of the winds  the rains  everything the tent was completely dry inside and was quite comfortable  just one thing though  this tent fits   people comfortably  i supposed   could sleep in it  but it would be quite cramped and one last thing for those who are wondering  the tent has a floor      
2054,3.0,                       nice looking tent but had to return the tent  it leaked in mild rain  wasn t going to chance a replacement  will look for something else      
2055,1.0,                       the pole that connects the front and back of the topper broke after the first use  the string on the inside snapped while taking the tent down  i haven t even had the tent a week  super disappointed  hopefully the strings in the poles that hold the tent up will hold up longer      
2056,5.0,                       great little tent  used it for the first time on a white water rafting trip with my husband where it rained all three days  stayed nice and dry on the inside except for where we tracked in the wet ourselves  the folded up raised edge of the bottom drop cloth helped a lot in keeping all the rain out      
2057,5.0,                       we used the sundome camping near monument valley utah there was an incredible thunder storm that night and we only had this tent  the winds were       mph practically collapsing the tent  the rain was torrential  but you know what  we stayed dry and the tent survived to see another camping trip      
2058,5.0,                       went on an expedition trip in moab  utah and used this tent  it sets up very quickly and has plenty of room for my air mattress and equipment     
2059,4.0,                       so my second camping trip with this tent i experienced heavy rains over night for several hours  i did have   small puddles inside in the morning but considering how hard it rained i didn t mind a little water  good for the price        
2060,5.0,                       excellent beginner s tent for light camping in mild weather  did some beach camping but unfortunately encountered some moderate gusts wind  which the provided standard steel tent stakes will not hold against  not the fault of the tent setup  just user failure ignorance  a dead man s anchor system for staking down the tent would have been the correct way to set up camp for that trip  next time      
2061,5.0,                       this tent is cute  i set it up by myself in just a few minutes  i like the airflow flap and the extra coverage over the zippers  the original idea for this tent was to have my kids play in it while we have the big tent for sleeping but i might just set it up in the back yard for the night  i will probably set it up under an additional tarp for added protection      
2062,5.0,                       had allot of tents over the years  this is no frills  but a sleek and easy assembly choice for the price     
2063,5.0,                       great little tent  held a queen air mattress  two kids sleeping bags and   duffle bags comfortably  we ordered the   person      
2064,4.0,                       great tent   my kids love it  the tent is pretty solid and easy to set up  however after   hours rain the water was everywhere inside     however for over   hours it stayed dry        
2065,4.0,                       very solid tent for the price  set up is relatively easy  and plenty of stakes are included  i ve taken it out a couple times in rainy pnw weather on already damp ground and the tarp like bottom  no need to bring a tarp or footprint  and rainfly have kept the inside bone dry  the only concern i have is the longevity of the poles  they re made of plastic and it s a tall tent so you have to flex them quite a bit  but considering coleman sells replacements for       and the pricepoint of the tent itself  the tent is absolutely a worthwhile purchase for a frequent car camper      
2066,5.0,                       so far so good  the first night of use  it withstood a good size rain storm  my son stayed dry while other scouts  tents leaked  will update at the end of the camping season to see how well it holds up      
2067,5.0,                       i ve used this thing for   adults camping all over the country and especially colorado where i live  it has always been good to me and a very easy setup break down  highly satisfied     
2068,5.0,                       best tent and very durable  easy to assemble  years using it and have work good  even in high winds      
2069,5.0,                       nice little tent for my boys          set up in a drizzle and made it through a rough night of downpour with no leaks   can t ask for much more than that   super easy to set up and take down      
2070,5.0,                       i have been using it as a living room tent for the kids  perfect size for them and the living room  not sure on the water resistance or weatherproof      
2071,5.0,                       took me less then    minutes to set it up solo brand new out of the box   i am well experienced with tents   very large  quite roomy   can fit two queen size inflatable beds with about a foot in between them in the middle  fantastic for the price      
2072,5.0,                       this tent was easy to set up and worked well for camping  my    yo daughter was able to set it up by herself without issues     
2073,4.0,                       standard tent other than the assembly  you have to bend two of the sticks  when there is no clip or anything to keep the sticks in place while you re bending one side  my suggestion if you are dealing with this test  is to stick one side into the ground  to act is that clip      
2074,5.0,                       great tent  very spacious  super easy to put together  windows provide great airflow     
2075,5.0,                       this tent was perfect size for   people   a    lb dog with  plenty of space for   overnight duffles   easy to assemble and folds up small for compact packing   great price for the quality   used for beach camping and had to use extra rope to tie down  but will be using again for more trips   our dog loved it so much  he just hung out in it by himself for hours          
2076,1.0,                       used it for camping trip on          water started sipping in from top and side of seam of the tent when it rain  we were wait the whole night even thought we put a tarp under the tent  very disappointed  passed my return day stuck with payment and   of these tents      
2077,4.0,                       this tent did a great job of keeping water and bugs out  the mesh top was fantastic for stargazing  and it has a cover to keep our rain over the mesh  the only drawback is that the tent barely sleeps two shorter adults  and wouldn t be ideal for larger  taller people unless only one person uses it      
2078,5.0,                       a great choice made buying this tent  roomy and plenty of room      
2079,4.0,                       we ordered a blue tent   we got a green one   it was a bit more difficult to assemble than anticipated   other than those minuses  it turned out to be a great tent      
2080,5.0,                       i love my new tent  my friend had one and i am so happy  the tent is very breezy with the doors open and rain fly off      
2081,5.0,                       camping two nights in it so far   first night it drizzled  second night it poured   i stayed absolutely bone dry both nights also  it packs super tiny would highly recommend      
2082,1.0,                       i bought this tent couple of days before my camping trip and when i was setting up camp  i realized the rod rubber rope that hold the sticks together is ripped  straight outta the box  i managed to use tape to hold it together   very mess up     
2083,3.0,                       poor build quality  seems started coming apart with forrest use     
2084,5.0,                       i have used this tent many times in all weather  it has held up very well  i have used it in the pacific north west in the winter with a heater  worked very well  i sprayed it with camp dry before i used it  has never leaked  i have the   man size  and it is perfect for   adults with gear  could fit   in a pinch  i would purchase this tent again     
2085,5.0,                       perfect tent   well packed and arrived timelyit was easy to set up    minutes and handled well the rain on our second day of camping fitted two twin mattresses well  easy to pack up and clean she reassured to come back      
2086,3.0,                       i bought   for my camping trip   it was raining pretty hard for   solid hours  more than   inche total    about   minutes in  one tent leaked at all four corners at the base   the other leaked at   corners also at the base   we were able to keep the tents dry with some paper towels   i m debating if i should send them back   friends told me i should be able to fix the leaks with some seam sealer set up was very easy repackaging as always was difficult as expected      
2087,5.0,                       very pleased with this tent  easy to set up and it s the perfect size      
2088,5.0,                       the tent takes nearly   minutes to assemble once you know what you are doing    this coleman tent is one of the best tent ive bought    there is no regrets    worked fine      just coming back from camp      plus not expensive    very affordable    and it can fit almost   persons base on how you place down you sleeping bags good and best buy      
2089,5.0,                       awesome tent  i bought this thing for the wife and i to go camping  it s big enough to put a queen size mattress and big enough to be comfortable in but small enough to be compact and easily carried  it s got great built in features too  there are small pockets to put your valuables  ventilation all over the place but the rainfly is great and keeps out the dew and rain  really great quality  would buy it again     
2090,4.0,                       great little tent for the money  i wouldn t take it to mt  everest but for light camping where you don t need to hike with the tent it s perfect  it s super fast and easy to assemble  my one complaint is that the side vents windows don t have any privacy unless you put the rain topper on  i would prefer being able to zip those closed  not just for privacy but for warmth in a cooler climate      
2091,5.0,                       held up good in a downpour   windy thunderstormsupposed to be a   person tent but two adults and a   year old were more than enoughno way you re getting   adults in this tent     
2092,5.0,                       we were camping in caprocks canyon in northern texas and a storm shows up at   in the morning  the wind kept violently pushing at the tent keeping my friend and i awake for about an hour  i said if this tent survives the night  i m writing a   star review on amazon      
2093,5.0,                       love the ease of this item     
2094,5.0,                       i havent tried this one yet  but i had one just like it a few yrs ago and rode out a super cell in it  never felt a drop  my only worry was a falling tree  very stout design     person is really   and gear    is really   and gear     
2095,5.0,                       what to say about this tent  it is very spacious it fits my family of   perfectly and we still have some extra room it is easy to assemble and disassemble it too i love that it is not bulky and just fits any luggage  in case of traveling to other countries the price was great and the quality is great as well so far  i am very satisfied with my purchase      
2096,5.0,                       it s exactly what i wanted and came in     days when i was expecting it in a week     good size for a queen size air pump mattress     
2097,1.0,                       the stitches holding plastic hooks that attach to the poles started ripping the first time i put it up  absolute garbage quality  going back right away  not buying coleman again      
2098,4.0,                       son is a scout and this is his tent   looks good as these things go  i am sort of person who motels were invented to use   price was more than reasonable and coleman is a great  brand for quality      
2099,5.0,                       great tent     
2100,5.0,                       bought for a weekend of camping  worked well for me and   kids  have a larger coleman but didn t want to use that one for   people      
2101,1.0,                       very dissappointed in this tent  bought it specifically because it had the coleman name on it  did not fit my queen size air mattress  the ends with the screen does not have any way to close during cold nights  should have a flap to zip up  would not recommend this tent to anyone unless they live in a very warm climate     
2102,5.0,                       coleman products never disappoint  theyre great for the price  this tent not excluded  it is roomy and well made      
2103,5.0,                       easy for   person to set up  kept the rain out through a storm and plenty big enough for   people  for the price can t be beat      
2104,4.0,                       gave this tent   stars due to the fact its a   season tent   but it done its job for what i needed and was priced at time of purchase      
2105,4.0,                       this tent is easy to put up  roomy for   cots  people   their gear  but   would be a squeeze the only reason i gave it   stars instead of   is the door  we have this tent from coleman  but for   people and it has the  d  door that allows you keep the door closed without constantly zipping  i don t know why coleman didn t make his one with a  d   it would have made it much more convenient but for the price  it s a great tent      
2106,5.0,                       cozy for   people  my wife and i have used it only twice but we haven t had any issues with it  will not recommend for sub zero camping  but we survived because of mammoth camping bag  we haven t tried it in rain  but will be interested to see if it works as advertised      
2107,5.0,                       great tent  little bigger then the other   people tents i owned  easy to pack with the added extension to the volume of the bag fast arrival even with the extra shipping fee to israel  it s cheaper then here   or any other   people tent in my country  good quality tent  great buy      
2108,5.0,                       been using this tent for a couple years now and no issues whatsoever   it s easy enough to put up that one person can do it alone and fairly quickly      
2109,5.0,                       have taken this on a couple camping trips never had a problem through wind and rain  holds up  easy to put up  like any tent it says it s three person  that s three person abreast i use it as a single so  i have room for a cot and my gear      
2110,5.0,                       deciding how many stars to give a product is a tough call  because you need to factor in cost  are we giving out stars based  just  on the product itself relative to others regardless of cost  the hyundai we had i d rate as   stars based on how much we paid for it  but is it as nice as a new mercedes  of course not  for the money  this tent is definitely a five star tent so i m going with that   is it the  best  ten out there of course not  go to some other camping sites though and see how much a similar sized  high quality  tent costs  like others have mentioned this tent sets up easily  rain fly was a bit more annoying but not difficult  and does the job  i haven t had to use it yet in the rain so i can t vouch for how it hold s up in the rain  but i did use it under fairly heavy winds and it held up fine  although the windward side of course was pushed in some due to the wind    like others have mentioned  it s not a    person  tent    but neither are the expensive tents what they claim to be either so i m not going to hold it against the product for claiming to be a   person tent  i m           lbs  and had plenty of room with all our gear and one other person in the tent  if i was sharing it with my wife  she and another child could fit in there with gear but it would be tight  all that being said  it was actually bigger than expected inside based on what i was imagining when i heard others complain about it not being large enough i live in florida so what i liked was that it very large netted windows which allows for a lot of cross breeze  obviously with the rain fly up this would be limited   the two small pockets hanging inside were a nice touch note  although i gave this five stars  i did so based on the cost so i will add that if i were going to purchase a tent that i needed for hardcore camping  for example i need to rely on for a month straight of camping while hiking the appalachian trail   i d go with a higher quality built tent  this tent  although it s great for my casual weekend camping needs  does seem like it might rip very easily or break at the seams  but it hasn t yet for me   if you re a hardcore camper you probably aren t even reading this review anyway and are going straight to rei or something   also if it s primary use would be for camping in very cold climates with snow  i d probably get something more durable as well  for the majority of people though  i think this tent would be perfect  especially if on a budget      
2111,4.0,                       i haven t been able to use this outside yet  but i set it up in my apartment   it took about    minutes to set up by myself in a tight area  so it would be much easier in a campsite   it was very easy to take apart and fit back into the bag   i like that it came with a small tarp that can be used as a doormat   the tent is quite small and could fit a couple  but they would have to be laying parallel to the door  so whoever is sleeping towards the back will have a difficult time getting out      
2112,3.0,                       i like it for the usual normal usage and ease and speed of setup  but neither is it full proof to wind or rain  so please beware  i just avoid these two elements if i can  it s easily avoided as it s my backyard  i won t take this to camp for sure      
2113,4.0,                        easy set up cheap costonly thing i wished i would have looked more into is the the rain fly doesn t cover closer to the ground   windy nights let a breeze through under the rain fly which would be nice on summer night but i used it when temps were at     at night and it was a chilly breeze coming off the lake  but  not unbearable      
2114,5.0,                       my first tent ever and this couldn t have been a better choice  and only       heck  most sporting goods stores sell rain jackets for more than that   took it out of the box and set it up by myself in my yard  so easy    minutes to set up the tent and another   to add the rain flap  once i saw how it went  the second time took less than   minutes start to finish  first night camping it rained like heck and while it was plenty muddy outside in the morning  my tent and gear  and me  remained perfectly dry  just remember to use a tarp underneath  also  just like the directions say  push the poles through the fabric tubes and don t pull   pulling will risk ruining the elastic cord  not to mention that pushing is a ton easier than pulling because that elastic cord stretches  i m a car camper  so i can t say how it would be to haul around backpacking  but it rolls up pretty compactly and actually does go back inside the little bag it came in  very impressive  i watched a lot of youtube videos on this product before buying it and the most common comment in them was  don t know what this one piece is for    if you buy this tent  which you absolutely should  and find yourself wondering the same thing  check out the attached picture  it s a welcome mat   love love love this little tent      
2115,5.0,                       great tent  i just can t believe anyone is able to physically get it back in this tiny bag to store it      
2116,1.0,                       no uv protection do not buy this and use it in the sun camping   dangerous        
2117,4.0,                       easy to assemble  can t comment on the durability to moisture  as an experienced tenter i always tarp my tents  there are zero tents that can withstand   hours of rain two days in a row  the windows don t open to the floor  door easily opened and closed  it s great for a few days      
2118,5.0,                       super easy to put up     minutes like advertised  it s light weight and easy to carry  i went beach camping  so didn t get it wet  but i sprayed the tent with bug spray and it was fine  great price for the product     
2119,5.0,                       on my first camping trip with my baby there was a bit of a cloudburst and the rain cover kept us      dry  it s a good tent  definitely purchase the bigger stakes for the corners  and use the smaller ones for the rain cover and vent      
2120,5.0,                       purchased this tent as my lightweight tent for kayak camping along rivers in the future   i have used this tent  x now to try it out and both times it has been great   easy to setup and perfect for   person who is traveling light with a single air mattress and a few bags   i have kept warm and dry even when there is a lot of moisture and dew in the morning   it is much better than my   person academy brand tent that gives me more room   i recently purchased the   person version of this tent as my main tent when solo camping regularly and can t wait to try it out   the tent performs and looks great too   highly recommend buying this tent      
2121,4.0,                       great tent  took to dale hollow  held up good during a very windy day  stayed dry during a night of thunderstorms  however  a section of one of the tent poles split      
2122,4.0,                       this is a good tent for the money  don t think you re gonna backpack too often with it  probably  as in never  for campsites in state parks  perfect      
2123,5.0,                       this is a nice and pricey tent  it takes less than   minutes to set it up  enough space for   people and some luggage  good value for the money     
2124,5.0,                       not a big camper   bought this based upon simplicity  reviews and price   during my second use in a    hour period my group experienced heavy winds  gusts    mph   thunderstorms  downpour  then heat and calmness  followed by a    degree drop in temperature and more heavy winds   i cannot believe this thing held up all night and stayed dry   especially with me putting it together   you really can t go wrong with this tent      
2125,5.0,                       we got eight people comfortably in this tent  four adults and four children  plus our bags  we always got for a ten person tent but i wanted something a little smaller this time and i m not disappointed     
2126,3.0,                       decent tent  but it wasn t long before mine broke  it s very simply put together and compact  but the tent poles are far too weak in my opinion  as i dissembled it on the third time ever  it got caught within the sleeve  not even pulling at it that hard and it snapped like a twig  was pretty disappointed at the time  next time i will invest in something made of stronger material      
2127,4.0,                       one thing thatis not apparent in the description or the pictures is that the upper half all the way around except the door is mosquito netting  great air circulation for summer  suprised me in spring and we got chilly  has a light fan hook in the roof so im happy with that  i dont know what the lower air circulation mosquito netting is for but nice tent just dont use it in cooler months and definitely not winter      
2128,5.0,                       used it for the first time last night in heavy winds and rain   the wind lifted our    ft x    ft canopy tent off the ground and flipped it upside down   the coleman tent never budged and we stayed dry   we put a queen sized air mattress in it and still had room for other stuff   i highly recommend this tent   lots of features on this tent      
2129,5.0,                       great tent and very good quality  fit   adult men with plenty of room and a backpack      
2130,5.0,                       this tent is impressive for the price  truly is wind proof and an waterproof  i took it out to the desert when it rained with crazy winds and it held up greatly  plus a big plus was the ease of putting the tent up  it took less than    minutes to get it up  it will probably be faster the next time i try now that i got it done once  definetly buying this tent again      
2131,5.0,                       great tent  had it for a year  easy to set up and enough room for   people if you want to have a little  storage space and legroom  might be able to jam   people in there  but will be tight did well in the rain as well  haven t had it in very heavy rain yet  all the sides are open so you ll always have fresh air best from fl     
2132,5.0,                       love the tent  easy to set up and take down by a single person  quick too    man tent would sleep   tight  easily fits a coleman queen blow up mattress and leaves room for gear and another sleeper off the mattress  i blew up the mattress completely before putting it in tent and wouldn t do it again  blow it up most of the way but give yourself some wiggle room so you re not stretching the door  didn t get rain so i ll change this if anything fails but i m assuming it won t      
2133,3.0,                       originally reviewed for   starsafter using this for the past two years i am removing   stars i have camped for over    years  but this is our first tent for our family  it s okay    person tent and is spacious enough for a family of four  luggage  etc complaints  after   years of using    camping trips      if you remove the rain fly you lose all privacy  i have previously camped in tents that the windows were zippered and prefer that over screened windows covered by the rain fly     the guide channels on the top of the tent have torn from sliding the poles through them  still usable  but irritating in the future we will probably upgrade to a larger tent with zippered windows on all sides of the tent      
2134,5.0,                       perfect size for    i can fit two twin air mattresses easily  tight fit for    but do able   the set up is a breeze  i love the color scheme   if you are tall and like to stand up  pick another tent   i m      and have to crouch in the middle  but this wasn t a major deal breaker for me      
2135,5.0,                       this reasonably priced tent is proof that you don t have to go to an outdoor store and spend a small fortune to get a good tent   this one is roomy  has plenty of zippered ventilation  a good rain flap  and is coated around the bottom to prevent water from running in during a rainstorm   i highly recommend this tent   we used it at the beach on a windy day and it stayed put nicely witht he stakes that are included      
2136,5.0,                       wish i would have bought coleman instead of what i had for years  finally a tent that won t leak  thanks guys  the camping trip was off the hook      
2137,5.0,                       good tent    but when we bought on amazon seller said it has built in led lights and had just need some batteries to use them  but we set up the tent we didnt find any lights and had to use flash lights    disappointed with sales pitch    two qwueen beds can be accommodated  its good for two elders and two kids or three elders  four elders is crowded      
2138,5.0,                       i was really impressed by this tent  really easy to set up  rained the first night i used it and it kept me completely dry and didn t let any water in  i got the   person tent but it can really only hold   people comfortably  so depending on how many people you ll have with you get the next size up  for the price this definitely did the job     
2139,5.0,                       you can t go wrong with a coleman tent  it would be difficult to fit   people in this tent  especially with all of their gear  but for   with gear  you would have plenty of room to spare  great construction  my favorite feature  not that i have used it  but i really like it  is the zipper for electrical cords  now if the kids want to have a  camp out  in the back yard  we can take a laptop or whatever and watch a movie or something  great buy  and i would recommend it      
2140,3.0,                       warehouse deal arrived with no poles   return was easy   purchased a blue replacement that was perfect      
2141,5.0,                       only used it a handful of times but the very first time we used it  it rained cats and dogs  people near us were getting wet  we had the rain guard on  of course  and a tarp underneath it that was it  there was very little wind but for my fiancee and i this is perfect  would suggest something bigger if more than two adults and a small child  oh  it does stay very warm in the winter  we live in florida so take that with a grain of salt      degrees outside if i remember correctly      
2142,5.0,                       bought this as our first real tent for a camping trip  it s plenty big enough for a queen sized air mattress with about   feet of extra space on the side  the second night it rained heavily and while the area below the rain guard became saturated with water  very little if any actually made it into the inside of the tent my only recommendation would be to possibly apply waterproofing to the tent if you plan on using it in inclement weather      
2143,5.0,                       amazing tent  has nets everywhere so that fresh air can be let inside  not a single bug got in  each net can also be closed up whenever  traps heat very very well  a great way to lay down and look up at the stars without any creepy crawlies around  would reccomend      
2144,3.0,                       water did get in  it was a thunder storm but i seen it coming through the seam  but for the price  i expected it      
2145,4.0,                       great tent however there is a bit of the fabric that had already pulled away from the seams before we even set it up  seems like a good amount of room for our queen sized inflated mattress and our tots of things  we are looking forward to using it however i am quite concerned about the seams  we used the seam sealer on it but could be returning it in the near future      
2146,4.0,                       was easy enough for adolescents to erect and dismantle   no more roomy than described  but does the job for weekend  impossible to stand up even in center      
2147,5.0,                       cute  easy to set up backyard tent for the kids  havent tested in any extreme elements     
2148,5.0,                       this was the first time in my life i had to put up and take down a tent alone  it was my sons first scout camp out and i had to attend with him  super easy  fit two of us and all our stuff comfortably  i would buy again for sure      
2149,3.0,                       bought it for two night camping and one of the poles broke when taking the tent down  expected more from coleman  disappointed  will be returning   the tent otherwise was a roomie tent with good ventilation      
2150,5.0,                       coleman   person tent has been used successfully on   camping trips   recent trip was a week long canoe camping trip down the delaware river and it proved to be lightweight  compact and functional   yes  there are more compact and lighter tent options out there  but for the price point this tent is a very good choice      
2151,5.0,                       tent worked fine for what we needed  daughter and grandson used it to camp in my back yard  she put it up and said it was about the easiest tent to set up that she has done  there was room inside to put   twin sized air mattresses and still have a tiny bit of room to put your feet on the floor of the tent to get around  for those of you who might wonder about inside space like i did       
2152,5.0,                       owned this tent for awhile now and i couldn t be happier   perfect for up north weekend trips  keeps you dry when it rains and holds up doing the windy days nights  very easy to setup too  would definitely recommend this tent to my friends and family      
2153,5.0,                       perfect for traveling and festivals  fits into a standard suitcase  light weight  easy setup  and great for the price      
2154,3.0,                       i am     and could not stand up in this alone and two people will have to squish to sleep      
2155,4.0,                       i took my family camping with this tent last week  the forecast called for rain  i had wanted to seal the seams before we left  but didn t get a chance  we had thunderstorms with frequent downpours  and we stayed completely dry  no rips or tears so far  plenty of room for the   of us    adults and   kids under        
2156,5.0,                       two years ago i bought the   person version of this tent for myself and two kids  i loved that tent so much  when i needed to down size to a tent for just me i decided to get a smaller version of the same tent  i could have gone smaller  but decided i d rather have the room inside and i really wanted a   foot width to accommodate my cot with plenty of room find my review of the   man sundome and much of it will apply to this   man version on our first camping trip  with this tent  we had a nice thunderstorm one night and i was one of the only tents to remain completely dry inside it is not a backpacking tent  it s not small when stowed and it is heavy  but for short distance or trunk camping  it s a great solution  the tent is super easy to put up   i do it by myself without problem i put down an   x    foot  i fold in the edges  and i put another ground cover    x    inside the tents to keep the tent floor clean and to help protect the floor from wear  with the windows open it gets a good air flow and buttons up nice when the weather turn cold  or wet  as with all tents  put in every tent stake and use every taught line  pitch the tent tightly so there are no creases or folds in the surfaces and it will survive pretty dramatic weather if it needs to      
2157,5.0,                       everything one should expect from a tent  has plenty of room and is really easy to set up and take down  unlike most tents  it s easy to pack everything back up into the original bag      
2158,5.0,                       perfect for   adults  it would be too crammed to fit any more  maybe a small child with  but i like having the extra space to put things we didn t want getting wet     
2159,5.0,                       very nice tent  went up in    min just like the website said  looks well made  light weight  with good air circulation  i bought a tent fan a couple years ago hangs nicely in the center  sprayed it down hard with lots of water and it is bone dry inside      
2160,4.0,                       used a couple times  rainfly worked great in the rain if you are squeezing   people in here  you are sleeping shoulder to shoulder lol  for two people  this is fine  but could even be a bit bigger imo  one queen air mattress takes up the entire tent for reference      
2161,5.0,                       super easy to set up even with   person   folds down really small which is excellent   a nice tent for traveling by yourself but with a camp mattress and sleeping bag inside it s not quiiiiiite big enough for   people   if you can store your gear elsewhere it would be great   haven t been able to test outside yet but so far i m impressed     
2162,5.0,                       got a larger coleman and like the heavy duty bottom  so i got this for myself  need to be careful when zipping to keep the zipper rain flap out of the zipper  seems like good enough construction  two person setup helps  but you can do with one  for backpacking i might want a lighter one  but for car camping this is great      
2163,4.0,                       i tried this tent out for some light weekend camping and it s great  only real problem is that my tent didn t come with any stakes so i couldn t fasten down the rain fly and the lower vent  but a simple trip to target or walmart will solve it      
2164,5.0,                       i recommend coleman       went camping and experience a heavy thunderstorm  saw no leaks and didn t bother to put a tarp over it  had a different brand tent and we always put a tarp over it because we had minor leaks  amazed by coleman and how waterproof it is      
2165,5.0,                       this is a great tent  it is exactly as described and work perfectly for my camping trip  it had plenty of room and was easy to put up and take down      
2166,5.0,                       super easy set up  first time on my own took    minutes  however indoors    its kinda fun to sleep in a tent  basically no experience needed camping tent  takes up little room  and it fit me and my gf with plenty room to spare  also tall enough to stand on your knees easily at           
2167,5.0,                       have very limited use on this tent so far  so i can t comment on it s longevity or sturdiness  but the size and layout are really nice  sets up very easy  plenty large enough for     people  and has some nice features  great middle of the road tent for car camping  hope to get more use out of it soon      
2168,5.0,                       got this for camping for when i cant camp in my hammock but it is quick and easy      
2169,5.0,                       easy set up  rained most of the night and not a drop inside anywhere      
2170,5.0,                         years now and still going strong  other scouts rents didnt last the year but were getting ready to start our  rd year      
2171,5.0,                       perfect go anywhere tent with enough room for a small family  great for a couple too  we tried some of the other designs and they are too complicated  this one uses space well  holds up in strong wind  super water resistant  perfect minimalist  classic tent with enough space and headroom to feel a tad luxurious      
2172,5.0,                       i would never cram   people in this tent   however it works nicely for my son  husband  and myself   it s easy to put together and fits a twin and a queen blow up inside   we have camped with it several times now and it is holding up well      
2173,5.0,                       good tent  comfortably fits in    people  we are all between           tall  with room for maybe   more person  we could fit in   full backpacks    sleeping bags and a whole bunch of electronics in this tent and still have more room  the set up was easy  clean up was easy as well      
2174,5.0,                       went camping for the first time in a while and i felt it was time to buy my own tent   i love this  its extremely easy to put up  and fit me and my friend perfectly  i also have the coleman queen size blow up mattress that is tall  which fit agains the side  so we had the other  rd of the tent to put our stuff  it was tight  but for two people  unless your trying to cram in there like sardines  i would say this fits   people  not          
2175,3.0,                       this tent is an awkward size  not really large enough for two people  and much too big heavy for a single backpacker  it s better for car camping given it s carry weight and extra ports for electricity  etc  it holds up nicely in weather  but not something i d buy again  it is extremely easy to set up      
2176,5.0,                       easy to set up   lightweight   great rain protection   perfect for taking in the canoe when doing overnight trips   great for   people   good for     cramped with   adults      
2177,5.0,                       was surprised how well it stood up to a lot of wind and rain      
2178,5.0,                       i like this tend very much  i bought   person tend and it can fits   person comfortably  the material is very good  and it is very light  i camp at canyon  sequoias and yosemite  and i don t have any problem  the tend is easy to assemble and disassemble  it protect you of any insects and other little animals  during the night the temperature was about    celsius  so to use it in cold places the sleep bag is necessary  the pictures show two tends  one of   person and other for   person  of my friends  it exactly of mine but bigger       
2179,4.0,                       this tent worked great for   adults and   backpacks   very roomy and had glasses pockets also a small loop for a lantern on the ceiling   it says    minute set up and i d say that s accurate      
2180,5.0,                       purchased as a gift for my nephew to camp with us  great starter tent  easy to assemble  take apart  and pack up  perfect for one or two people  so far it s held up two seasons of camping   very pleased with this product and will be purchasing another one      
2181,5.0,                       super easy to setup and install  sturdy and well made      
2182,2.0,                       i bought this tent for a week long camping trip with family   the coleman sundome tent is a nice tent but developed a tear at the zipper on the top of the door   we discovered this hole as soon as we erected the tent   the zipper is really weak as well   needless to say but this tent was sent back as soon as i got home      
2183,5.0,                       i haven t camped in close to    years  so got a recommendation from a cousin regarding a good  inexpensive tent for two people   i m glad i took his advice   this tent is simple to set up and roomy   we set it up at home prior to leaving for our trip to get a little practice and sealed the seams  when we arrived at our campground it was very dark but we were able to set up without an issue   we had one night of torrential rain and the rain fly performed as expected   not a drop of water inside the tent   i would definitely recommend coleman      
2184,5.0,                       this is a nice tent   easy to set up and works well   has lots of features as far as letting fresh air in   everything is pretty much what you expect   i m not sure how to distinguish a good tent from a phenomenal one but i could not find any problems with this one      
2185,5.0,                       bought for my   year daughter  perfect size for a backyard  girls clubhouse  rained cats   dogs the day i put it up   no water came inside  she loves it and so do i  we put a tarp underneath and a cheap area rug inside  now its carpeted from one end to the other and she has put   chairs inside  hours of safe fun  would recommend and buy again      
2186,5.0,                       worked great  very easy to assemble and tear down for that matter   my wife and i used it on a motorcycle camping trip   sturdy  light and compact just perfect   oh  and it rained one night and we stayed dry      
2187,4.0,                       took us a little bit to figure it out  but was fairly easy to put together      
2188,5.0,                       a great tent with easy set up  we bought it for  car camping   we are two adults and a five year old  we fit well with lots of extra room  you could probably easily fit a queen mattress inside with extra room  break down was easy too  it was a little difficult to get everything back in the bag  but we managed it  i recommend getting the coleman tent kit along with this tent      
2189,1.0,                       i bought this tent in july  but didn t use it until october      after the return window closed on this tent which i certainly would have returned because the corner anchors fell apart after one use  terrible product   very disappointed      
2190,5.0,                       used this tent and it was lightweight to carry  perfect size for   adults and one child  set up in under    mins and kept us dry  best purchase of the summer       
2191,5.0,                       great tent  durable  waterproof  and easy to set up      
2192,5.0,                       this tent is very roomy  even with   or   people    it is easy to setup and take down   this is a fantastic warmer weather tent   if you re looking for a tent for colder or more extreme environments  you may want to consider a different tent   i camp quite often and have recommended this tent to several friends  all love it      
2193,1.0,                       it poured on our camping trip and water dripped inside the tent even with rain protector      
2194,5.0,                       i bought this primarily for our grandchildren  two of them and their mother spent the night in it on christmas eve in our den and they loved it  excellent coleman quality  nice size and easy setup  highly recommend      
2195,5.0,                       intuitive and easy to set up  comfortable and functional  as well      
2196,5.0,                       first time we used this tent it poured rain for hours  i hadn t gotten the chance to seam seal yet  so we thought we were doomed  this tent really surprised us as the inside stayed bone dry  very easy set up and we ve had no issue fitting it back into the bag after use      
2197,5.0,                       i purchased the   person tent   it will comfortably fit   adults with gear  or   with minimal other stuff in the tent  very easy and quick assembly with   poles  took   minutes to put up  solo  my one complaint is that the tent did not come with stakes      
2198,5.0,                       great tent all around   i use this on wildland fire assignments        days at a time  and camping   easy set up and take down   great tent unless you are backpacking into remote areas  gets a tad heavy    overall great product      
2199,5.0,                       it even had a cellphone pocket inside off the ground  very thoughtful design  plenty of room too      
2200,5.0,                       great summer tent  high quality i ve come to expect from coleman  will keep a moderate rain out  a heavy or sideways rain can get up under the fly  i used it for myself and my foot locker  quick and easy setup  i ve come to notice over the years of boy scouts and camping that your gear should count as one person  so don t get a two person tent if you want two people and their gear in  the same tent  that s not any fault of the tent  it s just logistics      
2201,5.0,                       light weight and ease to assemble   i used it overnight during the summer months for my kids   they enjoyed the camping experience      
2202,5.0,                       used this for   nights in yellowstone   super roomy for a   x    holds a queen size airmattress  even a tall one  very nicely   easy setup  coleman quality      
2203,5.0,                       so far so good  set up is easy  we have sprayed it with weather proof spray  great size for my hubs  toddler and i to camp in  seems durable so far      
2204,4.0,                       i got this and while i have not used it outside yet i did ser it up indoors  it truly is a   person tent  it was super easy to setup  i set it up in less than    minutes by myself while   excited kids anxiously and impatiently waited for me to out it together  i have rated it as a   because i have yet to use it outdoors and can t speak to its durability      
2205,5.0,                       nice tent for the price   easy to put together and seems well made   withstood moderate rain and wind      
2206,5.0,                       i loved it  and the colors too   i use it just for myself  i m pretty sure if i added someone else  i would still be comfortable  a bit cozier too  but anyway  i love it for my taste      
2207,4.0,                       very lightweight  too bright for me  was super bright in the morning     
2208,3.0,                       i set up the tent in the living room to make sure everything was in working order before camping  after finishing set up i realized there is a large whole in the mesh on the door  it looks like the mesh was not sewn into the door at all  other than that the tent seemed ok  the fly was a little loose over the door and back wall and the rod for the fly is difficult to put in places plenty of room with a twin air mattress  i will be returning due to the rip      
2209,5.0,                       don t make the same mistake that we did      
2210,5.0,                       works fine for our quarantine backyard camping trips  it s just enough room for    nothing extra      
2211,4.0,                       my only reluctance in a five star rating   it is difficult to put up by yourself due to the length of the fiberglass poles  but  one backyard camp out and one camping trip to our favorite campground  seems like a great tent  looking forward to lots more camping adventures with the tent      
2212,4.0,                       i spent a week in this tent in yosemite national park and intend to use it much more i was able to put all of my gear plus a camp chair and my cot in the tent comfortably this is especially important for me since i am in my seventies and cannot sleep on the ground anymore so this tent serves me well along with mi cot and other coleman products i own the only thing i had a problem with was the zippers they would sometimes snag so  you need to zip and unzip very carefully of course this is a common problem with tents and sleeping bags      
2213,5.0,                       lightweight  fits   comfortably  super easy to assemble even by one person  only complaint is that it s a bit bulky  found it easier for overnight backpacking trips to remove from the carrier and load into backpacks without to distribute the bulk evenly      
2214,5.0,                       as a hammock camper  i bought this as a backup and for my wife who doesn t use a hammock  but camps infrequently   i m really impressed with the weatherproofing  size  and ease of pitching of this tent   it almost makes me want to abandon my hammock and tarp      
2215,4.0,                       i got this for my first camping trip and it was  very easy to assemble and disassemble even by   person  it can easily fit   cots      
2216,5.0,                       great simple tent for non serious campers   cured some boredom during the covid   pandemic of          
2217,5.0,                       we camp quite a bit  tent can fit   comfortably  i really like having a tent that you can step into and stand up  this tent was in consistent rain for over    hours and it only leaked a little bit  i was very impressed  we did not experience wind as others have stated  but it definitely help up to the downpour      
2218,5.0,                    muy buena calidad de materiales  excelente terminacion  practicidad y facil armado  muy amplia        
2219,5.0,                       i haven t yet had a chance to take this out and actually go camping with it  but i ve set it up in my basement to check it out and i m impressed with all the features that have been added since i last owned a tent   the high rise tarp base is a great feature  but i think i ll still want to coat the seams with waterproofer and also add additional waterproofing to the rain fly   just in case        
2220,5.0,                       this tent withstood    to    mph winds and torrential rain while other tents collapsed   the storm that passed through lasted about    minutes  but winds continued at less intensity throughout the night  this is definitely a tents that i would recommend      
2221,5.0,                       easy to assemble and sleeps a family of four perfectly  plenty of room for camping gear inside as well      
2222,2.0,                       this item is advertised as a   person tent with room to move around  but it can barely fit   people without everyone sleeping on top of each other  cheaply made and barely stands up to intended use      
2223,5.0,                       i lived in this tent for   days   it was great for one person  i m       no leaks and very simple to put up   no help or expertise needed      
2224,5.0,                       as other people mentioned  although it says that it is for   person  it is actually more appropriate for   people  heard that it is the general rule for all camping tents   there is enough room to have queen air mattress      
2225,5.0,                       for two people  this tent is perfect  there is enough room for myself and my girlfriend and our gear  and  i take it with me when i go to the field for marine corps training  would recommend this to any avid outdoorsman looking for a camping tent      
2226,4.0,                       great   season tent  this tent is a great for the  weekend warrior  camper  when new ours got us through one of the most torrential down storms i think i ve ever camped in  i was impressed with it s leak protection  after the second season i started noticing small punctures in the bottom though      
2227,5.0,                       this is a super easy to set up  sturdy  high quality tent    i have a   person just like it  that is   years old and that has been a really good tent too   this is big enough for a queen size air mattress and a single cot and us perfect  also have a coleman double tall queen air mattress that has been a great mattress and has lasted and not gone flat like the others  keep up the good work coleman       
2228,5.0,                       when you buy coleman products  you know you re buying quality and this is no exception  withstands what comes your way  rain is no problem and it s very spacious     
2229,5.0,                       my tent arrived a few days ago and was a little difficult to assemble as it was my first tent in quite a few years  however the second time around it proved to be extremely simple  the tent assembled tent is very spacious and provides plenty of space for all of gear  myself included   although i plan to use this tent just for myself another person can comfortably fit which attests to the labeling of the product as two person  there are some minuscule holes that light shines through and tiny non biting insects can come in through the mesh lined vents  you should definitely use this tent with a pad  even if you have a sleeping bag  overall its a great tent and i would recommend it      
2230,5.0,                       used in a strong rain with no leaks and no issues  goes up fast   easy  packs up quick      
2231,5.0,                       perfect tent that fits     people nicely  easy to put up  durable  and has breathable windows if you wish to keep some light in the tent  i kept it up for backyard camping and respite  stayed up during wind and rain  easy up and easy down     
2232,4.0,                       overall good product and have used it on about    camping trips  starting to develop holes in the canvas where the tent poles cause friction  sometimes have difficulties with the zippers but generally work fine      
2233,4.0,                       i was impressed with this tent  it s easy to set up  approx    minutes  even on the first use   water proof  there was light rain but was completely dry inside   and spacious for a   person tent  it does feel a little flimsy but it held up to the light wind fine  i m happy with this purchase and look forward to using again this summer      
2234,1.0,                       poles split the second time we used it   only had a    day warranty  so that didn t help   coleman website was not helpful  and required many hoops to even be considered for a replacement   very dissatisfied  will not buy coleman again        
2235,5.0,                       used this for a couple of trips and for the money it can t be beat      
2236,5.0,                       couldn t pass up something this cheap with high ratings such as this  glad i bought one     
2237,5.0,                       took this tent to the campgrounds at rocklahoma this year and it survived a tornado that ripped through the area   other folks around me weren t as lucky   it s a keeper      
2238,5.0,                       i m only an occasional camper and so this tent has been used twice  in nice summer weather  so i can t speak to how sturdy it is over time or whether the waterproofing works  for all you other occasional campers  though  this is definitely a good tent  not really sure about it fitting   people at night  as the air mattress for me and my boyfriend took up most of the space set up is definitely something to be attempted when you arrive at the campsite  while it s still light out  again  just a word of warning for the occasional campers  however  the instructions are good and everything fits together properly  good ventilation and plenty of privacy once the rain fly is on  lightweight and compact when it s rolled up      
2239,5.0,                       excellent price  very roomy and easy to assemble      
2240,5.0,                       i love this tent  super easy to pop up  don t use the small hook clips until after you have the tent up  if you try to clip while trying to place the bars  it will catch on the metal pieces  planning to buy another one      
2241,5.0,                       quality  durability and easy to set up  this is the go to rent the kids use in their camping trips and they love it  awesome size when open and when closed in the bag      
2242,5.0,                       easy set up  i love the idea of the vent on the back of the tent but when you camp in colder weather with the wind blowing  it would be nice to have the option of zipping that up so that cold air isn t coming in under the vent  it is small but you can fit   adults and   child in it easy  we kept our cooler right outside the tent and had our clothing  etc in a laundry basket      
2243,3.0,                       it s quite nice  light enough  easy to assemble  good for beginner campers   despite their  waterproof  video demonstration  it leaks water in just like how other reviewer posted with their pics      
2244,5.0,                       love my new tent  i was able to set it up by myself in under    minutes  and i am pretty slow and careful in setting up  i used it for a week long camping trip in michigan  and slept in this tent alone  lots of room for myself and all my gear  love that i can stand up in it  and love the hook for a tent light fan on the ceiling  nice ventilation  so stuff is able to dry out during the day  and none of that dampness everywhere after a day or two  we had a huge thunderstorm with high winds one night  and not a single drop of water in the tent in the morning  i trust coleman tents  when they say it keeps you dry  they mean it      
2245,4.0,                       it s roomy enough for   people  i don t think you ll feel comfortable for   people  it s tall enough that you can move in the tent easily  put up your pants easily  but you do have to bend a little  the set up is easy  in our camping trips  two  in the last few weeks  it was windy as hell in both cases  it took us some extra time to lay it down  it holds up against the wind well  however  the shoe mat was blown over     feet away when we got up one morning  there should be something to attach it to the tent      
2246,5.0,                       i assembled without and help it was easy enough  it was more spacious than i thought  my   kids and i all fit with blankets and pillows and there was still room for a couple of bags  it rained and everyone and everything stayed dry      
2247,5.0,                       this was a gift for my grandson   he loved it      
2248,5.0,                       this was my first ever tent  perfect for me and my wife   yes it will easily sleep   people   easy setup  kept us      dry during heavy rain  held up to       mile winds  take down  no problem  of course i could not get it to fit so nice and neat in the carry pouch  lol   very happy with purchase      
2249,1.0,                       i used this tent twice   both poles snapped in less than    mph winds   i would chalk this up to bad luck  if my friends tent  same exact version  had not snapped on its first use   upon contacting coleman  of course this is not covered under the warranty   not quite sure what would be   do yourself a favor and spend a little more on a better tent   it advertises up to    mph wind resistance but that is not even close      
2250,5.0,                       very easy to setup  we went for camping during first week of se and outside temp was so hot that day  we have opened all windows and removed top rain proof cover  that make our tent wide open on side to air to enter all directions and we slept comfortably four people can sleep provided if you have four small bag and you can leave shoes inside too it has two small pockets either side to put away small items like glasses  cell phones  keys etc      
2251,5.0,                       been camping once with this text but all went great plenty of room inside     
2252,5.0,                       i use this to go camping with my wife and two kids  there s enough room for everyone to set up and store things off to the side while still being comfortable  it also excellent airflow through the tent so it does become stuffy i did notice that it doesn t handle major rain storms as well is it could though i m sure some silicone waterproofing spray can fix that      
2253,5.0,                       great tent easy up and down was even able to put it bag in the bag it came in only fits   people with back packs     
2254,4.0,                       great tent for the price put it through some pretty intense rain storms did find some water but comparatively it did do pretty well  good for some one looking to do some more casual camping      
2255,3.0,                       used when it lightly rained and inside got completely wet      
2256,5.0,                       this tent exceeded my expectations  very little water pooled in the corners  but considering the  severity of the storm and the duration  it was very little  fit a full sized air mattress comfortably with room at the foot and side for belongings  extremely easy to set up  very satisfied with my purchase      
2257,5.0,                       great tent  the first day i used it we had a severe thunderstorm with heavy rain for hours  the tent was perfectly try and remained in place  easy to assemble and take down and comes in a very compact carry bag      
2258,3.0,                       it works  but the material is terrible  one corner nearly broke the first time i assembled it  just ok tent     
2259,5.0,                       bought this for my    year old  it is very big  he couldn t wait and went  camping  in our living room when he first got it  him and his brothers have used it multiple times in the yard since      
2260,5.0,                       great tent   not sure you can take it camping   meaning  hiking     
2261,5.0,                       needed a small throw away tent so i purchased this one for    bucks  very happy with my purchase wish i would have bought a few at that price  large enough for a couple and really like the extension cord port      
2262,5.0,                       great tent  it was just for two people  we were able to fit our intex classic downy airbed inside the tent without issue and had some extra space with the inflatable bed inside of the tent as well alot of great little features inside the tent and very easy to setup and bring down       
2263,2.0,                       i was very excited for this tent  it was a great price and the perfect size  after receiving the tent  i set it up in no time at all and made sure i liked it  all was well   then when it came time for the camping trip   i went to put the tent together and found one of the poles had broken  i had to ingeniously fix the pole in order to use the tent for my camping trip  i am very unhappy that my brand new tent pole broke      
2264,1.0,                       very disappointed  the pole s bungee cord was broken and made it difficult to set up i contacted customer service and never heard back      
2265,5.0,                       perfect size for just myself     little ones  much quicker setup   which is exactly what i was looking for with the   little ones in tow  breakdown was a little longer   mainly because i m a little ocd      
2266,5.0,                       i ve camped out with this tent three times now and it has been working out great   i can set it up myself and fit a queen size air mattress in it   the support poles can get stuck on the middle section when pushing them through so a second set of hands can help with that   really can t complain for the price  however   it is called sundome for a reason  it lets a lot of light in      
2267,4.0,                       decent value for a simple tent at     us  i ve been looking for a tent from which one can do some stargazing through a mesh roof window panel on clear nights  this comes close   note that without fly the tent is vastly just exposed mesh  great for ventilation but the only way to enjoy the view through mesh is at the expense of privacy if you re at a busy campground  better for remote  fair weathered camp spots though      
2268,5.0,                       very easy setup  very spacious  and compact once closed   it says its for   people but honestly   people should be the max  you need the room to keep some of your stuff inside otherwise it would be too cramped      
2269,5.0,                       my husband and i bought this tent recently  we are not avid campers  just enjoy the occasional camping trip  the first time we used it was in the shennadoah national park  it is easy to set up  it probably took about       minutes as first timers  unfortunately it rained the entire night   and not a drizzle but a good hearty rain  i was amazed at how dry the tent was   the only place that was damp was pressure points on the ground  for example  if you sat on the floor of the tent you would feel damp  but it didn t make it through the walls at all  amazing  it is a great tent for a reasonable price      
2270,4.0,                       amazing that they can produce this tent for this price  has everything i d expect for a traditional nylon tent  haven t tested it in adverse weather or anything  but great for backyard camping      
2271,5.0,                       this tent worked great  pretty easy to set up  comes with everything you need  we put a tarp under it and above it and were completely dry and comfy in a huge rainstorm in flagstaff over the  th weekend  fit our queen air mattress and the puppy s kennel with room for some gear also  nice closures and ventilation      
2272,5.0,                       a great tent for two people  an even better tent for one  nice looking  green  and super easy to put up  i experienced no condensation while camping next to the ocean  easy as well to disassemble and fit into the carry bag      
2273,5.0,                       good warm weather tent  i used it this december and noticed that because the fly doesn t come all the way down to the ground it allowed for a cold breeze to enter the tent  would be great in hotter weather      
2274,5.0,                       easy instructions and set up  has two pockets on the inside to hold stuff and a small circle dangling from middle so you can hang a light if you wanted to  nice air mesh sides that allowed nightly breeze to enter while keeping bugs out    our queen size inflatable bed fit inside and we still had room on the side to store our bags and such      
2275,5.0,                       huge tent for the price will definitely fit a queen air mattress love the big air vents  haven t tested to see if it s rainproof yet but will update once i do     
2276,5.0,                       nothing wrong with this tent   it s well constructed and lightweight   not sure i would put four people in the four person tent i got but was plenty comfortable with two people      
2277,5.0,                       this dude is absolute sturdy  i survived texas thunderstorm with    mph  wind for   hours and not even a drop of water on any of my stuff in tent spacious enough to fit a queen bed  definitely recommend this to anyone  this thing is as amazing                
2278,5.0,                       would have like it a little lighter for backpacking  nice tent though      
2279,5.0,                       bought this for my daughter and she has used it alot with no issues  even though rain and weather      
2280,5.0,                       i didn t prep the seams and stayed dry during a torrential downpour with no real experience in pitching a tent  would highly recommend to anyone camping during the warm months      
2281,5.0,                       this is a great tent for the money  first time out was a   day hiking trip to ny s adk  the second night there was a huge rainstorm and extremely high winds  this tent was bone dry  not a drop of water leaked in  no issues with the frame and body despite the high wind and rain  great tent       
2282,5.0,                       i cannot say enough about how awesome this tent is   quality is fantastic   super easy setup      min max   perfect for family camping   love the back window so you can see out the tent   no cords to trip over   rain fly material is extra sturdy and seems like it will provide excellent waterproofing   would definitely buy another coleman tent   really impressed for the money   amazon pricing is unbeatable as well   with prime it s a no brainer   testing it out this weekend and can t wait         
2283,5.0,                       lightweight  easy to assemble  i don t know yet if its water resistant since i only used it for summer camping      
2284,4.0,                       really great tent  my kids  camp out  in the house all the time and this was a fun new tent for them  it is really big   bigger than i expected  can easily fit     big kids in it and a lot of stuffed animals  etc  i also love that the top can come off for ventilation with the screen in place  etc      
2285,5.0,                       this was surprisingly really easy to assemble  its perfect for a small and solo camping trip with my dog  love that the cover comes off so you can watch the stars at night      
2286,4.0,                       used on a camping trip where there was an intense thunderstorm  part way through the night a tree branch came and ripped through part of the rain canopy  up until that point  tent worked great in rain and wind  so as long as no falling debris  this tent works great in a storm      
2287,2.0,                       i just bought this tent for a weekend beach camping trip  it was very easy to set up  nice size four person tent i was a bit disappointed with the quality though  there was a tear on the inside  near a window  when i took the tent down and repacked it the bag it came in ripped  for the price i would expect better      
2288,5.0,                       this tent is good for   people but probably best for    not sure how   could fit but reckon it s possible if small people  it was very easy to set up and take down      
2289,5.0,                       had it up in       minutes  down in    minutes and had my dogs and spilled a margarita in it and all was well    people are going to sleep like sardines in there but for   people and   dogs it was very roomy      
2290,5.0,                       great for the price  easy to set up on your own and great for one or two people  three people wouldn t be comfy unless it s a small child and two adults  has great pockets inside to hang things  the window zippers are great for a breeze  packs right back into the bag it came in  i use it for car camping      
2291,5.0,                       awesome  this tent was so reasonably priced and a great investment  it s very easy to set up  and the dome really does keep out the rain  i hadn t been camping in years and bought this tent for a specific trip  i now plan to camp more  it s a   person tent  but i camped alone  if you plan to use it for two people  be aware that you really won t have much room to move around  but it was perfect for a single person      
2292,5.0,                       huge tent  large enough for two cots and a small table  i haven t had an opportunity to test it in the rain but it did keep the mosquitoes out      
2293,4.0,                       don t love the design but great tent for the price  we got rained out in our last trip and tent didn t totally disappoint  our mats kept us dry  just a little of water underneath  not too bad      
2294,4.0,                       this is not a tent for below    degree f weather  however  at    degree s f the tent sufficed  we had   sleeping bags between   people and it worked out  two sides of the tent are mainly vented screens  but  with the rain hood applied they are covered minimally  this allowed cold air into the tent but also allowed circulation  above    degrees  not bad  do not take this tent below    degrees f  if you have people that are  touchy  about camping  then you should not put them in this tent below    degrees f      
2295,5.0,                       nice tent  was easy to set up  took some   mph wind gust with no problems  big enough for   queen mattress  a xlarge dog crate and just enough room left over for a large duffle bag and standing room      
2296,4.0,                       only gave four stars because we ve only used it once so i can t speak on longevity  which was a concern on some other reviews i read before purchasing i bought this tent for my  yr old as he started cub scouts  it s so easy to put up and take down he can already do it himself  my husband and son both slept in it comfortably and stayed dry and warm  this is definitely perfect for what we need it for  and we ll continue to use it as long as it stays intact      
2297,5.0,                       this is a great    person  tent and east to setup and take down by myself  remember to take the number that a tent claims is it s capacity and divided it in half to account for supplies and room to move around   otherwise   people would be on top of each other      
2298,5.0,                       i can t recommend this  tent enough   we took it on a camping trip to australia and it held up great   one of the few coleman tents that will fold up smaller than its carrying case which was a plus when you re traveling from campsite to campsite   the setup and takedown were fast and easy and it stayed nice and dry during the one rainstorm we encountered   overall  if you re looking for a smaller light tent that can withstand australia s climate  you can t do much better      
2299,5.0,                       just finished my first season of camping with this tent  i set it up by myself very easily  wish the rain fly went all the way to the ground butit hasn t been an issue yet  i ve slept dry through several rainy nights  it packs up very small in its own bag  probably about   x   x     it s a stretch to say   person tent  a double air mattress will take most of the floor space      
2300,4.0,my new tent arrived yesterday  i m taking it camping for the first time soon  so today  i set it up in my backyard to examine it  practice set up and also to spray it down with a water repellant  it arrived in the usual rectangular coleman zippered package  that i find useless for re packing  and all parts were included  green white gray tent  green white rain fly    long fiberglass poles whose pieces are connected by a stretchy thick string  for the tent     medium length fiberglass pole with pieces connected by stretchy thick string  for the rain fly  and   medium grade steel stakes about    long with the classic l shape on top  no plastic on stakes   i haven t set up a tent like this in several years and i tackled this project alone fairly easily in just a few minutes   first  i hung the rainfly on an outdoor clothesline and lightly sprayed the inside of the rainfly with kiwi heavy duty water repellant  while that was drying  i set up the tent  it took me maybe   to   minutes  alone  to set it up  there was a little wind blowing  so that made it slightly interesting  but i just used common sense and got it up pretty easily  after i d initially set up the tent  i returned to the rainfly  flipped it and sprayed the outside material with a good  heavier coat of the kiwi product  paying special attention to the seams again   then i returned to inspect the tent while the rainfly was drying   the gray material sewn into the bottom of the tent is a very cheap grade tarp material  i doubt it would stand up to heavy abuse but should be fine for my purposes   i ll be sure to put a heavy duty tarp under the tent  called a footprint  to protect it from damage from rocks or such  i ll also use a lightweight floor cover of some kind inside to help prevent any nicks to the tarp material  it really is very thin    the rest of the tent material is very thin  standard tent material with double stitching on the seams   on two sides of the tent  the see thru mesh is expansive covering most of the side and there is no option for covering this mesh  other than attaching the rainfly   the door and the rear window both have zippers to raise tent material over mesh material for privacy and rain protection  those zippers can let down the tent material to allow air to breathe through the mesh  the door   window have a zipper inside  there are two small mesh  pocket pouches  on the inside for storing stuff  these are about    x     roughly i d guess  didn t measure  but they re fairly small   they re sewn into the mesh sidings and hang on the inside  on the front  left bottom of the tent  where the gray tarp material meets the tent material  there is a small opening port to run an electrical cord  there is a small loop at the top of the tent to hang a lightweight light  i m       and i couldn t stand up in the tent but the tent s interior height wasn t bad to move around in just the same   not too cramped   in setting the tent up  one thing i liked was that the poles fed through tent material loops along the top and then there were also   clips on each of all   sides  to further secure the tent to the pole   to me  this is the best of both worlds  loops vs clips    as with most tents  the size rating of    people  is ambitious  i expect it may sleep   adults and   kids semi comfortably  but not   adults unless they were put in like sardines in a can with nothing else inside  i d call this a roomy   person tent  so it should suffice for my purposes  and is  why  i didn t opt to purchase the smaller   or   person variation    after i set the tent up  i sprayed the exterior with the kiwi heavy duty water repellant  being sure to extra cover all of the seams   especially those seams where the tarp material meets tent material   i gave the newly applied kiwi water repellant a few minutes to dry on the tent and then i took the rainfly  that was mostly dry from it s kiwi water repellant application  and attached it to the top of the tent  this took maybe   or   minutes  as i tied out the sides to give the rainfly room to  breathe  above the tent   note on kiwi heavy duty water repellant   i d buy two       oz spray bottles for this job  it s tough to get good coverage and you have to take your time with multiple light sprays  however  any  runs  won t show after it dries  unlike polyurethane   this stuff is smelly and should be applied outdoors on a non windy day  i preferred the kiwi over a polyurethane product because it s easier to apply and clean up after  understanding that polyurethane spray would last longer   i left the tent to dry in my backyard  with a gentle wind blowing steadily  for several hours  it handled the gentle wind very well and looked the same set up upon my return   taking it down was easier than setting up and took just   or   minutes  but there was no way i could repack that tent into the coleman rectangular carrier that it came in   not without significant effort and more time than i want to spend on it  so i ll use a large nylon bag that i have to store it in  along with the poles and stakes   the tent is fairly lightweight  but i can t imagine one person back packing this on a long hike  you d need to split the tent and poles between two hikers  i d guess   i ll update again after my tent s first use  there s rain expected on my trip  so we ll see how well it holds up against that 
2301,5.0,                       incredible value for the money  easy to set up  enough room to comfortably fit me  my wife  and both our packs  there was storm the first night of our trip with winds so bad we could barely sleep  but the tent held up great my only complaint would be that the zipper on the front door can be finicky  and often gets caught on the fabric around it when trying to close the tent  but it s not a deal breaker  i doubt you ll find a better tent in this price range      
2302,5.0,                       easy set up and take down bottom is good  rain resistance is ok for light rain  down pours it is not great      
2303,5.0,                       i ordered this for my kids to have their own tent  very easy to set up  lightweight  it s definitely a two person tent  very satisfied with this purchase      
2304,5.0,                       i was able to put this together in five minutes and break it down just as quickly      
2305,5.0,                       purchased for woman who likes creek stewart and the outdoors   her old tent was leaky  we bought this  she thanks us whenever she gets out      
2306,5.0,                       my eight year old granddaughter loved it      
2307,5.0,                       used this for camping at a horsemanship clinic   i didn t use the rain fly but it was simple to put together and i like that it fits in a small storage bag      
2308,5.0,                       i didn t know i was setting my tent up and taking it down in a tropical storm  it flexed  it sheltered  it did its job and is just fine  i am not recommending camping in tropical storm  but tacked and staked properly  the tent came through  i never use the standard stakes and don t recommend them in fair weather      
2309,5.0,                       very well made tent for the money  it poured on a recent camping trip and this tent kept us bone dry my only gripe  the tent floor material isn t very rugged  if you re camping on a rocky surface  i do recommend placing a tarp underneath the tent      
2310,5.0,                       i couldn t believe how small a package this thing came in  about a   x  x   bag   making it extremely travel friendly  i was worried about getting it to fit back in there after taking it out and it was not nearly as bad as i thought  the tent itself held up well in wind and was very roomy  good fabric  awesome tent      
2311,5.0,                       i bought when family were coming for a week    thought the kids would use it but no   i did   ok  i m    and could get in but had to crawl out in the a m   easy put together and completely comfortable   love it      
2312,5.0,                       my boyfriend and i got this for ourselves for our anniversary because his tiny tent wasn t cutting it for us  i love this tent   its very easy to set up and we both love being able to stand up inside  i can t speak for it on the weather front as we ve only used it for a couple nights and it didn t rain at all      
2313,5.0,                       i set it up myself in    minutes  well constructed great price     
2314,5.0,                       perfect  easy and fast set up take down    fit   of us and a small dog very comfortably    no issues with leaks or bugs getting in as long as the door was zipped shut      
2315,4.0,                       it s a good tent   i wish the airflow was a little better  but other than that small complaint  there s nothing wrong with it   it will hold two people plus their gear if they don t mind it being a little cramped      
2316,5.0,                       i only buy coleman tents  they are easy to set up  and reliable  the price is great for the quality and i love the colors i put this tent up alone  i am a wimpy  mildly overweight female  with breathing issues but great determination      
2317,5.0,                       great little tent  held up well through the rain storms that came through  bought it for my brother who was flying in for the trip  his other coleman had lasted him    years  can t beat the price      
2318,3.0,                       love the price  easy to set up  light to carry a short distance  but not light enough for my liking on a multi day hike  perfect for camping at a campsite that you can park close to      
2319,4.0,                       tons of room  better if setup with   people  may not be the best for a super cold environment  a bargain for the money      
2320,5.0,                       i really love this tent and highly recommend it     
2321,5.0,                       big tent  perfect for a double mattress plus a twin blow up mattress  and it is already treated to prevent water intrusion      
2322,5.0,                       this tent is just as durable and reliable as any other coleman tent ive ever had  could fit     small kids  or   large adult men      
2323,5.0,                       nice little tent  very affordable  we got this for scouting  when only a couple of us would be camping  rather than the whole family  when in the bag it is very small and light  easy to carry while hiking  we ve only used it once so fair so i can t attest to durability  but did well that first time  would recommend as a small  affordable tent      
2324,2.0,                       we bought on may as someone recomend it to us for our trip  just got home from our vacation and realized it does not have a warranty  sad for such a big company  it rained for like an hour and in the morning i realized that everything i had in the corners was wet      
2325,5.0,                       as an avid camper i can say this is a solid deal for anyone looking for a nice cheap tent  this tent has appropriate rain fly coverage unlike many of the cheap tents on the market  while this tent will not last for generations  it is good for the casual weekend camper if you are looking for a tent that is affordable and reliable  i would say this is your tent      
2326,5.0,                       i love this tent  great product and so easy to assemble  used this tent just for two people so far  my boyfriend who is     and i am     and we had a ton of room left including our duffel bags  would highly recommend      
2327,5.0,                       this tent ended up being even nicer than expected  i slept in it for two weeks while in kenya and was extremely satisfied with the size  easy of assembly  weatherproofing  zippers  screens  etc      
2328,5.0,                       love this tent  great materials and easy to set and pack in less than    minutes  we have used it many times in the forest and desert with no major issues  decent weight  still good after   years      
2329,4.0,                       this is a nice tent   there is a tiny rip on the seam near the zipper and the only way it would sleep   is right on top of each other  if you are looking for a tent that is very roomy for    this will do it   we had some pretty high winds the first night  the tent stayed put  i did make the optional purchase of sturdier stakes than what are included with the tent  this tent is for casual tenters  not hardcore  it works well and has a lot of nice features for the low price      
2330,5.0,                       we have used this tent twice now   both times it is very easy to set up   i ve set up and taken down by myself  however an extra set of hands make it even easier   the second time we camped it rained during the night and the tent stayed dry   however because the   sides are open and only covered with the rainfly  you do get a some moisture inside the tent when it is raining   overall very happy with the tent   so far no issues with it as we plan on using it about   or   more times this summer  so we ll see how it holds up over the summer      
2331,5.0,                       very pleased with our new tent  since we just recently got it  we have only gotten to use once on a  day primitive hiking camping trip   this tent is nice and spacious and very quick and easy set up breakdown   no problem fitting back into the tent bag afterwards which sometimes can be a struggle   one night it got pretty windy with a bit of sprinkle and the top help up very well   i also love having two separate pockets inside as well as a back  window       
2332,5.0,                       everything works just fine  went camping and worked as intended  had pup sleep with us in it  much fun      
2333,5.0,                       easy setup  we had plenty of room for a queen air mattress  with room to spare  could easily have done air mattress plus one sleeping bag      
2334,5.0,                       i have taken this tent on many trips since fetting it and it works great  really good quality and very easy to set up and take down  also very water resistant  i had in in a really bad rain storm and i stayed dry with all of my gear inside      
2335,5.0,                       i used this tent for   nights on ragbrai  bike ride across iowa  and it was great  one night during a heavy raid some water did seep in the bottom  i had a ground tarp and it trapped water so this may have contributed to the water coming in  it was easy to put up and take down  plenty of room for me and all my gear  i would recommend it      
2336,5.0,                       used it for one summer  this tent is really water tight  just as promised  is part of camping gear taken along on airplane trips  so the light weight is essential      
2337,4.0,                       a nice little tent to take the family camping with  a no frills tent that won t let you down      
2338,5.0,                       great tent  but definitely not big enough for a queen air mattress  we bought a full one when our queen took up the whole tent and broke the water seal our first time using    once we started using the full this tent was perfection      
2339,5.0,                       i bought this looking for a tent i could use for causal weekend camping and music festivals  and i got exactly what i was looking for  great price for what i need  but since it folds up kinda big i wouldn t recommend this for backpacking      
2340,5.0,                       great cheap tent  used it about    nights on a   week road trip in temps varying from about       and dry conditions to heavy rain  was a perfect size for myself and my dog  would have been fine with another person  i paid     for this tent and it was well worth it      
2341,4.0,                       only used this tent once so far  but it was easy to put up and a decent size  wish it was taller  but i knew that before i bought it      
2342,5.0,                       i ve used this tent over    times already and its worked perfect  nothing has broken or ripped  and has kept me mostly dry through multiple storms  the      minute set up is super easy  and it fits in a small bagged case  i would highly recommend      
2343,5.0,                       this tent is awesome  this is the first tent my husband and i bought to use for the occasional camping trip  we ve only been able to use it once  but it worked great i only have good things to say about this tent  the color is a really cool green  and space wise it can definitely fit       people  the set up and take down was extremely easy  the quality of the materials used have held up really well thus far i can t wait to use it again and again      
2344,5.0,                       we got this for our daughters and they loved it with their two twin air mattress is     
2345,5.0,                       works perfect for me  it was one of the few tents in our group that withstood a pretty heavy wind  so i can t deny that  very roomy  honestly  and i can almost fully stand up inside of it  i m        no leaks  no bugs  no problems  i would not bet on it to win a fight against a bear  however      
2346,5.0,                       the first time i used this tent it took    minutes to set up  it rains heavily for two nights with no tarp underneath and only seeped water the second night on one side of the tent      
2347,3.0,                       i got this a year ago but only used it once at the beach and the second night we had strong wind  the tent poles broke early morning and it fell on two of us  it did great for wind and rain on the first night good amount of space      
2348,5.0,                       my first review ever  this is excellent  it s very spacious for   people  i love the mesh top that you can cover with the piece of tarp  it was pretty easy to assemble even with spanish instructions  but i did have an extra rod piece i didn t know where it goes  but it handled well without it      
2349,4.0,                       very nice product but a queen mattress is tight     
2350,5.0,                       very easy to assemble and didn t have any water in it after a sudden down pour      
2351,5.0,                       easiest set up known to man  like any tent not clear on how to put it back in the bag for storage     
2352,2.0,                       way too small for   people   our girls are    and    and are petite and barely fit in this   already looking to replace also  can barely fit full size air mattress      
2353,4.0,                       the tent poles have to bend a shocking amount to install them   i was certain they would break  it did work  but i could hear the fiberglass crinkling a little with the strain we used this on a very cold night  and did find some water inside   presumably some condensation   in the morning      
2354,5.0,                       my boyfriend and i take this tent every where  we camped in torrential down pour and didn t get a single drop in the tent  which it was a little bit bigger  not good for friends or people who aren t planning on cuddling all night      
2355,2.0,                       i have used coleman products for over    years and have been generally pleased with their products   however  this tent  while being extremely cheap  turns out to be constructed in a very cheap manner as well   we have used it twice and the seams are already pulling apart to the point that the tent will either have to be repaired or will be unfunctional   the poles are also very flimsy   and the dimensions are so small that      year old boys could not fit comfortably in it   i will try to get this returned      
2356,4.0,                       the tent is a great buy for the money  simple to put up  stormproof  and most importantly grandchild proof  sadly  someone took a knife or other sharp blade to the case prior to shipping  otherwise i would have given this   stars      
2357,4.0,                       love this tent  our kids bought it with their birthday money  and there is plenty of space for both    and    to move around  and even stand up  it was super easy even for my kids to put up  my only issue is that with the rain fly on  i do not think there is quite enough air circulation from outside  but i would still buy this again  especially for kids      
2358,5.0,                       love it   very comfortable and roomy      
2359,5.0,                       seams to be well built and designedquality materials     
2360,1.0,                       i have owned several coleman tents and never had this problem before   i set it up in the woods making sure the ground was relatively clear of branches and rocks  slept in the tent for   days  when taking the tent down found holes on the bottom   there were no branches or stones poking through  i could not say for sure if they were there before setting up the tent  i didn t crawl around looking for holes  but i do know the packaging was impeccable      
2361,4.0,                       a little bit smaller than i expected  i bought this for the firefly music festival for myself and a friend to camp in  not sure how two other people would fit in there with us unless we were all spooning  also  i m      so i spent a lot of time crouching and ducking when maneuvering around the tent  we did fit two twin air mattresses inside and had maybe two feet of wiggle room at our feet  it was enough for what i bought it for but if you want roomy you don t want this      
2362,5.0,                       great tent   not just for the price   though you can get smaller packing  lighter tents  for much more   depends what you need   i use this for car camping or  more often  off the back of the motorcycle  and it is way big  in a good way  for two   and more than big enough for three  using a queen and a twin blow up mattress      
2363,5.0,                       i love this tent  i am a cub scout den leader and have used this with my kids for lessons  it is easy enough that two   year old boys can get it put up together  my son and i camp have camped in it  plenty of space for me  a      lady  and my seven year old with plenty of room for all of our gear inside      
2364,5.0,                       there was absolutely no leaking for us when it poured rain for an hour in key west  we just had a cheap tarp underneath and never water proofed it  this tent is perfect size for   and all of our stuff  perfect for the price      
2365,5.0,                       got the   person tent  first time campers and decided to buy this tent to try a local campsite in so cal  great for outdoors  and great for living room sleepovers  fits a queen size blowup mattress      
2366,5.0,                       easy to set up  plenty of room  great purchase      
2367,1.0,                       missing one of the rods for the water proof screen have to go to walmart to buy a replacement as we have a camping trip in   days  seems like a good tent sadly we won t know      
2368,5.0,                       purchased five of these to donate to a local scout troop  good tent at a very good price      
2369,5.0,                       used this tent on a weekend camping trip with friends and it was spacious enough to comfortably fit two people  a queen sized air mattress and two large duffle bags full of our belongings  it withstood the light rain we had very well and the vented zip down windows were definitely a plus to let the breeze in without the unwanted bugs  perfect for a weekend getaway      
2370,4.0,                       we haven t used the tent yet camping  thus i can t give it a   star rating  but we have opened and setup the tent and it was very easy  construction and materials seems very good quality  no tears or rips anywhere and with the rain fly on  we sprayed it with water and no leaks anywhere  solid tent so far  amazon s processing and delivery were as always spot on       
2371,5.0,                       very nice tent for the price easy to put up and take down fits queen mattress and still room for supplies definitely recommend      
2372,5.0,                       we bought this tent for two people  it was perfect  would also be good for a family of four  but definitely not enough room for six people      
2373,5.0,                       this tent is perfect for me  it says two person  but i fit myself and two other women in this tent  very very simple set up but is very effective  it says it is waterproof  but i also took extra precautions and sprayed it with waterproof ing spray  which is about     at the very most  and it lasted through a storm  if i ever lost this tent for some reason  i would definitely buy it again      
2374,5.0,                       nice for the price can always  count  on coleman  products      
2375,4.0,                       assembled in my house to see if it really was easy   yes it is easy  the tubes are awfully long  and i hope the inside cords don t break  but this is the standard tent assembly method i ve used on other tent brands   it seems like it will be a good tent   time will tell when i take my next camping vacation      
2376,5.0,                       it s a good tent  i recommend only having two people in it  maybe three  doesn t leak and we have used it about   times now  has a hook at the top to hang a lantern  has one pocket on two sides so you can store extra stuff you have  smartphone  lights  glasses   vents pretty well and has optional zipper vents on the door as well as the parallel side to the door comes with a little mat so when you come out the door your feet don t have to step on the ground      
2377,5.0,                       took this tent camping in march up in the mountains  it actually heats up quite easily when the sun comes up  and it protects from winds when necessary  two people slept in this tent and we had more than enough room   only important gear inside  one small bag each  backpacks outside  would definitely recommend      
2378,5.0,                       great tent for the money  accommodates a queen sized air mattress and gear with room to spare  i ve camped in this tent   times in the rain and have never gotten wet  i ve been able to set it up alone  but  as expected  setup is much easier with a second pair of hands      
2379,5.0,                       this tent saved me from a wild storm  i had no faith and thought that i was soon going to be soaked and miserable because of the pouring rain and high winds but i was bone dry    not an inch of water anywhere  i am super happy with this purchase and highly recommend  for anyone that attended country thunder wisconsin      you can understand how bad the weather was      
2380,4.0,                       easy to put up  nice height  but still a little small  i have a queen size air bed and had to shove it in the corner of the tent to fit our stuff in with us  now that isn t that big of a problem except when it rains  the rain stays out pretty well until you touch the side then it starts to seep inside and pool water at the corners  so with the air bed touching it a fair amount of water got in  had the rain fly on as well with the guy wires tight with the tent sitting on a tarp  other than that great tent just remember to bring a few towels to put in the corners if rain is to be expected update      so this is the second year i ve used this tent and i feel its important i make this update  seal the seams  this is important step to do when you first get this tent  we went camping in some pretty heavy rain and we could see the water bleeding in through the seams at every corner and on some of the side walls  seam sealer costs maybe    and will do the whole tent with a little left over so just take the time to knock that step out before you take it out  also it does fit a queen air matress  but not with very much space left for any of your stuff so you might touch the sides while you sleep causing the tent to weep  this is most likely unavoidable unless you forgo the air matress and just sleep on a pad on the ground so you ll only touch the waterproof bottom tub so to sum it up      buy seam sealer   get some waterproofing spray   like operation  don t touch the sides   enjoy yourself in the great outdoors     
2381,5.0,                       coleman always makes a good product   i like the green since it doesn t attract bugs   good for one person who wants some extra room  or two people   very well made and easy to set up break down   would order again      
2382,3.0,                       this is a summer tent  there are big windows that can t be closed      
2383,2.0,                       none waterproof  water comes inside from each corner        
2384,2.0,                       the first time i used this tent it rained  the tent leaked horribly and the sides became covered in moisture inside the tent  my clothes  sleeping bag and supplies got all wet  i will be contacting the company for a refund or some type of compensation for money spent on such a poor product  i will be trying ozark trail to find a more dependable product      
2385,4.0,                       wow the tent is big enough for a full size air mattress   comfortable just too many windows don t care for the window by the floor and       
2386,5.0,                       this is a roomy  and rainproof tent  i went camping last month  and on the first night there was a thunder lightning storm    stayed dry  condensation in the morning was not an issue great tent  replace the tent stakes with heavier ones then you will be golden      
2387,5.0,                       great tent  waterproof and easy to setup      
2388,5.0,                       okay i wasn t sure what to expect  but it honestly was a great tent at a great price  it rained and was super windy two night we were camping and we had no issues  i did spray the tent prior with a water resistant spray which i recommend  two adults  a   lb dog and a queen air mattress and two backpacks fit comfortably     
2389,4.0,                       tent is easy to set up and take down   roomy enough for one person with gear  but maybe not for two   it is small and light when stored in its bag  so it fits easily inside a vehicle along with other  bulkier camping equipment      
2390,4.0,                       not a    min setup  fast shipping  nice price  packaged well      
2391,5.0,                       amazing tent  super easy to put up  we took to boundary waters and hit some pretty good rain and wind   of the   nights we were there   no leaks  held up great   the lights are really cool too      
2392,5.0,                       bought this tent just in time for my last camping trip to avoid another sleepless trip due to my father s snoring  lol  it s a great tent  fits my twin sized air mattress with room to move around still  it also rained a couple nights and i stayed dry and comfortable  i personally think that this tent will fit   people comfortably  i don t think i ll be squeezing   people in there though      
2393,4.0,                       great product except when ours showed up it had a hole in the mosquito netting  we ordered and kept in the box due to covid until we went camping and so we missed the return complaint window by a few weeks      
2394,5.0,                       i m not very smart and this tent was a breeze to set up  i have a queen size intex mattress that my gf and i use for camping and for the two of us  this tent is the perfect size  the mattress fits perfectly and we can easily store our bags  a cooler and misc items at the foot without feeling cramped at all the most amazing part about it  is that we easily fit the tent back into the carrying case coleman makes great products  who could ever argue that      
2395,5.0,                       very spacious and roomy tent that is easy to set up  love the little zipper opening area to put your shoes outside after you ve zipped up the main tent  you will not find a better tent for the price       
2396,3.0,                       a little smaller than i thought it would be but it wasn t a big issue i got this for     what a deal it s great i d give it more stars really easy to set up might try to use it for backpacking and see how that goes but it s a super simple tent for a great price set up was a breeze speaking off it was windy as all h ll and was still able to set it up it didn t look like it was handling the wind to well though so i did have to take it down to was only testing it out in the yard     
2397,5.0,                       i went camping for the first time ever this weekend  and this tent was an absolute dream  it was extremely easy to set up and take down  it rained for a majority of the weekend and this tent kept us perfectly dry  i was so nervous my first time camping  but this tent made a lot of aspects so much easier      
2398,5.0,                       got a twin air mattress in there      
2399,4.0,                       used it during a recent camping trip  very easy to assemble and pack away   it kept us warm and dry and held up well to a few light showers  pretty spacious and was overall very comfortable  the side pockets inside the tent and very handy      
2400,5.0,                       you just went for a trip through newfoundland and labrador caught in a thunderstorm on a clift next to the ocean in labrador tied it to the motorcycle super high winds blew the tent flat but it rebounded little bigger than what i needed but performed well     
2401,2.0,                       does not accommodate   people comfy at all  my girlfriend had to basically sleep on top of me  if they would have been truthful i would ve purchased a bigger tent  i was very annoyed to find out the hard way on our camping trip when it came time to sleep      
2402,5.0,                       pretty easy to set up for one person  would be an absolute breeze for two  plenty of space inside  sturdy construction as well that held up to some pretty serious winds  i did have to tether the for corners down from the first hook position because under strong wind gusts the tent did lay flat  but stood immediately back up   tethering it out at the corners put an end to that easily      
2403,5.0,                       such a nice tent  we have used it twice so far in both warmer and colder weather and it has worked flawlessly  great price point  easy to set up and tear down and very durable  would recommend this tent to others  the photos everyone has provided does it justice      
2404,5.0,                       this is a great tent  i took it backpacking through the at  it worked great  it is alittle heavy  but works well      
2405,5.0,                       nice compact design and light weight  highly recommended      
2406,5.0,                       absolutely love this tent  we bought   and took them for a    day trip down the outer banks  we weathered many storms and high gusty winds and cane out unscathed  the tenants are quick and easy to put up and take down  my    yr old prided himself on getting the tent up in his own  and quickly too        
2407,5.0,                       great tent but i m not sure about sleeping three people in it  very well built and and we were able to fit it our queen air matress with some room to spare  there are two mesh pockets on the inside for small things  we used them for our phones  keys  and flashlight  we used it in the summer so didn t need the rain fly and got an amazing view of a starry night sky through the mesh ceiling  if you just want something simple that works  this is it      
2408,1.0,                       i used this tent once and it leaked terribly  the entire inside was soaked  i expected a lot better from coleman  i have several other coleman tents that are all fine  this might be fine if you only use it in dry weather or as a kid s toy  but it is completely worthless as camping shelter  and i ll definitely think twice before buying anything from coleman for awhile      
2409,5.0,                       if you take price into consideration this tent scores a   star with ease  if you are a serious hardcore type camper  i cant say how you will like this tent in all honesty   if you are a normal family type camper and you buy this tent  i would be shocked if you dont find it a great deal  there are so many nice things to say about it  one thing i would like to say is that they stitch the instructions into the case   so you cant lose them    buy it  you wont regret it      
2410,5.0,                       this has got to be the best tent on the market for the price  easy setup and takedown  does exactly what it s supposed to do  i highly recommend      
2411,2.0,                       there is no zip cover for the screen windows on the side   currently  the photos of the interior show a zip up window cover but this is not the case   not being able to zip your windows closed means that it can get very drafty at night   also  i found that the zippers stuck very easily around the door   this tent might be good to set up on the beach as a shade tent but it s not for actual camping      
2412,3.0,                       it s the kind of tent that is perfectly fine to sleep in at the end of the day  but not necessarily one you want to hang out in night after night   it does breathe nice and withstood light rain no problem very easy to set up  even though the instructions are less than clear      people can have it done in      minutes     adults   that would be cramped   it was me  my wife  we re both shorter than       and our   year old and that s a little close for comfort with minimal gear like backpacks a few complaints  as others have commented  the stakes could be better  no spare fiberglass rods   they are the kind that collapse into sections and an internal elastic string hold them into a long piece when assembled   so if one rod breaks  you better find your inner mcgeyver real quick   never hurts to bring along some duct tape when camping   i don t know if they even sell replacement spare rods overall  you get a decent tent at a decent price  like all coleman products  more or less    i m satisfied      
2413,3.0,                       overall a good piece of gear  does not breathe well at all  you will sweat your butt off if it s hot outside  the little opening at the bottom that is meant for allowing the wind to come in  pretty much does not work  do not use this tent in warm hot weather  it does not breath well at all      
2414,1.0,                       i was excited about this tent as i have been using coleman camping gear for as long as i can remember  but the seam of this tent broke with the first use itself  i am really disappointed      
2415,5.0,                       this was super easy to use and set up  it fit a queen sized air mattress in it  my cooler  hiking pack  and two costo totes filled with camping items  i still had room to walk around a little too i highly recommend getting this tent  especially if it is your first time camping and don t know how to really set up tents yet      
2416,5.0,                       i have taken this tent on several camping trips already and it s great  we even got stuck out in a few heavy rain storms and kept dry  it s very easy to setup with   person  as a general rule of thumb a tent is good for half the amount of people they are rated for unless you like sleeping like sardines  so a    man tent is good for   and and a   man is good for    happy camping      
2417,1.0,                       came across this tent as recommendation from wirecutter  they re wrong  we used this tent one time for backyard camping and the elastic line inside the poles has snapped in multiple places  i would definitely look elsewhere for a tent      
2418,5.0,                       this tent is perfect for   people  i love it      
2419,5.0,                       perfect for   people  easy to setup and robust  value for money       
2420,5.0,                       i lived in this bad boy for   and a half months in colorado as a raft guide  wear and tear is small to none  the only damage was done by high winds and even then came back just as good  i am also        and am about the length of the   person tent  this tent is recommended to all or any  and are encouraged to make it a good time      
2421,5.0,                       great tent  pitched super fast and easy and looks really nice  in reality  the   person tent is more like a   person tent with gear and bedding      
2422,5.0,                       very spacious tent with lots of mesh allowing for great sky views from inside      
2423,5.0,                       perfect size for   people plus some gear  super easy to assemble and the carrying bag is large enough to store in without worrying that you aren t rolling it tight enough  the tarp bottom is a great feature for rainy days or wet ground  we stayed out during a rainstorm and stayed dry      
2424,4.0,                       tent worked perfectly and was very easy to set up  only draw back is the stakes to hold it down are garbage  if the ground is at all hard  they will just bend and not go in  this makes it very hard to secure the tent   upgraded stakes and problem solved     
2425,5.0,                       great tent  first tent i ve ever owned and it works great  i ve used it six times since the end of june      and i have no complaints  very happy i bought it      
2426,5.0,                       easy to assemble  great size for   people  looks nice     
2427,5.0,                       just used it   after applying a silicone water layer and permetherine coat  the tent worked perfectly   my two small kids and i were able to fit a queen size inflatable mattress and still had room for extra gear   everything inside stayed dry  despite a lite mist in the air and temperatures in the   s   they had a great trip and are looking forward to our next      
2428,5.0,                       great little tent for the price     
2429,5.0,                       it takes    minutes max and easy to install  very happy with product and bought the second one already     
2430,5.0,                       good quality tent and rain proof     
2431,5.0,                       easy to set up big enough for two people comfortably     
2432,5.0,                       great tent  easy to set up take down   it calls itself a   person tent  i d call it        if that   person tent   our inflatable queen bed fit very tightly inside with no room to put anything   perfect for one person with a twin size mattress which will give you room for other stuff to set on the floor   otherwise very well made      
2433,5.0,                       this product exceeded my expectations  very pretty rich lime green color and great quality  you can fit a queen air mattress with some room on the sides  i highly recommend this      
2434,5.0,                       says   person  but i used it alone           lb male  and it would ve been tight with a second person  perfect for one person with some stuff inside with them  duffel bag  camp chair  etc       
2435,5.0,                       so far  so good  we have used this   times  one in a torrential downpour  would only use for car camping though as it is heavy  you really need   people to help put it up and a tarp for under the tent  the kids love it and there is room for   people and a medium sized dog  no spiders can get in  big plus  and it has been water proof up until now      
2436,5.0,                       i go camping every year to the philadelphia folk festival  i needed a new tent  i know a coleman is great camping company  i used there tent sealer on the seems of it  it rain heavy this year  august       no water got into my tent      
2437,5.0,                       great tent small enough and big enough to be comfortable      
2438,5.0,                       love this tent  super easy to put up  i don t know how they can say it is a   person though  i would not put more than   people comfortably    would be pushing it  i use it with my queen size air mattress and it is perfect to fit that and a few bags inside      
2439,5.0,                       great one or two person tent   very easy to assemble and portable   held up well over a weekend of rain   while no rain came in through the walls  they are definitely not waterproof and could benefit from water repellent spray   definitely well worth the money      
2440,5.0,                       i got it last minute and i already used twice in different weather it works perfectly  one day was raining and we didn t get any water inside  just perfect      
2441,5.0,                       coleman simply makes awesome products   so well thought out for campers and well made     
2442,5.0,                       nice easy set up  great size and i love all the vents  testing it out this weekend      
2443,5.0,                       great tent  overnight on calling form a coast in october  wind and mist were no problem  slept two adults comfortably      
2444,5.0,                       great tent  easy set up and plenty of room inside for   campers  we fit a queen sized air mattress in it      
2445,1.0,                       one of the main cross poles broke the first time we set up the tent   the two fiberglass sections actually split in half the long way   i got fiberglass splinters in my hand when i tied to set it up      
2446,5.0,                       this is more like   person tent   i m   foot and i stretch end to end and half way into that i have to bend my knees  it is a good designed tent the first time i used it we had a severe storm come in with       mph wind gust this tent never budged with coleman   inch tent spikes in the ground   good design a little short      
2447,5.0,                       we have used this tent once in hot weather with many mosquitoes   one got in but i think it sneaked in with us   after its demise no more bugs    without the rain fly you sleep under the stars   it is light  but not for back packing   i have had it erected with the rain fly and it looks like it would keep out the rain   we will not likely use it in the rain  but anticipate using the rain fly when rain might occur   it is very light and easily erected   we are two  but bought the   person tent because of  the reasonable price   it sleeps two comfortably with room for our dog and moving around   i am   feet and could still stand up in in most of it   as oldsters we may use it with low cots      
2448,5.0,                       i purchased this for a mother daughter camp trip   i d never camped before in my life but this was super easy to set up and take down   the day we camped it poured and rained buckets of water and we stayed really dry   i especially liked the pockets inside for putting your stuff in and away from the floor   we were able to hang a lamp inside once it got dark which was really nice   the tent is also roomy for   people      
2449,5.0,                       i took this on a trip to yosemite park with   other friends and on other camping trips  it is very spacious and easily fits    people  none of my friends are  large   but we had     foot guys in it at one point with other friends and had plenty of room  it fits a queen sized air mattress with room for gear for car camping as well  it keeps rain out well and is overall a great tent  the bag it comes with is a bit small for it though  even by packing it efficiently      
2450,5.0,                       had same one before but  squirrel ate big hole in it was food storage tent     
2451,5.0,                       i used this tent on a camping trip that turned rainy and snowy  i stayed nice and dry inside even with out having treated the seams or adding additional tarp covers  the   person size fit my twin sized air mattress with plenty of room to spare  i m pretty sure another one would fit in there too      
2452,1.0,                       just unpacked our new tent at our campsite to find out there are missing pieces  only   stakes  missing one stick set that holds up the canopy bart of the tent       we now have to go to the store miles away from our campsite to get a new tent     really upset about this       
2453,5.0,                       easy to pitch    min   reasonably priced  speedy delivery  very roomy tent  i recommend an air mattress for more cushion but the tent is great and stylish      
2454,5.0,                       i love my little green tent   it has been with me now for many camping trips in all kinds of weather and terrain   it is so easy to assemble on my own   it fits in to small spaces amongst the trees   it rebounds with the wind and keeps me dry in the rain   couldn t be happier   i do find it is  for me  only suitable for one person camping   when my husband and i go out   we must have a larger tent to hold both of our bodies and our things        
2455,5.0,                       great buy for the size  a great tent for one person on a week long camp out  but would be too bulky for a week long backpacking trip i ve done two regional burning man type events in it in texas and it was great a friend of mine used one at burning man itself a couple of years ago and had no problems a good tent      
2456,5.0,                       it s definitely a quality tent worth the extra few        
2457,5.0,                       i haven t even opened this thing yet and i bought it like   months ago  i go campicamping a couple times a year  last time i went i broke my tent  so i needed a replacembt for next time  this one was a really good deal at the time  when i bought it  it was only     so can t lose      
2458,5.0,                       used this to camp at a festival for the weekend  the set up was quick and straightforward  and the second night it rained and stormed throughout the night  but the tent held up surprisingly well  with little to no water  i was impressed  however  although i had an idea of the size  it seemed smaller than i thought  definitely best for two people      
2459,5.0,                       bought this thing for a renaissance festival and thing works like a charm  took about    min for me to set up by myself  when it says   person it means   bodies can fit in it as if they were sardines  but that s like every tent  i was alone in mine and i had almost too much space  would reccomend     
2460,5.0,                       love this tent  it held up in the rain beautifully  even without a tarp underneath  assembling de assembling is a piece of cake      
2461,5.0,                       used this for many camping trips  still working fine fits me  my gear  and my dog just fine wish it had doors on both sides      
2462,5.0,                       easy set up must need for   person solo camp     
2463,5.0,                       survived a very bumpy night      
2464,3.0,                       if you have a queen size air mattress   you must inflate the air mattress in the tent you will be cramped for space   i suggest the   person tent instead for extended camping   other wise it was easy to set up and one person can easily  assemble the tent     
2465,5.0,                       i bought this as a gift for a friend and she loves it     
2466,5.0,                       this is a great tent  my   year old and i took it out camping for our first cub scout campout and it worked great  it is very easy to set up and took me probably    minutes working by myself we put a very big queen inflatable mattress in there and had just a little bit of room around the edges   not enough to walk around  just enough to keep some stuff in the tent i didn t rain  so i can t speak to its performance there  but it does have a rain flap folds up small and seems very sturdy      
2467,4.0,                       good tent  it definitely serves it s purpose as a small  inexpensive dwelling for a weekend camping trip  this was super easy to setup and take down  i would definitely recommend this product to any small family  group or couple      
2468,5.0,                       just took this on it s first camping trip  very easy to set up and take down in      minutes   haven t used it in the weather yet  but first impressions are that this is a great product at a great price      
2469,5.0,                       easy to assemble and store  i haven t used it in inclimate weather   so no input on that     
2470,1.0,                       the tent seems ok  but the cord in the tent pole broke after one use  and coleman customer support did not return my contact to their customer support team  the tent is in warranty      
2471,4.0,                       i got   of this for my parents in puerto rico after the earthquakes  it took too long to get there even with prime  i wish it will be faster shipping to the island  especially after natural disasters  the price was good and easy to assemble      
2472,4.0,                       love this tent    took it on  st camping trip with no issues and about to take it on   more  easy set up and packable  i would recommend buying better metal anchors since the ones that comes with it bend very easily      
2473,5.0,                       as advertised   no problems     
2474,5.0,                       good cheap tentfits a double air mattress     
2475,5.0,                       easy to set up   to storage     
2476,4.0,                         star because i don t like the ventilation in the tent      
2477,3.0,                       good tent  came with a small tear in the mesh when i first opened it which is a bummer but it is overall pretty good for the value     
2478,4.0,                       much smaller than anticipated  but still a quality tent      
2479,5.0,                       great product for the price  i use this for some solo camping and it is easily put up by one person  of course i also put up my two room ten person tent by myself  i definitely would recommend this for     people  i think even though it says   person it might get a little cramped unless   or   of those people are children  but it works great for the purpose i bought it for      
2480,5.0,                       great tent  easy assembly  lightweight  would love that it had more windows or ventilation for beach camping but in general it is the freshest tent for a great price      
2481,1.0,                       i put up and took down this tent probably   times  and the bungee rope in the rods broke  otherwise it did well for me     
2482,4.0,                       fits a queen size air mattress perfect for one person     
2483,5.0,                       love it kept me dry no leaks  no problems  easy to put up takes   min     
2484,4.0,                       easy to assemble with no need for written directions unless you have zero common sense   it makes for a safe and dry environment when the elements are not in your favor and rain becomes a threat  the tent goes down just as easily as it goes up and can hold three people very comfortably  i found this to be a very good purchase for the quality i received      
2485,5.0,                       i bought this for a recent camping trip   it was simple to put up  adequately sized for   adults  and easy to take down and put away i would not say this is really a   person tent   it fit   people very well but if your are going to put   people in this tent  you will not be able to put any luggage in the tent with you      
2486,5.0,                       the tent comes in a box  in the bag  with a generous carrying case once the cardboard is discarded however  i had trouble getting it to fit after use  mostly due to impatience with the snow  that being said  it setup easily  i used a tarp underneath  the same size as the tent  it comes with a little floor mat for your shoes  i also bought extra strong tent stakes for rocky ground  because it comes with regular dinky ones  it stood up to the wind and snow like a champ  it is very spacious and   camper plus gear had lots of spare room to sit and play cards  it has two mesh pockets and a place to attach a light at the top  overall it is the camping item that i was most pleased with on my trip      
2487,4.0,                       its a easy setup and basic tent  but this is a sleep only tent in my opinion  i m      and can not stand up inside which i m used to with most tents  but sleeping with   twins air mattresses was a pain  my point is great beginners tent but too small for my needs  my friend bough the   person and i was able to stand up inside      
2488,5.0,                       nice tent  easy to set up      
2489,5.0,                       amazing and came handy during our beach visit with the little one it was bought when planned for a picnic with the little one   but used when went to the beach  this is very easy to setup and dismantle  highly recommend      
2490,5.0,                       love the size   went fishing with some buddies and this tent was perfect for me and my gear   didn t rain on me  but expect it to perform just fine      
2491,2.0,                       easy to set up  bugs and humidity got in through wide opening      
2492,1.0,                       a bit disappointed     
2493,5.0,                       the tent is easy to set up and take down with the exception of removing the fiber glass poles thru the guides   if the metal parts on the poles were beveled i believe it would make it easier to pull them thru the quides   great tent for the price      
2494,5.0,                       i purchased this tent for a backpacking trip and its super easy to assemble  you can put it together in less than    minutes and comes with its own carry own bag  two people fit comfortably with full sleeping bags and it is quite roomy  if your looking for something simple and with enough room  this tent is perfect     
2495,5.0,                       pros  easy to set up  nice green color  good for rain and sun  haven t tried in the winter   stayed dried even when raining  breathable  good designcons  none     
2496,4.0,                       this is a nice tent to have  for the most part it holds up to rain  i still get some water that gets in at all the corners  this is very fast and easy to set up      
2497,5.0,                       good little tent  especially for the price  it fits   people with no room to spare  you might have trouble if you re over   feet tall  easy to put up and comes with a little tarp to put in front of the door  which is very nice      
2498,5.0,                       the product is as described in the picture  this one arrived in the right time and without any mishaps  i recommend it  bought from medellin  colombia      
2499,5.0,                       easy tent for quick set up  says its a   person tent  but in reality its a single person or a couples tent  lightweight and easy to setup and break down  i set mine and sprayed it down with waterproofing as soon as i got it so i am not too sure how well it resists water out of the box  it rained quite a bit on the trip i took it out on and didn t get a single drop of water inside      
2500,4.0,                       i was looking for a lightweight tent to use on ragbrai  register annual great bike ride across iowa  which is a   day bike tour across iowa  my requirements included ease of set up and that it would sleep one person  and hold all my gear  for a relatively inexpensive tent  the sundome performed quite well  this tent held up through a severe rain storm that included high winds and hail  the inside of the tent remained completely dry      
2501,4.0,                       a good tent and easy enough to set up by yourself  found this out the hard way  but it is not waterproof  the rain cover will protect the top of the tent but rain and water will get in into the areas that are not covered by the cover      
2502,4.0,                       held up great in rough weather  first night of use was through outer bands of tropical storm  heavy rain all night and stayed bone dry  goes up and breaks down quick and easy   slept   easily with two on queen air mattress and two on sleeping pads with room left over for gear      
2503,5.0,                       great value for the money  took about   minutes for two experienced campers to erect  likely not much longer for newbies  i like the airflow feature near the back of the tent  perfect for two people and their gear also  we got absolutely hammered by a     hour thunderstorm our first night using the tent and were completely dry in the morning  though the tent was set up on a tarp   would recommend      
2504,5.0,                       easy to set up  fits a full or queen size air mattress  it s nice to have the cover for the top to keep out rain and dew  there s a nice vent at ground level to keep air flow while you sleep      
2505,5.0,                       enough room for a single person to spread out  or two people to sleep on their back with their hands at their sides  can sit up in it and still have a half a foot to the top  withstood an entire day of rain with just damp corners  easy to set up and to put on the rain guard      
2506,5.0,                       recently used the tent for a winter campout   pitched the tent in snow   i was concerned the poles might snap due to the cold temps   the tent and poles did well  the night time temps were in the upper teens      
2507,3.0,                       i bought this tent for my yearly camping rafting trips with friends  overall seems to be a reasonably well built product a few minor issues  the stakes provided with the tent are incredibly flimsy  save yourself the time and just buy back ups now   a little difficult to set up by yourself  this is an issue with most multi person tents  though so i don t really hold it against them      
2508,5.0,                       i bought it for my   year old last year  she wanted a hiding private space  this thing is huge  easy and simple to put together  i did it myself   easy to take apart and put back in storage      
2509,5.0,                       our favorite tent  we have this tent in both   and   person sizes  super easy set up  one person can do in less than    min  folds up small and doesn t take up much space either      
2510,2.0,                       just mist order from overnight and my sleeping bag ended up wet  not cool waste of money     
2511,5.0,                       love this tent                  
2512,5.0,                       beautiful design and color  can fit two people well plus our things  we use a twin size air mattress  easy to assemble and pack      
2513,5.0,                       i took the tent out for a spin one july weekend in indiana  it did great through a lot of drizzle both nights  there was no moisture in the tent at all  the ventilation is good  but i did remove the rain fly for more ventilation while it was in the high    s the bottom of the tent is tarp material  so you really don t need an additional tarp under the tent  nice  one less thing to pack  it was an easy setup  probably took       mins  one person can set it up by themselves without much hassle  although it would be easier with two  the instructions are easy to understand  and the bag is a nice size for packing  keep in mind that it sleeps   people  but that means no room for gear  i expect to use it for many years      
2514,5.0,                       easy to pitch and break down alone  price was good and small size when packed  good weekend tent so far      
2515,5.0,                       the tent is easy to set up  has two mesh pockets inside   the heavy duty tarp like floor extends to the lower part of the walls  which makes it less likely to get wet   we stayed dry in a heavy rain      
2516,5.0,                       best tent  good ventilation and easy to assemble  seller fast delivery     
2517,4.0,                       good tent for the money  haven t had it in the rain yet  sets up just like any dome style tent  pretty easy for one person  i only wish coleman would have made it where you could zip the side vents closed      
2518,4.0,                       this tent comes with it s own little carrying case   i opened it just to make sure there were no rips in the fabic       degrees in nebraska   won t take it outside for a while    anyway  set it up  no tears of rips  the stakes are small metal one  i expected that and i will replace them for better ones  overwall very pleased with perchace  however  much too small carrying case   couldn t get poles in case  will update later      
2519,5.0,                       this tent is perfect for   people and short stay camping  it is easy to put up  light and compact to travel with  not a whole lot of extra room  but enough for beds and baggage      
2520,5.0,                       well  the second time using this tent it poured rain overnight and my son stayed dry   unfortunately most of the other cub scouts couldn t say the same   so  i d recommend this tent  for sure      
2521,5.0,                    excelente tienda de campa a  soporto la lluvia        
2522,4.0,                       this is actually a really nice tent  it stayed dry through a pretty intense thunderstorm  the only moisture i encountered was condensation on the inside of the tent from my breath all night  it dries off quickly in the sun  and the privacy is nice inside the tent with the rainfly on i did take off one star because i think it would be uncomfortable for two  large  people to sleep in  i m a good      and i ended up sleeping somewhat diagonally so that i wasn t touching the sides of the tent  while i see it could definitely  fit  two people  with the gear and stuff i kept in the tent with me  it was only big enough for   i would say this is a great weekender tent  maybe for the single person or a close couple  it comes in a carrying bag  which was easy to pack the tent into after the camping trip  the tent itself doesn t weigh too much  but i wouldn t want to carry it around all day putting it up is very fast  can probably be fully up and ready to go in   minutes if you have a helping hand  take down is just as fast  one feature i really appreciated was that the floor of the tent is made of tarp material and that material goes up and around all sides of the tent by a few inches  so even if you ve got a lot of water around you  you won t get wet the description didn t mention it  but it comes with   metal wire stakes to secure all the tie downs to the ground  there is also a ring which you could hang a light from in the very top of the tent      
2523,5.0,                       this has been a great purchase and it has held up well i bought this for short camping trips  e g  weekend trips    i use this primarily for car camping i selected this particular style of tent because i was familiar with the setup process the tent is well made and very quick to setup   i can get it up in under ten minutes   the process is straightforward and intutive moreover  the tent has many nice features for the price   it has pockets for small items and a dangling piece on the ceiling for clipping fans or lights to   the door is well made and the ventilation is generally good   i say  generally  because i used this in may and didn t have a fan and the tent was stifling for the first part of the night i will say that i have only used this in good weather and have yet to be in it when it s been raining   i don t expect that my opinion would change though   the seams are all sealed and the rain fly attaches well all in all   i m happy with this purchase   easy to set up  nice features  holding up well  and light  for car camping    i would recommend this      
2524,5.0,                       after doing tons of research and reading reviews and visiting sporting goods stores i finally settled on buying this tent for my birthday camping trip  i m not one who goes camping regularly so i was worried that set up might be a bit challenging  but it definitely was not  i was able to get the tent set up in about    minutes very easily  the interior was spacious enough for   adults with plenty of wiggle room and room for gear  the accessory pockets inside held everything with ease and breakdown was just as easy  the only challenging part was getting the tent rolled small enough to fit in the included carrying bag  but i chock that up to operator error  overall it was a great tent at a great price and performed exactly as we had hoped and am definitely looking forward to our next camping trip      
2525,4.0,                       very happy with this tent   perfect size for two people and our bags and incredibly easy to put up  and fold back into the bag  which to me is sometimes more frustrating than putting it up    four stars because i can t vouch for longevity  as i ve only used it twice   also  the zipper catches on this odd flap of cloth sometimes when you try to zip it all the way down  most definitely a bargain for the price   no regrets on the purchase      
2526,5.0,                       first time going camping and i was a bit intimidated with setting up but it was very easy to assemble and to take down  it is lightweight and held up nicely with the wind and spills my children made  very happy with my purchase      
2527,2.0,                       used it for the second time the past week  woke up to a puddle in my tent after a small sprinkle  seems that the water was getting in from the seams   puddle not in picture but of the drops     
2528,5.0,                       the tent setup was straightforward and took little time  it has been through a couple of rainy days without leaking  good little tent for one or two persons  no surprise that it s a little of a tight fit for two people  but it s very compact when folded up  i would buy it again      
2529,3.0,                       this tent wont hold a queen air mattress like they said it will  its good for a youth   good tent but not for adults     
2530,5.0,                       i have only used it once and it s easy to assemble  i will be updating it later for the quality of weather proof and water resistance      
2531,4.0,                       used it twice so far but i m impressed  set up and clean up are quick and easy and then tent seals well      
2532,1.0,                       this tent definitely does not accommodate   people  one adult and one child is about all you were get in here  disappointed because i got this for the three of us and now have to purchase a bigger tent      
2533,4.0,                       i will be updating this review due to the fact that i got it to give as a christmas gift  but  in the meantime i was very happy with the fact that its pretty light and comes in a carry bag  it also was incredibly easy to wrap which was a definite plus      
2534,4.0,                       i had this tent on the beach and it held up well  it rained on one night and i had no water issues  you just have to make sure to have the cover on  this is definitely a summer tent with all the air vents and windows  it got fairly cold at night but nothing blankets can t fix  i would rather be a little chilly than steamy  i only gave   stars because this is not exactly a   person tent  i would say this is more of a     person tent with space for backpacks  lights  etc  i had bought a   person blow up mattress for this tent and it was a tight fit with all our stuff    duffel bag  baby cooler    flashlights  small bag of snacks   it worked great for me and my boyfriend    children is possible in this tent but not   adults unless you want to be laying on top of each other  this tent was easy to set up and take down  we did not have any issues folding the tent back up into the tent bag      
2535,3.0,                       so so quality  a little disappointed      
2536,5.0,                       i took this backpacking in the tetons   it was a little heavy for back packing but i have seen these coleman tents work amazing in the worst rain and wind storms      
2537,5.0,                       amazon had it on sale for     when i bought it  for that price  it s incredible  it s no light weight backpacking tent  but it seems like it ll last a while      
2538,5.0,                       excellent tent  especially in warmer weather  nice and tall  can sleep quite a few people if you really squish in  we slept   college students without bags or gear in this tent  very waterproof  was one of   tents in our group that didn t leak when our campsite was underwater      
2539,5.0,                       there s enough room to lay flat like a starfish and contemplate your life     
2540,5.0,                       i ve been beating the cr p out of this tent for a couple of years now  from mountains to deserts to forests and even strapped to the back of my motorcycle ripping down the highways  it s taken all of the use and abuse with ease  for the price  you really can t beat it      
2541,5.0,                       we did get a little bit of water in the tent during a storm but nothing unbearable at all  could have been due to the rain coming down sideways cuz of wind  but overall kept us dry  lightweight but difficult to get everything back in tent bag after first opening  like every thing else  but can be done      
2542,2.0,                       if you re looking for a cheap tent to have backyard sleepovers for the kids this one might work  but if you re looking for a family tent to give you years of camping use you may want to pay a little more for a better brand  we used this tent twice this summer in yellowstone for   days and later for   days and the pole sleeves have already torn  the wind was up a bit on the last trip but nit enough to justify the failure  i d say maybe we got a bad one  but i just returned another coleman tent that tore at the stake loop on the corner after using one time in the back yard  guess i m heading to rei  my last rei tent lasted almost    years      
2543,3.0,                       smaller than i thought  didnt really protect from the cold weather     
2544,4.0,                       as described   good quality tent   bottom part looks little cheaper quality but acceptable  bag and acc come with it and both of them are ok quality  no complains at first look and first try  i paid     as a lighting deal and it is better then what i paid for  it is made in china but very good quality check i think      
2545,5.0,                       this tent was so easy to set up my         year old daughters did it by themselves   come in a nice bag and can be put back into the bag after you set it up      
2546,5.0,                       great tent for me and my pup  super compact when not assembled and quite roomy  i was able to put her dog bed inside along with my sleeping bag with room to spare  a little tricky to set up  but that s only because i m new to camping  very satisfied and extremely affordable      
2547,5.0,                       it survived a south dakota hailstorm without getting us wet whatsoever  the tent is pretty roomy   we easily three people and gear inside without difficulty  for the price  it s definitely a must have      
2548,5.0,                       small and i can stand up in it     
2549,1.0,                       we used this for one week   the elastic bands that hold the rods together all came apart and the telescoping pieces can no longer support the tent   it was really a total waste of money   it s a real disappointment  and i would recommend you not buy this product      
2550,5.0,                       we got this for my boys   and    for back yard camping  they were able to assemble on their own little to no assistance  they love it and in use every weekend  so far its holding up strong  they went as far and turned on the sprinkler system to test rain resistant  according to my    year old it passed      
2551,4.0,                       used it on a dry summer night  not sure how water proof it is  but initial feedback is that it is nice for the price      
2552,5.0,                       we now have   sundomes that we use for our girl scout troop  and our scouts bsa troop has gotten started using this same model as well   it s a nice size  durable  easy to put up and take down  even for kids  and is at a great price point      
2553,5.0,                       they should call this tent the gargantua  because it is huge  great deal for the pricehighly recommend      
2554,4.0,                       i m bummed because i bought this at a ridiculously high price and then the price was slashed in half over the holidays  my son loves the tent but i m bummed at the value  if you get it for less than      buy it      
2555,4.0,                       i purchased a second one because i liked the first one so much  as always though with tent sizes they always seem to claim to sleep  people   that would fit easily in a packed clown car  i use it as a   person tent  though it could fit     i guess if everyone was no taller than       then this would be a good tent for    at    feet tall however it is hard to find good tents that don t make you feel cramped  i happen to like this one      
2556,5.0,                       i went camping over a summer weekend and needed a tent on short notice  i bought this one because of the good reviews  it is  x  and i was the only one sleeping in it  so it was nice and roomy  i opted for the   person instead of the   person because it was only a    difference it is really easy to set up  i am not much of an outdoors person  and i had never set up a tent before  i did it by myself with no problems it rained all night and i didn t notice any leaking through the seams anywhere  i rolled up a tarp underneath too so i wouldn t have problems with puddling  i would say there is a good amount of ventilation  since i wasn t uncomfortably hot during the night i m happy with my purchase  i m no camping expert  but it was good to use for a weekend camping trip  it held up and i m sure it will last me for a while      
2557,5.0,                       good investment  i really like this tent      
2558,4.0,                       took this tent camping this past weekend for   nights  it rained pretty heavy the first night  the inside of the tent stayed dry  not one drop inside  the   person option is huge and has plenty of room for   people to sleep in comfortably and have plenty of gear      
2559,3.0,                       if you re taller than       you better sleep like a mummy because there is absolutely no stretching room with this one  it was easy to assemble  and more importantly  easy to fold up and put back into its box storage  very waterproof  no need to spray this with scotch guard pretty bare bones  can t say it s good or bad unless you re tall      
2560,5.0,                       perfect size for two adults  this fit two very large twin air mattresses with plenty of space to move around them  great ventilation as well does not block light at all  which i don t mind but some folks do easily assembled and disassembled      
2561,5.0,                       perfect for one or two people  so easy to set up  i m a complete camping novice  and i set up this tent in about   minutes  i love the  sky light  option  too  great for star gazing       
2562,5.0,                       bought this tent for a last minute camping trip and i couldn t be happier with my purchase  stood up to wind and rain  but also very breathable on the humid nights that followed  easy to set up and take down  came in a convenient carrying pouch which made storing it a breeze      
2563,5.0,                       it s a cheap tent but sleeps one easily     
2564,5.0,                       used on a rainy camping trip and this held up really well  fit a queen blowup mattress for two people perfectly      
2565,5.0,                       so far so good  i live in the tropics and wanted a good size tent for car camping for my   person family  i m still trying to figure out how the hell do you do hiking camping with a   year old without bringing so much stuff      
2566,5.0,                       used this multiple times  keeps moisture out and stable in windy conditions  about a    minute setup with no issues or tears  plus it s larger than the other   person coleman tent i have  pleasantly surprised      
2567,4.0,                       a good  inexpensive tent that has plenty of room for four people and some equipment  tents are always rated for more people than can comfortably fit      
2568,5.0,                       nice tent  fits   average size people no problem  easy to set up  good quality      
2569,5.0,                       great tent  easy to set up  and big enough to fit our queen size air mattress  a couple of duffle bags  and our two big dogs on blankets  we took this on a road trip and got to where we could set it up and tear it down in under    minutes  respectively   quality seems good  love that the flooring is already tarp material  i typically throw a tarp down on the ground under it just be safe      
2570,5.0,                       simple and fast tent to pitch  i paid      on an amazon deal   amazing  for that price  because the top is open under the fly  we froze in    f overnight weather  still can t complain      
2571,5.0,                       i d recommend this item to any hiker  camper it s spacious light and  waterproof the colors are great     
2572,4.0,                       awesome for summer fun     
2573,5.0,                       i had this tent for about   years now  great tent this past weekend i went camping and there were    to    mph winds and the tent had no problem  very strong and it didnt collapse in  even with a canopy falling over on it  stayed dry even though outside there was about     inches of rain on the ground  definitely worth it  would buy it again if i need it too      
2574,5.0,                       great for what it s for  plenty of room for   people      
2575,5.0,                       cute tent and easy setup  roomy for a smaller tent      
2576,5.0,                       my son camps a few times a year  not all the kids have tents  but there is always extra room with this as an extra spare tent      
2577,5.0,                       it has plenty of space  and so far the bottom has held up through some pretty bad abuse      
2578,5.0,                       first trip it snowed about    inches  this little tent was still standing no problem  dry inside  easy to put up and take down for not being an instant tent   small packing size is great  definitely worth the money      
2579,5.0,                    muy recomendada para campamento en      metros sobre el nivel del mar msnm        
2580,5.0,                       i love it  i bought it for my significant other and i he s     so i figured this size would be enough and it is  love the color too      
2581,5.0,                       it s a nice  high quality tent  can t wait to take it out on a trip      
2582,5.0,                       very good price and quality     
2583,5.0,                       great quality tent and easy to put up alone  would recommend getting titanium stakes with it  stakes it comes with are not the best for some campsites  already have a few bent ones from the last camping trip      
2584,4.0,                       fits an air mattress perfectly  i only had three people using it but i think it would fit about four people and luggage very snug     
2585,5.0,                       yes  you can buy tents far better than this  but only for hundreds of dollars more  for      this tent is a steal  it s massive on the inside  most people will be able to stand up inside it  probably a good idea to buy better stakes  but that s pretty much always true with coleman tents  for fairly low key car camping  it s perfect      
2586,3.0,                       really difficult to assemble when severely intoxicated  in all seriousness though the spikes included in this set are incredibly flimsy and the disassembly instructions aren t really clear so getting this back in the bag it comes in is damned near impossible  looks decent and keeps the rain out at least      
2587,4.0,                       easy to dis assemble  mesh at the top of the inner tent lets in air but also sand  not suitable for desert camping  room for one double airbed  would struggle to fit   people      
2588,5.0,                       fun tent for teo     
2589,4.0,                       ok for the money     
2590,5.0,                       love this tent   used it for the first time last night and its a super easy set up only took about    minutes   now that i have done it once it would only take about    to set up  high quality materials well made  love that there is only   poles needed to set the tent up and they set up easily  the mesh on the top of the tent is awesome on a nice night with the rain fly off we will be able to sleep under the stars  really happy with this purchase      
2591,5.0,                       went camping with this tent and what would you know  it rained heavily the first night  we did have a tarp under the tent  but the downpour did not get any rain in the tent and the rain fly withstood high winds without even seeming like it would come off  when muggy  the tent inside wasn t too horrible  the airflow is good  was comfortable with my husband and i in the tent  we had plenty of room for us  our two bags  and room to step in out without stepping on each other i would highly recommend this tent to others who would like a nice tent for general use      
2592,5.0,                       held up to rain showers through out the night  stayed dry  not much protection from wind  def a spring and summer tent      
2593,5.0,                       used this tent   time so far  it set up quickly and easily  i didn t need the directions to set it up  it fits nicely back in the bag     
2594,3.0,                       solid tent for a solid price  unfortunately it didn t survive the first camping trip due to a rainstorm  all   corners let water in  i ll be starting the return process once i get back  i m looking for a more reliable tent  as wisconsin weather can be unpredictable      
2595,4.0,                       if you have   people  make sure buy tent for   people  this is too small for   people      
2596,5.0,                       nice tent and is actually larger than i expected  me and my friends are enjoying it and are looking forward to more camping trips     
2597,5.0,                       one word  amazing  can t beat the cross breeze netting  you can t beat the price for the size  the best part  the weather resistance  we did nothing but unpack this tent and the same night  the rain came down  i mean it was downpours of rain for     hours  bone dry inside  wouldn t buy any other tent      
2598,5.0,                       i use it when i camp off my motorcycle  it fits in my duffle bag and is roomy enough for all my stuff and myself      
2599,4.0,                       its a good tent     
2600,5.0,                    exelente art culo        
2601,5.0,                       so after searching and researching a lot about tents i went ahead and bought this tent and boy it fulfilled all my expectations so there we were at ohiophyles after a day long white water rafting and it was raining on and off  we set up our tents  one ozarktrail from walmart and one coleman s  this one   all of a sudden there were severe thunder storms and it started to rain very heavily  the ozarktrail tent was soaking in water and it was all wet inside while the coleman remained absolutely dry even in such heavy rains    we were about to pack up n leave but coleman saved the night for us  though in ozark s favour i should say that that tent was like     years old and had been used a lot of times and i think the rod for their rain sheet was missing and so it was sticking to the actual tent while our coleman was brand new  though it was a  bit cramped up for   of us but we managed as none of us was   feet all in all i am now much more confident about camping out in rains with this tent and it easily would fit   people      
2602,5.0,                       bought it for my homeless cousin  he loves it  says it keeps him warm in the winter and breathes in the summer  he does wonder why there is such a focus on capitalism  and the one percenters  as opposed to the homeless  sick  and dying americans out on the streets      
2603,5.0,                       we just went camping and love our tent  i would say that it can fit   people comfortable not    it was easy to assemble and take apart  not bugs came in  it was completely dry in the rain and strong quality      
2604,5.0,                       perfect for short camping trips  easy to assemble like other tents  durable      
2605,1.0,                       didn t hold up   poles broke     
2606,4.0,                       no complaints about the tent  other than that it would be really tight for   adults to fit in there  i slept with two of my kids and there was very little room to move around  outside of that though it was easy to set up  easy to take down and package back up  would probably be perfect as a two person tent      
2607,5.0,                       this thing is amazing  i ve taken it in the woods  in the rain  and on the beach  super windy and cold at night   for the price of      this is a really good deal as other reviews have stated  i would get a tarp and other stakes also get an air mattress for like     on amazon  with a hand pump   it will save your back      
2608,5.0,                       i don t really require much from a tent  it should be easy to set up  have some thermal control  and be able to take a little rain  on it s first use this tent displayed the capability to do all of those things  it took my gf and i    minutes to set up and about     to break down  there s a bottom vent that provides pretty good airflow  and if you re cold the rain fly does a pretty good job of keeping the heat in      
2609,5.0,                       great tent  it was out first time camping and it worked so well for us  we camped in northern colorado  it has these zippers you can unzip as a window which was pretty cool  it also rained a bit and this tent just held up so great  highly recommend      
2610,5.0,                       i bought   for grandkids camping out in yard during covid    they love them  up for   weeks now  roomy for        
2611,3.0,                       this is a nice tent  easy to set up  just a few minutes  and feels like reasonable quality  my only beef  and the reason i m returning it is the windows don t have zipper closures do forget   season camping      
2612,5.0,                       this tent is awesome  super light weight  but weatherproof and sturdy once built  instructions were easy to follow and took about    minutes to set the entire tent up      
2613,5.0,                       great tent for the money      
2614,5.0,                       amazing  perfect for two people even though says   person  i mean   can fit but was perfect for me and my girl  actually had a huge strong storm the week we went camping and thus actually kept us and our items inside the tent completely dry  took a few min to completely understand how to put it together  really just the poles  i felt like i was going to break them but i didn t  and eventually figured out how to put them up      
2615,5.0,                       well made tent  easy set up  product was as advertised and arrived quickly      
2616,5.0,                       we bought this tent for memorial day to put on the top of a houseboat to protect from the rain  it survived through   heavy rain thunderstorms only being held down by the weight in the tent  the waterproof cover stayed put  i would highly recommend this tent     
2617,5.0,                       i bought the   person   x  ft tent  first tent we have ever owned  we put it up in the front yard to test it out before went camping with it  a queen sized air matress fits in it pretty well with a foot of space on   sides perfect size for   adults that are      lbs each and an   lb black lab that is a bed hog  the  person leaves plenty of extra space to move around while you re sleeping  love the clip in the center ceiling of the tent  makes it very easy to clip on the base of our battery operated lantern the first night we used the tent  it was in the   s  and as long as we had the sundome sides secured to the ground  it keeps the cold air out pretty well  it may have helped out a little that we had a giant dog laying between us though      
2618,5.0,                       i have used this item several times already  i love it  its easy to put up  the only hard part is the rain fly  but i think we have it down now  i have been in a windy storm and it held up great  no leaking or problems      
2619,4.0,                       i have purchased coleman tents before  and i find that they are as reliable as much more expensive tents  i have had these in a downpour and they do not leak at all  the plastic base is sturdier than the lightweight material on the sides i will never buy a      tent again      
2620,4.0,                       easy to set up     
2621,1.0,                       dont like its quality     
2622,5.0,                       decided to test my tent out and we ll  it s also puppy proof lol  my puppy decided to jump on it and she legit bounced back   she s okay  but it s nice the wind did not blow it away  i poured water on it to see if it is waterproof and dang my tent was not affected whatsoever  and it is light     love this tent        
2623,5.0,                       good product  as advertised     
2624,5.0,                       we only had one problem during assembly remember hooks clamp on the rod  other than that  it was easy  this says   man but that does not mean that you could fit   adults in it  maybe   very small children  we were able to fit one queen size air mattress in there and barley had room for bags and other items for   people  great tent  great price      
2625,4.0,                       this tent is amazing but it is small  a grown man probably cannot fit in the tent comfortably but it is lightweight  easily constructed  and appealing to the eye  i recommend this tent to the shorter people who aren t claustrophobic      
2626,3.0,                       good tent  easy to set up and pack  looks good quality  enough space inside     but my one came with a holes in a floor material  nothing that some repair kit can t fix and i don t feel like sending it back for such small issue  but still i would expect more from coleman      
2627,5.0,                       i spent the weekend of      thru      on carolina beach for the annual jeep weekend  it rained everyday several times a day  i treated the tent with scotch guard prior to the trip  it held up wonderfully  at one point the wind was crazy bad and the tent took it like a champ  perfectly roomy for two people with air mattresses and room for additional items  coolers and bags  would recommend      
2628,4.0,                       all went well     
2629,5.0,                    buena calidad        
2630,4.0,                       i have an older non sundome tent version  the sundome version has much more ventilation in the ceiling of the tent  for camping  i purchased this to use for my grandsons when camping with me in the summer  it is very much like my older version and is a very good value for summer camping  i wish they had incorporated the more single set up friendly bow connections at the base  these are a bit tricky with a single person  the rain fly set up needs to be staked with the provided flaps or the dew will enter the inside  all in all a very good value and i plan to use it over and over      
2631,5.0,                       i wasn t expecting much for less than     but i was impressed  easy to set up and easy to put away  solid build  went camping in the desert in high wind area and it held up just fine  fit sleeping pad and had plenty of room  light and co pact definitely recommend this tent  can t beat the price      
2632,5.0,                       perfect for camping in rain or sun   kept us dry when it rained and cool enough inside when it was hot   perfect buy     
2633,5.0,                       easy to set up  although i think it is a good idea to do it once at home to get familiar with it good sized   easily fits a queen sized air mattress with plenty of room around for gear   spacious for two   fine for three if at least one is a kid  wouldn t go more than that      
2634,5.0,                       this tent rules  my friends are all jealous when i whip it out on camping trips  i haven t been in rain with it yet      
2635,4.0,                       this tent is easy to set up and decently sized  though the   person rating is stretching it a bit  this is a perfect size for two people with air mattresses and their gear  but with   people you d have to go with simpler padding  or no padding at all       
2636,5.0,                       good product      
2637,4.0,                       not sure why i thought this was bigger than it is but it did what we needed it to do   fit a full size air mattress completely with no room for anything else in the tent      
2638,3.0,                       this is a nice tent  nice material  easy to set up  not being a camper and although i read many reviews  i was not prepared for how truly small it is    lol     
2639,5.0,                       this was very easy to put up by only one person  we bought a queen size blow up mattress to go in it and it fit great with room to spare  this seems like a nice easy tent to put up and down  i bought it as a gift so hopefully they agree      
2640,5.0,                       kids love it     
2641,5.0,                       awesome tent  easy to set up  great price  bought the   person size for just myself and husband and have plenty of room for our stuff      
2642,5.0,                       absolutely love the tent i set it up in the living room for the kids to play in and this tent is way bigger than i imagined the family loves it      
2643,5.0,                       very comfortable and roomy  fits a twin size blow up mattress perfectly  it says it fits a full  but i haven t tried it  there was definitely enough space for a bigger mattress  but i like to have space to move around      
2644,5.0,                       such a great value  we bought this for a   day weekend in the desert  it doesn t get too hot with the side windows open  and kept us warm at night  very durable and well made      
2645,5.0,                       the shipping came ahead of schedule  great little tent  easy to set up and the instructions are attached to the storage bag so they won t get lost which i think is a great added feature  the open top is great to keep down condensation but can be a little chilly on colder camping trips  but if you throw a light blanket over it when it s cold it will keep it comfortable inside      
2646,5.0,                       this was gift to my son  he loves his new tent      
2647,4.0,                       i was satisfied that i was getting a quality coleman product which was well made and sturdy  i believe i got what i paid for  having compared this to a lot of other tents before buying it  this tent is easy to set up and take down  practice once before you take it out to camp   you won t need to worry about the directions after that  but they are  sewn onto  the inside of the carry bag      i had a twin air mattress  and that was at an angle   if side to side  it pushed against the sides of the tent  so  i had plenty of extra room to put food storage  backpack  water  clothes  etc  a queen air mattress would still leave room for basic stuff  where i had some unused space  even   with a twin the zip on the front flap door was secure and easy  and i was able to keep the little gnats out  i hadn t realized there would be mesh only triangles on either side of the tent  but it was high enough for the rainfly to shelter it  i don t know how it would be with windy rainy conditions my friend had a coleman tent that was approx the same size as mine  a few years old  and i noticed a definite difference in the material it was made of   his was a bit heavier gauge and seemed more durable than mine  although mine was fine for camping in a campground  i would want something sturdier and not see through if i was going to be in more inclement weather    something i didn t like    though i liked the white green color  it was pretty transparent all in all  it was a good investment for me  since i am not a regular camper everything fit perfectly back into the sturdy zip up bag it came in  and the handles make it easy to carry  also great for one person and lots of  stuff   would be fine for two and room for packs  etc   three  no  i don t think so  kids  maybe         
2648,4.0,                       work for me and my dad was able to go camping with my daughter     
2649,5.0,                       great tent  easy to assemble  wouldn t expect such a great tent for such a low price  uusd it four times this past summer and everyone couldn t believe how big and tall it was  not to mention it was easy to put back in      
2650,5.0,                       this tent is great  very easy to set up  easy to pack up  and light to carry  i especially like the  plastic rubberized  floor of the tent  keeps the moisture away from sleeping bags   just fits  a queen air mattress  so use that as you source for size  love the little zip hole for an electrical line    helps to keep the phone charged while you are sleeping      
2651,5.0,                       this tent is great  for the price it s seriously awesome  it fits three people but two of us went and took a dog and it was perfect  it also rained and we had no leaks  and it s easy to put away thanks coleman       
2652,5.0,                       used the tent a week after purchasing   easy set up  and take down   rained the first night but the rain cover and tent floor performed great   no leaks   expecting tent to provide good results on follow up camping sessions      
2653,5.0,                       really love this tent   price and quality is really good   i would recommend it         
2654,2.0,                       the first time i used it  it leaked  not a lot  and it s true that we had fairly high winds     mph   but i was disappointed  i m just back from my camping  trip and haven t had a chance to contact the company  i ll post the results when i ve gotten in touch with them there s no way that   people plus gear would be anything but too cramped to stay friends  especially in stormy weather  as all sleeping bags would be up against the sides of the tent  i prefer a modicum of comfort for my aging bones  so i use an inflatable mattress  which took up fully half the tent  this isn t a problem specific to coleman  though  it s the unrealistic advertising of the entire industry  it would be nice if they listed it as    person if you re really small or you like to sleep like sardines  but if you want to breathe or roll over during the night  plan on no more than   people  it s too short to stand up in  which is a major failing comfort wise  but again standard in anything less than a full sized family tent  i have one of those  but i was on my own this trip and it s too much for one person to put up  which is why i bought this one aside from those complaints  it s a nice enough tent  there s sufficient airflow  and with the windows zipped shut  it was actually quite warm in the cooler nights  low   s   no rain came in except along the bottom  and i had   days of rain   the pieces go together easily  and i really like the way they designed the sleeves for the main supports  i ve used other tents where the joins in the fiberglass pole pieces  kept catching  but these were great  they slipped through very easily  both pushing and pulling      
2655,5.0,                       perfect for car camping  sets up quick     
2656,5.0,                       i just received the tent a week ago  i chose the coleman sundome   person tent  the first thing i did was to set up  i had help available but wanted to do it myself to see if i could set it up alone  it was an easy setup  it took me about    minutes the first time to set it up and about    minutes to take it down and put it back in the the bag  of course it was a nice sunny day in the low   s in my front yard  however  i think i will be able to  set it up in a campground just as quick or maybe even quicker  my camping is usally at a campground out of a pickup truck  next summer i am hoping to get my wife to take a trip in the boundry water caonoe area  it will be a camp site without much  if any  portage  i am       and i can stand in the middle of the tent which was one reason for the   the    x    footprint is big and will be perfect for me and my wife plus gear  maybe a bit over kill in size for us but it is nice to have all that room without much extra weight or bulk  i plan to use seam sealer on the seams between the bottom material and the sides of the tent as other reviewers have suggested  i will update this review after actually camping in it  i plan on bringing some extra bungee pole cord  it looks to me that i could use the poles easily without the pole bungee cord inside of them if needed  however  for a few bucks why not bring the extra cord  i am also going to buy some more substantial stakes but will use the ones supplied with the tent for boundry water canoe camping because of their light weight      
2657,5.0,                       this is a great little tent for     people    i bought it for my dogs to get out of the rain in my back yard  and it s holding up pretty well  good price for the quality     
2658,5.0,                       sturdy tent for a new boy scout  packed well and delivered quickly  can t go wrong with coleman      
2659,5.0,                       really great tent with a lot of room   you could sleep   for sure   very well ventilated   i did not get to test it for how well it handles rain   when i do  i ll edit my review   easy set up and everything fits back into the bag after tearing it down   the ground vent flap and a sort of welcome mat is nice plus      
2660,5.0,                       easy set up     
2661,5.0,                       this tent is amazing  we went on a trip in the mountains and it started to rain like crazy with strong winds  so much that you could basically feel how rivers of water were moving the floors underneath us   however  no one drop of water made it into the tent   my only  negative  comment would be that this is not a   person tent   two people fit very comfortably and maybe three if they are tiny      
2662,5.0,                    buen producto        
2663,5.0,                       this tent is incredibly easy to set up  it took me less than    minutes to do  it has everything you need in one conveniently small package that you could easily take with you for hiking or backpacking      
2664,5.0,                       great tent never leaks its awesome  just get a set of longer stakes than come with it or you ll blow away      
2665,5.0,                       worked well for me for two nights in the nc cradle for forestry  make sure to get the silicone sealer for it too  well worth it to keep dry while the boys around me were waking up to a puddle in their tents     
2666,5.0,                       this tent withstood   severe thunderstorms with not a leak  we weren t lucky campers and yes we checked the weather reports   this is one solid little tent for the weekend or novice camper  the mattress that comes with it isn t twin sized it is single which is smaller  this tent will fit two of them and sleep two comfortably  for hot weather camping there was plenty of screening and venting  it was truly my home away from home      
2667,4.0,                       this thing is bigger than i expected  i was going to get the   man tent but thought i ll get the   man for extra room  this tent set up was quick and easy but the rain fly seems kinda flimsy      
2668,5.0,                       really nice tent for the price  got it for camping outside the car at parks with the wife  would say it fits two people comfortably maybe    four people would be shoulder to shoulder  this held up well with no leaking in   days of straight southern florida rain storms  tent was also very easy to set up with rain fly  took about    minutes without looking at directions and no tent building experience      
2669,5.0,                       great little tent  east to set up  love the color   coleman is so reliable i used this for family camping in yellowstone   no issues with it   the weather was chilly but pleasant  our campsite had pretty even grounds i haven t tested it in any extreme rain  snow  or wind      
2670,2.0,                       had no rain cover  rain would have just pored in      
2671,3.0,                       has a   inch rip bottom of doorway on a seam looks like it came from the factory that way      
2672,5.0,                       needed a small tent to take on motorcycle rides for     dayers  works good  won t fit into my saddlebags  so i have to strap it down  but easy to set up and take down      
2673,4.0,                       great my son loves it looks promising great size for   persons with a kid or two    not for cold nightsthe fact it has windows can be problematic if there s cold wind      
2674,5.0,                       love it can t wait to use it in the spring when we go camping  love it      
2675,5.0,                       easy to set up and a great tent for simple outdoor needs  definitely recommend coleman just needs to put a  how to set up  video on their website for the best experience      
2676,5.0,                       works like its supposed to     
2677,5.0,                       this was advertised as a three person tent but you can only fit two people inside comfortably  not much room for mattresses either      
2678,5.0,                       had it for a year now   no complaints     
2679,5.0,                       at this price  hard to be the value for a car camping family tent like this      
2680,4.0,                       i bought this so i could go camping by myself  i m familiar with one person tents  and they have enough room for you to sleep  but no room to bring gear inside  this is just the right size for that  it might fit two skinny children  but two adults would just fit if at all  comes with stakes and all the things you need to assemble the tent  can t wait to take it to the woods and try it out  i ll update my review then to comment on weather proof abilities  air flow  etc      
2681,4.0,                       writing this review after   years of use  the tent worked solidly for the   years i had it  the only problem i ve ever had is that i don t use a tart under it which has caused the plastic at the bottom to tear away and create holes  thus it s not as solid underneath anymore but it worked pretty well for the entire team i had it      
2682,5.0,                       first of all   i love the color  my sons and i used this tent once  and it served its purpose  when we woke up in the morning  we found out it had rained throughout the night  we didn t get wet  so coleman is doing something right  not a ton of room but when you buy a   person tent  it s for   people  not   people and a bunch of stuff  perfect for scouts events  we love it      
2683,5.0,                       i think this was a great tent for what i paid for it   it said it could be put up in    minutes  i wasn t so sure i believed that because i have never put a tent up  but i did get it up in about    minutes      
2684,5.0,                       very good     
2685,5.0,                       we use it for day outing  good purchase for light camping under good weather  i wouldn t use it under rain or snow  can t beat the price      
2686,5.0,                       this tent is incredibly portable and well made  myself and my husband       and       bought the   person so it would also fit a couple bags or our dogs  definitely did not disappoint also bought this as a daily deal through amazon for a quarter of the price      
2687,5.0,                       easy set up by myself it took me    mins to have the tent up and staked  held up great through   rain storms and winds blowing  up to    mph not one drop of rain entered and i haven t yet sealed the seams      
2688,5.0,                       great budget tent  i got the   person and its very comfy  very easy to set up and store back  looked like quality material and was sturdy  recommended      
2689,5.0,                       great tent  confortable and super easy to put together and take apart  used for   adults and a   year old      
2690,1.0,                       sure does     
2691,4.0,                       nice tent for the price  however  one of our tent poles came defected   the inner elastic wasn t connected through the whole pole   it worked for setting up but takedown was a chore   not the best for cold weather camping  but i look forward to warmer weekend for testing      
2692,5.0,                       love this tent  was very proud of my purchase      
2693,5.0,                       i bought this tent for my son s  th birthday as he has expressed serious interest in camping  i wanted to get something a few steps up from the little kid tents  but i didn t want to spend a ton of money  this seems to fit perfectly  after a little backyard camping with this tent i m very confident that it will easily handle some slightly more serious camping  it has kept us dry and handled some pretty serious winds like a champ  i m about average height         and i can lay comfortably as well as sit up  i ve only camped with my son  but i can say that   adults should fit comfortably and you could probably fit a  rd person in a pinch  though it would be tight  setting the tent up was very easy  my son and i had it up in about    minutes the first time and now we can get it set up in about    bottom line on this tent is that i would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a reasonably priced tent for light camping      
2694,5.0,                       i gave coleman another chance to see if they regain excellent products   and  yes they did with flying colors   excellent tent providing excellent ventilation  rain guard for we got caught in a major storm and stayed dry with no signs of moisture in the tent  an excellent tent for those who still believe in good camping at a good price  sets up in minutes   room to spare in tent carrying bag for upgraded stakes  mallet  and small dust brush and pan along with foam soap to keep things organize   would highly recommend for i am not just a week end camper      
2695,5.0,                       up and down in    mins     
2696,5.0,                       gave this to my brother as a graduation gift and he loved it  says it is the perfect size for two people      
2697,5.0,                       this tent was so easy for me to set up  i d never set a tent up before and it took me no time at all  it was plenty roomy for my daughter and i to put a queen size blow up mattress and our bags in  we had a bit of room to spare      
2698,5.0,                       exceeded my expectations   easy   great quality   looks awesome      
2699,5.0,                       i was trying to decide between the   person and the   person tent  glad i went with the   person  a lot more room than i was expecting  easy to put up and take down  great price as well      
2700,5.0,                       loved the tent  queen size mattress will fit with just a small space for your bag   mine was a double high queen size  i really think   single layer twins or single layer full queen would work better   you have to blow the queen mattress up from the inside because you will never fit it in the door after it is blown up      
2701,5.0,                       easy to set up  inexpensive tent   kids love it      
2702,5.0,                       will fit   grown people comfy      
2703,3.0,                       returned     
2704,4.0,                       the tent was simple and quick to set up  there s tons of room in the tent as it was just myself  would definitely fit   people  the fabric and zippers are a little cheap and the door zipper catches a lot  there was no rain so i can t comment on that ability  however  i was bug free and warm in the   ish degree woods      
2705,5.0,                       i love this tent  it is a perfect size and i love how compact it is  i can easily fit it in my motorcycle saddlebag for camping trips  i did end up spraying a waterproof spray on it just to really enforce the waterproofing but i feel as if i didn t have to      
2706,4.0,                       works great     
2707,5.0,                       fits a queen air mattress   https   amzn to  rnspzv   with tons of room leftover       
2708,5.0,                       i purchased my coleman   person tent last year and is helping me survive the winter here in michigan  even with heavy daily use it continues to work very well  the zipper is still very smooth  there are no holes or rips  the seams remain strong and intact  i see no problems with this tent whatsoever      
2709,5.0,                       easy and perfect     
2710,5.0,                       this is a great little tent that i have used a few times now  i got rained on hard one night in this tent and a little bit of water got into the corner  but overall stayed very dry  when packing up the tent  the case expands beyond its original dimensions so you can avoid the age old issue of nothing fitting back in the package after you recieve it      
2711,5.0,                       stood up to first heavy downpour like a champ   no water inside   love the view when waking up in the morning out the screened top      
2712,5.0,                       i m pretty tall and very picky about being comfortable at camp so a   person tent doesn t do it for me  i m not the best at folding up tents either so the expandable bag was a lifesaver     
2713,5.0,                       i had a nice weekend with this tent  the first one for me that i could stand up in   i m       setup was easy enough   ventilation seems better than most tents i ve had   there was no rain  so i can t yet comment on how it handles that   i tent only twice a year  so i ll have to follow up on this if it rains in october  my next outing      
2714,5.0,                       great tent    person tent wouldn t comfortably fit   people  in my opinion  but it s plenty big for the three of us  easy to assemble  nice tent      
2715,5.0,                       it s ok     
2716,4.0,                       went up easy      
2717,2.0,                       this tent is good  if it isn t raining  i brought it up to northern minnesota for a camping trip  my friend and i decided to sleep in this tent  we set it up  which was surprisingly easy  then we went to sleep  that night there was a thunderstorm  we had the rain fly on all night  i woke up at about   a m  and around the inside of our tent was an inch of water  i had to use my extra clothes to wipe up all the water  another time i went camping  i went to bed in this tent  and all night it was a clear sky  no rain  there was a lot of dew  i looked around the inside of the tent  and there was a decent amount of water in it  i ran my finger along the inside side of the tent  and my finger got soaked  we also had the rain fly on that night pros  easy set uplooks greatlots of roomcompactgood ventilationcons  swimming poolwet all the timehard to dry outleaks at the seams     
2718,5.0,                       great purchase  can fit full size air mattress with room left over  recommend purchasing better stakes      
2719,5.0,                       i would highly recommend this tent  it was a great size for two people and their belongings  it was a super easy set up  and take down  only took about    minutes  it was very windy and rainy a few of the nights we used this tent  but it kept us warm and dry  even in   mph wind speeds      
2720,4.0,                       comes with plenty of useful features  battles the wind  protects from the sun  has enough air flow slits to keep from getting musty   large enough for me     male  and girlfriend update             years later and still using this tent  i only camp about    x times a year  so for casual user  as long as you are careful packing and unpacking  don t rip it   it should last      
2721,4.0,                       nice tent but a little small  a queen size air mattress fills the whole inside of the tent  better size for one person rather than   people      
2722,5.0,                       i love this tent   it held up really well while camping on the beach for   days  and we got quite a bit of wind   it is light and airy  and it was pretty easy to set up  even in the wind   it also rained a little  and the tent kept everything totally dry  love it      
2723,5.0,                       loved it   setup was easy and i had no bugs sleeping with me      
2724,5.0,                       easy to set up  easy to take down   for regular people it s a two man tent   bear that in mind if you re going larger      
2725,4.0,                       for the money  this tent is pretty good  one of the clips for the rain fly was broken  but not worth sending back  i just staked it into the ground   just used it for a week of camping where it rained every single night  remained dry except one night a few drops were on the floor when the rain was especially hard for a few hours   setup was quick and easy   the parts  poles  mainly  don t seem that durable  but no big deal  if this one wears out  i ll buy another    certainly cheap enough and should last me awhile as i don t use a tent that often      
2726,4.0,                       i surprised my husband with this tent the day we went camping  so he didn t even get a chance to practice setting it up   but he didn t need it  set up is very easy  this tent has plenty of room   we put a single and a queen air bed in it and still had room  the only downside of this tent is that the top cover isn t attached  so a little more light is let in  we are sitll happy with this purchase      
2727,5.0,                       for the price you cannot go wrong with this beginners tent  the setup is super easy with only three poles  including the one for the rain fly   the bathtub bottom for the floor works nice  says it will fit a queen size air mattress and it will  but you will not have any room left over fyi  this also makes it inconvenient to pump up the mattress inside the tent because the door is too small to fit the air mattress after it has been inflated  the huge windows let you look out the tent at night  two pockets is better than one  only gripe is that the rainfly is a bit shallow and wind can still get up under it and move the tent      
2728,5.0,                       amazing  it was easy to set up the only problem is to fold it back again it says for   people but tbh is fine for           
2729,5.0,                       initially got it for kids to sleep in a separate tent   ended up used for a backyard camping on the deck which works very well without anchor   then used for multiple times during my son s weekly soccer game in the field   everyone loves it   fast setup and take down   strong enough through a rain storm and more than    miles wind during a soccer game      
2730,5.0,                       we took this for our first cub scout camp this weekend and was very happy with the performance   it was a very easy set up  and stayed completely dry even after hard rain all through the night friday   a cold front came through the second night with some very strong winds and    degree temps  but no issues at all with the tent   i d absolutely recommend      
2731,4.0,                       biggest caveat  we ve only used it a couple of times  it remains to see how well it stays perfect but right now it s great  it took me and my eight year old cub only a    minutes to set up the first time we used it at camp  it looks great  especially in a wooden environment  for two of us it was a perfect size  three would be possible  i doubt four adults would fit well but four kids could      
2732,5.0,                       campers     
2733,3.0,                       we bought this on a friday and camped in it on saturday  very easy to setup  great ventilation  looks nice too one negative was that we did not receive the correct number of guy lines for the rain fly  otherwise everything was great      
2734,5.0,                       all of my tents have been coleman and last a long time  with this i used a queen air mattress and it basically had room for that and our bags  it s great  we slept   in this  if you don t have an air mattress you can fit more comfortably  very easy set up      
2735,4.0,                       i bought two of these tents at the same time  they were delivered quickly and easy to set up in a campground in me  i fit a queen air mattress with about a      walkway  on two sides  it did rain  and we stayed dry  it s a bit difficult to dress when you can t stand upright  but who needs clothes   you pretty much live in a swimsuit can t wait for warm weather to use these bright green tents again      
2736,5.0,                       i m an infrequent camper so i wanted something compact and easy to assemble  this comes with a great storage bag and is easy to assemble  this may make me camp even more      
2737,5.0,                       haven t you it yet  just set it up in the yard  i put it up by myself so it pretty easy  i don t know about the weatherproof or water resistance yet  but it looks good and i can spray it if it has small leaks     
2738,5.0,                       this tent was used for a weekend away at a motorcycle rally that my husband went to   of course hotel rooms were booked as he decided to go last minute so he got a tent site at a nearby campground   the tent is compact enough in it s case carry bag to be able to fit on top of the side bag of his harley   it was easily removed from it s carry bag  easy to put up and definitely roomy enough for two   the bathtub like bottom helped to keep the moisture away from his sleeping bag and other personal items   with the vents on the tent it was a little chilly  it actually went down to    degrees at night in texas  so this needs to be kept in mind when deciding what you are using it for and where   it was easy to take down and put it back into it s carry case   overall a great tent for the price and good quality      
2739,5.0,                       took this on a camping trip in  st week in october to maine   set up is very easy  weather was in mid to high    s atnight and i was warm   poured rain for   days straight  heavily and had some leaks on   corners where rings for stakes are attached totent  with the amount of rain and how heavy it came down  the amount of water in tent was very minimal  maybe a shot glass amount in   corners and   shot glass in the other and i am very happy with it       
2740,3.0,                       time will tell     
2741,5.0,                       i have used this tent   times sense i purchased it  i find that it was water proof beyond my dreams  and light to pack away  i can erect it in under    minutes too     
2742,5.0,                       well ventilated when open  plenty of room inside  haven t used the rain fly yet but i like the design      
2743,5.0,                       purchased for   little grand boys  was set up in their yard  not anchored down  when a strong wind came up and later they found the tent         mi away    thru two pastures  over at least   fences  unscathed    now that s a tough tent       
2744,5.0,                       we are absolutely satisfied with this tent  we ve tried a few and they would always leak with a storm  this one was bone dry after back to back several hour storms  we had several days of them and this tent passed the test      
2745,5.0,                       omg  i loved the size  design and all  easy put together  great bargain  waterproof and vent well      
2746,4.0,                       i liked the tent and it did the job  unfortunately the description states it would hold   queen size mattresses but it definitely did not  i tried every which way to make my mattresses fit and it just didn t happen      
2747,4.0,                       i used it for me and my daughter and kept   duffle bags in the tent and still have extra space  very warm and roomy      
2748,4.0,                       its good quality but there bad if it rains  i noticed it started leaking during one of my trips during the rare times it rains in arizona  monsoon season   it leaked a bit but apart from that it never rains so apart form that the build quality is superb     
2749,5.0,                    la costura no es de buena calidad        
2750,1.0,                       bought this tent first time we put up there is a hole in seam between the zipper and tent      
2751,2.0,                       i just came back from camping  first time i used the tent  the poles ard of inferior quality  two of the end parts broke  i have to use a duct tape to keep the tent from collapsing  i m not sure if i can use it again because the pole will give me problems  i advise people to buy a better one      
2752,5.0,                       the tent worked out great for camping  assembly is possible with   person and definitely a breeze with   people  all the zippers work perfectly  there is a pocket on both sides on the inside to put a flashlight or whatever you need to find quick in the middle of the night  there is also a spot to hang a lantern in the middle  overall it packs down nice  it s sturdy  and does the job     
2753,5.0,                       so glad i bought this    fits a high queen air mattress      german sheppard   adults and gear with room to spare    good ventilation for summer camping very easy set up     
2754,4.0,                    muy bueno el producto de buena calidad        
2755,5.0,                       we slept in this tent with our   chihuahuas  we were all warm and cozy    it says a    minute set up  took us   at best  recommended to all friends      
2756,5.0,                       took it camping beach side and was very windy  inside was nice a cozy and huge  fit   adults and two children with room to stretch out      
2757,5.0,                       great for kids and adults  fits a full sized air mattress easily  easy up  easy down  works very very well     
2758,5.0,                       this was perfect for a   person overnight texas camping trip in fall   we left the rain cover off for half the night and got to see the stars  then when we put it on we were cozy  it was very easy to put up take down and store  very pleased with our purchase      
2759,4.0,                       not amazing but not bad  typical coleman quality  arrived as described  and of course  they make the carrying case so small that you need to refold the tent as it was at the manufacturer  which you can never do and therefore either rip the zipper when trying to cram it in the case or don t bother zipping it up at all      
2760,5.0,                       great little tent for kids and great price     
2761,4.0,                       we did a practice assembly in our living room  which was a good idea since we ended up at the campsite late at night and putting it together by the light of the car s headlights  no problem   i put the rainfly on upside down   it did sprinkle the next morning  but we didn t find that we had any tent side seepage the tent was roomy enough for my       husband  my   year old  our miniature poodle  a bunch of stuff  and me  this is great tent  i think  for most families going car camping  the only issue we had was with the door and door step area  our friends camping with us had a smaller sundome and had the same issue here   it isn t taut enough to be easily zipped and unzipped for fetching things and the step over area of the tent is a bit high for toddlers that keep going in and out  we had a lot of bruised knees from the little goofballs falling out of the tent onto the site s gravel pad while playing  not a deal breaker on the tent  just something to be aware of if you have little scoundrels using the tent like a playhouse during your trip we did purchase the coleman tent kit with the mallet  extra stakes  and such  i think that was a good investment as well  the stakes in the tent kit were better for holding down the tethers on the rainfly      
2762,5.0,                       i bought this tent  after researching and reading many reviews on other tents  even tho i was apprehensive about it this tent was very easy to set up and didn t take very long   there were   of us   adults and a tall teen   we took a blow up mattress  that i thought was a queen ended up being a full   the mattress fit    adults on it  and the teen slept in the sleeping bag on the floor and there was still plenty of room in the tent for the duffle bags   extra sleeping bags  it could have easily fit   average size adults  as well as fitting an actual queen blow up mattress   duffle bags i would recommed this tent for sleeping up to   average size adults it also rained the first   days  down pour at night   no one got wet and no water came in the outer dome shield comes off to let air come in   circulate or you can just tie it up to let the air in there are also   hanging pockets inside the tent  this came in handy for small flashlights  wallets   the such      
2763,5.0,                       fits a queen end to end but you have to blow it up inside the tent  i use a twin because this is  for me  a solo tent  a twin gives room to put your bags down and shoes  etc  i love this little avocado tent      
2764,5.0,                       we fit   small children   myself  and my    year old daughter in this comfortably  so far they love it  it is so easy to put up and take back down and out away  that s a big bonus in my book      
2765,5.0,                       awesome tent  look no further  right out of the box  our first camping trip found us in a   day downpour  not a drop inside the tent  easy setup and teardown  sturdy and lightweight materials  perfect      
2766,5.0,                       perfect amount of space for me and another with gear camped during a storm recently   very strong winds and moderate rain     no leaks at all  the tent itself held up very well through very strong winds but i will be buying better stakes  they were ripped out of the ground     times that night  which was no fun very easy to set up  also  there wasn t a weird smell like another reviewer mentioned     
2767,3.0,                       i purchased this tent as a shelter for my   small dogs  i am able to fit   dog houses and their water and food dispensers with ample room left over  what i don t like about the tent is that the outer covering is ripping and tearing      
2768,5.0,                       i haven t used a tent in over thirty years  but this tent was very easy to set up   my two boys and i went on a cub scout camping trip in north texas  and the tent was perfect  we experienced a thunderstorm for a little over an hour with heavy downpours and high wind gusts but the tent stayed dry and in place  i couldn t be more pleased  thank you      
2769,5.0,                       little small but the price is very reasonable  the quality is awesome  overall i m really impressed      
2770,1.0,                       i would give this   stars if possible  doesn t even keep mosquitos out  worst night camping i ve ever had covered head to toe in bites and mosquitos everywhere inside all night long     
2771,5.0,                       i used the tent in a recent camping trip  there was a heavy downpour during the trip and due to me not placing the tent in a good spot the bottom of the tent ended up in the middle of a ditch with a couple of inches of water  but to my delight not a drop of water found its way to the tent  it also seems reasonably sturdy and of good quality for the price  it looks good too  i highly recommend it for a casual camper      
2772,3.0,                       bought in a rush for a hunting trip  only fits   people if you re shoulder to shoulder in sleeping bags  barely fit   cots for   guys  otherwise kept rain out  did what it was supposed to do  only downfall is fits   comfortably      
2773,5.0,                       great product     
2774,5.0,                             
2775,5.0,                       great for car camping  used in heavy rain and it did great  not a drop inside  sleeps two  not much room for other things  easy set up  nice tent      
2776,5.0,                       easy to assemble and disassemble  we were actually able to get it to fit back into its original package  the package is expandable which is nice      
2777,1.0,                       the ridge pole that holds up the awning broke on the first use   calling support was a joke   got someone that had clearly never been in a tent before and wasn t familiar with their products   then i got a run around on a replacement part   shouldn t be this hard        
2778,5.0,                       bigger then expected  easy to set up and take down  great for a family of   with   kids but definitely not   adults  we bought on prime day and got an amazing deal       
2779,5.0,                       this tent allowed us to set up a twin sized air mattress with plenty of room for our other gear  i liked how tall the tent was  this tent was very easy to set up and it held up during rain and snow on palomar mountain in december  it was also very quick and easy to disassemble  we are very impressed with this tent      
2780,4.0,                       setup was straightforward  good space  had winds    mph second day and moderate rain the next day  handled both with no leaks or breakage      
2781,5.0,                       loved this tent   i was able to put it together by myself   kept all the bugs and rain out   used it for only one night so far but it was definitely raining and not a drop of water made it inside the tent      
2782,4.0,                       it was easy to set up and pretty nice  only complaint is it s a bit smaller than i was thinking and the zipper kept getting caught in the door guard everytime we zipped and unzipped the door     
2783,5.0,                       went camping last weekend   this tent worked very well  it may be a little tight for   people but it was perfect for   adults   a child  easy to set up   take down      
2784,5.0,                       as advertised  got a great price through amazon   person  this is a huge tent  nice dome to help with rigidity and for wind  tall enough for me to stand easily   i m        we didn t experience any rain yet so i haven t tested any of the rain features i agree that this is ideally a summer time tent  without the rain fly there isn t any privacy on the sides perfect tent for family of   occasional campers      
2785,5.0,                       easy to set up and plenty of room great tent so far ill update when i go camping soon and not in my back yard  lol

2787,5.0,                       this tent is a good little   season tent for the money i have gone through several tents over the last couple of years and this is my  nd sundome my  st having been lost to a mini tornado in oklahoma last year  no fault of the tent i just came back from a car trip through southern az  up into northern nevada then into southern oregon near crater lake      in cottonwood az  snowing at crater lake tent preformed fine      
2788,1.0,                       bag for tent was ripped for the second time  what a joke  walmart is better than amazon      
2789,5.0,                       arrived quickly  haven t tested it for waterproofing yet but when i used it  it was easy to setup  easy to tear down  like the color and overall an easy and great buy      
2790,5.0,                       perfect summer tent  when erected properly  there is fantastic airflow because of the clever vent near the bottom  the floor is made of plastic and forms a basin a few inches up the sides to keep the rain from seeping in  tent is lightweight and very simple to erect  the zippered pouch is expandable   because they know we ll never fit it back in like they do at the factory it even includes a door  mat  the   fly provides ample shade without impeding airflow  suitable to use from late spring thru early fall in vermont      
2791,5.0,                       good size tent easy set up

2793,5.0,                       loved it  my friends were so obsessed with this new one  and i am really satisfied with material and easy to set up tent is best      
2794,1.0,                       not waterproof  water got in in light rain      
2795,5.0,                       great tent and great price      
2796,3.0,                       good quality and easy setups  but only sleeps     people when you consider luggage  comfortably only fits   person wth a cot  but i like that the ceiling is high      
2797,5.0,                       nice tent  plenty of room  easy set up      
2798,3.0,                       tent was nice but you get what you pay for  during the initial setup one of the plastic clips on the tent broke in half  luckily  or unfortunately  another person in our boyscout troop had the same thing happen on his colman tent so he had extra  rd party clips with him      
2799,5.0,                       better than i expected     
2800,5.0,                       this tent is exactly what i was looking for  not too big and easy to setup  item came on time and was packaged carefully  i am six foot and this tent has plenty of room for me and my wife  i saved money buying it here verse the local big box stores  great buy     
2801,5.0,                       perfect starter tent for warmer weather camping or back packing  its very easy to set up  and though you start to get a little nervous when you bend the poles to set up the tent and hear a little cracking  there is no breakage  after about   uses now  doesn t make any sound and is very flexible  i got a   person size for my wife and i  and we have a good foot on each side of us for our packs  and comfortable head room  its airy and spacey  and keeps cool  its surprisingly light for a   person  and when my wife and i backpack sharing the load is easy and hardly noticeable  but even a two person or one person i wouldn t recommend backpacking with for one person  great starter for anyone wanting to get into camping  i recommend getting some seam sealer for the bottom of the tent as i saw some reviews it isn t super water proof  i ve done this ahead of time and haven t been rained on yet  but recommend doing the same      
2802,5.0,                       perfect size for wildland fire camps this year  ca  id  nm   no issues and the price is easy on the wallet      
2803,5.0,                       the first time i used this tent it rained for    hours  with just a tarp under it and what comes in the bag we were dry the entire time  excellent pop up     
2804,5.0,                       good quality tent  set it up by myself to test  it s much easier with two people putting it up  and everything seems to be well made  haven t tested the product in the rain but if i have an issues i ll write an update  otherwise assume it stayed watertight      
2805,4.0,                       i like it for being a tent      
2806,5.0,                       can t tell on water proof   did not rain   it was fine with morning dew so should work fine      
2807,5.0,                       just what i wanted it to be  all parts were intact and went together easily  my children and i have used it many time and we have been able to put it back in its travel storage bag each it  which is a huge plus       
2808,5.0,                       excellent tent  easy to set up and break down      
2809,5.0,                       got caught in a storm and it downpoured all night into the next morning with strong winds and it held up no problem and we stayed dry i ve had it for   years now and still looks brand new even with how much i ve used it      
2810,5.0,                       good quality      
2811,5.0,                       solid construction  relatively easy set up for   person  much lighter than i thought it would be  plus it has an outdoor mat for shoes for those who complain about its effectiveness in a heavy rain storm  it s a better bargain to get this tent and then buy a tarp from a hardware store i cannot wait to use this tent this weekend      
2812,4.0,                       i like it

2814,4.0,                       i used it two weeks in florida and had no problems  it performed great  it has good water tight seams  a friend s tent next to mine got water  i returned a second tent i purchased at a local sports store  aka demy  and purchased a second tent like this one  i gave it only four stars because i want to believe that there is another tent of its class that it is better but if there is not then i really do not like the color      
2815,5.0,                       cannot stress enough how great this product is  perfect size and weight  we ordered a   person tent for the two of us and the doggy  more than enough space for all three of us and our bags  ventilation airflow is great as long as you use the lower     
2816,5.0,                       this tent is a great value for its size      
2817,5.0,                       a little hard to fold back up if you aren t concentrating  but a perfect little tent that kept us completely dry in heavy rain  it is fairly well insulated and made things feel at least    degrees warmer than outside when i was camping in    degree weather  we slept with   people in this   person tent  but could ve easily fit a fourth person      
2818,5.0,                       love

2820,5.0,                       super easy to set up and take down  it will keep you dry  it blocks wind well  this tent will not keep you warm as it is not designed to do so      
2821,5.0,                       we have used this tent for   camping trips so far and it has held up to strong winds and heavy rain  i am a novice camper and not a handy lady but my   year old daughter and i set this up alone without difficulty      
2822,5.0,                       easy to set up  plenty of room for two cots  one foldout chair and all our gear  former scout master and i was impressed with product

2824,5.0,                       bought this tint for my first ever camping trip last month and couldn t be more pleased about my purchase now just waiting for my   person to get here so i can test that bad boy out  reason i bought another tint is although this tint was great just needed something bigger for me and my kiddos so next time i go camping i can have this as a spare in case anyone wants to join us  great tint   stars       
2825,5.0,                       great tent  easy to set up and tear down  had a thunderstorm the  nd night and night leaks

2827,5.0,                       super easy to set up  i m a     woman and set it up on my own  though it s easier with two people  compact and held up to some vicious winds in the mountains of colorado      
2828,3.0,                       ok quality     
2829,5.0,                         women and first time camping  ever    this tent did hold   people  two adults and a child   super easy to put up   put up in    mins   has to pockets  in side to put keys  or phones  up   super tight tent  no bugs  got in  at all  are they are any kind of draft   the  nd nite  we camped out  a super storm came  i mean it was a storm    we was scared    but this tent  did great   it did fall in    and no water at all  came in this tent    all night  i would say this    i m buying me a bigger one   coleman s sundome   person tent   it s well worth the money        
2830,5.0,                       easy too set up     
2831,3.0,                       worked better than i expected  set up was easy  size was just right for one person and gear  it rained hard several times a day all three days i used it and it stayed dry inside  its worth the money for short trips to the lake with the kids  definitely not for an epic backcountry trip or the impending zombie apocalypse     
2832,5.0,                       easy to assemble and good price       
2833,5.0,                       this is a basic tent at a basic price and it s done it s job well for the price vs quality so five stars it s a little small if you want to also keep some of your stuff in the tent and sleep for two  but still overall manageable and waterproof      
2834,4.0,                       this is a good size tent plenty of room for   people  tall enough to stand in the middle  easy to put together  need a hammer to put the stakes down  take down is relatively easy      
2835,4.0,                       first night using it there was a thunderstorm and we remained safe and dry  it fits a queen air mattress  but it s snug  head to toe fits exactly  and left to right you have about a foot of clearance  small and simple  perfect for    normal sized people      
2836,5.0,                       this is a great little car camping tent   it looks great  has a great design  and is extremely easy to pitch      
2837,5.0,                       perfect     
2838,5.0,                       this tent is great for a couple  it fits a queen air mattress with room to spare but i will get a double air mattress in the future just so we have more room to change clothes  also  it doesn t hold heat in very well  but we also had a very shady campsite when it got below    degrees   so being closer together is probably better  we used it on a road trip and continuously had to set up and take down our tent  everything held up really well  the steaks that come with the tent are metal and easy to put in the ground without a hammer   we never had to use any back up steaks  it rained a lot in maine and we were always nice and dry inside the tent  there is a place in the top of the tent to hang something  in our case  an led light  in massachusetts  it got really hot outside and inside the tent  but the tent is open enough to let in a nice breeze  this is a great tent to start out with or go on a road trip with  when it is collapsed  the tent is very small and light  basically  this tent is a good fit for short term and just two people      
2839,5.0,                       easy to set up  my husband did it alone in a short amount of time  we fit myself and my husband and our two toddlers in here       
2840,5.0,                       i have even put up my self     
2841,2.0,                       i would give it   stars but the pole for the top piece came apart the first time we used it  was feeding it back through to take the tent down and broke   the tent is great for two people with single air mattresses  easy up     
2842,5.0,                       roomy      
2843,5.0,                       worked like a charm  rain was bad the first night i used it  and i did not have a single leak  also the heat was contained very well within the tent  we only had   people in the tent  and   would have been snug  but still enough from for   full sized adults one thing i wish tents came with was an appropriate sized tarp to put underneath of it      
2844,5.0,                       easy peazy setup  just finished up a road trip to glacier np  perfect for two with one on a glamping air mattress      
2845,4.0,                       tent was easy to set up and looks to be very durable  only knock is that two queen inflatables were a very tight it  our fellow campers used one queen and one full and that was perfect      
2846,5.0,                       this   person tent fully met our expectations  i had no difficulty in setting up the tent  although i had never done it before  it took me around    to    minutes to get this setup completely with no help  the space comfortably fits   people and their stuff  the removal and repackaging was easy too and i was able to get it back into the original box  overall good product  very happy with the purchase      
2847,5.0,                       super easy to setup and very roomy      
2848,4.0,                       works like a charm  easy to put up and easy to take down     
2849,4.0,                       is a great quality tent  and i love that the bag is large enough to fit the tent back in after use  not to heavy  this fits in my tall hiking backpack with a compact pot pan and wood stove burner with enough space for clothes  and other misc items      
2850,1.0,                       this tent is most definitely not water proof or resistance   also it says tent for two i have to say that was tight       
2851,5.0,                       used this tent multiple times and even in the rain a couple times  no leaks and stayed dry and warm the whole time  it is very easy to setup and take down  it is kind of tight for   people but perfect for        
2852,5.0,                       solid tent  fits a twin air mattress      
2853,5.0,                       i must admit that i am a newbie camper  so  i was looking to buy a tent that is not expensive as well as easy to set up  this   person tent from coleman perfectly suits my needs  i am writing this review after two  nights of camping in this tent  the product arrived on time  in perfect condition  no damages or missing parts  i did try setting up the tent in my living room first before camping so that i ll get accustomed to the set up instructions  this did help a lot since the instructions given with the tent were not      clear during the first try  the instructions on where exactly to insert the poles a and b can be made more clear  that is why i ve included pictures of the tent   with and without the rain fly attached  you may get an idea from there  with regards to space  this tent can fit a   person sleeping bag  queen bed size   i and my spouse could comfortably sleep here along with   backpacks and a camera bag   tripod  also  the tent has two pouches that can fit phones  wallets and other small things  it is well ventilated too  we camped near the yosemite valley and the temperature did drop a lot during the night  nearly as low as         degrees fahrenheit   the tent along with our sleeping bags were good enough to protect us from the cold  the rain fly looks sturdy enough to endure light rains even though i didn t use this tent during rain or snow yet  will update my review once i do  as from what i ve seen  this tent is perfect for camping in california during summer  it took us hardly   minutes to set up this tent and maybe    minutes to take it down  it came in a pretty compact bag and proper folding ensures that the tent would fit back into the same bag  very compact and easy to set up  take down as well as to store  go for this tent and enjoy camping  ps  i should probably mention that almost     of the tents that we saw in the campgrounds near ours were from coleman too  this definitely is a great brand       
2854,5.0,                       my    year old and her    year old friend put this together with no adult help  perfect  have only been using it one summer so far  can t speak to long term durability      
2855,4.0,                       third one of these i have bought  i take a lot of people camping in the mountains  i will say this  i am not sure how they configure the tent to accommodate   people    is comfortable    if they are smaller individuals  just a thought      
2856,3.0,                       it s a nice tent but if your going some where cold i d pick a different one  my queen air mattress could barely fit in it      
2857,5.0,                       great tent for what we need     or   people  occasional cub scout campout or backyard campout   coleman has been a big name in camping supplies for many years for a reason   fair pricing  good quality    note   yes  it is for   people but we don t like to be like sardines   this fits   adults and a   year old comfortably without being ridiculously oversized  either       
2858,5.0,                       great quality  good space for     i would not recommend for   people but perfect for my gf and i   both of us are   feet tall and about     lbs had room for our queen air mattress and about an extra     feet for bags and clothes   my brother and his giirl bought the same   person and agreed they could have used a little more room   i think the   person was only like     more      
2859,5.0,                       it s a cheap    person tent  good for car camping  way too big heavy to backpack with so don t even try it  seems pretty durable      
2860,5.0,                       large enough for a queen mattress with some extra room  and very easy to take down   put up  highly recommended      
2861,5.0,                       excellent tent   i love the bigger size of this tent without the added trouble of extra poles and whatnot   assembly is super easy and can be done by one person   its just two poles and its up   i owned an older identical tent to the one  but i finally decided it was time for a new one and i had to buy the same one      
2862,1.0,                       everyone is saying it doesn t leak but the first time i used it was during the rain and it leaked substantially in three of the four corners  i didn t get a chance to check the tent before the return window was up  so now it s a hassle to do much about it      
2863,5.0,                       easy set up  decent quality     
2864,5.0,                       bought this to replace one that i have had for over    years   used and abused by my sons   a great product to replace my old one   i highly recommend this tent      
2865,5.0,                       great tent     
2866,5.0,                       bought this tent for a couple of homeless men that attend our church  they are very happy with the quality that stand up to florida rainstorms      
2867,4.0,                       it s more like a fits   comfortably  which we expected when we purchased it  we got it as a gift for my son      when he crossed over to boy scouts  unfortunatly my son s cot doesn t fit in it which was a bummer  but it is easy for him to set up and take down by himself      
2868,5.0,                       well built  easy setup   we used to use the sundome four person and wore it out  but this one is just like it only bigger  big enough to stand up in      
2869,5.0,                       easy to put up and cozy inside  it fits two twin size air bed or a queen size air bed  don t use the stake that comes with it  it bends easily  you can easily buy one from home depot or harbor freight  they have sturdier stakes with nail heads       
2870,5.0,                       i love this tent  it s been great  it can fit   coleman cots side by side if you don t want room to move    if you do  it s durable and roomy      
2871,5.0,                       greatvalue for what it is      
2872,5.0,                       easy installation  good quality       recommended     
2873,4.0,                       not the best one but im satisfied     
2874,5.0,                       as advertised  would be helpful if the stakes are a little sturdy  had a good experience during my backcountry camping      
2875,5.0,                       a fantastic product  coincidentally  my friend and i bought this same one for our first camping experience in the smokies and loved it  glad it was part of my adventure easy to carry can be assembled in less than    mins and easily too great material quality  kept us warm only suggestion i have for the manufacturer is to make the instructions much clearer  the illustrations are really confusing      
2876,5.0,                       awesome tent for the     good quality  easy to install  and most importantly  very sturdy   i feel very safe camping with this tent      
2877,4.0,                       held up in    mph winds      
2878,5.0,                       not a bad tent if you can find it on sale   fit a queen size king coil mattress with some room to spare      
2879,5.0,                       great tent for the price  you can always trust coleman brand  the zippers appear to be a good quality  we will see how long they last and how this tent holds up in the rain      
2880,3.0,                       we took this tent with us on a camping trip to michigan in early august  with probably way too much confidence  we decided not to open it  the tent set up fast   easy  but when we started to put up the rainfly  we realized that the pole to keep the rainfly out   away from the tent was missing  we manages to improvise with ropes  tall trees and bungee cords  when we returned from our trip i contacted amazon  they said i needed to contact coleman  as they don t handle things like missing poles  i then contacted coleman and the told me i needed to contact amazon  as it was their fault that the pole was missing  i argued a bit  then the guy agreed to send a new one out to me  he then tried to get me to pay for the pole  i told him i wouldn t  as it wasn t my fault that it was missing  he relented and sent me one  not the end however  he sent a replacement pole that needed to be threaded and assembled by us  by this time we were exasperated by the whole experience i suppose i could return the tent  but really don t want to deal with all the hassle  so  i have      tent and will just have to make due note we sprayed waterproofing and not a drop of rain came in during a hard thunderstorm  it was a bit cold one night   as the temps sunk to about    degrees not a horrible tent  but don t trust that everything is in the package      
2881,2.0,                       bought this tent for a six night trip we just had a week ago  on day   morning  when my    year old boy took the tent down  the string inside the rainfly ridge pole was broken  it wasn t windy or anything that could stress out the string  disappointed  bought it two months ago and missed amazon s return window      
2882,5.0,                       it withheld a tough storm on its first night of use  very impressed  roomy and easy to set up         
2883,5.0,                       great deal  large enough to sleep to   foot adults  if they are close friends  fits a full size air mattress perfectly  i really reccomend it for one   foot or smaller adult if they have gear with them  or two kids  nice thick bottom tarping  may not be the best for really cold environments      
2884,4.0,                       i bought this tent and used it once  great quality and easy set up  i would have rated this higher but my cot did not fit inside unless i set it diagonally  and that prevented it from being a two person tent  good thing i was alone  i guess  i will say that i liked the quality enough to buy a larger version that an accommodate my cot  i will use this for camping without cot  nice product      
2885,5.0,                       best for occasional camping  plenty of room for two people and their gear  difficult for one person set up   it s easier to set the bows with a helper      
2886,5.0,                       great little tent for the price  a bit small for my      frame  but i knew what dimensions it was before buying  this tent stayed totally dry during a huge rain hail storm      
2887,5.0,                       for the price  you won t find a better tent than this   i didn t seal the seams  yet my first use in a rain shower was dry with no issues   it is a little hard to get in and out of  especially when an air bed is placed inside   overall  great tent      
2888,5.0,                       held together way better then anticipated  definently wroth the money  i saw other tents both larger and smaller that were not holding up against the crazy wind we had over in estes  co  so glad this tent met all my expectations      
2889,5.0,                       this tent is amazing  i used it to go to all   of the great lakes this summer and it went through storms  rain  thunder and lighting  wind  etc  it didn t get us wet once  the pole of the top rain tarp did stick out a little in the back but it doesn t effect the functionality at all  we were able to fit   twin air mattresses comfortably with room to spare  when we didn t use air mattresses we were able to fit   people comfortably  so  although it says   it s about          
2890,4.0,                       perfect for two people  don t plan on putting much gear inside once you re both in   if you fiddle with it just right you can put a queen sized air mattress in it  but the fit is tight   good for car camping  i would not recommend for back packing unless you have a second person that is willing to split the load   one person carries tent  other carries stakes  poles and rainfly   easy to set up and take down      
2891,4.0,                       somehow i bought this without realizing you can t fully close the vents in the tent   don t make the same mistake      
2892,5.0,                       this tent worked wonderfully in down pouring rains  i did have a tarp under the rain  fly  but no leaks  in fact i pitched it in the dark by myself and four days later  when i started packing up i realized i had pitched the tent in a hide ant pile  but no bugs in my tent all weekend      
2893,5.0,                       i go camping roughly once a year or less  in july  in the sierra nevada mountains northwest of reno  it s always been nice weather  no rain  snow  or wind  gets a bit cold at night but it s tolerable  i bought this and used it in fair weather this year  it was fantastic for that level of use  it ended up that i set it up in direct morning sunlight  with the rain flap on  it suddenly became an oven by   am  but who sleeps in on camping trips anyway      
2894,5.0,                       all i can say it s good  no problems with it     
2895,5.0,                       i normally backpack so wanted a less expensive tent for car camping that i could thrash around and not worry about  this tent is nice and the price is great  the   person feels very large to me  i can stand up in the middle      
2896,5.0,                       used for   days of camping no problems   easy setup your typical dome tent etc      
2897,4.0,                       pros easy to set upthis is good for two people  for casual campers   will be pretty tight for   or   people good pricecons difficult to roll back does not feel sturdy buy this if you camp infrequently  if you are looking to camp often  then buy better quality ones that come at a premium     
2898,5.0,                       easy up and down and that s what counts the most for me      
2899,5.0,                       i set up the tent   weeks ago and waited  know storms would be coming through   the only moisture in the tent after these storms was from my shoes   even the winds left it unscathed      
2900,5.0,                       it worked as promised  i used it in the desert near joshua tree and took a picture when the milky way was out  it was easy to set up and pack up  although i wish they explained the rainfly and stakes better      
2901,1.0,                       i setup the tent one time to try it out before going on a week long camp  it was up for a   days  we had a bit of a wind storm  but it wasn t terrible  when i went to take down the tent  one of the clips had ripped off and a loop for the peg is already tearing   when we finally did use the tent  it was freezing  it keeps none of the cold out at all      
2902,5.0,                       held up very nicely in a storm  we coated ours in coleman waterproofing first and didn t expect inclement weather  as with all tents  it is a little generous to call it a   person tent  but it s a nice upgrade from our   person tent  comfortably accommodates   people  uncomfortably sleeps    no issues with zippers or breathability so far      
2903,5.0,                       awesome     
2904,4.0,                       this tent was as described and holds   person easily  it was very easy to set up and could be done in less than    minutes     
2905,5.0,                       we own a   person tent of the same model  kids are happy now to have their own        
2906,5.0,                       this tent really does stand up to high winds  i took my son out on a cub scout campout and the winds were wicked that whole day  we saw that another tents poles had shattered in the wind  this tent really handled the weather great      
2907,5.0,                       great tent  easy to set up in very little time  plenty of room for two and gear  would sleep parents and   small kids fine too  only thing i d change is the fly  would like to see it go a little further down the sides  i usually camp spring and fall so i usually see frost      
2908,4.0,                       for the price  you can not buy a better tent  durable and spacious  one of the poles did break when i was hunting do too extreme winds  but    that is probably my fault for not taking a tent more suited for the enviornment i was in  over all  i am satisfied with the purchase  the tent is a pain to place back in the storage bag  so i use a larger bag for the storage      
2909,5.0,                       at the time of purchase it only was     so do keep that in mind  for the price this tent is durable and can easily survive in rain  though the directions to set up are almost non existent thebtent pops right into place and even the most inexperienced of campers should be able to get this up in    minutes by themselves  most likely though in far less time      
2910,5.0,                       this is one great tent  i looked at dozens   this one had everything i wanted and more  i put   twin air mattresses in plus a little table between them  perfect fit  had it up for a week with   very rainy nights   bone dry  and everything fit back in the bag easily     stars      
2911,5.0,                       set it up to apply waterproofing  all parts present and accounted for  good stitching  no holes  not a high end tent  but well made  would be heavy for backpacking  i have another coleman tent  different model  and the quality seems to be consistent  it will serve its intended purpose well  i would recommend it      
2912,4.0,                       i wish it used pole hooks instead of pole sleeve at the very top  but that is not a big deal  buyer beware       person  means    people laying side by side and nothing else   so really  this is     person plus gear for size when this tent drops below fifty bucks  it is a great value      
2913,3.0,                       used this four person tent for  the first time this cool   rainy weekend   rained hard multiple times and no leaks   easy to put together and take apart   however  listed as a four person tent   i slept in it by myself on a cot and there was very little space remaining      
2914,5.0,                       this tent was more than i could ask for  definitely served its purpose  the only thing i would have changed about it was adding poles to the side of the rain fly so the tent could get airflow with the benefit of privacy      
2915,5.0,                       after you set it up once  you can do it quickly with one person     
2916,1.0,                       when we opened our  new tent  we were disappointed to see that it was used     there were several stains  a hole in the bottom and when we put it up the floor was covered with dirt  leaves and trash the tent is great and easily fit a queen sized air mattress      
2917,5.0,                       easy to set up  worked great      
2918,5.0,                       i like it     
2919,5.0,                       easy to assemble  stores nicely in the bag   while you can fit four people in it that would be snug  like in most   man tents   we use it when camping with   people and found it perfectly roomy      
2920,5.0,                       i was not expecting to be camping at night with   mph wind  this tent handled it like a champ  it was really easy to set up n take down too  worth the buy      
2921,4.0,                       the tent did well overall  perhaps the lack experience of one of the two parties setting up the tent took it a little longer than anticipated  but the flap over the tent is a bit of a pain to get established      
2922,5.0,                       seems well build and strong    st time was camping on the beach   kept the bugs at bay and it is definitely quality   i consider it inexpensive  that is ok  but don t buy a cheap tent   they are not worth it  find a good brand like coleman on sale and you won t be sorry   this one is top notch      
2923,5.0,                       quality construction and a good value     
2924,5.0,                       cool  nice item for picnic     
2925,5.0,                       this tent is perfect fits a standard queen air mattress and still has room  slept   just fine i think you d even be able to fit maybe   depending how big each person is  super roomy     
2926,5.0,                       the first night i got to use it we got some rain which was not expected at all and this tent handled it without issue or any pre prep  setup and take down were both easy and quick      
2927,4.0,                       this is a decent tent for the price  it is definitely made for warm weather camping though  we used it this fall and temps were closer to    degrees f and we froze when the wind would blow through  the walls are very thin and the vent at the bottom let a lot of cold air in  it will be great in the summer but we will need a different tent for any more fall camping      
2928,5.0,                       i ve only camped   nights in it so far in two different locations  but i am rather pleased with it  i frequently camp in the high desert  nm az co  in summer  which means cool nights  but warm temps as soon as the sun comes up  my last tent had really lousy ventilation which meant no sleeping in past sunrise  though i am only a car camper  i was planning to purchase a more expensive   person backpacking tent from one of the bigger names just to save on weight and bulk  and  maybe  get a quality upgrade   i ended up going with the sundome not because it is less expensive  but because all the tents i was looking at had rainflys that prohibited good ventilation  i was able to sleep in until     am in this as the ventilation is superb  unfortunately  i did not get to experience using it in any rain  so i can t comment on the waterproofing  some say the little zippered slot at the corner  to run a power cord through  leaks  so that s something i ll have to pay attention to if i expect rain  since the vast majority of my camping is done in the high desert with only brief showers i m not overly concerned  i do occasionally camp in colder  rainier climates and may buy another tent with a full length rainfly for that  better insulation and will likely keep water out of the tent better   nonetheless  i am quite happy with it for my purposes i had no trouble setting it up single handedly in a few minutes  and it feels well made  i do like that the floor tarp comes up the sides several inches  rather than meeting a seam right at the ground like my old tent  the zippers operate smoothly and i found it quite roomy for me  my dog  and a little gear  i had plenty of extra floor space to move around which was nice  since i don t like feeling cramped in a tent as an aside  it says  great for backpacking   on the label attached to the carry bag  i find that laughable  it is    lbs which isn t a  huge  extra weight burden over proper backpacking tents  but it is rather bulky  if your goal is to take a tent backpacking  i would absolutely not recommend this one      
2929,5.0,                       this rent is great  we took it camping with another couple friends and it fit us all comfortably with extra room  just to clarify that was   full grown adults  and their gear  it keeps you out of the elements really well  and is easy to setup      
2930,5.0,                       this tent is perfect  kudos to coleman  i am disabled and was easily able to set up the tent alone in    mins or less  the zippers are constructed to make it impossible for them to get stuck  even when the zipper catches the flap  it easily slides off  very highly recommended      
2931,3.0,                       the tent is easy to set up and works fine but only used it   times and where the poles go through on the top of the tent it is already got holes in it so don t expect it to last very long      
2932,4.0,                       super simple tent  if you re a casual camper  this tent is great  pops right up  so far i have only used it once  so if anything happens i ll update it  i also love how easy it was to break down  roll up  and fit perfectly back into its case  i would suggest sealing the seams      
2933,4.0,                       tent is great  much larger and taller than expected  four stars because the rope in the fly tent poles were cut so we have to get replacement poles for the fly      
2934,1.0,                       bought this a while ago  but never had the chance to use it   was super excited as it seemed like a great deal with great reviews   i just went to shenandoah national park to camp over columbus day weekend   tent seemed great and the setup was easy   everything was great  but then it rained for two of the nights i was there   on the first night  water leaked in two of the corners  but it didn t seem terrible  so i figured i could deal with it   the second night it rained a bit harder  and i work up to the bottom of my sleeping bag wet and my pillow wet  by both of the original leaked corners   there were clear slow leaks in those two corners and pools of water in the floor of the tent by both   it just stunk   i actually kept the tent poles and threw out the tent and the last night i slept in my friend s tent   i understand it was on sale  but for a coleman and first time use  i was extremely disappointed   maybe i just happened to get a faulty tent as most reviews have been good  but it was a bad experience and i expected more from coleman      
2935,5.0,                       solid tent    easy to setup and stays nice and dry      
2936,4.0,                       only used it onceeasy set up nice little tent     
2937,5.0,                       i used this once and it was very easy to set up  i have not tried it in inclement weather yet      
2938,2.0,                       it arrived with a broken pole     
2939,5.0,                       i ve used this   times so far  it s great  it isn t quite as rainproof as advertised though  i was stuck in a few hours of intense down pour and i had several teaspoons of water in the tent   not a big problem but none the less it made me so nervous  other than that  it s great  it was super easy to build and take down  i did it alone once  the little door mat is cute too      
2940,5.0,                       sturdy  compact and good value for money  made for a comfortable first camping trip      
2941,5.0,                       best deal on tents  not too bulky or too heavy  i go camping once a month  and so far it s holding like the first day  really happy with it     
2942,5.0,                       we ve used this tent several times so far and are very happy with it  it rained on one of our trips and kept us dry  takes less than   minutes to assemble with   people and fits perfectly back in the tent bag after use      
2943,5.0,                       love this tent  it s good for one person   two small people would fit but you d have a hard time fitting your gear  i put it up myself in about    mins  and i have very little tent experience  i did have a second person help with the rain fly   that would be difficult for one person to do  it s not very heavy  and it s pretty easy to get it folded and back into the carrying case  i forgot to seam seal it before i went camping  and despite getting a whole night of rain i had no leaks  the pockets and hook for a light are a nice touch      
2944,4.0,                       haven t had issues with this tent   and we re on its third year of use  fyi   description states   persons  but i think that would be if all   are using sleeping bags  we used this for   slightly taller than average adults males  using twin sleeping bags each  and size was sufficient enough for them and their overnight weekend bags      
2945,5.0,                       thank you     
2946,5.0,                       just tested this out on a camping trip  easy to set up  kept us warm  and perfect size for   of us     adults and   kids with room for our gear      
2947,5.0,                       i highly recommend this tent   i am a single mom to a cub scout   i bought this for our first campout   i have never put up a tent before and i was able to put this up by myself   the night of our campout it was raining heavy with thunder and lightening all night and the tent did very well   we did not get wet   it has plenty of room for a queen size mattress      
2948,5.0,                       great camping tent  i was surprised at how much space was inside  easily fit four pretty large dudes over   feet tall inside with room to spare  protected from the wind pretty well and folds up and sets up very quick and easy  light and small enough to easily carry around while backpacking  highly recommended      
2949,5.0,                       he has not received it yet    but i m sure he will love it l     
2950,1.0,                       why are the reviews on this so silly   the zipper is of very poor quality and the material is very thin it s a kids tent    in grown up size      
2951,5.0,                       easy to assemble  little harder to put back in the bag  but awesome tent  fits   adults comfortably  prob good for   if you dont mind being a little snug     
2952,5.0,                       this tent traveled around the usa with me  and preformed well in all conditions  from the cold nights in northern montana to the incredibly hot nights in the arizona desert  this kept us dry and protected from rain  sleet  sun  insects  etc  and the screen roof allowed for some great star viewing from inside the tent  i have no complaints      
2953,5.0,                       i like this tent due to its simplicity   the second time i ever set it up was in the woods at nighttime   very quick and easy to setup  just remember to layer it into the storage bag for no brainer reassembly   a little dew came in toward the bottom of my door  so i m guessing it was morning dew that ran through the zipper   overall  for the money  you can t go wrong      
2954,3.0,                       would be a good tent for camping in the woods   camped on the beach and it was windy  the plastic was pretty loud and couldn t stay in it more than    minutes  the little stakes were also not enough and by morning the tent was in the top of a    foot tree      
2955,5.0,                       i just got back from camping on an island in a lake  this was my first time using this tent  it was wonderful  it thunderstormed at least once a day and this tent kept the rain out just fine  it also held up to some intense wind  i love how much room this tent gives you for standing and also for storing supplies  the only downside i could find to this tent was that since two sides have large screens for sides so the rain cover needs to be used for any rain and also for privacy  the ventilation was great  i am very satisfied with this purchase      
2956,5.0,                       easy to set up  good size for a queen air bed with a bit of room on each side  love that the bag is big enough to actually fit the tent well and has a removable seam to increase the size of the bag even more in case you need to put it up quickly or wet      
2957,1.0,                       i used this tent  brand new  camping in the summertime with a light but steady rain  the tent leaked water inside through the seams in three of the four corners  i woke up in the morning with pools of water inside the tent s corners  and my sleeping mat got soaking wet  poor quality      
2958,5.0,                       i m excited to use this tent in hawaii  i assembled it easily in my living room and checked with a friend on the island who said the rain fly should be adequate  great little tent  perfect size for one person to sleep in with a suitcase and changing space  my   man coleman tent has lasted for years so i m expecting the same quality for the price range      
2959,5.0,                       this tent is as easy to set up as it advertises   it was seriously only a matter of minutes before my girlfriend and i had the thing completely built and the wind rain cover attached  it kept us dry in the rain and didn t let any bugs  that we knew of  in while we slept  i highly recommend this tent      
2960,5.0,                       i love this tent  i made various trips with it and it s very easy to set up  even for one person  and it proved it s quality when we got into a bad thunderstorm this august in a state park  it had been raining for hours heavily but we remained dry  the price for this product is amazing  will buy my sister the same tent      
2961,5.0,                       easy to assemble  used in a severe storm and it held up very well  no leaks     
2962,3.0,                       opened up the box  easy set up  took me    minutes by myself  once set up  i noticed in the door by the zipper  the stitching is coming undone       
2963,5.0,                       perfect tent for camping trips  very sturdy and easy to set up  it took about    mins for us to set it up and i am pretty much a beginner      
2964,5.0,                       used this tent three times now  twice in some pretty good rain  i ve stayed completely dry  it has enough room for me and my gear  its a deluxe  one man tent      
2965,4.0,                       quick setup good for two people     
2966,3.0,                       this was only the second time using the tent since we purchased it at the end of may       poles are cheap and split  metal piece was missing from the pole making it difficult to set up i would recommend a better tent with aluminum poles      
2967,5.0,                       purchased so i could put up a tent without help and it worked      first time i ve ever put up a tent alone and it did not take all day     
2968,5.0,                       this tent is awesome  i ve never put up a tent before it was so easy  up in less than    minutes  it rained one night and the rain fly kept everything dry  highly recommend       
2969,5.0,                       the tent is lightweight and does well enough to block mild winds up to      mph  haven t been able to test the water resistance of the tent      
2970,3.0,                       the door does not have a way to be only mesh   we camped in a desert in oman and it was hot  telde air circulation was poor     
2971,3.0,                       good but i got  water   times inside     
2972,5.0,                       this is a very easy to put up take down tent   even for my grandson   a queen size air mattress fills the bottom nicely   quite a bit of space if you didn t want to use an air mattress that size   pockets are convenient and a small lantern hangs nicely from the center hook   all in all a nice   person tent      
2973,5.0,                       great to not have to chase rainfly  also  tent interior will stay dry when erecting in rain  it fits in bag reliably  fairly easy to put up and takedown  bulky and heavy on motorcycle but i made it work for me      
2974,5.0,                       i ended up setting it up alone   took a few minutes longer than having two people but it easy      
2975,5.0,                       light weight and very sustainable in heavy rains too       
2976,2.0,                       the tent is poor quality and the carrying bag handles were cut  dont buy they are careless with what they send      
2977,5.0,                       we ve made it through wind and through rain  i ve only seen   drops of water slip through big enough for a family of   easy to set up      
2978,5.0,                       don t know how water resistant it is  but it s easy to assemble      
2979,5.0,                       great product to bring on a camping trip  it took five minutes to assemble  it was very comfortable for   people but can accommodate one additional person as well      
2980,5.0,                       spacious for a   man tent  nice ventilation  durable  great piece for camping       
2981,3.0,                       definitely  recommend for first time camper  used it for my sons camping trip  i was able to fit a queen sized mattress along with our belongings  only problem i had is that one of the poles snapped  luckily another camper had extras     
2982,5.0,                       great tent for the price  stakes are poor  use all guys if any wind      
2983,3.0,                       seemed smaller  also it leaked      
2984,5.0,                       would definitely purchase again   very easy to put up     used it in my lr for a sleep over for my granddaughter s birthday   they had a blast      
2985,5.0,                       excellent     
2986,5.0,                       i was able to put it up by myself in about    minutes on the first try   it was equally easy to take down and store in the case it came with i expect it to take less than    minutes to put up next time and would be even faster with two people      
2987,1.0,                       this tent i would not recommend  literally broke the first trip  it was windy and a strap literally ripped right on the stake  very disappointed      
2988,5.0,                       easy to set up and it seems durable     
2989,5.0,                       i grew up camping so i have some experience with outdoor gear  is this the best tent ever  of course not  look at the price  but it is a great starter tent for summer weather  i got drizzled on for a while and didn t experience condensation getting all over my stuff inside   the material is passable  the floor of the tent has a sufficient rise to guard against leaking in  and i didn t bust any zippers  side note on the zippers though  they re about as sturdy as you d expect them to be for the price so just be gentle with them and be aware that you re not catching fabric between its teeth as you go  i would say it is possible to bust a zipper but if you re careful  you ll likely get mileage out of this tent  as far as size  i bought one of those blue standard queen blow up air mattresses and it was a sure struggle getting it through the door but i managed to do so by sort of squeezing it in half in which case by the time it was in it was upside down and nothing could be done about that  a queen mattress length is too long to fit from front door to back window but it did tightly fit sideways and i had enough room at the front door for my medium size suitcase and all my other camp junk  the rain guard is what it is  serves its purpose but i wouldn t suggest counting on the material to hold up in a rainy season when you re shoveling trenches around your tent to guide rushing water away  make no mistake this is a starter tent for summertime use  not for professional woodsmen that get snobby about their materials  if you re snobby about zippers maybe opt elsewhere   if you re like me and shopping all at once for everything you d need  it can get pricey quick so maybe work with this for now and upgrade your starter items over the years  it has a hook to hang your light  stick with something fairly light in weight for that   a screened zip window in the back and a zipper door that can also serve as a window when shut  works for me  but i m not a quality snob  i give it   stars not for being the best tent ever but for serving it s purpose   offering what you d expect at a low price      
2990,5.0,                       can t beat this tent for the money  easy set up  great for motorcycle camping  get some better tent stakes and this setup will last a long time      
2991,5.0,                       my husband and i bought this tent for our churches family camp for a weekend at casa de fruita in california near hollister  the tent served us well  and one of the nights it started raining  but we didn t get wet at all  its water proof and we also found ourselves very warm as well  its also more roomy then the tent we previously had  you can fit two sleeping bags inside  no problem  along with your bags too  it was also pretty easy to set up as well  no issues  the zipper works great as well  i highly recommend this tent for at least two people  more than three will be pushing it  unless you intent to set   or   small children up in the tent  then i think you should be good  just my opinion though        
2992,5.0,                       after you get the tent put together  it looks good and is very spacious inside  the storage bag has a feature allowing you to rip off the tag along the center to increase the width  b c they knew it would be challenging to stick everything back inside      
2993,5.0,                       this is nice tent  i could fit queen size mattress and still have left over space  looks great  also seems to be popular tent as i have seen   other people with same tent on the campground      
2994,5.0,                       this is a great little tent for one or two people  it would be a little cozy for two though  it was the perfect amount of space for one person and my clothes  it even came with a little tarp door mat that was really nice to have      
2995,5.0,                       great quality and price  it fit   kids and one adult with one queen size bed leaving enough room for our bags  it was easy to assemble and take down      
2996,1.0,                       it was amazon choice  i thought it should be good but it wasn t  we been in shenandoah national park for camping  both windows are open and the storm directly comes in  it was really cold  as i used it i think i can t return it  i tried to contact customer service but unsuccessful      
2997,5.0,                       tent works great  well made quality  sets up easily  the   person comfortably fit myself and my son along with our stuff  we could probably squeeze another kid in there with stuff as well fairly easily  very happy with this purchase      
2998,5.0,                       tent was a great choice i bought the   person size  perfect for my wife  son and i  assembly couldn t be easier  bag aslo expands if you having trouble putting tent away      
2999,5.0,                       as a  senior  who car camps a lot  the lastest version of the coleman sundome tent has it all  easy setup  roomy  stays sturdy in the wind  and the entrance zipper is smooth and does not catch        
3000,5.0,                       great for the outdoors      
3001,5.0,                       this tent is so easy to set up and fits   people really easily with a queen sized air mattress   the price is unbelievable for the value as i see it in stores on clearance and it still isn t as cheap   great buy for beginning campers      
3002,5.0,                       went camping for a few days and this was great for my girlfriend and i  it rained alot and it didnt seep through at all  very easy set up  all and all it is great quality     
3003,5.0,                       such an easy tent to go camping with  packs in a small bag but is large enough pitched for   to   people      
3004,1.0,                       update the reason why this pos was returned was because the rod for the rainfly is way too long  and it s not like   oh that little extra is for the flex   nah    gtfo with that  it s over a foot too long  that s why the person who bought it probably returned it    and then it was sold to me as a new item  now    i am returning this pos and i want everyone to know that this has likely more to do with the vetting on returned items through amazon  the packaging department for the original item messed up big time too though  i want an rma and a freaking return asap i am disappointed because i paid for a new item  when i got this item  it was clearly used  it was full of a dustpans worth of previous camping fod and dirt  someone clearly used this  returned it  and then it was not vetted to ensure it was ready to be labeled new or used  i mean    the rma process didnt even clean it out to make it look  new   if you re going to charge that price    clearly mark it as used  when i pay for a new product  i expect a new product  if you ordered a meal from a restaurant and you got something completely different wouldn t you be annoyed    even slightly      
3005,5.0,                       we ve enjoyed using it so far      
3006,4.0,                       quality  highly affordable  good aestheics and easy to install      
3007,5.0,                       great tent budget friendly as well  very durable but i still have yet to really test it out in harsher conditions      
3008,1.0,                       the product has very poor quality near defect  amazon deletes the negative review     
3009,4.0,                       very well constructed tent   the pack bag  however  is quite flimsy   it tore easily with one interaction with a conflict   will report back after first flight test   setup took awhile in the test area      
3010,4.0,                       easy to put up and down and has help up great so far  it s smaller than i would hoped  i thought a queen air mattress would fir fine but it was a very snug fit where only the air mattress fit  it had been a while since we camped so i just think i forgot that   people means   sleeping bags snuggled close to one another      
3011,5.0,                       perfect for one adault  would work for a couple   one person can put it up in   minutes  keeps you dry in heavy rain  actually fits in the bag easily   not perfect  but probably the best tent your going to find for         
3012,5.0,                       great tent  just as described  first use had a crazy thunder storm  stayed dry and in place      
3013,5.0,                       i have a private beach club  my idea is to set up these tents on the beach  for rentals   not knowing the products or their quality i purchased several different tents here on amazon ranging from               this coleman outshines the competition by far   easy to set up and take down  great value for the price   i plan on purchasing several more     
3014,4.0,                       bought these for the many homeless families living in the woods in my area  a local organization takes care of them so when i heard about these children and parents living outdoors i had to buy   of them  i hope to get more soon      
3015,5.0,                       recently used this tent while camping on the west coast  this tent held up very well to some major heavy rain  meaning torrential down pours  everything stayed very dry inside the tent  no leaks to speak of  very easy to set up  it took less than ten minutes with two people  construction of the tent is excellent quality  it does not come with a footprint  like some higher end tents  but for the price  this tent cannot be beat  after looking at some tents in the           range  we were very happy we bought the coleman  great quality at an affordable rate      
3016,2.0,                       very roomie  worked great till first storm came in  one of the poles broke  wind wasn t that bad other tents stayed up fine  mine was only one that had issues with the pole breaking  ended up duct taping an extra stake to the broken pole to keep the tent up for the night and cut the camp trip early      
3017,5.0,                       very happy with this tent  very comfy for one person  snug but doable for two      
3018,5.0,                       used for camping  it s huge      
3019,5.0,                       have not had the chance to set it up in rain but in warm weather its perfect      
3020,4.0,                       good beginners tent  it will not fit   people but   is ok  set up is fairly easy      
3021,5.0,                       bought this after looking at the reviews and to be honest not disappointed at all  it works as advertised  assembly and putting it back is really easy  i used any tent for the first time and took    to    minutes to assemble it fully      
3022,5.0,                       excellent     
3023,5.0,                       we loved the tent  had purchased one from another store  returned it back and purchased this one  we have used it few times  and looks good  i do recommend this tent      
3024,5.0,                       excellent tent for small money   for those of u who like me  don t use electrical cords when camping   be sure u close all the velcro type electric cord openings  i missed     had a tiny puddle during an overnight nh white mtns  shower  nothing serious  luckily there wasn t any gear in that spot  for campers who would need electricity inside the tent i would suggest u use it cautiously if it rains heavily as the tent does take on water with the cord slits even slightly open      
3025,5.0,                       awesome tent  so easy to put together      
3026,5.0,                       easy to set up and worked   don t camp too often so perfect for me   as far as long term usage  not able to answer      
3027,5.0,                       i liked     
3028,5.0,                       an overall good reliable tent for the price   it s ideal for car camping  but far too large to be a backpacking tent   very spacious with good amenities for the price   i used it this past weekend for   days in vt and it kept me dry throughout a couple sporadic wind and rain storms  so definitely got use out of the rain weather protection   my only very minor complaint is the zipper tended to get stuck sometimes at the bottom of the door when closing it   this is just my pet peeve and should not prevent someone from buying this tent   highly recommend this product      
3029,5.0,                       love it  easy to put and take down  lots of ventilation   it s smaller than an older   person tent by coleman  my queen air mattress just fit with no room around the bed  that suits me fine      
3030,5.0,                       my boyfriend thought this tent would not be waterproof bc the rain fly dosen t go all the way to the ground  buuuuuut  thanks to reviews on amazon  i was a believer  and we went camping last weekend in the rain and there was one tiny area that leaked a little  overall  easy set up and nice tent      
3031,3.0,                       you certainty wouldn t want   people hanging out in here  we did have an issue with water coming in both times we used it  however  it is cheap and easy to set up      
3032,5.0,                       love     
3033,5.0,                       grandkids love it     
3034,5.0,                       i bought the tents and used them last month  they were very easy to assemble  it rained and we did not get wet  i also liked that i can stand upright in the center  the tent was very spacious      
3035,5.0,                       absolutely love it  i ve used it several times already  once in a bad storm  it can take       mph winds  it did pull the rain cover off but the tent stayed out      
3036,4.0,                       the ten itself is nice and the quality seems pretty good   i was hoping my son and i could fit in it comfortably  but i used it on a camping trip where i slept in it alone and at       i had to sleep at an angle   still my head was touching one end and my feet the other   not a chance i could share that tent with anyone else      
3037,5.0,                       perfect for two people  maybe three  but tents never fit the number of people it says it can comfortably  love how it is open so you can see the stars if the weather is good  so easy to set up  we always buy better stakes then the ones that come with tents  compacts into a small space  perfect      
3038,5.0,                       great little tent   fits a queen air mattress with no room to spare  easy to set up      
3039,4.0,                       as usual  the person rating of this tent pertains to the maximum possible adult occupancy  without reference to any gear you might have  i use this tent for front country camping  where is is very roomy and comfortable for two people with sleeping cots and all our gear  here are the highlights after at least    nights in this tent assembly is quick and simple  on a windy day the fly is a little challenging but nothing that can t be solved with an extra pair of hands last year i was camping in the adirondacks and had two days of persistent heavy rain  the inside stayed perfectly dry  full marks for water proofing be aware this really is a three season  warm climate tent  there are large insect screen windows on all four sides  and a ventilation opening down low on the back wall  great during the summer  however  only the windows on the door and back wall can zippered shut  necessary for privacy since the fly doesn t go over these   there is no way to seal the other three openings  i have spent three nights in this tent where temperatures were around    degrees fahrenheit  five degrees celcius  and even with an appropriately rated sleeping bag it was hard to stay comfortable because of the cold wind blowing through the tent the tub floor is sturdy and holding up well  in fact the whole tent is showing no signs of wear  recommended for warm climate camping trips where weight isn t an issue
