0,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          just received the hadineeon double walled electric kettle and it s an amazing product  i already have another kettle that is made by hadineeon and i was looking for a completely stainless steel kettle that had a cool touch exterior  i found this and it is exactly what i needed pros entirely stainless on the inside  there is no plastic or silicone whatsoever on the inside soft open lid  some lids pop open splashing hot water on you  this is very well engineered in that regard power      w is more than enough power  it heats up    l in roughly     mins depending on the temperature of the water aesthetics are nice  can t beat it for the price cool touch exterior and being double walled is great for heat retention  i have a kid and my other kettle is glass which gets hot and this has the cool touch which is awesome remember that an electric kettle is more than just heating up water for tea and coffee  i use this to preheat water for making pasta which saves a ton of time compared to heating up on stovetop alone      
1,5.0,                       it s been two weeks since i get this electrical water hitter it  looks very nice on my kitchen counter interior   first i boiled water for my tea and omg  tee  tasted horrible  then i read instructions  and boiled water three times  yes  people  you should boil water couple of times before you start using it  to remove  whatever stainless steel is cover with  initially  after that  water taste perfect  automatic shutdown works perfectly but you should keep water  level between minimum and maximum  you can boil one cup also but you should shut down manually when it starts boiling and it happening very fast  whole week i ve been using this heater very heavy  i  mean very heavy  boiling like    gallon of water a day just to make sure it works and i don t have to return  so far so good  works perfectly  i will post another review  in a couple of months      
2,5.0,                       okay  so i am a huge hadineeon product fan  why  i had gone through   different manufacturer frothers for my coffee cream and theirs was the best of all  i loved that item so much that i have bought   more over this year as gifts  a few other friends always see the froth and ask for the info so they can buy their own as for the kettle  i took a photo of the frother  black  and the kettle side by side so you can see that this is a bit larger  it is well made  solid  and i love the way it works  just lift off the power base and place it back on  the water gets to be boiling hot but the kettle stays cool to the touch outside  it works exactly as advertised and i have no doubt that i will likely be buying more for my friends      tea lovers of not note  my wife loves to take her coffee with her in the morning and i have found that by simply prewarming the inside of the cup thermos with hot water  her coffee stays a lot hotter through the day  this makes  that  job even easier  no mess  easy clean up and a grade a in my book i highly recommend      
3,5.0,                       the hadineeon electric kettle    l       stainless steel interior double wall electric tea kettle is a fantastic buy highly recommend if you haven t used an electric kettle to help cooking meals of all types  you do not know what you are missing  this double walled kettle heats water fast and efficiently  it looks great on the counter and is the perfect tool to add to your kitchen arsenal  we heat water often for everything from ramen noodles and oatmeal to hot drinks of all types or when you just need to add some hot water to any recipe  this kettle is perfect for all applications and the kettle separates from the base so you can move the hot water around safely and independently this is a great kettle for the price cost we are gifting some to family and friends that haven t yet used an electric kettle but saw ours in action during the most recent holiday      
4,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i like my new kettle especially the matt slick look of it  it s very quiet too compare to my old kettles  it s very pretty and modern look  much nicer then any white kettle i ve seen   it boiled water quick and quiet  it s big too so i don t have to refill it all the time      
5,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i always wanted a reliable kettle   this one seems doing the job  as u see also it matches our kitcheni used electric kettle for some time  current one worked well as well but it had   issues and this one resolved both it s hot when water is hot and by accident  without thinking  i touched it a few timesand the bottom is wide  but top is narrow  so it was very difficult to clean inside this kettle has   walls  so i can touch outside even when the water is hot inside also  bottom top is same size and wide enough to put my hand inside to clean inside wall    its outside is white but modern white  not the old shining white color    the doube walls  so outside is not hot when inside water is hot    the nice looking  modern designit is perfect for my family  specially we are considered al coffeholic        
6,5.0,                       this kettle is convenient to use especially with the cordless design  even though i only use the kettle for myself  the size capacity on this thing allows me to boil a lot of water real fast   i drink a lot of tea and generally prefer warm hot water over cold room temp so i m constantly refilling my mug  my favorite feature is the automatic shut off because i tend to forget to check on the stove when boiling water  also  this kettle is aesthetically designed so i usually just leave it on the counter when not using it  you can also wrap the cord around the charger base so it makes storage really neat      
7,5.0,                       i ve been looking for a relatively small electric kettle for a while  we had a coffee maker that worked just fine  but cleaning and using it just didn t feel right  i m very much a chai mix person rather than straight coffee but my mother loves a quick cup in the morning  so  having a full size coffee maker just wasn t the most expedient or efficient i wanted a relatively small one  not too large like   liters or more  we don t drink that much at once  i wanted something that worked fast  like done in   minutes fast  and i wanted something that was  one and done   no fuss or complicated settings  and i got all that with this kettle this is     l  so a little larger than i wanted  but it works out great  plenty for a few cups without wasting too much  barely takes a minute to fill to the recommended level  and with one button  it s going  takes a few minutes to boil  and you can definitely tell that it s boiling  it is a bit louder than i originally thought  you can hear the kettle heating up and then the boiling  so if you want a silent kettle  this one isn t it  depending on when you re using it  really early in the morning while other people are asleep or if you have very little distance between the kettle and a bedroom  this could be an issue  but for us  it s nothing to complain about  the water is boiling hot when done and it auto clicks off  both with sound and the light under the button  you can easily tell the difference between the kettle being on or off for safety i ve heard complaints that the lid doesn t open as fully  but i don t see an issue  my hands aren t so big they can t clean it when needed  and i always pull the plug when i know i won t be using if again during the day just for caution  i originally wanted something with a warming function  but truthfully  i don t miss it  the kettle heats so fast normally  i wouldn t need it  and as we are not habitual drinkers throughout the day  it s a non issue overall  i love this thing  it works exactly as i wanted it to  and we get use out of it every day  i m drinking more coffee now than i did before  which some people might think is a bad thing   but i enjoy it      
8,5.0,                       should ve bought this sooner   what a time saver and it s so simple to use   i was using a coffee maker for hot water since i always use hot water for tea  hot chocolate  instant soups and korean instant coffee but    it takes up a large amount of counter space    it s ugly      you have to deal with cleaning out the pot so your hot water doesn t have a coffee after taste     it steams from the back  which can ruin your cabinets over time this handy appliance fixes all of that   small footprint on your counter so you can leave it there all the time   the design is very simple and modern   i don t need this to be a show piece on my counter   i just need it to be out of the way and heat water quickly   it takes     minutes to heat up water to a perfect hot temperature depending on how much water is on there   it does steam for the last    seconds or so from the spout   however  you can rotate it so that it faces out   no more steaming my cabinets if you use hot water for tea  hot chocolate  soups or whatever  buy it   you won t regret it      
9,5.0,                       this electric kettle is a worthy investment  i ve been hesitant over the years to purchase an electric kettle because of lack of storage in my kitchen  but i m so glad i decided to give this one a try pros  it boiled water in     less minutes than my traditional stovetop kettle  cord could around base for convenience and clean looking storage  matte finish on outside of kettle gives it a more classic look  easy to cleancons   bigger than a stovetop tea kettleoverall  this a great purchase and will shorten the time needed to boil water and do it in style      
10,5.0,                       beautifully designed with a sleek white exterior  this electric tea kettle is super fast and can heat up    l of water  the interior is      stainless steel and bpa free with auto shut off  very impressive and you can t beat the price      
11,5.0,                       my last kettle was giving away and i wanted to buy a new one  i came across this fantastic product  it boils the water just like any other  but it double wall  keeps the kettle completely safe to touch from anywhere  no hot on the outside   this is perfect for my house as my kids are just getting to an age where they want to help in kitchen  but i am afraid they might touch hot surfaces  with this kettle  i am not concerned anymore  i know there is   less item they touch can burn them  they still are not allowed to pour water from it  on the functionality side  this is just perfect  a very quiet kettle  which boils the water perfect and auto shuts  after a few uses  i wanted to wash the kettle  the inside is   single stainless steel container  so when i opened to clean  it was super easy to clean  and the chance of scaling is very minimal as well overall a fantastic product  i am satisfied knowing the product is backed by   year warranty      
12,5.0,                       this thing is awesome  so easy to use and clean  just be sure to not fill it above the max fill line  that is very important  otherwise  you ll end up with water inside the handle lol  it is so easy to use  just fill to the max line  set it on the base  and push the switch down to start it  hot water is ready in about a minute  i haven t actually timed it   water stays hot in the pot for a while after your pour your first cup  i have an oversized coffee mug that i drink from and i can fill it a little more than twice before i have to heat more water  the appearance of this item is very sleek and modern  looks great on my counter  definitely recommend this       
13,5.0,                       good for the cost  i purchased the kettle on dec     have used it for   months  it is very easy to use and heats water to boiling very quickly  even when filled to the max setting  the on off button is easy to use  the heating element base is very lightweight  with a power cord   ft   inches  features of this kettle that i like include entirely stainless steel inside  inner lid as well as the stainless steel open spout filter  easier to pour water  the lid opens softly instead of pop open prevents hot water from splashing on you   the non slip grip handle stays cool to the touch while your water comes to a boil quickly     l is good enough for my daytime use      
14,5.0,                       we had a great electric kettle that was a gift and it stopped working  ever since then  we have been looking for a good one and unfortunately we never found one that was as good  usually  the issues we have is that the mouth is too small to clean and we see a lot of mineral build up that is hard to clean what i like about this one is the mouth is large enough to clean  since it s stainless steel  its really easy to add water  vinegar and lemon to make sure it s clean this one does have a minimum amount of water that needs to be in  about     cups  before you can boil  i recommend using a measuring cup and filtered water so you ensure that the electric kettle doesn t have too much build up and that you always reach the minimum mark also love that you can hide the cord underneath  helps you keep your countertop looking neat      
15,5.0,                       in the interest of full disclosure  we were offered a gift card for a good review  i initially held off on posting a review just because of that reason  so now that the kettle has actually been put the ringer of multiple daily use cycles since december i can attest that this kettle is worth every dollar we spent on it  pro to this kettle  we purchased one at costco  a chefman  and that didn t last bit over a month and a half with a lot of daily use  the plastic lid hinge gave  out which affected the shut off switch  after a long time searching for a new kettle  we took a gamble on this one  this one has an all stainless interior  no plastic exposed to the water and steam  the lid on the hadineeon has operated precisely since day one  it opens and closes perfectly still  the water heats up quick and we have never had one issue with it  yes i would buy this again  the price is competitive and there are no leaks when pouring  kudos on a great product      
16,5.0,                       i was searching to replace an old  hot shot   single serving water heater that we primarily use for tea   i was not extremely concerned with the insulation factor nor the fact that the hadineeon holds   cups of water but i have come to appreciate both pluses   the unit is very well insulated and the ability to heat water for more than one user at a time  works out really well   it feels like a sturdy  well made unit   i have not put a thermometer in the water at the end of the auto shut off cycle but it is  very very hot   bottom line   i m very pleased      
17,5.0,                       if you want quick hot water and quiet steamer then this is the product for you  i love that i can put this on my desk in my room and not have to go to the kitchen to make coffee and microwave water is terrible    this pot will gaurentee you get quality hot water for your coffee  or beverage soup that you require  i intend to send these pots out for gifts  and the price is unmatched   the only negative i ve found is i would of designed the power switch at the top in case you hit it by mistake and break the switch being on the bottom but it not a major problem thanks for a great product once again        
18,5.0,                       we have used and reviewed hadineeon electric kettles in the past   we have grown to like them   this is a simple  very light kettle that is consistent with their high quality   it is a pretty  simple  and effective product   we love their lighted glass kettles but this product is very light and we plan to gift to an old friend who is growing weak in her grip but wants a pretty kettle for tea and hot water   this kettle is spot on   she will love it      
19,4.0,                       this color is just so cute  and in the end is what made me click buy   so let me begin by saying i am a tea addict i drink tea   to   times a day and this kettle is so quick and just a perfect option for making hot water for tea  we also use it very frequently to make hot water for our cup of soup noodles  heat the water pour the water  and boom there is dinner  no dishes either  when i cook i use it to viol water fast as it takes about half the time to boil the same amount of water in the kettle as it does on the stove top we took it camping and it s just a nice kettle comfort of home still just as easy and worth wile as at home only thing i would have liked to know before i bought was that there is no bell that lets you know the water is boiling  it gets to a vertical temperature    my water is always a full rolling boil    and then turns it s self off  and if you are not paying attention you can miss the tiny click it makes  but worst case this happens you go back and turn it on again it will only take a few moments for it to get back to that top temperature        
20,5.0,                       i could not wait for my electric tea kettle to arrive  the reviews were very positive so i was anxious to see if all were true  yes  they were i watch a lot of british shows and they use electric kettles  anyway this holds about   quarts of water  inside all stainless steel with min max easy to read markings  i followed the instructions by boiling water  x  water heats up in     mins i use filter water  the cord coils under the plate where the kettle sits   love this feature   looks sleek and modern on my counter  very well made for the price i will do a follow up after a month but so far very happy       
21,5.0,                       everyone loves our kettle   and by everyone i mean our whole family  so much better than heating a glass in the microwave or a pot on the stove  the water is hot in minutes  one little click of a lever and it s on  it s also adorable  but the best part is the outside does not get hot at all  i burned myself on our last kettle by accidentally touching it  no worries about that here  no worrying the kids will accidentally touch it either  really amazing  love it      
22,5.0,                       after a lifetime of stainless steel kettles  i started out wanting to purchase a glass kettle this time  but this one won me over instead with several features first  it caught my eye with its cute  retro color secondly  its shape  most kettles tend to have a body that tapers towards the top  which helps retain heat so the kettle boils faster  but also makes the top opening narrow  which makes the kettle harder to clean  which i hate  this kettle doesn t have that problem  and here is why i liked the concept of cool touch surface  which was definitely a great safety feature   con  no little window through which to see how much water is in there  pro  double wall construction means the kettle retains heat well and water remains hot for longer periods of time  so refills don t require reheating quite as often   obviously  the pro far outweighs the con i have been using it for two weeks now  and so far all the benefits and no apparent problems  definitely an excellent product i would recommend to others looking to replace an old kettle      
23,5.0,                       i surprised it delivered in the original box itself  the box was left by my apartment front door and it was opened  checked inside and everything seems fine so no biggie  nice style and color  all stainless steel inside  easy to clean  i boiled water twice before first use as instructed  water gets boiled fast with water in max line like within   minutes  what i don t like was there is already limescale build up on the bottom in the very first use update boiled water for the real use and the limescale i have mentioned above no longer show      
24,5.0,                       after moving to a house where i have to pay for water  plus having to wait what seems like a long time for the hot water to come out of the kitchen faucet  a kettle seemed like a good idea  this kettle is outstanding     it works very quickly to heat water throughout the day  it is used     daily and has my water boiling in under   mins  not sure why i waited so long to buy a kettle especially this one  highly recommended      
25,5.0,                       i wanted something simple with a beautiful design  i was gifted a glass kettle and it was awful and so hot i burned myself  i returned it and purchased this one and even after the kettle has just finished its heating cycle it doesn t feel hot at all on the outside  the color is a nice mint and compliments my kitchen really well  i ve had it for a month and so far i m really happy with my choice      
26,5.0,                       i love this kettle so much   it s super easy to use   you just press the button and it quickly boils the water and then turns off by itself   nothing gets hot on the outside of the pot so i feel safe and very comfortable with it   i bought the white one which is very beautiful  i buy tons of stuff online and on amazon and this is definitely one of my favorite purchases yet   i m crazy about it       
27,5.0,                       this is my second hadineeon purchase and their quality of construction is excellent   it is so nice to be able to boil water and to be able to touch the outside of the kettle without getting burned   it boils water quickly and is easy to rinse out   i love the stainless steel interior   and i love the design  it looks great on my counter   thank you again hadineeon for another great appliance      
28,5.0,                       if you are on the fence about purchasing the hadineeon electric kettle  let me remove your doubt  the hadineeon electric kettle is an excellent addition to your kitchen  both at home or office  i have used this kettle every day now for a few weeks and have found it to be a most satisfactory performer  first off  let me make clear it does the job it s supposed to do  boil water quickly  but in addition to that it  keeps it hot  pours easily  and is pleasing to the eye  now before you start thinking this review is too glowing for it to be real i will point out one little thing that the hadineeon electric kettle could stand a little improvement on   the lid could open a little wider so as to make it a little easier to add water  that s it  the issue wouldn t stop me from buying one as a gift or recommending it to a friend  good luck finding your perfect kettle  hopefully  i have made that search a little easier      
29,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i was in need of replacing my cheap plastic kettle that was over    years old and wanted a cordless one  this one ticked all the boxes for me  the color is bright and stands out in my kitchen  the base is sturdy and has a cord wrap underneath to keep the cord organized  the kettle itself is light and heats up fast  i filled the kettle up a couple times and boiled each time to get rid of the  new smell  before i used it for my cup of tea  kettle is easy to pick up off the base  great product for the price      
30,5.0,                       i am very impressed by this kettle which is by far the best i have ever had the entire interior is made of stainless steel with no seams at the bottom  in other kettles  the spout has a flimsy filter but in this one  it is sturdy and part of the kettle itself it takes about   min  to boil if full which for me is good  i wasn t expecting the outside wall to remain cool to the touch it looks like the lid has a magnetic mechanism because it closes with minimal effort finally  i absolutely love the color      
31,5.0,                       the kettle is lightweight but sturdy  cool to touch outside  it s easy to clean  i could reach inside with no problem  easy to handle and use  not flimsy or clunky  perfect size  the on and off switch is located on the base  the kettle is easy to lift off the base to poor and clean  the filtered spout doesn t spatter or splash hot water back up while pouring  it has automatic shut off after water finishes boiling  i can make about   and        oz wide beer mug size cups of tea before refilling water  i use it almost everyday for tea  coffee  hot  cereal  or soup  i really like that it stays hot longer than heating by microwave  i really like it and would buy this again  it s so much easier and convenient than using a stove top tea kettle  i recommend this hadineeon brand      
32,5.0,                       i like this one much better than my previous one  which was about    years old at this point  this has stainless covering the whole inside  including the inside of the lid  no plastic touching the water  the water heats up  pretty fast  the outside stays cool   the kettle is very light  weight  overall pretty great so far  i wish the lid would open up a full    degrees   so that i could fit the kettle in my fridge door water dispenser to fill it up  no big deal  and other than that it s great      
33,5.0,                       i bought this to take camping because i m tired of waiting    minutes for coffee in the morning  this fully heated to a boil at maximum water capacity in just under   minutes  it was cool to the touch even after heating twice in a row  it s heavy duty and i believe it will hold up quite well for camping i like also that its stainless steel but coated so it won t scratch i like it enough that i plan to keep it in the kitchen and use it at home as well      
34,4.0,                       works really well  and looks nice on my counter   the only thing that would change my review from   to   stars  would be if it kept the water hot longer   it stays warm for a while  in the kettle  but not hot enough for that next cup of coffee   i need to re heat it when i m ready for that next cup   but  it s still really fast  so that s not a deal breaker      
35,5.0,                        i waited two months to write this once taking it out of the box  it is a bit bigger than expected but  i am not mad at that  at all  this thing is perfect  because it lifts off of the base  no need to deal with annoying wires   no need to unplug and plug it back in to use again  it does sound like a rocker starting  when it boils  but  you get used to it    get it  you won t regret it      
36,5.0,                       i already had a regular electric tea kettle but i heard good things about double walled electric kettles so i wanted to give one a try  after looking around i settled on this one after it arrived i compared it with my other kettle  they both heated the water in around the same time  when i came back   hours later to check the temperature  my regular kettle s temperature was      f and this kettle was around     f  so the double walls really do work and i m very happy with it      
37,5.0,                       i have used this kettle everyday for   weeks now and love it  it heats the water up very quickly and i like the auto shut off feature so i can walk away if needed  the outside stays cool after the water is done boiling  so you can set the kettle on the table without worrying that it will burn your tabletop  the design is very appealing to the eye  clean and modern  also big bonus   this one is all stainless steel inside so you don t have to worry about the hot water coming into contact with any plastic  my only minor complaint is that i wish there was a temperature control as the water heats up super hot  i use it for tea so i let it rest a little longer to let it cool off a little but it s not a big deal      
38,5.0,                       nice and actually bigger than what i expected  i like the capacity  its a simple electric kettle without any fancy features  i was looking for an alexa enabled kettle which i couldnt find  so  paired this with an amazon smart plug  now  i can ask alexa to make the water ready for the morning tea  matches the white furniture of the bedroom as well  it seems that it gets finger prints on the handle but they can be cleaned      
39,5.0,                       what i like about this hadineeon electric kettle is that it has      stainless steel interior and there is not contact of the hot water with any plastic parts and therefore there is no risk of contamination or plastic rubber taste on water  the double wall prevents any involuntary contact with a hot surface which is a good safety feature  the body of the kettle is cylindrical and not tapped which allows a good size lid and an easy cleaning process which is also important to consider  it is not noise and its modern european design goes well with my kitchen  i purchased it on dec          and it is working very well without any problems  it is an excellent product with a fair price  i highly recommend it      
40,5.0,                       most of the kettle we  have purchased in the past are small   this is a big capacity kettle  i like the fact that it matched the white cups i have in the house plus the white tea and coffee tray that i also purchased at amazon  it takes a while to make the water boiling  otherwise everything is   stars      
41,5.0,                       what can i say    i ve owned the cuisinart kettle  see pics  that was waaaayyyy more pricey  and have used this one and am impressed  its fast  heats well  and has a wide mouth that makes clean up easy for me since i have big hands plus  hadineeon has great customer service  this ll be my  th product purchased from them      
42,5.0,                       this kettle matches my kitchen perfectly   i love how the whole inside is stainless steel  the only con i see are you can t choose a temp  its just one temperature   this might not work for people who want tea at       so far  this has not been an issue for us and we are willing to look past that for an all stainless steel pot      
43,5.0,                       looked for a new kettle replacement and already had this brand s milk frother so i thought why not  turned out to be a great choice  love that its double walled with stainless steel  we got the pastel green which was an awesome color to boot pros  boils fast as any other kettle  larger capacity for those extra guests  and my favorite  retains the hot water temperature for about   hours post boil   by   hrs  water is still hot enough to enjoy a nice cup a tea  cons  nothing really  if i was being picky  then a small view or indicator for current water level would be nice  but really no complaints here      
44,5.0,                       i love this kettle  it s beautiful and boils the water to a very hot temperature  it s a little louder than expected  but that s a non issue for me great value for style and functionality      
45,5.0,                       after using and tossing stove top kettles for years  i bought this electric kettle  best decision ever  it costs less than most stove top kettles  water heats within a minute and stays hot  and it s much easier to clean  the color is an added bonus  it matches my kitchen decor perfectly      
46,5.0,                       this kettle is such great quality  i had tried other kettles off of amazon and ended up returning them due to some problem  not with this one  it is so nice and the instructions are super clear on how to use the kettle for the best quality water  it also heats up extremely fast which is great  do what the instructions say and you will love this product      
47,5.0,                       legacy  tea kettle on stove  user   switched when workmanship on teapot began to deteriorate   bright idea   let me consider an electric tea kettle   i purchased hadineeon electric kettle double wall     l electric tea kettle stainless steel because the design  features  functions and color are exemplary i enjoy a cup of crio bru cacao every morning   and the hadineeon will be a great add to my mindfulness morning ritual   thank you     
48,4.0,                       i like the design and the color i chose  very calming soft green  the kettle is very easy to use and heats water to boiling very quickly  even when filled to the max setting  the water stayed warm for quite some time when turned off  the user instructions are very clear and understandable  the button to open the lid take a little harder push of the button that i thought it should  and the lid doesn t open wide   i can manually open the lid a little wider for cleaning   the on off button is easy to use  the heating element base is very light weight  this unit looks good on my kitchen counter  and i could just as easily use it in my home office      
49,4.0,                       overall  i really like this kettle  its fast  simple  and gets the job done  my only complaint was that the base color doesn t exactly match the kettle  the kettle color is a bright mint color and looked new  the base was somewhat dingier in color with some black around the edges  so i m not sure if i just received an old base  with a new kettle       
50,5.0,                       so far  i like it just fine  love the double wall and the feel of the matte finish   took a star away because the kettle doesn t sit flat on the base  so it wobbles which just makes it feel cheap update  adding a star back for the wonderful customer service of the manufacturer     
51,5.0,                       i was thourouly impressed on how quickly this actually boiled water  i filled it about halfway between the minimum   maximum line  and it was done is less than   minutes   i love the auto shut off feature  and the fact atht it will turn off you if you don t have enough water in it  it will definitely be a great product to make our hot chocolate with  during these cold winter months  it s also super easy to clean and doesn t take up a lot of space to store either in between uses  i am extremely happy with this purchase      
52,5.0,                       very happy with this kettle so far   it dwarfs my old kettle  which is hidden behind in the pictures  and it has a nice white finish that blends in with the rest of the kitchen   the interior is all stainless so i am hopeful that this will resist the build up of limescale over time   the base of this kettle can accommodate any unused length of cord   just be sure to lay the cord flat as the base is relatively light   the kettle boils fairly quickly even when filled to capacity  which is great as i plan to use it to make more than a few cups of tea      
53,5.0,                       my roommate burned her hand on our old kettle because she didn t know i had just used it  i was looking for a kettle that would be cool to touch and still make my tea boiled to perfection  this kettle was everything i wanted and more  it is perfect for our apartment  boils hot water  and is so cute  i love the color   if you want a kettle that is child or better yet roommate friendly this is the one        
54,4.0,                       boils very fast  stays hot inside and safe to touch on the outside  the only issue is the lid does not open the full    degrees  which makes it harder to add water to  still  much better quality than most electric kettles   and much more convenient than any traditional water boiling methods      
55,5.0,                       i bought the milk frother several months ago and absolutely love it   use it everyday so i thought i d give their electric kettle a try all their products are so well made and stylish i like iced tea  so i usually make mine in a pan  then transfer it to a container this product does everything   heats up the water on the countertop and then i throw in my tea bags no hot stove top  no hot pan to juggle or glass to break wonderful      
56,5.0,                       just received my order   tried it out right away   the attractive sleek design matches well with my coffee grinder and thermos pot and i love the ease of how this stainless steel interior double wall electric kettle works       w is ample power for a speedy boil and a fast track to a fresh cup of morning joe   i am satisfied with this kettle as it works exactly the way it s supposed to   fast  efficient   nice looking design makes this a winner   highly recommend      
57,4.0,                       this kettle is ultra light  heats quickly and is quieter than my old hamilton beach model  the sides don t get hot but the lid does  there is no fill level window so you just have to remember where your level is from last time  love it so far      
58,5.0,                       i ve been trying to get rid of all my  junk  for a while and live more minimally  however  this tea kettle is the perfect addition to my kitchen  i got the black  it s matte and looks great just sitting out on the counter  it s very easy to use and the water heats up quickly  water is steaming hot  takes probably     minutes to finish heating  loving the kettle so far and it comes at a great price       
59,5.0,                       want a rolling boil in just a few minutes   this pot is the answer   plug in  fill with water to line and press clear clip at bottom  the pot sits atop the  looks like a top  base  note how big it is      tall and     around  the color is a pale light sea foam      
60,5.0,                       loving this electric kettle   no plastic touches the water  which was important to me  the kettle is also well insulated  so the outside doesn t get hot to the touch  water heats up quickly and holds plenty of water  i even heat up water to cook pasta in the kettle and then poor it into a pan to add the pasta      
61,5.0,                       i researched many different tea kettles  i was looking for something that was both and esthetically pleasing and durable  i found many for           but that i loved but they were beyond what i wanted to spend  this kettle fit all the above criteria and the price was a below what i would expect to pay for the quality  worth every penny      
62,5.0,                       i turn on my electric kettle several times a day  drinking warm water vs cold is is a healthy practice   i boil water to wash dishes  i use the siphon coffee brewing method and pre boiling the water cuts a lot of time once transferred this is my second kettle from the same company   they make the product simple  no complication and well made  it has a nice black mat finish         maintenance friendly          it arrived the following day at no charge in double boxed packaging      
63,5.0,                       love this kettle  it s large enough to make an   cup mason jar of tea each morning that i drink throughout the day  it has gotten me drinking more fluids than ever before and i honestly haven t even had to clean it because i just use water in it  the mint green is light in color and a nice addition to my kitchen  i keep it out on the counter all the time      
64,5.0,                       love this product  it is much bigger than i originally thought in person  very simple to set up  just clean with vinegar and you re good to go  looks sleek alongside my white kitchen cabinets and white coffee machine  the kettle boils the water in less than   mins if that  perfect for my morning hot teas      
65,5.0,                       large capacity is not large due to its max filling mark   the lid is not fully opened when the thumb button is depressed making it not easy to fill   if you want it opened more you have to lift up lid manually   otherwise it s great      
66,5.0,                       great kettle  very modern clean look and a great price  i love how light weight it is and am very happy that it s stainless steel and bpa free  another huge plus is the safety features  the kettle automatically turns of if there s no water in it and the double wall feature makes it cool to the touch while it s boiling your water so you won t get burned if you accidentally touch it  i have little ones that love to climb up on the kitchen counters and press buttons and those feature relieve a lot of worry  all in all very happy with my purchase      
67,5.0,                       if you are looking for an aesthetically pleasing electric water kettle at an unbeatable price point  this is the one  basic one push down button begins the warming process   auto releases after boiling point is reached  looks great with my dinnerware  unlike the dancing light glass carafes out there that stick out like a sore thumb  i plan on giving a couple as gits for the holidays as i am sure my traditional stove top water kettle fans to convert after trying this one out      
68,5.0,                       an all stainless design keeps all plastic away from the water   it is very fast bringing even the maximum amount of water to a boil   no need to watch it like a stovetop kettle so you can focus on other cooking or morning duties      
69,5.0,                       this item shipped very quickly   let me start with saying i have owned several electric kettles  this one looks great on the counter and does exactly what i need it to do  i used this to help clear my drains  for making a pot of tea  and for sterile water for a neti pot   heats the water quickly and isn t too loud about it either      
70,5.0,                       this is a great teakettle  it is large and heats water quickly  it s light and easy to pour even when full  the swivel base is a nice feature i love the instant shutoff and the longer cord that allows me to move it away from the upper cupboard  great kettle for the price      
71,5.0,                       i tried multiple products but this one is the easiest and excellent  for the full kettle    seconds to warm   seconds to hot   seconds to boilhowever  water doesn t stay warm in the kettle for a longer duration  so i usually transfer it to thermos bottles      
72,5.0,                       i got this kettle because i really wanted one in my classroom   i have purchased hadineeon before and decided to give them another try   again i am satisfied with the products they have   the double layer wall is perfect for having in the classroom that way i know none of my students will get burned if they touch it   it heats my water fast and does exactly what it is supposed to do   i would love it if there was a keep warm option just to keep the water warm throughout the day  but it doesn t take much effort to push the button      
73,5.0,                       water stays hot  got it because i ve done some research on stainless steel and it s better to hold hot water than the plastic kettles  comes with warranty which is amazing   bpa free and nice color  also fast boiling      
74,5.0,                       it is elegant to look at and works like a charm  frankly  at first sight  i thought it was too big for my needs but  alas  it seems to know how big it should be  i am also surprised at how quickly it brings water to a boil  the whole process is automatic so there is no fear of water boiling away  it discreetly  pops  off when done  loving it      
75,5.0,                       love my electric kettle have been wanting to get an electric kettle  for a very long time and finally it s here love love love it mostly got it to make myself some tea but can be used for so many other things like hot water for your rice  pasta etc      
76,5.0,                       plugged in and boiled cold water very quickly   automatic cutoff once complete   is nice and very handy   you can hear it click off but be nice to have a louder buzzer or  ding  you could turn on off   i am used to the stovetop kettle whistling at me    lolthe only negative i could say is the lid opens pretty well but i wish it opened fully or could be removed for better cleaning      
77,4.0,                       this kettle is my second one by hadineeon  it s easy to use and reliable and this one in particular is super easy to clean as well  i love both of the ones i have  however my only issue is that i like to see inside  so i do prefer the glass kettle over this one so i can see the water level  this works well and last      
78,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          super easy to use and clean  this is quieter and warms up water pretty quick  and auto shutoff  the socket cord is pretty decent size  i love the stainless steel on the inner side  wide mouth so that you can pour water straight from the tap  perfect new year buy      
79,2.0,                       the kettle was great at first until i suffered a  nd degree burn from accidentally reaching over it to unplug it after use  the steam alone severely burned my wrist and now i may have a scar for life  i ve never had any type of incident using another kettle  so i would either be super careful with this one or just buy another brand  easy to use  but also super easy to hurt yourself  i was going to attach a photo of the burn  but it s pretty ghastly      
80,5.0,                       this electric kettle is awesome for heating water quickly  i find it especially useful for ramen noodles  i heat the water  put the ramen noodles in a bowl  add water  cover it and wait   minutes and there are no dirty pans to clean up  if you live in an area with hard water  it s easy to clean with a small amount of vinegar  pour in the vinegar  wait   minutes  swish the residue with a cloth  empty  and rinse with clear water      
81,4.0,                       i like that the electric kettle does not take up much space on the counter   the kettle is easy to clean  except i would like if the lever to open the lid had a different shape for the thumb to more easily push it all the way   i would like the lid to open up more  also      
82,5.0,                       love the tube shape and minimalist modern design   i also like that there is no visible heating element inside the kettle   double wall promises me not getting burnt anymore like i used to with my old kettle   just a minor reminder   pay attention not to let water go in between the plastic and the stainless part of the lid when you clean before the first use      
83,5.0,                       it does not have the glass window to gauge the water level   you had to peer inside the pot to make sure that you did not go beyond the max fill level   other than that little problem  the product works well and looks good too   yes  i would purchase again from this company      
84,5.0,                       i got this kettle recently and very happy with it  the kettle doesn t get hot so it s safe if you have kids  heats up fast and it is all steel on the inside  the kettle is simple and looks good in our kitchen  great purchase      
85,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this kettle is super fast to heat and is easy to use   it shipped quickly and was nicely packaged   it is easy to clean and came with a packet of descaler   the outside stays cool to the touch      
86,5.0,                       i love how fast this product boils water  my wife starts her day each day by boiling water and some days she cuts it close making it out the door on time  there s no way that s happening with this  we ve never used an electric kettle before  but we re sold now      
87,5.0,                       i have only had this kettle for a short while and i already love it  it boils water so quickly and so quietly  one of my biggest concerns when buying an electric kettle was the ease of cleaning it  as i live in an area with extremely mineralized water  i can fit my whole forearm into the kettle and scrub the bottom of it with ease  no more worrying about limescale ruining my tea  a great purchase for the price  and i love the sleek design  i have the black model   it looks great on my countertop      
88,5.0,                       after reading reviews about this kettle  i decided to order it  ours finally stopped working after many years  so something that not only looked good on the counter but worked great was something that we wanted obviously    so far it s been great  heating up nice and quick  not too loud  safe to the touch not hot  if a child accidently reaches over to touch it  and looks really nice on the counter  because of all the great reviews i m in high hopes this will last years        
89,5.0,                       love this kettle   it s so easy to use  the temperature of the water is perfect  it heats really fast  like two minutes  super easy to clean as well  and the blue color is gorgeous     
90,5.0,                       i love how easy this kettle is  first off  it holds lots of water for many people to fill up their cups and second  just super easy fill and click and done  highly recommended         
91,5.0,                       love this kettle  it heats up fairly fast  the outside of the container gets warm but not hard to touch  the interior is super hot  obviously  but this is to make aware to be careful of the steam i cleaned it a couple times with water vinegar mix per instructions  prior to first use  then i boiled a max pot and made some tea  fantastic the kettle is very easy to use and looks cute      
92,5.0,                       i am in love with my new hadineeon    l   cups electric kettle      w stainless steel interior double wall electric tea kettle  it is so easy to use whether i am having one cup of tea or making a pitcher of iced tea  it s sleek design looks great on my counter so i leave it out  no need to put it away  it was so reasonably priced i m getting one for my girlfriend who just moved into a new home  great housewarming gift  love it      
93,5.0,                       this tea kettle is a quick  effective way to enjoy a cup of tea every morning  we received the item quickly  and began using it right away  my husband and i both love to drink a cup of tea each evening  and this kettle heats the water to the perfect temperature quickly and quietly  we love the design  and it is extremely easy to use and maintain  definitely recommend if you re a tea lover like we are      
94,5.0,                       nice product   we took a chance on this hadineeon product  as we needed to replace our old plastic kettle that was beginning to emit a burning smell   this product does well what it is designed supposed to well  boil water   we felt that the price was right  and so far  we are quite happy with this sharp looking kettle      
95,5.0,                       it looks great on the counter and is the perfect tool to add to your kitchen  it s getting so much use  we heat water often for everything from pasta to hot drinks of all types or when you just need to add some hot water to any recipe highly recommend      
96,5.0,                       the kettle has beautiful color and modern design i like that the water boils very quickly even though it is made of stainless steel  the outside of the kettle is not hot at all when boiling i love it overall      
97,5.0,                       the kettle is easy to use and heats water quickly  we especially like that it s lightweight and is easy to take along for road travel  the entire stainless steel design is nice because it heats water quickly and keeps it warm  we like it a lot and look forward to using it for making hot water for tea      
98,5.0,                       i waited to write this review until after i used it for two weeks   i am happy to report it is the best kettle i have ever used   it heats the water quickly   the outsides stay cool enough to touch   it is easy to poor   no splashing   the flip top lid means that i do not get burnt by the stream anymore   a draw back is it requires a minimum of just over   cups   i always put the minimum into the kettle and pour any unused boiling water onto my sink sponge to sanitize it   so this works for me      
99,5.0,                       this was a fantastic upgrade to my older electric kettle  it has a nice simplistic design that would go well with most homes i tested the boiling speed with my older kettle using the same amount of water  and this one reached boiling faster another feature i like is the double wall  this allows my water to stay hot much longer than other kettles without the double wall      
100,5.0,                       i bought this kettle as my last one had finally stopped working  i m british so we drink a lot of tea and the kettle is an integral part of our kitchen  i loved the color of this kettle  it was easy to fill and it boiled fast    great purchase     
101,5.0,                       love this kettle  i am a tea drinker so it s nice to be able to filly travel mug all of the way without messing with my keurig to do it  works well   heats eater quick      
102,5.0,                       this is the perfect little electric kettle  i love the color  it heats up so fast and it s super easy to use and clean  now we can have tea for two in minutes      
103,5.0,                       one great thing about this kettle is it s large capacity so i can make tea for the whole family in one heating   the water levels are marked inside and at the max level it still heated very quickly   there is a strainer in the pour spout  so i m going to try a large leaf tea directly in the pot   the only improvement needed is the base design  if it were heavier or had suction cups that would be nice   overall a fine colorful kettle      
104,5.0,                       this electric kettle works great  i love that it is cordless once it is lifted off the heating unit  it heats a good amount of water much faster than doing it on my electric stove and the auto shut off is a great safety feature   just what i needed      
105,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          good kettle  it boils water fast  has a beautiful design and is very convenient  i love it  also the kettle is good for a gift too      
106,5.0,                       the water boils so quickly  i barely have time to get a cup  we use this several times a day for making tea  and so far all is excellent  no more hot kettles boiling dry on our gas stove because the whistle didn t work it s got a safe shut off  nice stainless interior wish there were more color choices  but maybe there will be when i need to buy my next one  with a   year warranty it will be awhile      
107,5.0,                       i should have bought this years ago  i use a french press and this kettle is much better than heating water in a pot   it s faster and i m really satisfied      
108,2.0,                       i really loved the look of this kettle  sleek finish and the size was perfect  i wanted to love this product  however  every time i tried to pour hot water is spilled on my hand or all over the place  there is something wrong with the design of the spout      
109,5.0,                       we have being using this electric kettle everyday for more than   months and we are very satisfied with it  it boils water quickly  keeps the exterior cool outside and the water warm inside  and most importantly  it s lined with     stainless steel entirely inside  including the lid  which provides us a safe plastic free boiling condition  the matt surface outside is both stylish and easy to clean    stars

130,5.0,                       got the product today  the bottom of the kettle had some grey spots  tried wiping it with a towel  but no luck  the water heated up very fast as mentioned  but the grey spots still remained disclaimer  i am writing this review as part of a promotionupdate the company sent me a replacement and i can confirm that there were no grey spots this time  it worked perfectly highly recommend this product

133,4.0,                       i bought it to use at work and it s almost perfect  the only thing i would improve is the hinge on the lid looks to be plastic and i m not sure of it s durability and i wish the lid opened more fully  i have small hands so it s no issue for me to clean it really  but it would be nice if it opened to      water heats up quickly and tastes good  cool to touch  and i love it s simplicity      
134,5.0,                       awesome and modern looking electric kettle  love it so far  only down side is it seems a little loud when it starts boiling but maybe i just got used to my ceramic one that was quieter

136,5.0,                       the only issue is sometimes  the boiling takes longer stops because the lid pushed a little bit open very tiny and it seems the heat flew out and can t hit the stop sensor in time  takes longer  i put a bottle on it sometimes when i use it to help close the lid tightly  i love this water kettle  the quality is so good  and the design is so elegant

143,5.0,                       i wanted a cheap  simple way to heat water in my van and this works perfectly  i didn t want to spend the extra money on a stainless unit since it lives in a plastic tub  i would have bought a smaller unit  but those are not an option      
144,4.0,                       this kettle is nice   works fine  however  it is a little smaller than the one i hade before  my main criticism is that there is nothing on the outside to indicate the water level inside

149,5.0,                       the only downside was the pressure needed to open the spout is more difficult for my    yr old mom but she managed fine   she loves it

153,5.0,                       the product functions and looks exactly like the description and image provided  the opening serves as an easy way to clean the product and water milk warms within few minutes  the design of the product is user friendly and elegant  however  it would be nice if the product is available in darker shades  since white gets dirty easily  i would definitely recommend this product

155,5.0,                       i like the seamless constructions and the  easy fill with the marks on the inside of the kettle the large handle which prevents steaming of my hands     
156,5.0,                       kettle came very quickly  it seems very sturdy  and it heated up very fast  so far so good     
157,4.0,                       honestly disappointed how the box shipped  it didn t even come in an amazon box  and the product box was destroyed  however  the product itself is great and works well in my office      
158,5.0,                       i took my time selecting a replacement electric kettle for my very old one   i am very happy with my new hadineeon   it looks fantastic on my counter   it heats effectively and more quietly than my old one   and the water stays warm enough for a second cuppa without reheating   excellent product at a reasonable price

160,5.0,                       i love this electric kettle  i have no complaints at all so far it boils water quickly  is cool to the touch  and has a bigger capacity which i appreciate  not only does it work great  but my favorite part is the look of the kettle  it has a modern design and i love the pop of color the green kettle adds to my kitchen

162,4.0,                       i absolutely love this kettle  i have been wanting a new one so long and i never liked the ones that were a clear plastic because you can see how dirty and stained they get so fast  this is cute and amazing  the only thing i would note is that you don t want to fill it up the max level because it will over flow and pour out as it boils  but other than that i love it      
163,5.0,                       very elegant design and easy to use as expected from these electric kettles  it feels sturdy and can hold a good amount of water   one minor thing i noticed was the base is a bit light so when you unbox it and the cord is still stiff  it might not lay flat  i did not see any rubber pads on the bottom of it  it s not a big issue because your kettle will still sit fine on it      
164,4.0,                       i only received this product a few days ago but so far everything is great  it heats very fast and its not too loud  the angle of the lid can make it difficult to dry all the way but definitely not too difficult  love it      
165,5.0,                       this product is fantastic   my kids make hot chocolate all the time  and now i don t have to worry about them using the stove      
166,5.0,                       i really like this kettle  i like that the kettle detatches easily from any angle  i can tuck the cord back without making it awkward to to pick up the kettle  it is a little noisy while heating up

169,5.0,                       overall very easy and simple to use  heats up water very quickly and efficiently  the mint looks great in my kitchen and i ve already gotten quite a few compliments  the double wall is great and doesn t allow you to burn yourself  my only con is that the button to open the top lid is a bit tight and hard to open at times  but i can look past that  i would definitely recommend      
170,5.0,                       i love all of my hadineeon products as they are healthy  aesthetically pleasing  and durable  i have two of the glass walled kettles from the company and wanted another one that s simple and black to use at my desk  water comes to a boil quickly and the wide opening makes washing oh so easy

183,5.0,                       works very well and is very nice looking  heats water up super quick      
184,5.0,                       very well made  so far used it four times in two days for my tea and coffee  these hot pots need to clean regularly with citric acid or similar natural product  it has proper instructions how to use it

189,4.0,                       overall  this is a great kettle  it boils quickly and is easy to use  the only issues i ve had so far are that it s quite loud while actively heating and  after the first time i used it  there was immediate scaling on the bottom  i tried their suggested methods of descaling but the spots didn t budge so i ll have to try some other tricks      
190,5.0,                       i like the well placed power switch   the lever toggles easily and has a bright light when powered   the lid flips up    degrees when the top of the handle is depressed  making it very easy to refill  although there s a bit more friction than optimal   i expect this will improve with use      
191,5.0,                       love this pot   i was going to buy a kettle for the stove but liked this option instead   it s easy to use and clean   i just wish there was a way to fill it from my fridge water dispenser to use our filtered water   it s too big to fit there      
192,5.0,                       this is a good electric kettle  it heats the water quickly without any issues  i ve had it for over a month and it s easy to clean and no rust is present  mine does make quite a loud popping noise when heating up but that s not really an issue      
193,5.0,                       this kettle is great  i love how quickly this boils water and i love that the kettle is easy to use  with a press of a button  i have access to hot water in no time  i can even set it and forget it because it automatically turns off  finally  it is a space saver because the cord is coiled at the bottom of the base      
194,2.0,                       this would be a great electric kettle except it is so loud  i m not sure if mine is defective or if this kettle is just especially loud   and it s loud from start to finish  not just when the water starts to boil  i don t even want to use in the morning  which is the only time i would  because i don t want to wake my roommates up      
195,5.0,                       heats quickly  love the auto shut off  easy to clean  love the color too      
196,5.0,                       boils water so fast  i use it for my french press daily      
197,5.0,                       works well and heats up quickly  i really like the large lid making it easy to clean inside  and that there are no plastic parts for the hot water to come into contact with  i only took off one star because it is a bit noisy when heating up and boiling      
198,2.0,                       i ended up returning this without even using it  the lever that you use to turn it on is so incredibly flimsy  it felt like the plastic they use to make disposable flatware  since that is a part that is going to get a lot of use  i didn t feel like it would hold up well  too bad because it s a pretty kettle      
199,5.0,                       exactly what i was looking for heats up quick   perfect for our rv life

202,5.0,                       liked the quick heating and sleek looks  the inside is steel so easy to clean  overall a great product for the price  the only thing missing is a window to see water level from outside  with a cool touch exterior which prevents accidental burn  it s very quick to boil water so saves time      
203,4.0,                       from all the other electric kettles here on amazon it was really hard to choose one  however  when i came across this one it caught my attention  especially because it has good reviews  so far this has exceeded my expectations  it warms up the water at a great temperature and it so easy to use  love it      
204,2.0,                       i wanted to really love this kettle    pretty color  all metal inside and great reviewed heating element  i was looking for a better electrics kettle then my     cheap one from the store i had been using for years  i received this and got only   uses out of it before it quit working  my last use  near the end of the heating cycle  i witnessed bright white flashes i side the base of the kettle  looked like a lighting storm inside it  was very odd  i didn t think much of it because i didn t smell any burnt plastic  metal or view any burn marks anywhere  so my next use  the switch light turned on but no heating cycle started at all  i even tried   different outlets  my guess is the base heating element over charged itself and just quit working  i was seriously bummed  refunded immediately and shipped back to amazon    watch out for the overheating and white flashes  keep your eye on it  even though this is a beautiful kettle  i would not recommend it      
205,5.0,                       i love this kettle  it heats up really fast and clicks off when it s done      
206,5.0,                       i m a heavy pot user  so lumps of chlorine quickly build up on the bottom of the pot  however  if you add lemon or vinegar and boil the water  the chlorine lumps will come off and it will be clean  it s been   months since i bought it  but it looks like a new one  it s easy to clean and i like the design very much      
207,5.0,                       just as beautiful in person as it looks in the pictures  i thought it would be small  but it s perfect   i would buy it again and again  so easy to use and keep clean

676,5.0,                       pretty good and nice     
677,4.0,                       heats up nicely and arrived well packaged  i have used it three times now and my only issue so far is you need to do a slow pour or the seal on the top lifts up a bit and water comes out of the top instead of the spout  it does tell you in the directions to pour slowly  so they do warn you  i am impressed with the thoroughness of the directions for care and maintenance  very easy to clean  i have young children so not having the outside get hot to the touch was a must and having ran it three times now  it will not burn if you touch the outside  the double wall insulation is nice and kept the water hot for about    min on the stand      
678,5.0,                       it s good       
679,5.0,                       love it     
680,5.0,                       nice      
681,3.0,                       this is my first electric kettle so i didn t know what i needed  but i wanted one so i could make tea  i like the look of this kettle  it works fine  it is easy to use  and it s simple to clean  it holds a lot of water  and it requires a lot of water at minimum to use  i m only one person so because of this  i had to boil way more water than i needed to brew my tea  also  i couldn t use the hot water fast enough for my tea before it started going cold  so i am returning this to get a different kettle with a  keep warm  setting      
682,3.0,                       the kettle looks nice and feels sturdy when using  two things to note    if the kettle is filled at or even slightly over the max line then the lid pops up a little  some steam comes out but it may not allow the auto shutoff to kick in    do not pour too fast  the spout doesn t pour well at full tilt and hot water can splash or run down the kettle luckily i had read the comments before purchasing and was aware that these things could happen  otherwise  it seems to be a solid appliance      
683,1.0,                       i ve own multiple electric kettles in my life since i m an avid tea and coffee drinker  this kettle is by far the worst  the outside is made of plastic   not colored ss the way it looks on pic  it takes two hands just to press down to open the lid because of the cheap plastic  very disappointed  looks pretty on my counter but not functional  going back to my old kettle  also not thrilled with the milk frother of the same brand  there are better ones out there     
684,2.0,                       the website gave the impression that the auto shut off switch would work once the water was boiled  but  in fact  there is no such feature  the shut off switch only works when the water is all boiled away  not what we were seeking  we did find one  for the same price  actually slightly cheaper  that did have this feature      
685,4.0,                       i love this how this kettle looks and that it is all stainless steel inside   it s good that there is a boil dry feature  but i kind of wish it stopped boiling automatically after it came to a boil i also like that it does not drip when pouring like my old kettle this kettle arrived only in the manufacturer s packaging and the box was pretty beat up on arrival   thank goodness the kettle stayed in perfect condition      
686,1.0,                       the outer material is cheap plastic   it rocks back and forth and doesn t feel steady on the base  it shakes when the water is boiling  and the lid is crooked   i ll return it if i can find the time      
687,1.0,                       when i got it i thought it with nice color for matching my kitchen appliances this kettle has big capacity and took around   minutes for    l water boiled  i used it constantly about   days but i found that close to the bottom the inside wall rusted  only two days        
688,4.0,                       updated review  feb    a different cs emailed me  solved all the problems  and did it professionally and well  i now have a new kettle  one which is quiet  the new one is fast  the auto shutoff works brilliantly  the old one didn t and i didn t know it was supposed to   that s something hadineeon needs to make clear in the product description   there actually is auto shutoff  both when the water boils and on boil dry kettle turned on with no water in it  it s a beautiful kettle  i chose it because it is attractive  and now that it works well  i m very happy  using it every morning  obviously  the old one was defective  which happens  good cs is worth it s weight in gold to customer relations  as is a company willing to back up it s products                                                        review on feb   i have never used an electric kettle before  and since i loved the look of this  i bought the white one  i could only find one review addressing noise  so i went ahead with the purchase  it is astonishing  it sounds like a small jet engine from the moment i push the  on  lever to the moment i take the kettle off the base  i emailed longlive us   rd party seller   customer service  they asked for a video  so i made one and sent it  along with saying that the power cord gets warm when it s heating water  the first email i got from them was wonderful  they asked for my shipping address so they could send a new kettle  were concerned and polite  i sent the video  and the answer i got back shocked me  they were snide and condescending to quote from their email   the kettle will make noise during the boiling process because the water will produce a lot of bubbles during the boiling process  and the bursting of the bubbles will produce noise  if the kettle is just noisy  this is normal    things  i actually have boiled water a few times during my long life  i know boiling water produces some noise  but not like this does   and why   but it doesn t normally vibrate my kitchen cabinet  nor can i hear it from another room in my house  this kettle makes noise from the moment i push the  on  lever  not just when the water begins to boil  once the water is boiling  it s fairly quiet   thus even the reason given doesn t hold up if hadineeon longlive us knows the kettle is this noisy  why didn t they just say so in the reply to my first email  and why aren t there more reviews saying something about how noisy this kettle is  better yet  why don t they do something about it at this point  i will never buy from this vendor again  and i m sad amazon allows sellers with this attitude on their  rd party platform  the seller  btw  isn t hadineeon  it s longlive us      
689,3.0,                       so i love that this kettle has no coil inside and is well insulated to keep the water hot  however  it is much larger than i expected  almost twice the size of my old kettle which held   l more   and the lid is tricky  it sticks to open and sometimes popped open when the force of the steam was too much  resulting in some steam billowing out and potential for burns all that said   it s very sturdy and well made  easy to clean  and quiet  just wasn t exactly what we were looking for      
690,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          update  jan            i received a second kettle and it has the same auto shutoff defect   the other reviews describing this issue are accurate  the kettle design will not allow for the shutoff after boil feature to work   this is due to the hinge design combined with the shutoff being linked to the lid having to be fully closed  our kettles in the past weren t dependent on the lid being sealed  so not sure why this one requires it  but the   mm gap caused by the less than perfect fit   finish in combination with the steam pressure forcing the lid slightly up  causes a gap that won t allow the auto off function to operate   after   kettles  i m done trying this out and will order a different kettle jan           the design  finish  etc  met expectations  however  the auto off function did not work  the water boiled and continued to boil and never shut off  i ve requested a replacement  if the replacement is of better quality  i ll revise my review      
691,5.0,                       i researched electric  tea kettles  for months and hesitated to even buy one  there are so many of them on amazon   which one to buy     and after all  isn t a tea kettle on the stove or a pyrex glass in the microwave sufficient for heating water  well  yes they are  and i ve used those two things forever  but i ll never go back after owning this hadineeon electric kettle  i was wary about the brand  had never heard of it  but it is the most satisfying piece of equipment in my kitchen these days  heats up so quickly  gives a very satisfying  rumble  as it s heating  and you can hear it begin to boil  seconds later  it s done and turns itself off with a click  heats to the minimum line in about     minutes  and a full max line in about   minutes  i typically add just above the minimum line  which i think is about       oz   and in     minutes  at least twice as fast as a microwave  it s done  it s easy to pour  keeps it s boiling  or near  temperature throughout the pour  fantastic for pour over coffee  and i just love it  i never thought i d enjoy a simple little device more than i do this thing  hope it lasts for many years to come      
692,1.0,                       going to have to return the kettle  i was very excited to use it  but upon opening the box and taking the kettle out you can instantly tell that it s been used  there is some kind of spot it almost looks like food on that inside of the lid  as well as a dent  there is also some kind of dried liquid at the bottom of the kettle  i normally wouldn t mind much but since it s used i m going to have to return it  very sad   sorry if the pictures are great  especially the one of the inside of the lid i couldn t get the camera to focus very well  edit  just showed the kettle to someone else and we realized that it also has a dent at the bottom on one of the sides  not going to buy from this seller or this brand again      
693,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i bought this kettle as a gift for my husband  and it turned out to be a blessing for me as well   initially  i purchased it based on a review that said something to the effect that if apple were going to make an electric kettle  this would be the one   my husband being an apple fan  i took a chance on it   i m glad i did   this is the quickest and easiest way to heat up water   it is faster than the microwave and stovetop  and it is super easy to keep clean   i have had it for about three months and it still looks and works great   at first  i was worried about the cord  which seemed like it didn t want to relax enough to let the base lay flat   after a few days  though  it relaxed and sits very well   another concern was whether i would easily be able to tell when my water is the right temp since it does not have a timer   a few trial and error sessions and i found the perfect amount of time for me  which is about    seconds when filled to minimum   i was pleasantly surprised after a few times that i could determine its readiness based on the pitch of the sound emitting from the kettle   as far as kitchen appliances go  this one is my favorite   it is so simple  lightweight  attractive  and easy to operate   i highly recommend it      
694,4.0,                       i love this electric kettle  it heats the water very quickly  the exterior is always cool to the touch  it isn t too heavy bulky and it has a simple yet beautiful look  the only reason that i gave it   stars instead of   stars is because the lid is slightly misaligned by about     of an inch  it hasn t affected the product in a negative way at all  it just doesn t look as perfect as i d like when you are looking at it up close  even with the slight imperfection i would still purchase the kettle again      
695,4.0,                       this is the first electric kettle i ve ever owned  i ve always used stove kettles  and i really like it  however  within the first   days it developed brown spots on the bottom inside of the kettle     which is odd to me because i always refresh the water every day   maybe i m supposed to let it air dry out every night  when i try to clean it  brown residue from that area comes off like rust but the spots remain  i know it can develop scaling from water but i just didn t think it would happen so soon  and it s only on the bottom     anyways  i enjoy it and how fast it boils the water and am happy with the purchase      
696,5.0,                       really enjoying this electric kettle  the insulation is useful  and the kettle itself is only a little warm to the touch after boiling water  so you can tell the insulation is effective  it turns off properly after water has been fully boiling for   seconds or so      
697,5.0,                       great product      
698,4.0,                       i read all the negative reviews before i purchased this kettle  the pros far outweigh the cons  i use the kettle twice a day  it heats fast and is easy to pour  i have to say i usually only fill it half way for my use  the lid is hard to open to full using the the button  the lid does open wider manually and i have no problem wiping it out  the lid does not open wide enough to turn the kettle upside down to dry   overall i am very happy with this kettle and i would buy it again      
699,5.0,                       i just received this as a gift and i absolutely love it  i drink tea often and having this is so much more convenient than the tea kettle i was using  it was a very thoughtful gift and i plan to be using it all the time      
700,4.0,                       for being so inexpensive  it is a good product  you definitely get what you pay for  and you can tell that it isnt the highest quality product  but so far it works  my only complaint is that there is a hole on the inside of the container and if you fill it too full or are cleaning the inside  water can get into this hole and leak out the outside of the container  i am not sure if this affects anything electrical  so far it hasnt  but the look is sleek and simple  which i like      
701,5.0,                       i like the whole stainless steel internal compartment  i use it to make tea and turkish coffee  reaches the boiling temperature and easy to clean     l is more than enough for family use  the price is very competitive      
702,5.0,                       we absolutely love this product  we love the double insulation wall so the kettle doesn t get hot from the outside and keeps water hot inside  it works really fast too  our water was hot enough in   minute  no more heating up water on stove  this is perfect and fast enough to save up time when we are in rush   this is very easy to use and it s also very convenient  i would highly recommend this product      
703,5.0,                       this kettle is sturdy and well made  it boils quickly and for the price i think you cannot go wrong  it s a great color  the cord length can be tucked away under the base  it has a nice filter near the spout with large holes instead of a mesh that can clog with debris  you can fully reach inside to wipe it clean  the lid is sturdy and the button for opening it is as well  i recommend this kettle  i would give it more stars if it had lights and could play music to turn my kitchen into a dance party      
704,5.0,                       it took me a while to pin down which electric kettle i was going to pull the trigger on  and i ended up going with this hadineeon it has very simple functionality  yet does everything i wanted  boils water very quickly and quietly  interior is spacious and entirely stainless steel like it should be  i have no serious complaints with the kettle and am enjoying it so far      
705,5.0,                       it looks really good  simple but elegant  it s fast to boil water  it s quite easy to clean and use  i would highly recommend you to buy this kettle if you need to find one      
706,5.0,                       this kettle is incredibly easy to use  fill it with water  press a button  and it shuts itself off when the water is boiling  done  maintenance is a breeze because it s super easy to clean and store  if you re looking for a great kettle at a great price then look no further      
707,5.0,                       i used to heat up my water in a pot on the stove  then my sister got me this kettle for christmas and i didn t know what i was missing until using this   it heats up water within a matter of seconds  i love the clean white look and the stainless steel on the inside   i ll always be a kettle user now      
708,5.0,                       this electric tea kettle is great  it is beyond easy to use and heats up the water much quicker than other electric tea kettles i ve used  i chose the sea foam green color and i m obsessed with it  i like to leave mine out on my kitchen counter because i m a big tea drinker and this is such a cute one to keep on display      
709,5.0,                       looking nice  stainless steel lid a designed hole inside  see photo  when water goes it  it leaks out from switch or bottom  i guess it s into the middle of metal inside and plastic outside  i have seen that design on others too lid pops up about   mm in boiling  solving it by putting anything on the lid      
710,4.0,                       i like the white color  very minimalist and clean  the opening is wide to clean  however  like all tea kettle it has calcium buildup  they do give you directions on how to remove it  great for large quantity of hot water quickly      
711,5.0,                       excellent  we have fallen in love with this  it heats up unbelievably quickly   stays hot longer than our experiences with other electric kettles  if we need a reheat it goes so fast  we had no idea this would become an essential kitchen tool  but now we use it many times every day  great product      
712,5.0,                       this thing is beautiful  the white is easy to clean and the design is sleek and sharp      
713,5.0,                       perfect for my french press or making tea  i wish there was a glass viewer but you can tell by sound when the water is hot enough      
714,5.0,                       i bought this for my parents to put in their camper as an easier way to heat water while on the road  they both really like it  and are getting a lot of use from it  it heats up quickly and is easy to use and store  highly recommend      
715,5.0,                       i really like the large capacity of this kettle  it looks nice  effectively and quickly heats up the water  i purchased this particular one because there is no plastic inside the unit      
716,5.0,                       been searching for an electric kettle for a while  finally found the hadineeon  is exactly what i was looking for and works great

718,4.0,                       would have liked a way to see on outside of kettle how much water in the kettle as my last tea kettle showed it do not know how to send a pictue of my electric kettle i ordered from amazon

740,5.0,                       works good        
741,1.0,                       this electric kettle has a major design flaw   the automatic shut off is intermittent and it is due to the fact that the lid does not stay fully closed when the water is boiling   apparently the shut off sensor works only when the lid is fully closed   however  when the water is at full boil  a lot of steam is being generated and the lid is being forced up by the steam   the difference between the lid being fully closed and slightly open due to the force of steam is approximately     mm  the first picture has lid fully closed  the  nd picture with red circle and arrows shows the gap created by steam force    and this amount is enough to cause the auto shut off sensor not to work   if you put something heavy on the lid to keep it closed while the kettle is boiling  it will auto shut off   but what s the point of keeping another object on top of the lid   hence this is a major design flaw additional issues with this kettle   started to see spots  see  rd picture  on the bottom of the kettle  rust and or mineral deposit spots  exactly after the  nd use   instructions say to clean the kettle dry after every single use   sorry  that s a pain in the rear   i don t have to do this to my regular stove kettle   at approximately sea level  where i live   it takes     minutes to boil when filled to the max line   not any faster than on the regular stove top kettle  probably slower    and it is actually pretty loud what s good about this kettle   no plastic parts come in contact with water   it is double walled  so less of a chance to get burned   the white finish is nice  at least when new    full kettle balances well in the hand and you have good pour control  but if you pour fast  it will spill over     the handle is fairly thick and i can see it might not be comfortable for people with small hands it seems that just about all electric kettles these days have one or more significant issues   the ones that are advertised as all metal  read no plastic or silicone touches the water  seem to be made out of inferior stainless steel   i would not mind paying more for a product that is actually well made and has true stainless steel   otherwise  they are all useless because they are pretty much guaranteed to rust   a shame  really   also  it looks like there is only   or   primary manufacturers of these kettles in china that make basically same kettle with slightly different designs for different brands   so they will all have the same problem  regardless of what they are called i obviously returned this back to amazon      
742,2.0,                       there is a coupon for some dollars off for the next purchase if you leave a nice review in the box  in my opinion this is how they get   stars the kettle boils the water but does not shut off  the problem is the top cover does not close tight  if you press on it and hold it while water boils the kettle shuts off  but if you are not there it will keep boiling grabbing the kettle too close to the top can get you burned as well  because the cover does not close tight or maybe there are some cracks overall quality is like a cheap boot leg knock off of a good brand  do not be fooled by nice pictures  the inside metal part is not aligned well with outside plastic  also the holes inside the all metal body are not finished with chamfers  cheap technology  cheap knock off  i am surprised that amazon allows this to be sold in us      
743,1.0,                       update  company tried to pay me a gift card to change my honest review to   stars  so now i am giving them   star instead of the   star originally said my honest review  it sounds like a train running through the kitchen  you literally cannot talk over it  but it boils water and i like the color      
744,3.0,                       works well  nice and big  boils fast  cute color  only thing i really don t like is the handle  it s uncomfortable  that may sound crazy but it s true  the handle is sized for a man a hand which makes it hard on my wrist particularly when it s full and heavy  as a woman i probably wouldn t buy this a second time      
745,4.0,                       i purchased this tea kettle for my son who said it was too large and clunky looking for his counter top  he chose a different one  smaller and green  he never even tried it out  just didn t like the look or feel of it from the get go that doesn t mean it wouldn t be a great buy for someone else   and the one he chose was about     extra      
746,1.0,                       the kettle wobbles on the stand and could easily tip over if lightly brushed by someone even   having water in it tow weigh it down does not make it more stable   if it wasn t for the     shipping return fee i d return   instead its going into the trash      
747,1.0,                       it lasted almost    days and started to leak from the bottom  do not waste your money      
748,5.0,                       for coffee or tea  i used electric kettle for some time   current one worked well as well  but it had   issues and this one resolved both     it s hot when water is hot and by accident  without thinking  i touched it a few times     bottom is wide  but top is narrow  so it was very difficult to clean inside  this kettle has   walls  inside outside   so i can touch outside even when the water is hot inside   also  bottom top is same size and wide enough to put my hand inside to clean inside wall pro      doube walls  so outside is not hot when inside water is hot      wide upper part  so i can clean inside by putting my hands inside     nice looking  modern design  not the old style stainless con  no  con   but as wish list    i d like to have a button to keep hot water hot continuously   my old one had this feature and it s nice sometimes  but it s  asking more      
749,5.0,                       i ve had a few months of experience now with various electric kettles and this i have to say this is not only the easiest one to use  but pleasing on the eyes  to me  an electric kettle should be very straight forward  easy to use  and just work  this kettle by hadineeon does all that  the button to open is simple and direct  the water is hot indicator highly visible  and there is a pleasing  soft click when the lid closes i can t emphasize that click enough  you know when you open the coffee pot and then close it  you have that loud sound of the plastic hitting the glass container   that s unnerving to me  i ve heard that from other electric kettles  but not this one  this one sounds like that satisfying thump when you close the door of a finely engineered car door as far as it s place in the kitchen  this product just blends into your kitchen and sits there quietly  it s an electric kettle right  you don t want it to be attracting too much attention to itself  you want it to be part of your kitchen appliances  ready to use at a moments notice  and then blend back in  this kettle just has that very aesthetically pleasing design anyway  i look up and can t believe i wrote three paragraphs about an electric kettle  but i liked it  you will too      
750,5.0,                       i wanted two kettles  one that you could adjust the temperature and another that is basic just for boiling   i wanted two  because the water where i live is very hard  so i didn t want to constantly clean my variable hadineeon temperature one  that i love  by also boiling tap water to cook with   so i will only use filtered water in the variable  daily use for tea  and tap water in this basic one  irregular use for cooking    this particular model seemed to fit the bill as you can see  this one is larger than my silver one and is not see through   i do not like the aesthetics of this one as much  but this one will just be under my cabinet so it doesn t really matter   this boils a minimum of   l    cups  and a max of    l    cups    my other  which looks smaller  actually boils from     l so it actually holds more   this kettle has a wider opening though  so that is nice   it makes it easier to clean and pour water into   the interior has the minimum and max water lines but does not have measurements marked i tested how long it takes to boil the minimum in both  and they were both consistent at about  m  s with room temp water   this one has a stainless steel food grade container whereas my other one is glass   both kettle materials are much better than plastic  although the steel one may hold the water temperature more since it is double insulated overall  i like this one much less than my other hadineeon kettle with all the bells  whistles  and pretty looks  but at almost half the price  this kettle is perfect for what i want it for  basic consistent boiling with no plastic touching my water from a great brand  so i cannot ding it a star      
751,5.0,                       heats up very quickly and i really like that the exterior stays cool to the touch   also really like how nice it looks in my office   great for having handy to quickly make myself a cup of tea   love it      
752,3.0,                       i have looked high and low for a tea kettle with no plastic that comes into contact with boiling water  i thought i had finally found the perfect solution  and it was a great price  it arrived and was bigger than my previous chef s choice kettle that i d had for years  so i wasn t super crazy about this taking up more space on the counter  but i would have lived with that  but then i boiled a batch of water in it and dumped it out before boiling my first batch of tea water  and after just two boils the bottom of the tea kettle looked like you see in the picture  i waited until it dried and i ran my hand over the spots and my fingers all came out with a light silver gray dust on them  i repeated this several times and my fingers kept coming out of the kettle with silver dust on them  my chef s choice never ever did this  ever  so i m questioning the quality of the steel   knowing i was going to return it  i bought a cuisinart kettle and there is a marked difference in the feel of the stainless steel inside both kettles  this one seemed thinner  the cuisinart did not do the spots silver dust thing after boiling  i still give this kettle   stars because it boiled water fast and was quiet  doesn t get hot on the outside and i love that there s not plastic on the inside at all  but i m not taking my chances with that silver dust in my tea when that never happened with a trusted brand tea kettle  it s going back  if they decide to use better quality steel on the inside this would definitely be my kettle of choice      
753,5.0,                       one of the best kettle i ever had  it quickly boils and even came with a pack of tea stain cleaner just in case if you make tea inside it it is cool to touch and easy to clean  it s top opens wide so it s way easy to wash it i recommend it      
754,5.0,                       i feel this electric kettle is more safer as this the main reason why we bought it  it heats the water very fast without overheating the kettle  it s very safe to touch without burning your hands      
755,5.0,                       i am so very happy with this little kettle my last kettle had a very small opening to get the water in   this one is wonderful  it opens up big time and is very easy to fill  plus the marking on the inside make it easy to know where the maximum fill line is  granted  it does not have individual cup markings  but since i make a pot of tea at a time  individual cup size is irrelevant for me  i do like that the on knob lights up  at first i was annoyed that the on knob was not metal  but when the light went on  oh  that s when i changed my mind let s talk about how fast it heats water  whoa  that was a surprise  hand s down faster than my other kettle   which is now out in my studio to heat water for throwing on my wheel   it is quick  and i can touch the outside of the kettle and not burn myself  which is one of my greatest feats  i seem to be a magnet for burns  now  i did pour the water a little too fast into the tea pot and the water splashed out and landed on my foot  but if i had been paying attention  that would not have happened  all in all i am quite happy with this kettle and also got the goose neck kettle for my hubby s pour overs  he loves it      
756,3.0,                       i like the way this pot looks and the double layer design   the interior is all metal and does not have any plastic parts in contact with the water   it boils fast  about     minutes to heat up a full pot however  the automatic shutoff didn t work quite right for me i found that when the water boils  the lid pops up a bit and forms a small gap  and so the steam tube does not detect the pressure change and shut off the boil you can fix it by weighting done the lid with a coffee cup or a rock or or maybe a book of poetry you no longer have use for the other problem is the base is very light and the cord  which is fairly heavy duty  lifts the base off the counter unless you weigh it down with something      
757,5.0,                       very nice look  water heat up quickly  very nice material  very happy with the product  and would definitely recommend     
758,5.0,                       we have been buying electric kettles for about    years now and this product is a great look and function for the price   it is double walled so the water heats really quickly and keeps the water hot quite a long time   it s a nice looking kettle and while you can t see the water level from the outside  the top opens wide so it is easy to view   the price is about half of what i paid for my last kettle   so overall  i recommend this product as a great buy   i have a number of other products from this company and find them to function well and be priced just right      
759,4.0,                       overall i like the kettle but i have not had it long    i have a milk frother by the same company and i love it so i have high hopes for this kettle   i like the design  i don t love the color   i don t hate it but i don t love it   the kettle is super easy to use as expected   i followed the recommendation to boil water in it twice and dump it before the first use   both times i filled it halfway between the min and max fill lines   it boiled the water in under   minutes   the kettle stays cool to the touch  the thing i m  not thrilled about i posted a picture of the inside of the kettle after the first use   there are small dots now around most of the bottom   i let the kettle cool completely for about    minutes before using it again to see if they went away and they did not   i did not notice them there before i used it the first time so i m not sure why it showed up from the heating device   i don t think it will impact the water but i m not sure at this point overall i like it right now   i will have to spend more time using it to really know for sure      
760,5.0,                       i received this kettle yesterday and i absolutely love it  it looks really nice on my counter top and it does an amazing job  i am a morning tea drinker and up till now i had been boiling my water in the microwave  as an avid tea enthusiast  that s a big no no  i decided to take the plunge and order a kettle  of course  i did my research and found that this one hit all the marks and had great reviews  as suggested by other reviewers  i ran   cycles of water through the kettle to season it and bingo   it was perfection  having tea from a tea pot rather than the microwave makes a huge difference in the flavor  i will warn you  the water is hot  hot  hot so be careful  i highly recommend this product      
761,5.0,                       this is an overall nice kettle  the design is pleasing with truly all stainless steel interior  it is not too heavy and is comfortable to pour  it heats up as fast as my other electric kettle so no complaints there  the light indicator at the bottom of the handle works well and is easy to turn on and off  my product did have some streaks  scratches and signs of use when delivered  perhaps this was due to testing at the factory since the manual does state each kettle is tested by boiling water  feels like a good addition to the kitchen  the company did reach out to me and did their best to help me out      
762,5.0,                       this kettle is big  i was not expecting it to be so big but it is a nice feature   i fill it to the max line and don t have to refill the kettle as often as smaller kettles  it boils quickly   the interior is steel but the exterior is a form of plastic  the double layer keeps the inside hot and the outside cool to the touch  the lid sits firmly shut until it is released by the lever  i recommend this kettle      
763,5.0,                       i purchased this electric kettle understanding that i would receive reimbursement for this product if i left a positive review   i am normally hesitant to agree to such an arrangement and was prepared to pay for this if i did not find it measured up i have used the kettle  it appears well designed   it is very attractive  i would have preferred a black color rather than white  it works exactly as described after using this product i have no complaints or concerns  it is an excellent product at a reasonable price      
764,5.0,                       this kettle works great and a bonus is that it looks really good   i love the feature that you can wrap the cord underneath   i hate having extra cords out on the kitchen counter   i use an electric kettle at least once every day for my chai   here in arizona  the water is full of minerals   even though i have a water filter  the salts build up on the inside of the kettle so i have to clean it every few days and it s gross   the electric kettles i ve had in the past have metal tubing on the inside  which is basically impossible to clean around   for me  the look of this one is great but the best feature is how easy it is to clean   i m really glad i switched to this one   this is the  nd thing i ve bought from hadineeon and i m happy with their products      
765,5.0,                       i use this electric kettle to make tea and it does just what i want it to  the outside appearance is attractive enough and the inside is stainless steel with a  max  and  min  water line on the inside  it heats the water fairly quickly  taking just a few minutes to heat about    oz of water  overall i m happy with this product as it does everything i expected it to  note  i don t let the water get to a full boil where the kettle turns itself off  instead  i keep the lid open while heating and i watch until the right amount of steam starts coming up and then i take it off       
766,5.0,                       i absolutely love this thing  heats up in an instant and i can grab it immediately without burning my hands on the sides  no more waiting to hear the traditional stovetop kettle whistle obnoxiously and having to go back and forth every time i want another cup of tea  not to mention  this isn t just great for tea  i ve made tea  hot cocoa  instant coffee  pot noodles  miso soup  it s definitely going to come in handy when i m sick and don t want to spread my germs all around the house      
767,5.0,                       i am happy with my new stainless steel kettle   this kettle reminds me of a kettle my grandmother had when inwas growing up  although i prefer the glass kettle  the stainless steel option is nice because the kettle is not hot to the touch  thus it is safer   i amusing the stainless steel kettle in an efficiency unit with limited kitchen space   i use the kettle to boil water for drinking and making tea   overall  i am satisfied with the product and customer service for hadineeon      
768,5.0,                       we drink a lot of tea and also make pickles so i need hot water fast  i can heat a good amount of water quickly  i conducted a test from start to finish to see how long it would take to heat up a full container of water  it took   minutes and    seconds to get hot water  not bad at all  it turns off once it gets hot  plus i love that it s stainless steel so the water stays hot for a while which is really helpful  it does exactly what the product states  if you are looking for an electric kettle pot  this one checked off all the boxes      
769,4.0,                       this electric kettle was first sent to me as a gift  i ruined the first kettle by mistakenly puttingon the stove burner  i was glad i could order another one as it is a very good kettle  the water heats very fast  i had my son put a special note on the top of the kettle so i would remember not to put it on the stove again  my tea tastes very good when i use the heated water from this kettle      
770,5.0,                       this is my first ever electric kettle  i have always used the stove top kettles  and i should of bought one sooner it is easy to use and heats water quickly   so far i am enjoying it and look forward to trying more from this brand  all of their products are well made  it only took a minute for mine to boil the water  at halfway full   shipping only took   days and overall am very happy with my purchase  will update if i need to      
771,5.0,                       this item is right up my alley  functionable  easy to use  and works quickly  in just a few minutes  you will get piping hot water perfect for tea or whatever other hot drink you want to make  on top of how well it works  it is also pretty and sleek and looks great on any countertop  i have been very happy with every item purchased from this company  they are affordable and high quality      
772,5.0,                       i love this  this electric kettle is fast and efficient  it safely and quickly heats up a lot of water and is perfect for my hot tea habit  it s nice that i don t have to have the noice of the microwave or the hassle of the stovetop  it stays warm for quite a while too  since getting this a few weeks ago i ve used it multiple times a day and am thrilled  i d highly recommend this      
773,4.0,                       i d give it a     to date  i spent a long time reviewing electric kettles and finally settled on this one  i like that it has a wide opening at the top  a larger lever to turn on the kettle  and a stainless interior  and am overall happy with it  the only thing i am adjusting to is the push opening on top that requires quite a bit more pressure than my previous kettle      
774,5.0,                       super easy to use  you just pour water to the max line and turn it on  it turns off by itself when it s done boiling  it starts boiling within the first couple of minutes but i would say takes about   mins total to shut off  if you re impatient you can probably have very hot water   mins in  either way  set it and forget it and you ll have hot water pretty quickly      
775,5.0,                       some things i love about this electric kettle  the look of this new model    it looks great sitting on my countertop  the double insulation keeps the water warmer longer than the glass kettle versions and also seems to heat up more quickly  less plastic so less harmful chemicals potentially leaching into my water  there s no window for me to see how much water is in the kettle but it s not a big deal for me since i always put in fresh water  although the measurements are not labeled inside the kettle  the min line is    liters and max line is     liters  the spout is more rounded so there can be drips after pouring water from the kettle but if you put slowly  it s not an issue  overall  very satisfied with my purchase      
776,5.0,                       this kettle is really well designed  it looks modern  and is easy to use  it heats water fast  and quietly  and doesn t have a lot of unnecessary features  it s easy to clean  i actually just dump out the unused water and wipe it dry  the stainless steel stays shiny and doesn t get stains of mineral spots  nice product  recommended      
777,5.0,                       what a beautiful hot water kettle  this replaces an old metal one we had with a faulty switch  and wow is it a step up from the cheapo one  gorgeous  great design  heats water as it should  easy to use and won t burn us if we accidently touch the sides  i expect we ll enjoy this bad boy for many many years to come      
778,5.0,                       wow i just added the cold water from refrigerator which is where we get filtered water from and our gas stove take a long time to boil or even eat water we always relied on warming a glass at a time in microwave but this kettle works like a charm within less than   mins i got boiled water         pretty impressive  definitely going to use in winters a lot  will update review if anything changes      
779,4.0,                       the electric kettle works well and the color is very pretty   its easy to use and makes the water hot very quickly   the first pot we received leaked water all over  we returned the pot and received a replacement right away   the new one works great   thanks   we use it for tea and hot chocolate and when the there is any need for hot water      
780,5.0,                       easy to use and clean  i like that this electric tea kettle has an automatic shut off when water boils  it is attractive and functional  i used to boil water in the microwave like many others  water boils quickly in this kettle  there are minimum and maximum markings inside so you easily know how much water you can fill  great size  highly recommend      
781,5.0,                       i love how quickly this hadineeon    cup electric kettle heats water   i ve never owned an electric kettle before but would highly recommend this one   the opening on top is large enough to fit my hand so cleaning is easy  just empty the water you don t use  let it cool down and wipe dry   the interior is completely stainless steel  no plastic and the outside is cool to touch   have to go now  my cinnamon herbal tea is waiting      
782,5.0,                       this was a christmas gift for my sister  who was replacing a worn out kettle of a different brand   she loves the looks of this one so much that she leaves it on her counter instead of trying to hide it like she did her old one   i works great and it s pretty  too   highly recommend      
783,5.0,                       i bought a kettle with the hopes of abandoning my dependence on a microwave to make tea and even just have hot water for porridge  this was the way to go  easy to clean  set up  and fits anywhere in my kitchen space  i m a fan of the large capacity  i used it to make hot water for matcha and was delighted at the result      
784,5.0,                       i love this kettle and sleek design  being a  tea drinker  i need the water hot and this kettle brings the water to a rolling boil in seconds  much better than using my microwave that  heats the cup as well as the water and i m always burning my hand  i would highly recommend this product      
785,5.0,                       we had the gooseneck kettle before  which we really liked except for the small size of the container  thus  we got this large one that holds a lot more water  for those who are trying to avoid the plastics  look no further  even the inner lid is covered with stainless steel  the double wall design helps to maintain the heat a little bit better than the single wall found in the gooseneck kettle  will see if this out lives last my previous kettle which works for almost  yrs      
786,5.0,                       i love it no more waiting for a whistling kettle with this kettle i can walk away and if it reaches a boil and i don t catch it it shuts off that s nice if you get busy and forgot you even had it on also it s quick to heat easy to keep clean all in all a great purchase for me      
787,5.0,                       simple sleek design  only one button  heats up max capacity cold water in about   mins and    secs  light weight  after boiling holds the heat well for later use  nice matte black color  looks great in my kitchen  good  steady pour  when opening lid  it opens half way so hot steam doesn t hit you in the face      
788,4.0,                       it is a good water kettle for  heating up water fast  but  it is a bit clumsy to use because it is large and you can t see the water level we returned it and purchased a glass kettle  which does not clean up as easy but is much easier to pour      
789,5.0,                       this kettle looks very nice  unlike many others it will be cool even filled full of hot water  shut off feature works just in time   no hot water contact with plastic at all since it is all steel inside   the only deficiency i found is missing water level indicator   but for such price it is very good kettle      
790,5.0,                       looks good and heats fast  holds a good amount of water too   only complaint is the lid doesn t open far enough for my big hands to clean it easily but it s fine for my wife  doesn t whistle when it s done heating    disclosure   i received this product free in exchange for my honest review      
791,5.0,                       i am very impressed with the heating time of this kettle   within two minutes the water is boiling hot   very easy to use   i also like the simple to use power base   the design is very nice as well and is fine to have on our kitchen counter right next to our hadineeon milk frother      
792,5.0,                       great product  this kettle has the ability to hold a lot of water  very impressed with how quickly it heats up  super easy  super fast  it s the second product i have bought from this company   they are reputable and carry good products at fair prices      
793,4.0,                       the kettle heats water very efficiently   the lid is large and the kettle easy to fill   the cord wraps conveniently around the heating element for easy storage   the one reservation i have  i cannot easily see the marks for measuring the water within the kettle      
794,5.0,                       very fast heating  probably within     minutes  normal water becomes pretty hot  appropriate for the tea  it is little lighter than the glass one  which i own too  this is for making tea or boiling milk  i love it and recommend to others      
795,5.0,                       it works so good  fast and stays warm a very long time  always wanted one so glad i found this one  it looks good on your counter as well   i really truly recommend this kettle you will be very pleased with the way it works      
796,5.0,                       i am very impressed with this kettle  i bought it strictly from reading reviews after another brand kettle had failed  it s quiet  cool to the touch and can boil a half gallon at a time  it has a nice design  all one piece      
797,5.0,                       purchased this kettle for a quick heat up time and a wide opening for cleaning  this kettle fits both of these requirements  also the automatic shut off is a plus  looks sleek and clean sitting on the counter and will be used to make tea and cocoa this winter  gifting another as a christmas present      
798,5.0,                       great kettle  i wanted something big enough to boil water for the whole family in one sitting without having to do multiple batches  this is perfect for that  very stylish too  so i like how it looks on my countertop      
799,5.0,                       this was a replacement for a stainless kettle that stopped working  it works very well  water is so hot i have to add ice to drink tea immediately i looked over all of the kettles available  as i not only wanted one that worked well  i wanted one that looked modern and blended in with my new white kitchen  the coffee tea area just stood out too much with the stainless coffee maker  frothed  and kettle  not to mention dealing with the unsightly cords  the cord of the kettle winds up under the base which hides most of it when not in use      
800,5.0,                       a great feature of this electric kettle is that the outside is cool to touch immediately after boiling  no more burnt knuckles   also  there is a place on the bottom of the warmer to wrap the cord definitely a very nice product      
801,5.0,                       this kettle is definitely worth the money  it has a large capacity and because of the double wall it s not hot to the touch when water is heated up  the bonus part is the look and color is very sleek      
802,5.0,                       this kettle is very safe  easy to use  and elegant in appearance  for the last several years i have used the microwave to boil water  i ve grown tired of doing this and also find it is hazardous  a few times i have accidentally tipped the water out when i removing the boiled water  so glad i invested the money in this product  it s covered by an excellent    year warranty  great price  great kettle

921,5.0,                       great kettle  stainless steel insides are perfect for boiling water  heats very quickly  the only negative i have is the lid doesn t open all the way so it s hard to clean  otherwise worth the money

930,5.0,                       bought my first one for my kitchen  works perfectly  ended up buying a second one for my room  tea for days  excellent product and works perfectly  highly recommend      
931,4.0,                       beautiful design  it works    but slow  it takes more than average to get a volume of water to come to boil than other  less beautiful water boilers  but it again  it does its job      
932,5.0,                       great we have been enjoying a hot cup of tea before bedtime for a few months now  boiling water on the stove takes forever and it s impractical to pour out of a pot  this electric kettle solved all the issues  the water for two cups heats up while i get mugs and tea bags ready      
933,5.0,                       beautiful to look at   noisy when heating   instructions for maintenance are very fiddly   water minerals can rust the stainless steel interior   according to the user manual       
934,5.0,                       i ve purchased a few electric kettles over the years and this is definitely one of the top ones for the price  it s aesthetically pleasing with a matte white finish  and has a large capacity of    liters  i like that it s tall  instead of short and stumpy as another one that i have  the matte white makes it look clean and more expensive than it actually is  it heats up the full    l in just a few minutes  and the water remains pretty hot inside the kettle even an hour later  i drink hot warm water at my desk all day long at work and love everything about this kettle  i have no cons for this and recommend           
935,5.0,                       i ll start by saying don t buy this kettle  just dont  read further if you want to know why  my first one came damaged  but amazon quickly replaced it  the hinge was stiff and didn t open completely  i thought it felt like good enough quality for the price  it s super cute  i was wrong  it s crap  i read other reviews saying how easily it rusts so i instructed my family to never leave water sitting in it  we are good about pouring out any extra water  we leave the lid open to dry it out  and usually use a hand towel to dry it  this ruins the purpose of this thing being convienent  it gets worse though  my daughter accidently left water sitting in it overnight  i came down the next morning to make tea and there were rust spots all over the bottom of the kettle  one night of water sitting in it and it rusted    i have had another kettle for   years that i have left water sitting in it for days on end and it never rusted  even with all our precautions with this kettle and keeping it super clean and dry it still got ruined  it s a piece of crap  i read reviews constantly to be sure before i buy something  sometimes i ignore the few bad ones  don t make the same mistake as me  save your money and go elsewhere  these guys have great reviews because they give you a free product to leave them reviews  you ll get the same offer on a piece of paper with your product  i want my money back  i have dishonest companies  learn from our mistake      
936,5.0,                       ordered to use in our travel trailer and love the sleek look  it s a full size  like a coffee maker  but stores easily when not in use  lightweight but durable and easy to clean  heats water quickly  highly recommend      
937,5.0,                       i had been researching electric kettles for weeks and for some reason i hadn t committed to purchasing one of the many  many choices on amazon  i wanted one with good reviews but not spend     or more  i found this kettle and the price is right and had prime shipping i ve been enjoying using the kettle for two months now  it heats the water quickly and i like how it looks in my kitchen  i really just wanted a good  practical electric kettle and this fit the bill great  i also love that the price is quite reasonable  if you want a solid kettle  this is a good choice      
938,5.0,                       this little water heater really works  it heats up water very quickly and it stays hot for a long time in the container  i also love that i can wind up the cord under the base to save room in my cabinet      
939,5.0,                       i replaced my tea kettle for the hadieeon and use it everyday   i even use it to clean out dirty dishes as it heats up quickly   quality      
940,5.0,                       tea kettle has a stainless steel on the inside and has a sturdy plastic shell on the outside   i like that it has a electric heating plate that separates from the kettle  once the water boils i can safely remove the kettle from the plate and set it on the counter   i would recommend this kettle because it is safe sturdy and attractive      
941,5.0,                       its much larger than my former electric kettle  water is very hot  the first few days it was very quiet but now it s really loud   i don t mind though  it seems very unstable on the platform but it locks in there and does its job so all is well      
942,5.0,                       it is a classy looking kettle and heats quickly and efficiently  a wonderful gift for anyone  it s an excellent product and i highly recommend it      
943,4.0,                       this heats fairly quickly and is easy to clean  i would give a star except for one glitch  you can not open the top with the finger push button  you have to pry it open with your fingers which leaves a strong risk of a steam burn      
944,5.0,                       i like that this kettle heats faster than my previous one  it s construction makes it easy to travel with too  the only issue i have is that the plastic base is very light  it doesn t stay put well without the kettle on it  mine dropped off my counter and chipped an edge  but still works fine  i just need to use a socket not on an edge next time  it looks great and is super easy to use  love the steel interior for keeping water hot      
945,5.0,                       love this electric kettle and so does my daughter   it heats up faster than a microwave      
946,5.0,                       love that this kettle heats up quick and has easy clean up      
947,5.0,                       very happy with this electric kettle  easy to use and my   grandkids are safer with this than with boiling water in a tea kettle on the stove  only problem is that there s an on switch at the bottom edge  so you have to be sure no one sets something on top of the switch like a paper towel holder      
948,5.0,                       one of the best electric kettle out there      
949,5.0,                       i love this kettle  it is very convenient  it is very easy to clean and easy to use   i have burnt many tea kettles because i am a multi tasker   this is longer a problem because it automatically shuts off and keeps the water hot for a bit so i don t have to reheat      
950,5.0,                       very attractive electric kettle  boils water fast and has auto shut off for safety  very happy with it      
951,1.0,                       it s is extremely cheap  plastic parts wobble and it feels like it will fell apart soon  doesn t stay stable in the heating pad  disappointed plus came without any box  the seller couldn t even use scotch tape      
952,4.0,                       i really appreciate this teapot  it is pretty and boils h o in just a few minutes  it is easy to clean and no plastic touches my water   i gave it a   because i feel that it doesn t keep the water in the pot  hot  for that long  there is no keep warm option  but i can live with having to press the button and waiting another   minutes    would recommend      
953,1.0,                       the touch stops working after one month  product is really good to make latte  mocha    but it only lasts for one month and stop working one day after the returning date      
954,5.0,                       it easier to clean and easy to use

956,5.0,                       i love the style of this kettle  simple and sleek  looks great on my counter  although it is very simple to use  the lid doesn t always shut tight so when it s boiling  it won t auto shut off right away  occasionally i had to manually turn it off  other than that i love it

958,5.0,                       didn t like the base at first but after a day or two it say nice and flat   beautiful color      
959,5.0,                       simple design  easy to use  decent quality for the price  charging stand and lid is a little flimsy but not problematic at this time  spout pours well without dribbling  holds a large amount but kettle is light so not too heavy to pick up  was selected because of the all stainless interior     
960,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this is the easiest piece of kitchen appliance i have ever got  my   yr old and  yr old use it for hot cocoa in the morning  i got this for my birthday for my kids to use to make my mornings a little easier   they love it  we use it every single morning  i use it some evenings for hot tea      its so easy to wash  and easy to use  i keep it plugged in and full for my kids to use each morning  best buy ever  no regrets  pricing is good  and product is awesome

964,3.0,                       pros  this works great it s not easy to tell when the water is done as it is very quiet which i guess is great cons  the cord is way too short and the bottom piece is very flimsy as if it was printed from a  d printer  it was very hard to keep it on the counter because its too light and went stay in place
