0,3.0,                       i actually needed a green shirt for a photography session  and the hue that was needed were some of the selection of this brand  upon buying the shirt  and used it for the session the quality was average at best  the thin nature of the shirt meant that with repeated washing or wear it would tear  i m somewhat used to more  thicker  shirts as i wouldn t buy this thin style of shirt again      
1,1.0,                       since the stay at home deal some of us have gained a little weight  so  to keep up with my body type i purchased a bunch of  gray g      t  shirts  these gray shirts looked and fit great even after machine washing  i decided to buy a bunch of white g      t  shirts to tie dye  the gildan white g     aren t made like the gray g      t  shirts   the gray were a heavier grade cotton  with better stitching et cetera   so  i thought that i d get some of the same type in white   i was extremely disappointed in the quality of the shirts that i received  not only were they of cheaper quality cotton  synthetic thread was used to stitch to shirt which shows up like a spot light  when tie dyed because  of course  synthetic thread will not take up procion mx dye   if the shirt description states      cotton the shirt should be      cotton  otherwise the description should state that the shirt stitching is synthetic and not      cotton  there should be no difference in quality of materials between the   colors of shirts but there was  the difference in a tie dye between a quality white shirt and the gilda g     is night and day  i feel  sullied and unclean  for having used the white g      t  shirts  one can be sure that i will no longer use the gildan product even to clean the floor so  no i m not happy with this product at all  each time i wear one of these shirts i ll be reminded of my disappointment when i see the sleeve  neck and tail stitching      
2,5.0,                       i liked them but still felt some synthetic feeling  otherwise they re great overall  i tend to notice when something isn t cotton made  it starts to give a distinct odor so i know these are real cotton      
3,5.0,                       good quality cotton shirt very comfortable and fresh i like the red color i have washed and the size remains the same i like its softness i use them for daily use to do exercises i also bought for my husband and i chose the sizes small and medium and i fit perfectly     
4,4.0,                       when these arrived they seemed awfully stiff   after washing some of the stiffness disappeared but some remains after     washings   happily they don t feel stiff scratchy once on   the fabric is heavier than i expected so they are warmer than expected  i just have to remember not to use them on a warm day      
5,4.0,                       one of the shirts arrived a little dirty looking for some reason but i washed them before wearing  they are dark black and didn t fade or shrink in the wash on both delicate normal cycles with cold water  i was them often  the fabric is nice and durable  i m sure they ll last me awhile i am a female but i prefer men s tshirts  in women s and unisex shirts i m a medium size so i ordered a small  they fit me pretty snug on the arms  i have big arms   but the rest of the shirt fit okay  i will order a medium next time i would say they are pretty good quality for the price  would buy again  i suggest ordering your unisex shirt size      
6,3.0,                       they are not a solid color    whatever dye that was used it made them spotty looking   also  make sure you wash before you wear because the dye will run   i won t be purchasing these again      
7,4.0,                       washed it once just a tad bit if shrinkage  i ll know after a few more washes  all i can say is i m happy i been searching for plain shirts for years  stumbled across reviews online saying these shirts were good  i enjoy them  i do sweat alot when working though and the sweat really feels weird when it s on the shirt  the sleeve length is perfect  match happier  don t buy fruit of the loom or hanes  these are so much better      
8,1.0,                       t shirt over sized when i opened packagequality a little suspect  there are many types of t shirts offered from gildan and not all have the same quality  i hope to one day order shirts and have it be consistently available     
9,5.0,                       i ordered these two red and green in original order  over a month later  i didn t get them  i spoke directly to company and i was all fixed up with what i wanted  guess those weren t my color  great fit and great cs     
10,1.0,                       worth it to spend a little extra money and get a better  higher quality brand from a reputable seller  at first the shirt seems fine  just really thin  after a few cycles through a washer dryer the quality becomes unbelievably terrible  the shirts are cheaply manufactured from cheap materials      
11,5.0,                       the t shirts i normally order went way up in price so decided to give these a shot   i bought a two pack  black   xl   this is a t shirt that fits well   material quality is excellent   heavy  but not too heavy of material   i did wait to write a review until i washed them one time   i wanted to make sure they did not shrink up too much   they fit perfect after a wash as well  i will be buying more today   highly recommended      
12,5.0,                       it s great to find  x sturdily made t shirts for my husband because he requires ones that are true to size and are durable   these fit and his favorite shades of blue are mostly always available in his size   i sneaked these new shirts among his main shirt rotation as a gift and he put one on  realized it was new  and kept admiring it      
13,4.0,                       shirt is well constructed and comfortable except for one issue which is that it is a very heavy grade of fabric and is uncomfortable to wear in warm   hot weather  much too thick for my comfort level but very well constructed     
14,3.0,                       headline says it all  if you re looking for a cheap shirt to work in or exercise in or use  like me  to print something on for fun  it was a white elephant gift   then this is your shirt  it s not soft  it s moderately thick and heavy  the crew neck is a little too high for my taste  it served its purpose  but it s not a shirt i d ever recommend for wearing  it s just a cheap shirt      stars isn t because it s bad  just because it s quite average  it doesn t try to sell itself for anything more than it is  or anything less      
15,3.0,                       i didn t expect anything amazing given the price  and  this lived up to my expectation   it s a decent  basict shirt  however   they run small  i would recommend ordering one size larger than what you typically wear         update   when i wrote my initial review  i had not tried on all the t shirts   some were a bit small  others were very small   definitely would not put any of them in the dryer   a lesson in   you get what you pay for    would not recommend purchasing these      
16,2.0,                       these t s were too short for my husband to wear on his long torso  also  the cotton was scratchy  not soft  which he would have been able to live with if they fit  but in this case it was just adding insult to injury  because i put them in a box under the christmas tree  we didn t discover the fit issue until after i was outside the return window  we just had to give them away  ugh  if you order  size up      
17,2.0,                       i was expecting these t shirts to be a lot softer but they weren t and also they run a bit too small for their size  returning     
18,3.0,                       while i really like these shirts  i have   of the royal blue and   navy  the arms basically give you wings  there is way too much room in the armpit  also  the navy shirts somehow get bleached by my silver necklace   wore two of them once but now they are ruined  so upset      
19,2.0,                       as a t shirt to wear casually  the shirts are fine   however  they do not work well under a button up shirt as the sleeves are too long   i ve bought gilden before in a size larger and they shrank just the right amount   the current ones do not shrink as the others did   i have to buy as size larger to allow for shrinkage to get just the right size and these didn t do that      
20,4.0,                       these fit true to size how ever the grey ones i ordered were rather stiff and itchy at first  after two rounds in the washer they are perfect now  great for the low price      
21,4.0,                       i ordered two of the dark purple tshirts  they came within   or   days  quality was good  they fit exactly as expected   i did wash my husbands in hot water and dried hot because they came in a   pack and he wears a size smaller than me  so i wanted to shrink his up a bit   it did bleed some  so when i wash  mine i will wash in cold and hang dry      
22,5.0,                       i recommend these t shirts  i am      and       i do not like tight t shirts so i bought a large  i am happy with it  although i am sure that a medium would have worked i will compare the gilden t shirt with the fruit of the loom platinum that you will see at wal mart pro   the gilden appears to be better built and the sizing was consistent on the two t shirts that came in the package  the neck was smaller  without being tight  i am guessing that fabric around the neck will not wrinkle up  unlike many fruit of the looms  there were no loose threads  unlike many fruit of the loom   gilden has heavier fabric  which is better most of the year where i live  east tennessee   i do not want a see through t shirt  also  no one who sees me would want me wearing a see through t shirt con   the fruit of the loom is much softer after a first washing  i washed the gildan t shirt in warm water with two minutes in the dryer on energy saving  gilden has a tag which is not as good as fruit of the loom  no tag   i cut the tag out without any problem and now the gilden is fine  gilden is slightly more expensive but both brands are inexpensive neutral   neither brand bleeds color  i have only washed the gilden one time so i do not know whether it will fade  my fruit of the loom t shirts fade but it takes many washes for that to occur i hope that this review is helpful to you update   june          the gildan t shirts that i bought previously held up reasonably well for the money  they did not shrink  they did not fade  however  they did not get softer   washing was on warm and drying was three minutes on energy saver i purchased some more gildans to replace the ones that wore out   i have not washed them yet  i bought galapagos blue and orange in large size  both are      cotton  the necks seem smaller than the fruit of the loom platinums that i own  i like that because i have a small head so i don t need a big neck  i am still      and     pounds and the large is comfortable for me  a medium would probably fit me better  however   i like a looser fitting t shirt i will let you know how well the new gildans do after washing in warm water and drying for three minutes on energy saving heat notably  i have some old fruit of the loom t shirts  like ten years or more  which are reasonably thick  reasonably soft  and still going strong after all this time  i wish that i had bought more of them june            after one wash in warm water and three minutes in the dryer  the new gildans did not shrink or fade  also  the necks did not stretch  however  the t shirts did not become softer  therefore  three out of the four results were good and one result was neutral september            after multiple washings in warm water and three minutes in the dryer on  energy saving   the verdict is the same  good   the t shirts did not shrink or fade and the necks did not stretch  bad   the t shirts did not get any softer  one other note   the tags on the t shirts would be very annoying to wear so i cut the tags out november            the first thing to go bad on these t shirts has been that the necks have stretched slightly  the stretching was not terrible but it is noticeable  at least to me   nevertheless  i would give the t shirts     stars  they do seem a little but softer or maybe i am getting more used to them   they do not feel scratchy to me  they have not faded or shrunk  i definitely like them much better than the ultra thin fruit of the loom platinum november             i have purchased only large size gildan t shirts  i am very happy that the sizing has been very consistent  gildan has much better quality control than fruit of the loom march            i have revised the rating to a five stars  the t shirts have gotten soft after probably         washings  the necks have stretched slightly but not very much  i am picky about that so i may notice that more than most people would  i dry the t shirts by putting them in the dryer on energy saving setting for three minutes and then laying them on a bamboo drying rack  i do not dry them by putting them on hangers  the t shirts still look great with no fading  i wear them frequently and enjoy the various colors      
23,1.0,                       these were really scratchy and stiff and ran small  my husband needs these for work and it would have been miserable to wear them  plus these run really small i would have had to have bought two sizes up to have them at least a little bit loose and not form fitting      
24,5.0,                       i purchased these shirts to replace some  not so  white shirts that i had  over the past couple of years i have managed to dirty up practically every white shirt that i have so i decided  why not gray  these shirts fit great and are comfortable to wear  after   washes it looks as thought have shrunk a little bit  but not much at all which is a relief  would definitely recommend them for a casual  comfy shirt      
25,5.0,                       i got these shirts to be able to go to the park and skate   if you know south florida  you can only wear black in winter indoors or you will be one of those knobs walking down the street in the sun under an umbrella   i d rather not do that while on eight wheels because i d put people s eyes out however  gildan has been a line of clothing that i look for since i discovered them   i ve got one of their plain t shirts from the mid   s or so and it s worn beautifully   the quality has not been spoiled by incompetent ceos looking for another ivory back scratcher to give to mongomery burns by using lesser materials      
26,5.0,                       i don t like having to spend too much money on work clothes  but i also don t want cheap quality that ll rip in no time  these shirts are the best  they fit nice  they last and they re cheap  you won t win a fashion show  but if you re looking for basic shirts that are cheap and last  go with these      
27,3.0,                       the all cotton shirts  not heathers  shrink significantly after washing drying   i ordered a size up after reading reviews on this  but the fit is a little awkward anyway  boxy and the sleeves are disproportionately short   fabric is rough and wrinkled badly even though i removed from washer promptly and my dryer has a wrinkle guard feature   i would recommend going with gildan s soft style t shirt over these       for a couple bucks more the shirt is a lot higher quality      
28,5.0,                       they are pretty good quality considering the price  my husband was looking for some cheaper shirts for work  he was broad shoulders so a lot of shirts end up looking like belly shirts  these fit really well  he s almost        lbs      
29,2.0,                       i ordered two xl shirts based on the pictures   i am      but not overweight  so i need it for the length  what i was sent are two shirts that are actually as wide  or wider  than they are long  and they aren t that long   one washing and they would be too short   it was so weird that i thought maybe it was an error but both shirts are cut like that the only reason i didn t give them one star was they seem to be made of pretty heavy cotton for the price   of course it doesn t do me any good      
30,5.0,                       my son is tall so i got xl but they did seem to shrink a bit  i dont see him wearing them  hopefully he will pass them to my husband who is shorter waisted so the money spent wont be lost      
31,5.0,                       for the past   years i ve been wearing gildan shirts without even knowing  they are for work so it has the company logos all over it  i ve always liked the way they fit and how thick they so i decided to buy some for myself now i can rock them without any work logos on them  they fit the same and feel the same           
32,5.0,                       i was nervous to buy a two pack since i hadn t tried this particular brand before  but i was pleasantly surprised when i opened it  quality is high  very soft  and pairs flawlessly with my wardrobe  you will not be disappointed with these shirts      
33,5.0,                       i was a little skeptical about this product  reading some of the neg  reviews  but for the price of       i gave them a try   the fit is great i ordered the  x thinking that they may shrink some as someone stated in their review   didn t happen  washed them in warm water and dried on med heat  fits like out of the package  compared to some of my other ts   i would say these are med  light weight bottom line for    bucks you cant go wrong      
34,4.0,                       i thought a medium size would work because this is a shirt in men s size  however i needed to order a size up because the medium size is a little snug  the cotton is thick and durable and i like the color  if i order again i ll definitely order a large for a more relaxed fit      
35,3.0,                       i ve worn large tee shirts for most of my adult life  but as i got older i moved up to wearing x large  recently  i decided to get healthy and lose some weight  as a result i ve had to buy new clothes  i bought gildan s large tee shirts because i had a good experience with their x large tee shirts  much to my dismay the size of the tee shirts seems to vary by color  the large red tee shirt fits me      lbs   ft    in   pretty much the same way as my old x large tee shirts  whereas the dark heather  purchased from wal mart  fits as expected  i m not sure if it is a quality control issue or differences due to where the item s  were manufactured  in any case  as they say  let the buyer beware      
36,2.0,                       the antique cherry red shirts i ordered were not specified to be cotton poly blend in the description so i assumed it would be      cotton  sadly  they were    cotton    poly  i like all cotton shirts  if i had know it would be a cotton poly blend  i would not have purchased them  they fit ok so i ll try them out  but please be more accurate in the product details     
37,4.0,                       shirts are good  heavy cotton as expected  but somewhere in the transfer of goods to my local post office the bag the shirts were shipped in was ripped to pieces and the shirts were placed in a clear trash bag with an apology note from usps  my missing star isn t for the product itself  but for poor handling or possibly shoddy packaging      
38,5.0,                       this is the  rd time i ve ordered a   pack of these i did one order in  x and the other   in  x and either would have been fine             i ve seen regular t shirts with thin material that shrinks cost three times as much for  x  x sizes these shirts are way better quality than i would have expected  barely shrunk after washing  and fit great  i need something comfortable for work and would have paid more if i had to but it was nice that i didn t     
39,4.0,                       these shirts seem to be decent quality  although the fabric isn t as soft as i expected   unfortunately i won t be able to wear them  because they seem to be about   size too small   i ordered  large  which is the size i wear in virtually every other shirt i have  including some lands end t shirts i just bought    so these will just sit in the drawer      
40,3.0,                         stars since image and shirt look way off      i should of read that it says safety pink as color meaning it ll be a bright hot pink color   quality and comfort is good just color way off   idky it s so hard to find a nice soft pick online at a good price   i could of got this shirt at hobby lobby for    if i had just payed attention to name of the color       
41,5.0,                       these are my husband s favorite shirts  they are thick and durable  we will be buying more      
42,5.0,                       these t s are the best heavy   but not too heavy   weight all cotton shirts i have ever found  and you cannot beat the price  nice heft  they are nonetheless soft  hang well and don t cling  yet are classically  perfectly cut  these things launder really well  too  they hold the heft forever  i have one of these t s that is a good    years old and it has held the color and body ever since  perfect when you need an opaque  full coverage  heavier t that breathes well  genuinely worth it at double   the price      
43,1.0,                       i purchased them as a gift so cannot say how it fit the person but i would not purchase again  the shirt is definitely not quality but even more so the black looked very dingy  more of an off black  it almost looked as if the shirts were worn before  i do not recommend this brand      
44,5.0,                       absolutely the best casual t shirt i ve ever owned  good gym shirt  tennis shirt  just all around great product  and at    shirt that is amazing  fit is perfect and material stitching is top notch  i bought   more two packs today after receiving my first   pack  highly recommended  i bough xxl  i m      and       broad shoulders and stocky  i don t like baggy closes but do not like tight fitting clothes either      
45,4.0,                       bought this as a gift  one shirt says      cotton and the other says        this makes it hard to decide whether to size up or size down  the recipient was grateful and liked the colors and quality  he is hoping the shirts will shrink some in the wash      
46,5.0,                       great  soft  comfortable shirts  i ve had a hard time finding good shirts that aren t made of that horrible  itchy  stretchy fabric blend that they make cheap shirts out of now  these actually are      cotton  when you stretch them  they deform  as they should  and they aren t the slightest bit itchy or sticky  very happy with them      
47,4.0,                       bolo  this is not      cotton  i searched and searched for      cotton and thought that s what  ultra cotton  was  read the fine print  yes they say that the sport gray is     cotton     polyester  i would not have purchased the product if i knew that  summers are too hot for any polyester      
48,4.0,                       i ordered this tee to customize with our team logo  the color was nice and the fit was great  the only downside was the quality after the wash  it felt alittle bit on the stiff wrinkly side despite fabric softener and dryer sheets  this is the basic level tees for this brand  so at this price  i can t complain  i ll be trying the moisture wicking tee next  as i ve used those before and they are a bit softer after a wash dry      
49,2.0,                          update             i ve only had the shirts for about   months and both have shrunk and faded significantly  the neck collars have rolled up  i bought these gildan dry blend shirts and the fit is much better  perfect thickness on the shirt itself   https   www amazon com gildan dryblend workwear t shirts xx large dp b  cx xmft ref pd yo rr rp                        encoding utf  pd rd i b  cx xmft pd rd r   dfdb   fe     f  bec    f dbc    e pd rd w p  dq pd rd wg jt xi pf rd p  b bffa     f  dbd a        bf fd    pf rd r  emxacpzbhn   pmnxfn psc   refrid  emxacpzbhn   pmnxfn   they also have a non pocket version   https   www amazon com dp b     frbz  coliid ian c q  tqf  colid  zfifidgdaf t psc   ref  lv ov lig dp it   even the gildan shirts that i got in a multi pack lasted much longer  if you re a bigger man looking for long lasting undershirts  get the dryblend shirts or   pack instead original review if you ever used stafford undershirts from jcpenney then you ll love these  i ve searched everywhere for years for black midweight undershirts close to the ones jcpenney used to sell  and i am so glad i gave these from gildan a shot  the fit is perfect and the shirts aren t see through  they do a good job of hiding your skin  i bought a multipack of undershirts from gildan but these are definitely thicker  they also last quite a while  no issues with armpit seams tearing of hems rolling up  great for self conscious big   tall men  i will definitely be ordering more      
50,2.0,                       fits well  i like having these green shirts for work unfortunately  they are stiff and rough  definitely a  too good to be true  deal yes  i buy these to destroy them at work  but it s also nice to be comfortable while i m working its not the end of the world  but i wont be buying these again  i ll stick to the dickies brand tshirts that i really like      
51,2.0,                       i bought these instead of my usual carhardtt that cost me        to try gildan t shirts i am far from satisfied  out of the package they were well made a nice thick material  although they were short in length and sleeves  the length drawed up at first wash and dry and we dried them on warm and cold water horrible fit      
52,1.0,                       antique cherry red is not      cotton i haven t tried it on yet  because it came here reeking of chemicals   seems like it will be ok  but this is literally stinking up my whole house      
53,3.0,                       ordered a  x  normally wear a  x  in these because i love huge shirts  but when these arrived they easily could have been size  x  plus  upon washing them  they shrunk big time on the first wash  they come above the waistline  and fit side to side like a  x  very disappointing      
54,5.0,                       my go to brand for the last few years as big name brand shirts have gone down hill in quality all the while going up in price  these are cheap  fit great  wash well and hold up well  love the color choices and come in packs of two  a lot cheaper than you pay for one in most brands  no shrinkage and hard to fade when washed      
55,5.0,                       these are my work shirts  i am so happy to have      cotton shirts with a generous cut  i order them large  because i want to be able to wash them with my jeans and put them in the dryer  i can t do that with the majority of my wardrobe because of materials they are made of  the shirts are made well and have yet to have a hem or any stitching come out  very pleased      
56,4.0,                       the fit is right and they re good shirts at a good price  but the color really isn t close to the picture on the listing  it s far more red than i expected  i ll keep the shirts  it s not worth the hassle of returning them  they aren t bad  but they aren t what i wanted  either      
57,4.0,                       finally found a nice basic tee made with medium heavy weight cotton that has some body to it  far better than the tee shirts in stores made of super thin  flimsy fabric  that look like they ll fall apart after a couple of washings  these tee are made with good material  good construction  they have a good fit  and they hold their own shape fairly well the only con i have is how the sleeves are sewn in at a slight downward angle  compared to my older tee shirts  in which the sleeves are sewn in at more of a right angle to the body of the shirt   this makes the sleeves somewhat restrictive of arm movement as you reach up or out with your arms but overall  this is a good tee  and i ll be buying more of them  at least until i find some with a better sleeve design      
58,3.0,                       heavy material  suitable for colder climates  fit is a bit larger than expected  the color isn t very good when compared to the amazon essentials tee  looks more greyish black      
59,5.0,                       purchased these looking for quick drying t shirts for travel  to be able to wash each day in hotel  hang up to dry  and have dry about    hours later   they performed well and were comfortable to wear  i rolled the shirts in a hotel towel before hanging on a clothes line to dry  and tried to put the clothes line away from the shower  bath tub to maximize drying  and that seemed to work too      
60,5.0,                       we love these shirts  i ve purchased so many for my husband over the years  they re so comfortable and soft but still a nice thick cotton  my husband hates thin cotton shirts     they wash nicely and don t shrink much if at all  they re great for using on cricut projects  ironing on patches  vinyl etc   my husband buys a size large and he is       and weighs roughly     pounds and has a longer torso so he loves that this fully cover his mid section and doesn t ride up as much as normal shirts do  very happy with these shirts      
61,4.0,                       i bought these primarily to wear under a long sleeved shirt  so i m not concerned with the wrinkle factor or the looks   my build usually puts me between a medium and large  so i usually purchase shirts sized large  to me these definitely fit like a large   my only comment is that they are a little thicker heavier stiffer    than most t shirts i ve previously purchased  which isn t necessarily a bad thing  but surprising   hopefully it means they ll last longer      
62,4.0,                       i expected this order in   days  i needed these for a gift   days after i ordered them  they arrived    days after i ordered them  they seem like nice enough  high quality  cotton shirts  i wish they arrived faster      
63,4.0,                       i ve had   of these for a few months now  the quality of the shirts is pretty good  they ve retained there color reasonably well after several washings  the only negative thing i can say is that they run small  you should order at least one size larger than you normally wear  i typically wear l or xl t shirts  i m not really an xl but i like a loose fit   i ordered these in xl and they re a little snug through the chest and shoulders      
64,4.0,                       i always wash my clothes before wearing them   i hate that sizing smell   cold water  medium dry and they came out wrinkled   i try to buy gildan because they are a very nice material   i washed and dried them  again  this time alone   still wrinkled   they were pretty inexpensive  so i will wear them in the shop      
65,5.0,                       after reading several reviews i was a little bit skeptical about buying this product but after seeing the quality and deep color of shirt and the size will spot on if you re getting a  x it will be a  x if you re getting a  x it will fit like a  x that s just good information for anyone buying     
66,5.0,                       these t shirts are very well made  they fit well and they don t feel thin and cheap like a few on the market now  i would definitely buy this brand again      
67,4.0,                       i scoured amazon researching t shirts  apparently a great many famous brands have declined in quality over the years  i ordered gildan based on the reviews  just got these this week  the thickness and weight of the fabric  and the way the shirts fit are a cut above many of the other t shirts i ve collected over the years  we ll see about durability and how they fit and feel after multiple washings  but for right now  they re great  if you re looking for a casual shirt for workouts  dog walking  home projects or heading to the hardware store  give these a try      
68,1.0,                       i use a t shirt every day as an undershirt  i perspire a lot  so i always need to find some with      that feel cool and heavy  unfortunately  this is none of the above  it felt more like    a sandpaper t shirt  of very low quality  believe it or not but  i will be going back to the best quality t shirts i have ever purchased and that is at walmart  where       cotton  is really true      
69,4.0,                       i have more than   gildan shirt  i don t like spending alot of   on t shirts anymore usually  but these ones were okay  maybe they ll soften up after a few washes  but out the box  kinda uncomfortable stiff  but that is expected of a new product  value for what i got is spot on  worth the buy  i bought the   pack purple dark      
70,5.0,                       these      cotton t s  white  are almost like they are from a lost era  much more substantial than i ve seen in years  not as soft as flimsy stuff you get from low end retailers  but i expect that with subsequent washings they will soften up   shrinkage is at predicted rate for high quality cotton so the end result in my case was the expected xl      
71,5.0,                       i don t know what it is  but my black t shirts fit better and seem to be more comfortable than my white t shirts    and they look good with the right outer shirt this is a well made product      
72,5.0,                       who doesn t love a good t shirt   i am pretty picky about my clothes and i think these t shirts hit the mark for quality  fit  and ethical production  they are made in the u s  from      cotton  unlike a lot of other t shirts on amazon  the seller provided the order quickly and packed the items with care  i would purchase again  thank you fitness dojo         
73,5.0,                       these t shirts are heavy cotton  fit well and are well made  for   bucks each            you can t beat them  i ve gone through a lot of t shirts  over the decades  buying at retail stores and on line these are the best i ve ever purchased  i recommend them highly      
74,3.0,                       wow  the thumbnail color of the  safety pink  is nothing like the item received  the image shows a nice pink that is on the pale side of things  what you actually get is a just shy of neon pink  incredibly bright and not what i wanted at all  bummer  not sure my photo captures the garish hue  but it is at least obviously a completely different color than advertised in the photo      
75,5.0,                       i m very happy with these shirts  i m making some graphic style shirts for my sister for the holidays  so i needed something that would ship quickly  these came fast and feel great      
76,5.0,                       i m between large and xl  seeing other reviewers complain about the neck being tight  i thought xl might be right for me  they are perfect when i put them on  but sag a little after a day of wearing  i guess i should either lose or gain some weight      
77,3.0,                       i have purchased and worn gildan cotton tee shirts for many years  decades really  these are disappointing  for specificity  i note these particular shirts were manufactured in nicaragua  unlike gildan shirts that i am happy with that were made in other countries i won t make the mistake of buying gildan shirts anymore unless i can inspect the garments in person first i purchased shirts in   different colors through two separate orders  i have the same reaction to all shirts in all colors fabric is a bit stiff  award   stars   first the good things  fabric quality is pretty good  though a bit stiffer feeling than other gildan tees i currently own  take off   star for stiffness good stitching  award   stars   all the sewing and stitching seem to be well executed vibrant color  award   stars   the color is vibrant and seems durable after several washings already uncomfortable tags in back of neck  award   stars   the fabric tags at the back of the neck are irritating  i removed them from every shirt  plus  they are long skinny tags sewn in along one short side  so they always stick up out the back of the neck if not removed sleeve and waist hems roll up  award   star   the hems on the sleeves and the waist roll up and stay up  they are hard to roll down  the more the shirts are laundered  the worse the rolling and staying rolled becomes  this makes the shirts a real chore to tuck in and unkempt looking at the sleeves when wearing      
78,5.0,                       they ran a little large  but shank a little with washing  so they are just about perfect   the colors were bright  and the material soft   i ll probably order some more colors  but maybe a size smaller      
79,2.0,                       i bought these extra large  for me   with the intent of using them as night shirts   it is taking several washes to get them in a soft enough condition for comfortable sleeping   other than that  they are well made      
80,3.0,                       these are the most uncomfortable t shirts i ve ever worn  imagine wearing a paper bag  i usually wear triblend shirts for work because they are light and extremely comfortable  maybe it s my fault for thinking  ultra cotton  meant ultra soft  i would have accepted moderately soft even  they went straight to donation bin  thankfully they were not expensive      
81,4.0,                       ratio  however  the only reason i gave four stars is that amazon essentials have raised the bar  do not misunderstand me  gildan makes a nice t shirt     but amazon raised the bar  hear that gildan    i love you but a prettier girl has just moved in    can i still say that      this is not the ugly sister  but when amazon raised the bar    elvis left the building         
82,5.0,                       i bought these shirts as oversized sleeping shirts and the quality is great  the material is kinda thick but not scratchy or uncomfortable at all  super happy with these so i bought more in different colors  they re all the same in quality and size      
83,4.0,                       im a pretty big guys      and     lbs i ordered the  xl shirt  they are pretty comfortable  and the weight is a nice middle of then road  however after a few washes only using cold water and hang drying them  they strunk to the point where my belly sticks out of the bottom about   to   inches  so due to that i can t buy them anymore tl dr the initial fit is great but after time they shrink terribly      
84,5.0,                       i m a die hard new york yankees fan  but  this season  i have decided to support the new york mets  too  so  i purchased a ny mets hat  that i like and i found a dynamite ny mets jacket  i will purchase before this summer s over  however  i can t find a decent  royal blue   ny mets t shirt  that i like  on amazon  so  i decided on purchasing a bunch of  plain    royal blue   t shirts  from a brand that i know and trust  and it just so happens to be these t shirts from   gildan   these are the   best   plain t shirts being sold in america today and that s without question  i love the color and i m totally satisfied with the fit and the price  they can t be beat and this is the  go to   brand for t shirts      
85,1.0,                       i bought   of these shirts and all of them smell like a several day old dead skunk  it s rancid and stunk up the room  had to open a window   i m not exaggerating  it s eye watering horrible   it s not the bag  it s actually the fabric   it s in the trunk of my car waiting to be returned if it were one  i would think it s a weird issue and just throw it away  but all twelve   how is              star reviews possible      
86,5.0,                       i bought a pair of these to wear during the lockdown and i am really happy neck was a bit tight initially  but quickly loosen up after a few days of use  washed it a few times already and did not shrink noticeably i like the selection of colors  i ll buy more in the future      
87,5.0,                       recommend this t shirt for anyone who desires an undershirt or just a t shirt  it keeps it s shape and color longer than other t shirts especially in the neck area where many times it can look  puckered up  under your shirt and feels bad  so far this shirt does great  will order more of these      
88,3.0,                       these appears to be a bit irregular the shoulders do not match the collar line  they are however a heavy cotton so i expect that they will hold up well for the price and for what they will be used for i gave them   stars      
89,2.0,                       not the quality i am used to from this company  apparently there is a lack of quality control in the cotten t shirt section of this comment  unfortunately i found this too late to send it back  the three was over     long and coming off the armpit seam  i attempted to tie it off as close to the seam as i could  then cut off the excess  i m expecting there will be a hole eventually      
90,5.0,                       unless you look hard enough  big and tall shirts don t come cheap  even here on amazon  to allow for shrinking in the wash  i have to get  xl or bigger for my  xl torso  when getting new shirts online  if only there were cheap xlt shirts here on amazon  that d really please my family  not only for me  but for their torsos  too  i had to buy gray to keep from burning up in the heat  dark clothes burn people up in hot weather      
91,3.0,                       certainly cannot complain about the price  but after decades wearing jcpenney s stafford premium heavyweight cotton t s  these gildan men s ultra cotton adult t shirts still are a disappointment   penny s was out of stock  so i ordered the gildans   they were flagged     best seller   but they are certainly not    best   made of a lightweight cotton fabric  after washing they are noticeably smaller  also  the laundered seams shrunk and puckered in places  so they do not fit nice  i should have ordered the large size to end up with medium  perhaps they will survive ten washings      
92,4.0,                       i have both the cheap tee shirts and the absolute best heavy duty tee shirts that cost a fortune these tee shirts in my view are the perfect compromise between quality and price      
93,4.0,                       this was a really good price for two shirts  the only thing i didnt like about these shirts was that they are very stuff and not very soft at all  even after putting it through the washer several times didnt shrink and fit as expected  good product for the price and fast shipping      
94,5.0,                       i am very happy with the gildan tshirts i ordered   they are precisely the high quality of tshirt that i wanted  not those flimsy things that start to tear and frey after only a few washes   thank you for the very fast delivery as well   i ll be ordering more soon  and will be recommending these shirts to others      
95,2.0,                       with just one wash in warm water and then drying in a warm dryer this shirt shrank so much that it was too short  too tight in the chest  and too tight at the arms   this is a poor product due to its problems with overall quality   most shirts  even      cotton don t normally shrink this much unless the cotton is poorly processed   i would not buy any more of this product by this company  i am    inches tall and weigh     lbs   the medium shirt was way too small after one washing      
96,4.0,                       i ordered two colors    a  white and  b  galapagos blue   the white ones  size large  were reasonably soft  for a cheap tee shirt   and should shrink to an actual large   i will keep them   the blue ones are also around the correct size  however i m returning them as the material is more scratchy than the white  and the fit is not as good  neck too big  sleeves too short imho    interesting that the white ones  which i liked  were made in nicaragua and the blue ones in haiti      
97,2.0,                       i ve always had a issue with gildan shirts  such as a lot of shrinking and too large arm openings  these shirts were listed as  premium   honestly if my wife hadn t washed them on accident i d have sent them back  i failed to see the  premium  quality  love amazon and all it stands for but these shirts were  regular  gildan     
98,4.0,                       love the fit as a big chested guy most shirts have to much in the stomach and to little on the arms  these are a good balance of a nice room in the chest slightly sliming on the stomach and nice length on the arms      
99,4.0,                       actually one of the better shirts i bought  i definitely recommend purchasing one size up from what you normally wear  i m a former body builder so i ve got broad shoulders  a big chest and normally wear a  x but purchased a  x per reviews from others recommending to do so  fits generally good overall  not the softest shirt i ever owned but i ve had worse  the shirt is comfortable and not too thick and bulky like other shirts  i ve got experience with these shirts and after a few washes they get more comfortable over time and last  i wear these shirts often and they re comfortable to wear out on the town  doing yard work or just laying around the house in      
100,5.0,                       these are perfect  comfortable t shirts  not too thick  not too thin   just right   surprisingly soft for a t shirt  as well   bought two  packs for my fiance and i to do tie dye shirts   they will be perfect      
101,1.0,                       this has got to be one of the worst product on amazon  i thought i was buying a decent product but instead  wound up with a poor quality cotton t shirt  after a few washes  they shrank so badly that i had to give them to my dogs to wear during winter      
102,1.0,                       very disappointed with these t s  after the first washing the bottom hems unraveled  also the material is super scratchy  they are pretty much useless to wear un tucked due to the unraveled hems i have purchased much less costly white t shirts from gildan and was quite pleased with them  would be curious to know if anybody else has had the same situation      
103,2.0,                       was not as heavy a weight of fabric that i was expecting  but it is okay but more of a midweight   but i wanted something sturdier   fit for me was typical of this size of men s tshirt except it was very long so i couldn t tuck it into my jeans   haven t washed this very many times so can t report on whether or not it will shrink in length  or width       
104,5.0,                       i m a pretty thick on the waist right now  so it s more tight for me around the midsection as a result  this shirt seems to fit better on fit people  if you re looking for it to be loose on the midsection  consider going up a size i ve washed this shirt     times and it seems to be keeping its shape and size  so that s nice  it s a cheap shirt though  so if it does start to shrink after      washes  it s not a big deal to buy a new one      
105,5.0,                       i m a big girl       and     lbs  i usually wear xl or xxl because sizes are so inconsistent  these shirts are a true xl  they fit my chest without pulling up too much in the front  they aren t too snug but don t look loose and frumpy either  the material is thick and even though they might shrink a bit in the wash  there s enough room that they still won t be too small  i ll definitely be buying these again      
106,4.0,                       these are the cheap but sturdy t shirts we buy at michaels for my son to wear while working on his car  motor oil and grease don t show of course on black t shirts  i ordered from amazon after not being able to get the size i needed from michael s  the shipment came in quickly enough  the shirts feel heavy and are well sewn  i don t see any defects  the only con i see is that after washing in cold water with mild detergent  these shirts had a chemical odor  i don t know if it could be the dyeing process or what but the smell is quite strong  it reminds me of ant poison  after washing a second time in warm water and an odor removing liquid  i was able to get a diminished smell  we are going to toss these after my son works on changing his motor oil or work on his engine  i will probably try another order to see if this is just an odd occurance  since i do not see anyone else complaining      
107,4.0,                       it s what you would expect in an economy t shirt  it s strong  well made with medium quality cotton   also the color is true to the photo  which i appreciate  sizes run a bit on the small side   i am   feet and     lbs and the medium size fits me very snugly  especially after wash and dry   this is the fit i was looking for so i am not disappointed  however  others should order sizes accordingly      
108,5.0,                       great quality tshirts  they did shrink a bit in the wash  the men s small  was smaller than i anticipated  i wanted an oversized man s tshirt to cut up for a woman to wear   have now ordered in a medium  love these shirts and what great value for money too  maybe size up if your not sure unless you want a snugger fit      
109,2.0,                       product fit pretty well out of the package   i did need to order one size smaller    a first for me    for which amazon did an exchange   after washing  though  the shirts are now way too short   i think they lost about   inches in length   they fit around okay  but i really can t raise my arms      
110,5.0,                       i am pleasantly surprised with this shirt  given how low priced it is  it s comfortable  thick  which is what i wanted    i don t like super thin t shirts  even when they re high quality   and seems durable so far  it s also the size i expected  at least after washing  seemed a little big at first   i m going to continue to order more of these  as they re exactly what i was looking for      
111,4.0,                       i ve ordered two packs of the dark heather color and can t praise them enough   they are very comfortable  launder well  and never need ironing if you hang them up right out of the dryer   i don t think you can ask much more from tshirts   i love them so much   there shirts are     cotton      polyester then i ordered another pack with one pink and one blue shirt   washed and dried them   they came out of the dryer with so many wrinkles it would take ironing with starch to remove them  temporarily    checked the tags  the shirts were      cotton   i would not have ordered them had i known that just be warned that not all of the shirts are of the same quality   in my opinion  this site needs to tell the shoppers what the fabric is in the dropdown for each color shirt   i wasted my money on the blue and pink ones   they are not made of a wash and wear fabric      
112,5.0,                       great product and deal  i ordered size large but it fits as if it is between a medium and a large  i would reccomend ordering a size up  especially because it is      cotton      
113,5.0,                       i am a woman who normally wears l xl for comfy clothes to bed or lounge around the house  i would say these fit maybe a little tight but that s because they shrank some after washing  they are comfortable  i wear the xl like a normal shirt because it isn t as loose as i would like my lounging shirts to be  i love having a generic tshirt that s soft  durable  and a good quality  i will buy more of these shirts to wear everyday and some xxl for sleep lounge shirts  i would recommend you order your normal size      
114,4.0,                       in terms of value for money  these are pretty good  they ve got a nice tough feeling fabric  which is a bit scratchy at first  but once they ve been worn and washed a couple times they soften up these are a little smaller than i expected though  i can comfortably wear a small in most t shirts  so ordered a small here  and it s a bit tight on the torso and shorter than average  length wise      
115,4.0,                       the fabric is soft enough and comfortable  not too light  i bought a variety of colors  specifically the grey one lost a lot of thread on the sewing on the waist part after hours of the first use  still  i bough them for using at home and maybe under a buttoned shirt or sweater  so not too bad for me  still  if you are looking for durability or to use in public with nothing else  be warned      
116,5.0,                       these t shirts are very nice  albeit on the thick heavy side as far as material goes  they are probably best for cooler weather because of the heavy material  with that said  they are definitely a great quality and recommended  purchased for my s o  who likes them ps  they will shrink a bit after washing and drying  so be aware when choosing a size      
117,5.0,                       after trying the well known brands and expecting something good  i was very disappointed with what i found out there   however  i received a t shirt with branding on it from an event i attended and it was sooooo good   i checked the tag on the neck and found the manufacturer and started looking it up   i found them at amazon and ordered some   i was not disappointed   there are very good  sturdy  heavy weight t shirts that i am extremely happy with   thanks to this manufacturer for creating a wonderful product      
118,5.0,                       you could tell this is ultra cotton  all my friends commented on the quality of the cotton  i d never had my friends compliment my clothing before  but trust me  these shirts will get people s attention   wow  this can t be regular cotton   said one lady who inadvertently touched my shirt while on an elevator of a public parking garage   where did you get that   yelled one man from his car window while i crossed an intersection of a trendy neighborhood  my life is probably never going to be the same  i don t know  but i can t wait to find out      
119,3.0,                       i was looking for  heavyweight  cotton t shirts  and these aren t them  medium weight at best  the construction of the shirt is good  though the tag is a little irritating  the fit isn t terrible  but it seems to be smaller than other shirts i buy  i would not purchase again      
120,5.0,                       my boyfriend is very picky about his shirts  but loves these   the shirts are a good fit  they don t shrink in the dryer  and are a good thickness   this is our second order of these shirts  so the quality is consistent   will buy again      
121,4.0,                       i can t say much about fit  i bought these to make some shirts for my brother  they felt very nice and when i ironed some heat transfer stuff on them it accepted it pretty good  i m sure i ll be buying more later      
122,4.0,                       i ordered a large which is my normal size but i would suggest ordering a size up because they are a bit snug  i just needed it for a halloween party so it worked for what i needed but i ll probably just donate it after tonight because its smaller than i would like   two shirts for a cheap price and its true to color      
123,1.0,                       this is not real gildan ultra cotton  i have several band shirts made of real gildan ultra cotton that are twice as soft these feel like cardboard  but they fit right and were cheap      
124,5.0,                       i purchased a   pack of the gildan me  s ultra t shirts in navy  excellent quality shirts  the material is superior  much better tha  the fruit of the loom shirts i purchased at the same time quality material and workmanship went into the gildan t shirts  i am ordering more of the gildan brand fruit of the loom shirts have gone downhill      
125,1.0,                       i assumed  ultra cotton     ultra soft     not the case at all  also it has weird seams and fits awkwardly      
126,5.0,                       i wanted a t shirt all cotton that was heavier but not too much  it held shape and size well after regular wash and full hot air drying  length shrunk less than an inch  i bought two to start then bought    more       
127,4.0,                       the shirt color was what i needed more  the quality over all has been really good  they just stain super easy and even with dawn dish soap the stains don t come out  i bought them for my job where i m unpacking boxes and moving and shifting things  so  the stains are not from food or anything of that nature  oh well  they were right for the money and work for the job also  didn t realize they came as a   pack  so  ordered one  thinking one shirt  but there were   in the pack  that was very cool      
128,5.0,                       my husband is really hard on his work clothes  and i was tired of spending    on more expensive work tee shirts that turn into grease rags down the line  enter these shirts  simple  great quality  much sturdier fabric than i expected   and if they get destroyed by grease hydraulic fluid whatever  i m not going to be too bummed about it  my husband is    and    lbs with a little bit of a dad bod  and the large was a little tighter than most of his same sized shirts so we will size up next time      
129,1.0,                       i was not interested writing the review  but i am writing since t shir i got was not good at all  i was having a t shirt with the same composition   it was so soft  with the same composition this t shirt from gildan is not good at all  it feels very rough  don t buy for any sports  don t buy for humid conditions  it can be only good in winter      
130,3.0,                       i was expecting a soft pink  like the picture  and what i got was like something a road crew would wear for safety visibility   however  the quality is good and i can wear them around the house      
131,5.0,                       these are just what we were looking for  love that they are      cotton  and on the heavy side just as we like them  good substitute for insulated underwear when cold but not cold enough for something heavier  can be worn with or without cover of shirt  love that they are snug around the neck  not loose  well made  reasonably priced  plan to buy more      
132,3.0,                       i read several reviews before finally deciding to purchase these for my husband  my husband is very picky about his shirts  another review also specified that a picky husband loved these  these shirts are fine by quality and fit as you would expect but they are not a soft shirt at all  they are a rougher cotton and feel heavy to wear as a casual kick around the house shirt      
133,5.0,                       its always hard to find   xl shirts but i got   pairs in black and   in blue for my fiance for christmas and he loved them thick material washed and air dried didnt shrink loved them     
134,5.0,                       this is the best brand   they hold up a very long time and are a good length for my       husband   hanes and fruit of the loom aren t as generous in length  he is hard on tee shirts  but this brand is quality   after   years  i am replacing some of his old ones      
135,4.0,                       size  xl waist and chest are a just little on the loose side for my    inch waist and    inch chest   buts shoulders are very wide with seams that drop down my arms    inches   and the sleeve holes are a little larger than other t shirts i have  including some older gildan ultra cotton   i d say these would fit well on someone with a       inch chest  broad shoulders  and big biceps   if you re between an xl and  xl  get this shirt in size xl   i think an xl would fit me perfectly across the shoulders  but might be a little tight across my waist and chest   what i do like is the heavy cotton material and sleeve length  which is much better than the t shirts now being sold in stores made of thin  clingy  man made fabrics with ultra short sleeves      
136,5.0,                       my go to brand for the last few years as big name brand shirts have gone down hill in quality all the while going up in price  these are cheap  fit great  wash well and hold up well  love the color choices and come in packs of two a lot cheaper than you pay for one in most brands  no shrinkage and hard to fade when washed      
137,5.0,                       this is a great way to buy a tough every day shirt  the colors hold for years  i m a female but it s the cheapest way to buy a t  shirt  i have bought this brand for years for my whole family  i have even decorated some for presents      
138,4.0,                       i bought   of these shirts in two different colors  they re great  save for the tags  the tags are easy enough to remove  but once you do  you have to pay extra close attention to the seams and design of the shirt to be sure you are wearing it right     
139,1.0,                       ok i ordered a set of these shirts because finding      cotton shirts is getting harder in the village i live in   i read the description and ordered a solid color which should be      cotton   after i got them  washed them and wore the first shirt i knew they were not cotton    nope they are     polyester   i cannot stand the way plastic feels nor do i care for how it does not breathe  hence why i look for pure cotton my advice would be skip this gamble and buy from someone that sells only      pure cotton shirts  not this color based content  seriously  different colors have different amounts of cotton and plastic   not cool   literally      
140,5.0,                       i can t speak to how the product fit  as they were purchase for others  but i will say that they are true to the quality of gildan shirts and take vinyl very well      
141,5.0,                       i gave this product   stars because i have better things to do than to complain about a    t shirt  is it my favorite shirt  no  am i impressed by it  no  does it fit as well as my other tshirts  no  but it s    a shirt  i needed a green tshirt  didn t want to spend a lot of money  so i got myself the cheapest one i could find  i will say this though  i normally wear a medium  i should have ordered a large  the shirt runs a bit small      
142,1.0,                       the quality is really lacking  i ve noticed a decline in product quality over the years    after sever uses this product starts to come apart at the seams  many loose hanging threads  over stretched neck line  collar    again like so many other brands  the tee shirt sleeve are not long enough  the overall tee shirt quickly loses its fresh  new appearance and becomes another old  around the house  work shirt   i guess in today s market there are very few true quality products available to the general consumer   my suggestion is to compare prices and take a chance on the competitors product  it may surprise you in being better quality at a cheaper price   brand named definitely don t mean better products these days  it means they can command top dollar for equal or less equal product quality      
143,5.0,                       fit well with room  washable cold or warm water doesn t shrink  i ve bought these shirts in green    times and in black once  they are my husband s work shirts  they are goid quality and goid value for your money      
144,4.0,                       good for a basic t  my son is    and thin so he bounces between m and l depending on brand   since we are purchasing as an undershirt i went with the medium and it seems to run on the smaller side of a medium   i don t know that there would be issues if he wasn t as tall  he also prefers softer style for an undershirt  amazon immediately issued refund  wasn t for us but no real complaints      
145,5.0,                       gildan is the go to t shirt for wearing as both an undergarment and as an additional layer not crazy about the very thin  very soft  body hugging t shirts that are widespread and popular now   find that they wear out quickly  stretch easily out of shape  do nothing but  barely  cover your skin gildan makes a heavy       cotton t shirt that is durable  color fast  and holds it s shape      
146,3.0,                       i bought   packs of   in different colors for my husband for work  these fit great when they are new but as soon as you wash and dry them they shrink a lot   my husband wears a  x and they usually fall right a few inches below the belt loops on his pants  after washing they now fall right at his belt loops so if he bends over his back is showing   they are good enough for around the house or for work since he wears a sweatshirt over them but for summer i will have to buy him new ones that won t shrink so short     
147,5.0,                       two soft cotton t shirts for under      what s not to like  these are indeed made with soft cotton  and the length is just right  also  the color appears to be strong  and hopefully will not fade      
148,1.0,                       bought   of these shirts for my husband and even after washing  the fabric is so rough  the fit is  stifling   his words  with no flex and even the color is off   they re not bright white but more off white  would not recommend these at all      
149,5.0,                       i m familiar with this brand as it s the brand a company that does screen printed shirts uses that i ve ordered from several times  the shirts just last and last  these fit as i expected  i like my t shirts a little loose and could probably have ordered a size lower for a more snug fit  the length should be good even if you re fairly tall  given the price  it was a no brainer  i don t know that i d pay      each for the more expensive colors though  that s getting into polo shirt prices      
150,2.0,                       not worth the purchase  if you want a great t shirt purchase the amazon essentials all cotton t shirts  as the cotton  style and cut are light years better quality  fit  cut and softness      
151,2.0,                       not a bad shirt  especially for the price but was thinner than i expected and they shrink easily they fit about as expected but are very short   if you can manage to tuck it in  it won t stay tucked   if gildan made them longer or in tall sizes they would be fine i suggest buying a size larger then immediately wash in warm water   should fit better that way      
152,4.0,                       while it isn t necessarily true that you get what you pay for  this is definitely one of those cases  this t shirts are cheap  in more than one way  the fabric is      cotton  but a coarse  rough cotton  and the cut is slightly awkward  the fabric is not especially thin  probably a little thicker than most shirts i ve worn  but the seams fold over themselves more than most shirts  overall lower in quality than the bulk gildan shirts i ve worn however  it s not uncomfortable  and the sizing or the shape isn t abnormal enough that it looks weird on me  despite its flaws  it should considered decent as a value t shirt  and is certainly acceptable for many people  however  those looking for good quality should consider more expensive options  size purchased  medium  on a male height      weight     lb  fit is as expected      
153,5.0,                       of all the shirt brands i ve purchased these seem to hold their color the best  i wash these at least twice a week as i wear t shirts everyday      
154,5.0,                       comparing these to hanes cottonsoft after   wash each size  xl    they are slightly larger  but both are acceptable sizefeel   they are not as soft  but finematerial  heavier weight and more suited as just a tee  but would be heavier if worn as an undershirt in the summeronly time will tell which last longer without stretching out  but would buy both again based on initial impressions     
155,1.0,                       i ve bought many of these shirts the past several years but this time i m not impressed  the quality and amount of material has gone down hill    lost about     inches in length   thinner material   all the edges  collar  sleeve and the bottom all curl up and i just can t stop it so just like everything else in this world   it s been cheapened for corporate profits update  these plain suck    i hate them  i fell ripped off     
156,5.0,                       shirts came with perfect fit and made of substantially thick cotton fabric to feel protective and still comfortable  i like that the sleeves and collar are the right size and not too large or loose as is common with many of these type of shirts  they wash well  maintaining their size and color well  highly recommend      
157,2.0,                       t shirts came in sealed shipping bag  i had bought these before and knew the fit wasn t too bad so i set the package aside waiting due coronavirus packaging concerns  well i finally got around to opening it and the shirt have an orange stain and the entire inside of the shipping bag is saturated with mens cologne      this seems to have been deliberately put in the bag due to the quantity  disappointed i waited too long to return them      
158,3.0,                       these are decent all cotton t shirts that for some reason remind me of the way hanes used to fit   they are a little loose in the arms  but tighter up in the shoulders so they don t feel quite right   i am       and about     with broad shoulders and this tends to be an issue for me  so i ve tried a lot of different t shirts at this point i prefer the synthetic cotton blends as they tend to hold their size better after washing   being all cotton  these wear like the t s i used to buy    years ago  and have the same issues after washing   i gave these a shot because of the price  and because my current favorite  next level  is a little tight in the guns for my liking   i think i d still stick to those at this point the search for perfection in a t shirt under    bucks continues      
159,5.0,                       i m a big guy and i m barrel chested from working out my whole life but i don t like the way a lot of thin shirts fit me  the drape off of my chest and make me look like i have boobs sometimes and i don t like that  these are nice thick cotton shirts that s fit perfectly and drape well      
160,3.0,                       nice looking t shirt and always orders large for some extra room since i am mostly a medium  however these shirts fit a lot tighter than what i am used to  so as a result disappointed in the fit  i am fearful if they shrink after washing i ll be unable to use them if they provide and even tighter fit      
161,1.0,                       this does not feel like cotton in any way  shape or form  it feels like completely synthetic fabric  with the feel of a polyester shirt but a bit rougher and stiffer  not completely uncomfortable  but there is absolutely zero chance that this is cotton  or even mostly cotton  i ll keep them for work shirts since i can t be bothered to send them back and they were cheap  but there s no way i ll ever order from this company again      
162,5.0,                       for years i had a tie dyed tee that my daughter had bought me   i wore it until it was just worn out   i liked the shirt itself was the reason for its  longevity   looking at a hole worn in the old thing  it occurred to me that perhaps i could find the basic shirt if i looked   finally i found them   same model sans the wild dye job   priced right  too   i ordered a two pack of them  and prime had them in my mail box two days later   ah   satisfaction   actually improved with their neat tear off label   great innovation just what i was looking for   money well spent   i m ordering some more after this trial run      
163,4.0,                       good basic utilitarian t shirts  large shirts are actually large   i was concerned about the red shirt dye bleeding into the first wash but nothing turned pink   same with the green  the tags are irritating  i cut them off   an unknown with new cotton t shirts is how long they will last  so i am holding off on the  th star   i will try to update in the future if needed      
164,5.0,                       great unisex shirt   we bought a ton to make for a retreat that my husband was leading   i pressed htv on them with no problems   shirts were consistent in color and cut   we have washed my husband s several times   it still looks great   right price  good quality      
165,5.0,                       colors are excellent and don t easily fade   little to no shrinking even when washed with hot water soft and full thickness cotton  not flimsy additionally  if tags irritate your neck  these shirt tags will easily pull off without disrupting the stitching of the neck  a rare feature but highly desirable i ve bought more and will purchase them again soon      
166,3.0,                       great at first wear  def shrink after you wash them  i really liked them when i first wore them  looked and fitted great for a big guy  but after the wash def shrunk      
167,5.0,                       these are nicer than hanes that i ve been wearing for   decades   and since hanes prices are ridiculous   i decided to try these  i m very happy with these  only wish they were tagless   but i cut them out      
168,5.0,                       fits as expected  i purchased these as work shirts  i am pleased with them  they didn t shrink after washing  nice baggy shirt for professional artist not just for men but big girls  too         
169,1.0,                       i bought this for my husband and regret it  these are very cheaply made and so scratchy  like  i didn t know cotton could be so rough  i plan to cut these into cleaning clothes  these may work for someone like a mechanic  you wont feel guilty at all for getting grease on these      
170,2.0,                       to myself  because i knew it really wouldn t mean much to me  and it doesn t  but it is scratchy  the tag says      cotton content  from what most would call a  rd world country  i have a suggestion   blame your primo world companies for bastardizing the products we have grown to expect  these in fact are closer to t shirt thin burlap than what you would call t shirt thin cotton  yeah          should not elicit much expectation  well  i really did expect to find those mothlike patches of no fabric here and there  not to worry  just a natural part of the disintegration process  i say  so don t blame me  gildan  it s your product  i just calls em like i sees em  ain t no sense in kicking your dead ass horse carcass     you already know how i feel  i ll go get you a shovel      
171,5.0,                       so soft and well made  had some problems with the original order and they sent a new order very quickly  would definitely recommend this company      
172,3.0,                       this shirt is well made and durable but i think they didn t get all the cotton seeds out before making the textile   i washed it and turned it inside out because the outside of the fabric seems less rough and scratchy  i use for night shirt  not for those with sensitive skin      
173,4.0,                       these     oz t shirts are pretty thick and not great for hot and humid summers  e g   austin in august    these      cotton tees shrink down a size so you might want to buy a size up   i wear a large but i bought an xl and it shrank down perfectly      
174,4.0,                       yeah   not the softest cotton   but it s better than the super thin shirt i just got made by next level here on amazon    a few of my chest hairs stuck through the fabric of the tan colored next level t shirt i just bought    it was pretty hilarious   i also really like the charcoal color   i wish the arms were tapered a little more     my arms aren t small  but the fabric flares out quite a bit   seriously   if your arms are that big you should have to buy at a specialty shop      
175,1.0,                       the shirts are way too thin  they were advertised as a thick cotton shirt  i bought fruit of the loom ones at walmart that are way better for way cheaper  also the sleeves are way too short too      
176,2.0,                       i was looking for the high grade gildan shirts that are soft and have a nice fit   something about the way these were presented made me think they were what i was looking for  i am not going to return them because i can use them for yardwork or working out   they are not what i will be wearing out on the town      
177,4.0,                       upon reading reviews i saw a few comments saying it runs small  sad to say but y all are running large to your size beliefs i ordered a size bigger for my husband  he wears a medium   so ordered a large  it is huge   glad it was used for my toddler to make him a gift so he loves it despite of the huge size      
178,5.0,                       the shirt looked and felt amazing  mu biggest issue was my fault  i ordered large instead of medium  many brands have different sized t shirts  i m not a small guy  i m           lbs but the way my body is  you wouldn t really guess i was that heavy  so based on certain charts  that height and weight is a large  but most of my shirts are medium and a size    waist    such an odd body lol  kudos to the seller  i simply tried on one of the   shirts and immediately noticed it was way too large for me  i requested a refund and i wasn t even responsible for sending it back  that was awesome because it made it much easier for me to go back and buy the correct size      
179,1.0,                       these shirts are extremely itchy  i was wondering what was making me itch  i thought it was the laundry soap or the body wash  i put on a fruit of the loom shirt and i wasn t itching all over  that s not the only problem  they are lint magnets and they attract pet hair like crazy and they are so short  i m       when i reach up for things my abdomen is exposed      
180,1.0,                       i was looking to replace some red heathered mossimo athletic fit t shirts that i really liked  which apparently they no longer make  compared to those  the sleeves on these just don t fit nicely  the ends are to wide and they flop around a bit instead of following the curve of the arm  the color is much brighter than the picture which looks to me almost maroon  i got the antique cherry red  and i guess the red does indeed look like a bright artificial cherry red lipstick  with black specs  the threading is in a lighter shade of red  and the overall effect is just blech  unlike the picture  this also has a white tag on the inside back of the collar  which the mossimo shirts don t  they have a tagless label   i always have to remove such tags  which sometimes damages the shirt  i ended up returning the   pack      
181,5.0,                       although it s a little looser bigger than expected  it fits fine  and personally i don t mind that it s slightly loose material is good quality  and i like how it has tear away tags if you need a shirt that s tight on you  this might not be your best bet  but i imagine gildan has other shirts that fit that bill      
182,5.0,                       my go to brand for the last few years as big name brand shirts have gone down hill in quality all the while going up in price  these are cheap  fit great  wash well and hold up well  love the color choices and come in packs of two a lot cheaper than you pay for one in most brands  no shrinkage and hard to fade when washed      
183,1.0,                       save your money  it seems knock offs are taking over amazon  yet another let down on buying tshirts on amazon  the first batch  a three pack of grey  extra large t shirts i couldn t get my head through the neck hole  this last two pack had long mis cut short sleeves and shrunk in a cold wash to a short belly shirt  im the fool for trying the second time      
184,1.0,                       these shirts are so scratchy   i ve washed many times with fabric softener and it is still a stiff scratchy shirt   gildan shirts have always been my favorite   sadly not any more     
185,4.0,                       if you like a thick t shirt than these will be awesome for you i just like mine a little thinner and softer but very well made      
186,4.0,                       i know these are men s shirts but i bought them for work  men s shirts are half the price of women s    i m a   foot     pound female and ordered smalls  they fit perfect and are actually a bit snug  i would say they are smaller than an adult woman s small size normally so i am really happy with them  if i were a male that wore a small normally  i d say these are extremely small for a man  however  for my situation they are the perfect fit and size and seem to be decent quality  super soft  would purchase again      
187,2.0,                       very disappointed    ordered large and it is a very tight fit with sleeves too short and arms too tight   seems well made  but it is clearly sized wrong      
188,5.0,                       exactly what i needed  i m      and i hate when shirts stop at my belt  though they do t say it these have the  tall  fit  ideal for those who desire the  xlt  fit      
189,5.0,                       we brought these t shirts and we got   t shirt that we liked the design  but was way to small  and we could not return them  we cut out the design and added it to these t shirts with a handmade design outline that improved on the design  would highly recommend for those who want to add your design to a quality t shirt      
190,4.0,                       shirt was thick  good for winter  but i was expecting a softer material      
191,3.0,                       color is as it appears online   it has a slight stench  but hopefully  washing will resolve that   i usually get a  x in men because i m top heavy and don t like tight t shirts   i ordered this in a  x because i was hoping to wear it to the gym over a swimsuit   the shirt is slightly small for what you d expect to see in  x men s   it s a reasonable price for a  pk  and i will give the other away and keep my fingers crossed that the shirt doesn t shrink when i wash it      
192,5.0,                       shirt is very comfortable and is good quality  perfect for when i m working outside  doesn t shrink when you wash them  great for the price now i have a good to shirt for working      
193,1.0,                       the fabric on this shirt is very stiff  even after washing  i bought these for undershirts and they re way too thick and stiff to be worn under another shirt  on top of it  the sleeves have huge wings that stick out and look terrible  this shirt definitely does not hug the arms  unfortunately i ve already washed them so i m stuck with them and i will never wear them  such a waste of money      
194,5.0,                       i ordered these because they re the same brand as several band tshirts i have  they material is thick and i didn t detect much shrinking after a couple washes  it s a little on the short side though  im   feet tall and it just passes my belt buckle  i d order again      
195,5.0,                       these were gifts for my grandsons and i was very happy with these shirts i purchased  i bought   different sizes and the fit was great  i do recommend you wash them on cold water to prevent fading and dry on medium  but don t over dry      
196,5.0,                       update          i had one bad shirt out of the numerous ones i have bought over the last couple of years  i lost a lot of weight and had to order two sizes down  i went from a xxl to a large  fit and finish are great as are the materials used and the fit is just right  little to no shrinkage when washed and they hold their color very well after multiple washings  gildan is my go to brand now original review one of the two shirts didn t survive the first initial washing  the bottom hem came unraveled and now it s just plain ugly  it s a shame too because they seem like quality t shirts  soft and thick  i ll more than likely not purchase these in the future and stick to what i know and trust  despite amazon s price hikes      
197,5.0,                       these are replacing old work shirts that were the same brand  couple weeks of wearing outside in the heat sun and sweat and they re holding up well  no noticeable shrinkage after washing  my previous shirts were screenprinted and that held up well  not going to bother with screenprinting this time around      
198,3.0,                       rough and scratchy   even after numerous washings   with fabric softener   the weight is just a little heavier than i was looking for  but that could be a plus to others  i was looking to replace some worn out  and apparently discontinued  gold toe shirts that i put on every day after work  they are fairly lightweight and super soft   and are the shirts i lounge in  sleep in  and work around the house in  i have some gildan dry blend shirts that i like ok  but wanted a higher cotton ratio in hopes that these would be softer next to the skin  no such luck  they re probably scratchier than the dry blend  definitely heavier  the search continues        
199,5.0,                       bought    of these shirts in various sizes for a golf tourny  we had them  cricketed  with our logo  they turned out perfectly     the shirts were a hit  bright green just as pictured  everyone was happy  the shirts are comfy and fit for your size   we bought medium  large  xl  xxl   the gals wore medium  nice fit thanks gildan      
200,5.0,                       nice hefty weight      cotton   it s quite large but i completely tailor it to fit my sense of style ordered this duo again in red   excellent true red color   like i said  i tailor these to fit  me    love the weight      
201,5.0,                       these shirts fit my husband perfectly  he is     and     pounds  the  x fits him so nicely  they are super soft and have a slightly heavier fabric  they did not shrink    shirts for         you can t beat it       
202,1.0,                       i was very disappointed with this shirt  and i was extremely disappointed with the delivery time which took over   weeks  the shirt fits very tight and it s short  i only wore it one time and i cannot wear again because my belly shows  so very disappointing      
203,5.0,                       this is a good t shirt for everyday wear  it is well made and one should get many years of use from it  it is not s as soft as some brands one can buy  but that leads me to believe that it will last longer  as an outer wear shirt rather than an under wear shirt  i love the ones i bought in various colors and wear them simply as stand alone t shirts without an extra shirt over them  for cold days  one can slip on a long sleeved patterned shirt that matches the color of the t shirt and achieve a nice layered  comfortable look      
204,5.0,                       so far so good  i actually ordered these for  plopping   i needed some large shirts to wrap around my wet hair instead of towels  these are great for that  they are a bit stiff now  but i know with use and  washing  they will soften  even brand new  they wrap pretty well      
205,5.0,                       i was very surprised by the quality of these shirts they were so cheap  i figured they would be really thin and not real well made but i would recommend these to anyone  i bought   of them      
206,5.0,                       the fabric held its shape and size after wash   neck and shoulders fit well   since it is tubular  there is no unfit seams   colorfast   always look neat and clean      
207,3.0,                       i ordered these t shirts in a larger size for lounging and sleeping in  the material is a bit scratchy and the tag on the back of the shirt scratches the neck  overall an ok shirt for the price and it s usage      
208,3.0,                       i weigh     pounds and got a large shirt   the neck hole is too big and droops   the sleeves are massive  sized for a guy weighing     pounds   the chest and waist fit okay and the length was well below the belt  good for tucking into your jeans after washing  the material was very thin  okay for july but not for february   they were very wrinkled out of the dryer  but who wants to iron a tee shirt this shirt is very cheap and looks very cheap   if you wear it underneath another shirt it is okay   otherwise  it gives you a  guy from the homeless shelter  appearance      
209,4.0,                       i ordered a size up based on some of the reviews here  but did not share their experience  there was minor shrinkage after a couple washings  but not enough to reduce an xxl down to an xl  which is my normal size  unfortunately  i had to pass these on to someone else  but i will be buying more in my usual size because they seem comfortable  well made  and good quality for the price      
210,4.0,                       ok so this is a men s shirt and i bought it for a vinyl project    it s very thick and not super soft but comfortable    it is a little big on me but that s expected seeing as i am a woman     
211,5.0,                       these shirts work well as both undershirts and t shirts  the material is decently heavy and not see through  and the fit is not too tight   loose   otherwise unflattering  when worn as an undershirt  they don t feel heavy or suffocating  on top of that  these are inexpensive and available in a number of colors  there is a tag in the back  which is designed to be torn off iirc  but it hasn t bothered me at all  so far i haven t noticed any shrinkage from laundry i have also tried the gildan dryblend t shirts  the material on the dryblends is some kind of synthetic blend which is lighter  it s also a bit transparent  so more suitable as an undershirt and less as a t shirt  overall  i would say that i prefer the ultra cottons over the dryblends for both usages  the quality of both seems to be good though      
212,4.0,                       don t get me wrong  it s a good shirt     but is t and undershirt when i bought it  i was hoping to be able to were this out and about with jeans or something however the feel quality of the fabric doesn t justify that it s a very good undershirt though  like great for under a sweater button up or something      
213,5.0,                       very nice weight and very white     
214,5.0,                       cotton is a little rough like something you would expect in a dish cloth  excellent though for the price and to use for work  bought one size up and as expected shrank down to a perfect size after the first washing  just ordered more      
215,1.0,                       i ordered these from the us   good price  with free shipping   however  the seller shipped from the uk and charged        for shipping   been trying to resolve with no success so far   probably a software glitch but watch your invoices   i ordered the shirts from another site and the fit and quality are pretty good   i use them for work and they hold up pretty well      
216,1.0,                       got my shirts today   they are supposed to be plain t shirts but had picture and sayings on them   not happy with them   i wanted plain   will not wear them      
217,5.0,                       i really like these shirts and for the price they are great deal and they fit as expected  i got the xxl and there may have been some slight shrinkage but still very good   i like my shirts very loose and these were perfect the neck line holds well and these shirts are actually pretty thick for cotton tshirts  great quality      
218,2.0,                         months ago i bought the  heavy cotton  and it fit fine  last month i bought the  ultra cotton   and after a few washings i noticed the length in front  neck down  appeared shorter above my belt line    i measured both  after several washings and after wearing for the day   the heavy cotton was   inches longer than the ultra cotton   i will be careful in the future to buy the heavy  and not the ultra   i have no other complaints    there was a minor difference in the  thickness  but does not bother me      
219,5.0,                       i love my tshirts  they are good fabric but also comfortable  the colors are as bright as they seem  i hope they don t bleed out all their color in my first wash  all in all  it s a good buy      
220,5.0,                       my brother was starting a new job and needed some black shirts  he s a bigger sized person and i was worried these shirts would be too heavy of material for him as he sweats pretty heavily from light activity  but they fit him well and he s had no complaints      
221,2.0,                       ordered the ash grey   color is as expected and what i wanted   ordered large   but size runs very small  shirt feels like a small to me   the sleeves seems particularly short   i am       and     lbs       cotton     polyester   fabric feels coarse and uncomfortable to me  has two tags  if that is important to you   i am returning due to tight fit  coarse fabric feel  and particularly short sleeves      
222,3.0,                       i was not a big fan of the fit of these shirts  the size was as expected  but compared to the other style of gildan i have purchased before  the neck was a bit larger than i like  and the overall length of the shirt was shorter than i like  just below the belt  i won t purchase these shirts again  these have been donated to my wife  who likes to wear a large sleep shirt      
223,1.0,                       i doubt it is      cotton  it feels grainy  not soft at all it should not be described just as imported  it should indicate origin  there resides the difference the labels indicate it comes from nicaragua  well so much for their cotton quality i would not buy it again      
224,1.0,                       i ordered several t shirt colors to replace existing t shirts from land s end  tommy hilfiger and ralph lauren  i thought the price was fantastic and the photos and descriptions were inviting  what a waste of money  the t shirts were too small for a medium and the first time i washed them  they shrank some more  making them impossible to wear  i m not the type to return items  and i didn t want to give them to anyone because they were so cheap  so i threw them away      
225,4.0,                       i dislike because it could shrink if you put it in the dryer they should be preshrunk  i like that it s cotton we need more cotton in the world not plastice base material that s the real reason why i bought these shirts i will be buying more     
226,3.0,                       shrinkage is a bit of a problem    length is ok    but shrank in shoulders and chest fits tighter       buy one size up and you should be fine    altough you have to pay more in some cases  this i find kinda wrong not my fault product shrinks     they say it s made with pre shrunk material       over all made well and heavier than most should wear longer      stars because of shrinkage and having to pay more to size up in some or most cases     i should state that i dry on low temp and pull my shirts out still damp an d hang to finish drying to help avoid shrinking            
227,4.0,                       i haven t washed these shirts yet  so i cannot comment on their softness yet   however  upon wearing them right out of the package  i would say that they are slightly scratchy feeling and not super soft as advertised   i expect  nevertheless  that after they are washed with fabric softener  perhaps even without  that they will be very soft   one thing is for certain   they are very well constructed   i m not unhappy even though they do not have the silky smooth texture i was expecting right out of the package   i am exprcted a better feeling once they have been washed      
228,5.0,                       i purchased these shirts many times in various colors over the years  i am totally happy with the fit and durability  i am       and    lbs and the xxl fit the way i like my shirts to hang  not snug not flapping in the breeze and a few inches below the beltline  i suggest washing in cold water and hang dry to prevent shrinkage  i bought white this time  for ocha  and it is a perfect bright white that matches dickies painter s pants perfectly  no undershirt needed      
229,3.0,                       i have ordered many of these shirts  they seem reasonable thickness and are comfortable  it is strange that price changes based on color but as the  number of colors to choose is great  color how ever was my problem on this last one when on my screen looked like a clear set of one blue and one red shirt  what i got however was clearly one blue and one  very pink shirt  i pulled up the product on another computer to confirm it is not a monitor issue  the shirt i got is not one that could look red or pink based on lighting    its is full on pink  the shade of the blue one was also off but not as significant  the shirt is sold as  heliconia  which is pink however the shift pictured was red  lesson learned  nothing against pink but it doesn t look great on me and is not what i wanted   other than the color   which us a significant issue  there is no other complaints on the shirts      
230,5.0,                       purchased as a sleeping shirt for my husband   from other reviews  it was recommended that i order a larger size  which i did   they are very comfortable and he loves the fit      
231,2.0,                         l suit    waist    lbs   size l shrank full size in first room temp water wash reg dry cycle  also a touch of fade in charcoal grey   have used gildan ring spun cotton shirts for my company  pop  among screenprinters    super soft but crazy shrinkage  returning these and bailing on gildan for good      
232,5.0,                       over all these are great shirts  however i have to commend this company due to how quickly they first got them to me but also when i opened them the one had a flaw in it  two pack  when i posted that i needed to get them replaced due to the hole they got the replacement to me by the next day  awesome     
233,5.0,                       this is the second purchase of these shirts   i m a woman       over weight     s and am long waisted and broad shouldered  i wanted a oversized shirt not tight thru the chest as i go braless   they are long no chance of riding up when bending  over and loose enough to cover those love handles   great as a night shirt also as they cover the hips   they are just what i wanted to work around the house and in my garden   really love them wash great shrank some after washing in warm water and low heat dryer   the fit i describe is after washing   soft      cotton which makes great for stain and spills washing out   the pink shirts i ordered are not the color shone on line   they are very flourecent pink   pretty but not what i expected  but am happy with them      
234,2.0,                       these are basic  heavier weight  rough cotton t shirts with collar tags  sort of an old school    s era beefy t type t shirt   not really what most people buy  or are looking for nowadays  you can purchase a better quality solid black t shirt at k mart  walmart  or even target for less money  so i wouldn t buy these again   only time will tell how they hold up to wear and washing      
235,3.0,                       bought these for my fiance so he could get rid of his old ones with pit stains  just pulled these out if the dryer and they are very course and stiff and hard feeling  borderline cheap and sandpapery feeling  not soft at all like the others he is used to  a bit disappointing      
236,2.0,                       these shirts were obviously tagged wrong  size didn t matter though  would have sent back anyway  the shirts were extremely thin cotton  a couple of washings and they would have been good polishing cloths and not much more  sent back for full refund so that is why they are getting two stars  always buy  prime      
237,2.0,                       fit is good but the shirts are very scratchy  i ve washed them twice with lots of fabric softener cold water   to try and soften them up and they are still pretty scratchy and now noticeably fading   definitely won t be buying again      
238,2.0,                       i guess i should have looked more closely at the listing to see that some colors were for sale in the      i just went right to the color i wanted and saw      what a great price  i thought they were on sale  however  i was wrong  the picture showed   shirts because it was only    not    i m so disappointed      
239,2.0,                       first off  i was looking to replace   t shirts  i found these and they were an ok price  pretty good reviews  the material is a bit stiff  but i have noticed that the more you wash them  the softer they are getting second  the ends curl up something terrible  i have never had t shirts that curl like them  i just dont think there is enough fabric at the ends to make them not curl update  after   months  i am disappointed in these  they have done nothing but curl on the sleeves and bottoms  it is irritating  i am going to scrap these and go with some better quality teesother then the t shirt curl  these are not bad  i think they may run a bit small  or maybe they just shrank a little     
240,1.0,                       took them out of the bag  and they were covered in that starch or whatever they put on new clothes  end result they needed a wash  so i tried them on  fit fine  and washed them  once done they had hardly softened up  still very rough and scratchy compared to other brands  the shrinkage was impressive in a you got to be kidding me sort of way  this is not a brand that i will be buying again  seriously it was that bad   no value for money      
241,5.0,                       bought xl as that is the looseness that s i like in t s   after washing  they seem just about the same size   i did use cold water  hung them up still damp and stretched them out a bit   i like them   only wish they had more single color shirts than two      
242,1.0,                       the length on these shirts are very short and even shorter after you wash them  i m   ft     lbs  bought xl and should have returned these  i have bought several of these in the past and they still fit good just needed to replace them from wearing them to work  not sure why they would change the length but i will not purchase anymore and would advise anyone not to buy these  i bought these to wear to work now can only use as shop rags      
243,5.0,                       i always bought dumpy  cheap t shirts because they are under another shirt so  who cares    but on hot days  or for other reasons  that top shirt will come off so i now have a quality made shirt to hang in      
244,5.0,                       i love all the shirts i ve purchased from gildan  women s shirts tend to be oversized and form fitting and i just wanted a loose  oversized fit in a t shirt so i ordered pink and gray t shirts in the size l and they are exactly what i m looking for  the material is soft and comfy and if i ever need t shirts again  i will purchase these again      
245,5.0,                       i am            lbs and the xl fits great   granted  i have long legs and a short torso  so there is no problem tucking in  if that s your thing   works well as your primary outerware in nice weather      polyester is the key to little shrinkage and the     cotton makes for great feel  i used to buy these shirts at shopco in salem  or  but the stores closed   it s good to find them still available on line      
246,5.0,                       i used to get st johns bay colored t shirts at penneys which i wear as overshirts in the summer   there are two things i consider musts   no pocket  uncomfortable and useless  and      cotton   but lately they seem to only have     cotton     synthetic   it s easy to get      cotton white t shirts in the underwear department  why don t they use the same material for colored t shirts   i have no idea i have quite a few of the ones from penneys but not all the colors i would like   so i got a couple of   packs of these to give them a try   note that if you want      cotton you have to be careful to choose the colors that are indicated as being      cotton and not synthetic blend they do have labels  but not too big a deal just cut them off as other people have suggested   what concerned me more is that the cloth feels more coarse than that of the t shirts i am used to   the whole reason i only get      cotton is that i am especially sensitive to discomfort in my clothing   it s hell if i get a little fragment of a piece of popcorn under my t shirt but i was pleasantly surprised that these are virtually as comfortable as the all cotton t shirts i already have that use what i guess is a higher thread count material   in addition  the neck fits perfectly   the penneys ones fit pretty well  but some didn t quite feel like a perfect fit   another point  they will probably get even a bit softer after they have been washed a few times   but one washing  i always wash new clothes before wearing  is enough for these to be comfortable as to shrinkage that some customers mentioned   i got medium just like the ones i got from penneys   they may be just a tad bit tighter coming out of the dryer   however  pretty close to the same   i don t find shirts comfortable if they are tight to my skin  so with t shirts  when i put one on  i always stretch it a bit with my hands so they don t hug my stomach or arms   after doing this  the shirt fit just fine   and they should be even better after i lose a few pounds which i have got to do the other good thing about these is that they are cheap   they are fairly light weight but to me that s a plus since i get them to wear in the hot season of the year so  bottom line  for me these are keepers   i will probably buy another   or   two packs i was going to give these   stars but i am so picky and these meet so many of my finicky requirements that i figure they ve earned   stars      
247,2.0,                       they looked ok before we put on but after we washed them they shrunk pretty badd  i will go for the  x next time since the  x doesn t fit  i air dry all of my clothes so the heat doesn t get to them but oh know next time     
248,1.0,                       these shirts are very stiff   i washed them and they shrunk in length and are still very rough stuff t shirts i usually order another brand but these were cheaper and had a year away tag the material actually reminds me of those old itchy polyester shirts in the   s we had to wear at jobs      
249,3.0,                       found them in walmart years ago  but couldn t get them in my size because they were so popular   found them on amazon and no problems anymore  except when they are out of stock  recently they seems to have changed suppliers because i noticed the fit is changing a little around the neck  but still a good product for the price  i wish they had a tall version  but i can t find it on the website      
250,5.0,                       i purchased these shirts because of the price first of all  and because of the quality of the shirts described from what i read in the reviews  i am very pleased with the shirts  i read in the comments that the shirt would shrink a bit after a wash so i was prepared for that  i bought a size larger than what i would normally get  which is what i normally do when buying shirts  i would recommend the same  i am            lbs and i bought a size l  after a wash in some cold water and some drying  the shirt fits me perfect for how i like my shirts to be  the color is just fine as well  i washed it a couple of times now and the black has not faded one bit  great shirts      
251,2.0,                       i thought based on the  ultra cotton  label these shirts would be softer fit better  nope  they are rough and the crew neck part is very uncomfortable and tight  i was hoping i d be able to just wear this at home to lounge in it  but it s too uncomfortable even to do that      
252,1.0,                       i purchased these shirts because of the gilden brand  i washed these new shirts as instructed to remove the package smell  after washing i noticed the shirts shrank irregular and the material is too thin  i plan on using these shirts for work  and with that being said i ll give them a   month lifetime before they start coming apart and fade  i do not recommend purchasing these shirts for long term use      
253,4.0,                       these are pretty good undershirts but thin  i am very picky and used to the heavy carhartt shirts  i do not like thin shirts  so these are on the edge for me  i would call them a light medium weight shirt  i will bite the bullet and order the heavy expensive ones from now on to wear in the warm months   but these will suffice to wear under a long sleeve shirt in the cooler months      
254,1.0,                       do you enjoy heavy tshirts that are just a little too snug  do you enjoy getting your nipples rubbed completely raw  then  this shirt is for you  mate  not only is the stitching shoddy  but the fabric  supposedly      cotton  feels like it was made from dry oak leaves  i ve always loved gildan shirts    until now  something has gone completely wrong over at that factory best stick with fruit of the loom or hanes      
255,1.0,                       got   sizes larger than what was needed but they shrunk anyway      
256,5.0,                       i really like these t shirts  i followed other commenter s advice and ordered a size up    xl  i am a big guy and was worried that washing would shrink a  xl    ft    inches      lb   these have now been through the wash   dry cycle many times and still look and fit great  recommended
