0,1.0,                       i set this tent up in conditions that ranged from misty to steady rain that lasted    hours  as soon as i set it up  i noticed that the rain was coming directly through the walls  i put the fly  sold separately  on and that helped stop rain from coming through the top  but the wall leaks persisted we had four of the exact same coleman   person instant tents set up and mine was the only one that leaked  i assume the factory missed the waterproofing step make sure you test the tent before you drive five hours from home to use it      
1,1.0,                       tent seems durable and was set up in seconds  i set the tent up in the back yard to make sure everything worked  it started to rain and almost instantly i noticed the seams of the tent were leaking water  i m am really disappointed as this tent is supposedly rated high for being water proof  the more frustrating part was i had to speak to   different amazon representatives to coordinate an exchange  they were finally able to accommodate me and get a new tent sent  we will see in a few days if the new tent is also defective  coleman is usually a quality brand and this product had really high rating but i am very disappointed thus far      
2,5.0,                       huge and ridiculous    obviously not for backpacking    but my husband and i love it  we throw a queen air mattress in here when car camping and we feel like kings  it s so easy to set up and take down  set up is doable with just one person  possibly of a certain height  we are         take down is easiest with two to help stuff it back in the carrying case we had it set up in the midwest when a tornado y thunderstorm rolled through  we sought higher ground till it passed  when we returned  she was safe and sound and still in the ground  not completely waterproof  but we only got a bit of dew sweat on the interior walls  and nothing on the floor the only  con  i have to note  i wish there were windows on all sides  so when you are inside you can enjoy the view from all angles      
3,5.0,                       it s comfortable for a full size plus a twin sized air mattress   it sets up and takes down very easily   sets up in less than two minutes with one person  and less than five minutes to get it stuffed into the carrying bag   it fits in my subcompact car   it stayed dry through   straight hours of heavy rain   too heavy to hike any real distance with  but excellent for car camping with kids      
4,2.0,                       i have a standard   person coleman dome tent  i purchased this tent because i take many camping trips alone and my other tent can be a bit of a pain to put up by myself  had it out this last weekend to give it a try  as advertised it was very quick to set up  took a little more then    seconds just because i had never set it up before  being a cabin style tent it does have good stand room in the center  i stand        there are some thing s about this tent i will have to get use to  the door  unlike my other tent  is not centered  it is off to the right  my wife went with me and this caused a little stumbling over each other trying to get out  the door has two zippers which were a little difficult to get open in the dark  early in the morning  it has two windows up front  two large windows on the sides but  no window in the back  with only one little vent in the top ventilation was questionable  the window flaps could be rolled but they could not be tie and secured out of the way  over all a nice tent took it for the first time on my own  again was easy to set up  this trip it did rain  rain fly is useless  unless you have the windows zipped all the way up  you are going to get wet  then windows up  no ventilation  got hot inside real fast  door is a real pain at night in the dark to get in and out of  don t be in a hurry      
5,1.0,                       disappointing  i ve been an avid supporter of coleman products for many years due to the affordability and quality of their products  i ve owned a   person dome tent for nearly    years that has never leaked  never blown over  never given me trouble  me and my wife just got a little older and decided we needed something we could stand up in and use a cot in  so we bought this  the design engineer missed the boat on this and so did quality control  i ve tried different methods to try to get the tent to be taut and tight on all four slopes  but i just can t do it  it needs at least one more connection to the corner support poles on each corner because it bags and sags three quarters of the way up the corner  this causes a sag on the interior that reduces space and helps worsen the leaking  it has a loop for a stake midway between the corners in the front and back but not on the sides  it needs one because you can t keep the floor taut without them leaking  leaking and more leaking  amazing that this didn t come with a rain fly  no  not amazing  ridiculous  where didn t it leak  this was not a hurricane   just some simple showers  it leaked at every corner floor joint  every window leaked even when zippered completely shut  the door leaked  who designed the door zipper  fire that person  the zipper on my dome tent is perfect   why did someone think that needed to be changed  the windows all leaked along the bottom seam  why  because the side slopes can t be made taut  it rains down  water runs down the sides and collects at the bottom of the window  it has no place to go but in the tent   it s as if someone designed it that way   the only way to prevent that leakage is to install a second shelter   or tarp   over the tent with sides  back and front that extend beyond the bottom of the window  i looked at the rain fly you can buy for this tent  and i don t think it does that  the leaking seam at the corners and where the floor connects just seems to be poor quality workmanship  i gave it a second and third coat of seam sealer and it did reduce the amount of leaking  but didn t eliminate it  i brought the tent home  set it up and let it dry out real good  then gave it a fourth really heavy dose of seam sealer at all seams  we ll see if that helps  i also designed my own rain tarp out of an old shelter frame i had that i will put over the tent next time  that s ridiculous to have to put up a shelter to put my tent under  ridiculous  why am i even giving this a three     i guess because i can stand up in it  it goes up quickly  and it fits my queen size cot with room to spare update i ve decided to get a new tent  not a coleman  the engineering and quality of this tent was just horrible  i ve coated the tent inside and out with at least   applications of silicone spray and several coats of seam sealer on all seams  i even caulked the floor to wall seam with clear silicone caulk  i noticed in the pictures that there are   pole to tent clips on each corner  mine only had    so i added tarp clips on the corners where it was sagging  the walls sagged so i added tarp clips on the sides to tighten the walls and floor  see pictures  i bought the rain fly  it rained tonight and the interior is soaked  water leaked right through the walls and especially at the base of the windows  i m leaving next sunday for a week camping in the up of michigan  i hope my new tent gets here in time  really  i recommend you do not by this tent      
6,5.0,                       so we were a little hesitant on making this purchase after reading the   star and below reviews   however  some close friends and camping partner family own this tent   here is what we did step     order the tentstep    order tent seam sealerstep    order rain fly  no brainer people step     when tent arrives excitedly open box  and set up in the living room  optional  and be sure to check with your spouse first as this did not go over well with mine step    take down tent from living room and set up again outside    use the seam sealer around all seams inside and outside the tent liberally  or follow directions on sealant product step    put rainfly on tentstep    connect garden hose and prepare leaf blower for weather simulation testing step    after waiting desired time for sealant to set  simulate various types of rain storms from gentle drizzle to driving hurricane force rain  do this at your own risk and be sure to roll up windows  on your spouses car when aiming simulated rain in that direction step    now using your leaf blower blast your tent with simulated wind levels from gentle meadow breezes to hurricane level   winds if you have a   speed leaf combo snow blower  again  do this at your own risk step      stake down your tent then redo step    then apologize to your spouse for crushing her flowers during all the simulated test i found that the tent is not made for     psi garden house spray down at full forces     however  there was minimal leaking  and i think that was from spraying right at the zipper   when using in a true rain fashion there was no leaking after a    minute soaking   the blower was a little over the top  but even after rolling my unstaked tent into my wifes flowers the tent took all i threw at it   i was going to repeat all the test and make a video to attach with this review but was advised  told  by my wife that i wasn t going to do that    argh thanks coleman for a great tent   set it up in less than    seconds and take down was just as simple  and i had a blast with my homemade weather simulation testing      
7,4.0,                       this tent is fantastic for camping solo or with one other person   super easy to put up and take down   remember all those times you got home and decided you didn t want to set your tent back up and dry it out  only to regret that decision next time you went to use the tent   that is not an issue with this tent as its so easy to pop up  you won t mind letting it dry out i m giving     stars because this tent leaks water when there is a heavy rain   nothing i can t deal with  but the seams at the top and sides allow water to come in   being totally honest i did not waterproof the tent so had i done that  it may have solved the issue      
8,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          when i bought this dark room tent  there were no reviews on it  only reviews on other coleman tents  so  while we haven t camped in it yet  we did throw it up in the front yard to make sure everything was in good shape  i wanted to put this review out there for anyone who is as curious as i was straight off  i ll address the main concern i had  and that was the amount of light the tent lets in  it s hard to describe  but it definitely blocks a lot of light  it s difficult to see inside the tent with everything zipped up  even in the middle of the day  although we did not do it in direct sunlight   it s as dark as my baby s room during the day  and he has two layers of blackout curtains over his window  i ll share pictures  but they really don t do it justice  it s very dark  i approve the downside of that is the tent is probably going to be warm during the day  it is sprayed with a coating to give it the dark room effect  no bad smell  btw   and that also acts as insulation  that will be great during cold nights  but maybe not great for baby s nap time in    degree heat  we bought a battery operated fan to push some air through one of the screens without having to have everything opened up during our son s naps  if he naps at all we ll see  one thing i don t love about the tent is that the zipper on the curved hinged door is a pain to open and close  although the door itself is super cool   the flaps that i suppose are there to keep rain out are sewn in in different directions and it snags on those  plus the zipper was a tad sticky  i hope beeswax will fix the problem  it wasn t bad enough to make me not love the tent  though  it is still worth every penny looks cool too the tent is huge and we can comfortably stand up inside  it was very easy to set up  we didn t even have to look at instructions  one downside to this type of pop up tent is that it s heavier than a traditional pole tent  worth it for sure  though another thing some people will love  but i don t  is that there are entrances on both ends of the tent  because we have three young kids  we want to be between them and the door  we re planning to put a small padlock on the zipper of the back entrance  that way nobody will easily get in or out on that side we thought found this exact same tent at costco for     more than amazon  we actually bought it because we weren t sure if the amazon one would come in time  when it did come  we compared the two  there was an obvious size difference  amazon one was in a much larger box   but the tent dimensions were the same  it was a puzzle to us until we opened it up and figured out that the larger one  this amazon one  is an instant pop up tent and the smaller one from costco is a quick set up tent  but is not an instant pop up tent  mystery solved that s really all i can report on so far because we haven t camped in it yet  but since there were no reviews on it  i wanted to get this up here with some pictures  i ll update this review after our camping trip coming up if this review was helpful  please hit the  helpful  button so other people can find it too      
9,5.0,                       i cannot recommend this   person cabin more  its not to be used backpacking only out of vehicle camping  my gf and i set this up in no time  make sure to purchase the rain fly and tent kit for the mallet and upgraded steaks  held up to a thunderstorm all weekend in grand canyon the very first time we used it  fit a queen bed with about     feet of free space left on the entrance door side  i even put big coals in my solo stove and and the tent was     while it was around    outside at night  ventilation was great even in the rain with the fly   highly recommended for expedition vehicles i will surely have this for years      
10,1.0,                       leaks like a sieve   i have had several of the instant tents from coleman  two of the larger sizes and one other in this size they were all superior  they never leaked one drop of rain and they were very wind resistant   the first thing i noted after i set this up on a chilly autumn day  was how drafty and cold it was compared to my other tent  the same tent  just a few feet away   then it rained   while one tent remained warm and dry  this new tent was cold and soaking wet  standing water on the inside  the walls covered in water drops in their entirety   i cannot return this tent because i bought it in      and had it in storage until  my original one wore out   it was the fall of      when i set it up the first time   i will reorder a new one because i love this tent   but i imagine i will have a       shot at a weather proofed product   other reviews are saying the same thing shame on you coleman for selling faulty tents   and for saying that they have a special weather tec design  your faithful customers are getting soaked in the tent and in the pocket book      
11,5.0,                       best tent ever   my husband and i set up the tent in under a minute   either of us could have set it up alone we used this tent without the rainfly   sold separately  in    degree temperature   it was cold and the interior walls were damp with condensation  but tolerable the windows on all sides are great we fit our two double high full size air mattresses inside with room for bags and etc would fit a toddler air mattress in between our two with still room at our feet for bags we added a small tarp by the opening to make a porch for wiping shoes before entering the zippers are good quality and easy to open i m      and can stand up all the way inside   my husband is      and can mostly stand up      
12,1.0,                       i purchased the    man green and teal version and couldn t wait to set it up for my first night   after making sure all of the poles were extended and locked in position  i staked it down as instructed  definitely a two man woman job   immediately  the entire side caved in   i tried closing all of the windows and that helped    for a brief second  but collapsed again   no point in buying this tent unless you live where is there is no breeze   wind was around    mph which shouldn t have brought this tent down   poles seem flimsy   this review gets one star because the size was perfect and tent was roomy   i m truly disappointed as this was the tent i searched long and hard for      
13,5.0,                       very happy with this tent so far   i haven t been able to set it up and use it in rainy weather yet  so i ll have to report back later on weatherproofing this tent set up just as quickly and easily as my previous instant tent did   it takes a little getting used to the  solid hinged door   as it relies on a pole system on the outer rim that zips up in the door   once figured out  all was good  but it sucks having a second zipper running along the outer edge of the door  as this can get confusing as myself and one other person already mistook it during first use as a regular zipper to open the door pro   because of the dark nature of this tent  it seems to be a thicker material and did a good job cutting down wind on a breezy and chilly night   something not advertised in the ability of this tent to say that it cut down on the amount of light coming in would be an understatement   there s nearly no light let in and most of it that does come in comes through a zipper or two that you haven t fully met up on the doors or windows i will keep this updated once i get a full season out of this tent   hopefully      
14,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this is a good tent under most weather conditions i have used this tent for nearly   years at scouting campouts  our scouts tend to be rainstorm magnets and this tent has endured quite a bit  i have never sealed the seams or done anything extra to the tent  i ve used it and the rainfly straight from coleman  the tent and i have endured rain and wind and faired very well  once i had to sleep in the center of the tent because of the way the wind was blowing the sides of the tent in  and there was some water around the edges  but we survived  until this last weekend we had a day of high winds and an evening of storms with continued high winds  the clips attaching the rainfly to the tent were unable to hold the fly on  but the guylines kept it from blowing away   see attached video    in illustration  port a potty was lifted off the ground and tipped over   during that extended straight line wind  after a day of enduring the wind  the stakes gave up and my tent with cot  foam tile square floor  rubbermaid storage containers and everything inside  began rolling away  we chased it down and it took   of us to drag it back  but the tent survived we restaked the tent and tried again  this time  the stakes held  but the tent did not  the tent legs broke free from where they were attached to the base of the tent at the corners causing the tent to collapse   see attached photo   one tent pole was bent under the pressure  at this point  i went and slept in my truck this tent has endured some pretty intense storms before and done fine  this one was just too much  a friend with a similar tent was able to tie his tent to a fence and he faired much better all in all  it s a great tent  after rolling away and later collapsing  i believe it only has one damaged tent pole that i will look into replacing  we will continue to use this tent  although  i will look for a lower profile tent for campouts with thunderstorms in the forecast      
15,4.0,                       it s a fine tent  and i gave it   stars because i think that s fair  even though i wish i hadn t bought it i also have the   person version  which i really love  but i bought this   person version to use for camping when it s just my wife and i  it seemed more sensible   i mean  a    person  tent should be plenty for   adults  right  well  not really in the   person version those adults can stand up  not so  in this   person version  also  it is very  very difficult to get in and out of this tent when someone is sleeping on the door side  if it could zip open on either side  that would be ideal  the getting up in the middle of the night to  go  situation is what makes me really regret having purchased this tent one more thing to know about these tents    when put away  they are much much larger than a regular tent of similar size  concern about storage and transportation was the main reason i didn t just get another   person of the same type considering that the price difference between the   and   person versions is so tiny  i d only recommend the   person for kids  adults  who tend to use inflatable air mattresses or cots won t be as happy  while they technically fit  it s just to awkward to move around in there now  for a single adult  this tent would be fine      
16,1.0,                       very disappointing  this is the second coleman tennis we ve bought in   years  the first one was a      person and it was unmanageable for me to open it when it was wet  post rainy camping trip   i m      and pretty strong but i couldn t get it open  poles stuck and thevtebt kept flopping over  too heavy to open and prop up to dry out  a pole snapped at a bending point and that was the end  it lasted   camping trips this   person tent we used for    again it got wet   st time i had nothing problem opening it to air out  now the  nd time after airing it out  another rainy camping trip i tried to close it carefully and a pole snapped right at the top center point inside  i also noticed a screw was missing that bolts one of the plastic brackets to the top on another pole   i m beginning to think these tents aren t made so we ll no matter what size you buy      
17,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          the support pole was on backward  if i did not have a small phillips on hand for another reason  i would have had a much worse experience  the black coating that is supposed to block light is full of holes that let light in  the knot used to hold tension on the guy line was too small and easily slipped through  it was easily corrected when i set up the tent for the first time but  i am not being paid to assemble tents  that is what i paid coleman to do  i made a video to further illustrate the details i do not trust this coating to last  i do not trust the quality system at coleman  that means that i do not trust the people at the top that create the priorities they have established  that means that i will not be purchasing coleman products  there is a coleman factory in our area  i would like to support the home town team           
18,4.0,                       if you are looking for a roomier tent that you can stand up in and to blockout the early morning sun this is the tent for you we are a family of   with three boys        i bought this tent because we wanted one that was easy to assemble  block sunlight for those times when we need to put the kids down for a nap or earlier bedtime or to sober up with a nap mid day  our tent was up within   minutes with two adults  i do recommend setting it up once or twice before camping because it is a bit confusing if you ve never had an instant pop up tent we camped in the colville national forest in wa next to the lake and there was a thunderstorm our second night camping we had already sprayed the tent with water resistant spray and i would say the tent help pretty well  there was a few leaks but it s to be expected with any tent mostly at the corners the walls were damp to the touch but it did pour rain for about    hours so i can t complain  if you are experiencing rain i recommend spraying it first and don t put anything in the corners of the tent just to be safe we had two queen air mattresses could easily fit a  rd but i prefer a twin for the  rd mattress to there is still enough room for clothes bag and changing area my favorite parts is that while all the other campers were awake at    am we were still sleeping because of the blackout affect my kids didn t wake up till  am  and the door has a pole that allows it to be closed but not zipped so my kids are messing up the zipper each time they go in and out durning the day only zipped it up for bedtime our tent was the tent to have  my brother who has a fairly new tent and is     was like i need this tent like now and he camps more then me and had a brand new baby  would recommend to all my family and friends who love to camp i will post an update after our next camp trip with more visual pictures and possible improvements for weather protection      
19,5.0,                       i just got this tent today  so of course i haven t actually camped in it yet  but i went right out and set it up  it went up so fast  and it was almost accidental   just by handling the poles  it almost set itself up  if it took a full minute  it didn t take a second more than that  and i wasn t even trying to see how quickly i could do it because the tent doesn t come with a rain fly  i also got a   x   tarp to go with it  and i hung that over the tent when i set it up today  with guy lines holding the tarp nice and snug and draped down over the tent  it looks like i will be able to keep the windows halfway down in a rainstorm and still be fine  that s a lot better coverage than the official coleman rain fly for this tent i wish it had a floor vent  but with four huge windows and a ceiling vent  i think it should be more than fine  i have a standard issue u s  army cot that will fit inside with plenty of room left over  i m using this tent to solo camp  do yourself a favor and buy some good quality tent stakes  my tent didn t come with any stakes  and i m not sure if it was supposed to   but i ve read a ton of reviews that said the coleman stakes are garbage  so i ordered some good metal official issue army tent stakes  if i end up bending those  i must be talented the tent is very roomy inside  and i love being able to stand upright in it   that was one reason i chose this model  it s called a six person tent  but don t kid yourself  six people would have to really  really  really like each other to squeeze into this tent  i do think it could fit four without their gear  or fewer with some gear  two people would love this tent and have plenty of room  since i m camping solo  it s like a small house for me recommended  absolutely      
20,1.0,                       brought this tent so that we would have a little more headroom than our dome tent  i soooo hate this tent  had read other reviews about purchasing the rainfly and sealing the tent before use to make it extra water proof  so i did  sealed the tent and separate rainfly  both seam sealer and spray on sealer  not only once but twice before our trip  so i did   coats of sealing  the first night of use we had a short down pour     leaked     walls on the inside were wet and dripping from the storage nets inside  second night     a steady rain and we woke up with saturated pillows  sleeping bags  and you could literally watch the rain running down the inside of the tent  i am not an inexperienced camper and have owned multiple tents     this is by far the worse tent purchase i have ever made   we wound up driving all the way back home to switch out this tent for the smaller ozark trail tent that we had been using for   years  without ever sealing mind you      and  drying our pillows and bedding  we left this tent in the dumpster at the campground       do not buy this tent       worst purchase ever      
21,1.0,                       this tent is awful  i don t usually write long reviews but i need to for this one because this was so bad good it s meant to have standing room so it does a better job of that than dome tents looks good easy to set up bad door  the door opens only on the right side and only half way  so if you sleep on the opposite side  you have to crawl everything and everyone to the zipper  then crawl over everyone to get out and the same to get back in  the door is also difficult to close because there is tension in the top corner so you literally have to pull the door up towards the wall for the zipper to close  insane small inside  my version was for     people  there is no way   people fit in there  barely fits a queen inflatable mattress for two people and their stuff  the floor space is severely limited by the door design  maybe that s why an equivalent dome tent would feel more roomy heavy and very bulky  it is very heavy and very bulky  even for a  small    person tent  i have another tent that is a dome tent and it s about   feet across and a radius of a bout   inches when packed  this is about     feet across and a radius of     feet across  it is gigantic  even when packed  furthermore  after unpacking it for the first time turns out that it doesn t pack back into the same bag    knowing this  the bag is designed to be ripped in the middle in order to expand it when packing it back up  what   so when you leave for camping it takes up x amount of space  but when i came back it took up  x amount of space in my car   awkward windows  there are three windows which all unzip down  but they are not under a rain cover  so you are exposed when they are open  so much for standing room lack of ventilation  if the windows are rolled up the only ventilation you get is a small   inch slit in the top  no air goes in or out material absorbs moisture  i don t what this material that they use  but it absorbs condensation overnight and then whatever is touching the walls is wet  my pillow was wet  my clothing was wet  and this is camping in very dry woods in the middle of the summer does not come with a rain cover  it didn t rain when i was camping  but the sloping sides and open windows would presumably just let the water completely in  so if you are in rain  you have to completely close all the windows  if you do that you are in a sauna summary  don t buy this tent  however  my friends have the   person version  and for the two of them it seems to work a bit better  because no issues with door access and cramped spacing      
22,1.0,                       i purchased this tent in june      specifically because of the  video  showing only a microscopic amount of water entering the tent during a simulated rain test   i have used the tent   times   the first two times i was in the desert during the dry season   the tent was great   the third time i used the tent was in big sur  california   this time my wife and young son were with me   i knew it was going to rain the first night  but i had no worries because of the video   i assured my wife  all would be good and that any rain we experience will be far less intense than the simulated storm in the video   i told her  no water would get into the tent    the first night  as forecast  it rained   the rain was not intense like in the video  but it did rain consistently for many hours   by morning  there was well over a gallon of water pooled on the floor of the tent   the rainwater did not come in through a hole or seam in the tent   rather  it permeated through the entire surface area of the top and the walls of the tent   fortunately  we were on cots and tall air mattresses   if not  we would have been drenched in cold rainwater      
23,2.0,                       i really wanted to like this tent  the setup is amazing  it s super impressive  but    first time out  a window zippper broke  they are super cheap and flimsy so i m sure it won t be the last  the points where the tent connect to the frame are already splitting  they will won t last one that really got me was this is not a   person tent  not even close  maybe six small people shoulder to shoulder with absolutely no gear  my petite wife  seven year old son and i were cramped   with three day packs for one night  i d go so far as to say this false advertising   very misleading and yes putting it up is great  so easy   even the mechanisms that hold the bars at the top are super solid and well built  but unfortunately it s pretty much a gimmick because of taking it down  there is no easy  clean way to do it  i felt like i was surely going to rip a side as i squeezed poles together and crammed it into the bag  unless you know how to pack a parachute  it s a mess  better hope your site is pretty clean oh  the fly  i had to buy a fly separately  come one man  that thing probably costs a buck to make if this tent had heavier duty zippers  reninforced stress points at the pole connection  and a more effective way to pack it   it would be an incredible purchase  but i guess it would cost a ton more if ya do a trip a year in good weather  by some ductape and enjoy  otherwise look elsewhere  i think coleman should stick to stoves for now  oh or sleeping bags  my wife loves hers disclaimer  i just got back from our trip and just set the tent back up to dry it out completely from condensation   and attempt to pack it up neatly   currently frustrated because i just can t get it      
24,5.0,tents come in many shapes and sizes  each have their positives  and their negatives  some tents are cheap  while other s  really expensive  the best tent for you  is going to depend on what you need from a tent  and how much money you are willing to spend  most people who like to camp in the summer time  will probably be satisfied with a tent like this one  while other s who camp in extreme cold temperatures  might be inclined to go with one of those super thermal padded tents   packaging  coleman loves to double pack these tents  when you receive your package  and open it up  it reveals the coleman bag as seen in photo    if you unzip the coleman bag  it reveals another box  once you open up that box  finally  you will be able to pull your tent out of the box to begin deploying   dimensions  the dimensions of the tent are     feet long  by   feet wide  and   feet tall  i chose a tent this big because i wanted enough space  however  they always overstate a tents capacity  it may fit up to   small children  but in reality  this tent can only house up to   adults  and up to   adults comfortably   pitching  pitching the tent  is not as quick as the company says  which should be no surprise to no one  if you had   people working together  you could perhaps do it in    seconds  however  i pitched it all by myself  and it took closer to   minutes  when you compare this design to a dome tent however  you will take much longer to set one of those up  all you have to do  is stand the spider column  as i call it  upright  then unfold each leg  until the tent is flat on the ground  then begin extending each leg of the tent  until the button snaps through the slots  again  it will be a bit cumbersome for   person to do  however  still faster then setting up a dome tent   once the tent is pitched  and you ve stretched all the legs outward  then begin setting up your guidelines  if your tent is on earth  you can use the included stakes they give you  to stake the tent down using the guidelines  additionally  if you plan to camp on days where it will be raining  you really need to waterproof the tent with the optional rainfly accessory  model             the rainfly is nearly impossible to put on  via   person  once the tent has been pitched up  i recommend   people to install the rainfly  the rainfly secures to the tent via plastic c clips  and the rainfly comes with its own stakes and guidelines  to secure to the earth   ingress  the tent has only   entry point  the front door  and unlike most tents  which the door spans the entire front half of the tent  this tent s door  only opens     of the front opening  i would have liked to have seen the full width being used  there are instant popup tents that are larger in size  that do use full width doors  as typical with all tents  it is double zippered  so you can close and open it from within   windows  this tent is fully loaded when it comes to windows  there is literally windows on every side of this tent  all of them have   zippers per window  each window has a mesh screen to keep bugs out  and each can be rolled down and secured with the knobs they provide  the reason they didn t use the full width for the door  is because they wanted to put a window next to the door as well  so rest assured  if your camping in the summer time  you are going to get plenty of ventilation   vents  now this is where i can be a bit nit picky when it comes to vent locations  on larger tents  they often put the vents close to the bottom of the tents  usually located in the back  or on the sides of the tent  but they chose to put the vents on the top of the tent on this model  i guess if your camping in the summer time  since heat rises  having them on the top makes sense  but if your camping in the winter time  its only going to let all the heat out  and if your running propane heaters  such as the buddy heater  you really want it to intake air from the bottom of your tent  also  if you close the vents  there is still no way to make them seal in their closed position  so they will still vent when you don t want them to  the vents also come with zipper meshes  as well as the velcro strap that keeps them open   material  the materials that this tent consist of     d polyester  and taffeta    d  they use taped seams  inverted welded seams  and use rugged polyguard  i m not an expert on tents  so i can t tell you the values of these materials  or how they are constructed  what i can tell you  is that no integrated weathertek system is going to completely waterproof the tent without the rainfly accessory  however  for a super light sprinkle  you can get away with it   for the most part  this tent feels like quality to me  a lot of times  companies will cheap out on the zippers  but these ones seem pretty good  the material makeup of the tent seems fairly solid  and the aluminum legs also seem pretty good  the spider column was fairly easy to work with when setting up the tent  so i think it is durable enough as well  do i think the materials would hold up in winds up to   mph or more  no  absolutely not  but who s camping in stormy winds   accessories  the tent comes with several accessory points that i like  outside the tent above the door  there is a loop where you can hang a lantern  mosquito repellent  etc  inside the tent are two mesh pockets  one close to the door on the side of the tent  and the other on the back half of the tent  on the other side  these mesh pockets can be used to store cell phones  keys  lighters  emergency supplies  pretty much anything you need small pockets for  the tent also comes equipped with a lantern hanger  but if your lantern only has a handle instead of a hook  you will need to use a carabeener to attach to the lantern hanger   experience  most of you are going to use a tent to go camping  while i would love to go camping personally  i no longer have a vehicle  so i have no access to camping sites  instead  i am thinking outside the box  and solving a problem i have  i lease my workshop  therefor i do not own the building  when you are leasing  its illegal for the renter to make changes to the building  its up to the person who owns the building to do that  the sheet metal roof of my workshop leaks when it rains  when it snows heavy  snow also falls in from the ridge cap  and since my shop is not insulated  it gets mighty cold in there during the winter time  there is just no way to heat it   note  absent t land owners are not fun  they don t consider you important  and they refuse to fix problems  but they love to go numerous vacations every year all over the world  with the money they make from your rent payments  capitalism at work fellas   to solve this issue  i bought this tent  i knew that it would solve two problems for me  first  keep the rain off of my most important machines  and provide heat to keep the freezing cold at bay  also  i wanted a space where i could do work in warmer temps  as you can see from the pictures  the tent fits the available space i have in the shop quite well  i ran an electrical cord up through the top vent  so that i can have power to run a light  space heater  and a charger   i used a    watt led worklight as my light source  i just used a small bungee cord wrapped around the light s frame several times  then put both the hooks onto the lantern hanger attachment  while it may be crude  it works  and thats all that counts  i run the space heater on low  its set to    degrees f  and it oscillates to move the heat around  when i am not working in the tent  i store my   best mowers inside  and a scooter  the mower closest to the camera  i actually bought on amazon   i use an outdoor wireless thermometer to monitor the temp inside the tent  thats how i dialed in the heater  also  to protect the tent floor from tearing  as i am moving heavy equipment in and out of it  i chose to line the floor with cardboard  and taped the cardboard together  and since i unfortunately do not have carpet material  i chose to just staple some blankets to the cardboard  if anybody has any knowledge on where i can get carpet to line this square footage on the cheap  please let me know   when the temperature is in the    s  i am able to maintain    degrees f with the heater on low       watts  when the temperature is in the    s  i am able to maintain    degrees f  if i through the heater on high        watts  i could easily hit the mark of    degrees f while its in the    s out there  but i don t want to use that much power on my bill  so i chose not to  for those of you who plan to use a propane buddy heater  make sure your vent is open  otherwise you will burn up all your oxygen and become asphyxiated  a propane heater generally puts out more btu s of heating power  but at a price of consuming propane   conclusion  i am known to do things in unique ways  and this tent is no exception  while this tent is a very simple solution to a larger problem  it is both cost effective  ingenuitive  and it just works for me  nobody can wait on absent t owners to handle things  and there was no way i was going to spend      dollars of my own money to insulate the workshop and fix the roof leaks  i really love my tent  it works really well  and i think you will love it too  if you choose to buy it  despite a few of my nit picks  i am going to give this a solid   out of   stars 
25,4.0,                       my wife and i camp upon our lake property every weekend   we use this coleman    person dark room cabin tent to suit our needs for the last   months of use   pros  it fits a queen sized air mattress and end tables quite well  plus a camping chair and storage totes   the floor is made of tarp material  and has held up well to constant dirt  foot traffic  and dragging things along it   the dark room tech is great   i get to sleep in when the sun comes up  however  it s still a tent and the material doesn t block the sunlight as much as a dark  thick curtain would on a window   the rainfly is great too because not only does it latch on to the tent stake down points  has its own lines to stake down  but it also connects itself to the tent poles too using velcro   and what more  the seams are already sealed for you   i also like the zippered hole for an extension cord  rather than folded tent material or velcro cons   we ve survived a severe thunderstorm in this tent already   i used weatherproofing spray  kiwi brand  and coleman s own seam sealer  and not a drop of rain landed on us   however  water did slowly drip in through the bottom seams of the windows  and where the tent material meets the tarp floor  were some leaks too   end result was a few tiny puddles of water along the sides of the tent  not even a cup worth of water   but otherwise the tent held up like a champ to a very harsh and long downpour with a bit of wind too   also  the tent poles tend to twist and bend sometimes making extending the poles a bit tricky to do  or folding the tent up hard to do   which you will not be able to get this tent back in the bag so easily   the main tent stakes are good and strong  the rainfly tent stakes are weak and i recommend replacing those   lastly  the pole for the door broke on us   it s supposed to bend as part of being the door  but i guess not strong enough to withstand constant use conclusion   great tent   very pleased with the product   just make sure you waterproof the tent and rainfly  and you ll be okay   lastly  we ve had some cold nights at the lake  upper   s  lower   s temps  and this tent does not hold in heat due to the mesh top  protected only by the raised rainfly   recommended summer use only      
26,3.0,                       this tent took on more water than expected that became a bit burdensome having to deal with removing it every few hours my son and i just returned from a   day camping trip in the snow up at buck creek  which is at the base of crystal mt there was a good foot of snow whe we arrived  but was fairly clear under the trees it snowed mildly on the first day and we did add the rain fly when we erected the tent the    second erection time is no joke  i just wish it had lived up to its other expectations i placed a tarp on the ground and folded the exposed edges under the tent as is standard tent protocol  within the first couple hours my son noticed drips at almost every seem running down the side while we were inflating our beds and rolling out bags  i placed towels there to collect the water at the bottom edges and moved our pads away from the walls we left for a few hours to unload the truck and set up our camp area i sent my son back to the tent to grab something and he yelled for me to come there quick when i got there i had noticed that the towels were now soaked and water was leaching way from then i rang them out and replaced them the snow increased on day two and we got about   inches overall luckily for us the temps dropped and froze the water overnight  we woke up to a bunch of water around and under our pads in the first morning after sleeping in the tent  and had to deal with water intrusion all day until the temps dropped i will be reaching out to coleman because i have feeling that perhaps my tent was a manufacturing defect  i ve had numerous coleman tents in my    years and never had an issue like this i gave this   stars simply based on my experience with my particular tent also be known that this was a brand new and first time use experience because of their history of quality tents  i m going to exchange it and give it another shot we left after     
27,5.0,                       my experience it was about   pm when we got to the campsite and it immediately started raining   i had the tent maybe half way up when the ranger decided now would be a perfect time to take care of check in   as we discussed the rules and regulations of the camp site  it rained harder and harder   finally  after about    minutes  i was able to finish the tent it already had water in it as the rain fly was still not attached but my wife and i powered through it   that s when it really started raining   couldn t get a fire started  realized the jacket i brought wasn t water proof  gave up on the rain tarp to cover food and equipment   we all huddled into the tent it must have rained heavily for about   hours   and when it wasn t heavily raining  it down poured until about   am  when we woke up the next morning  there was about   cups of water total in the tent   we learned if anything is touching the sides of the tent  water would easily come through   if nothing was touching  it did pretty well i would still give this tent   stars as i had seam sealer and water proof spray      in the car   if i would have sprayed beforehand  i don t think a single drop would have made it in   for the price of this tent  adding sealer and water proofing spray is a requirement   i got the kiwi camp dry  it ll take about   cans i also added a sunshade rain fly to the entrance   when you step out of the dark tent  the sun can take a little time to adjust to      
28,2.0,                       so this tent seems to be a love it or hate it affair for people on here  i can see how some people would like it but it really was not for me and it does leak some and gets you wet with condensation in any case i took this tent to maine as we were car camping and then day hiking katahdin pros    the tent is huge  you can stand up in it and the floor space and vertical style walls make it feel very big    the tent does set up in      minutes cons    water water everywhere  you get wet  the first night camping it was going to be cold so i closed the windows but left the top vents open  i was awoken an hour into my sleep with cold wet water dripping on my face  i immediately sprung to action thinking i needed to start sealing the tent up as it must be raining  well it was not  the tent is so airtight that i was having the condensation from the roof dripping on me  this occurred with the top vents open and with only   people in the tent  i then half opened all the windows  this made it quite cool and still did not solve the condensation issue it continued to drip all night waking me periodically  the next night we were hit by a rainstorm  there were several leaks that i had to fix  i also had nearly a cup of water dumped on my head but was quick and caught it  on the top of the tent near the vents a puddle had begun to form i was able to guide it to the side of the tent before it came through the vent screen  since it was raining all the windows had to be closed so i still got very wet from condensation  there are several hooks to hang things inside the tent on the center of the walls  these seemed to wick water in from the outside i therefore cannot recommend this tent based on the fact that no matter what you will get wet  but wait there is more      weight and size  the tent is very heavy and the bag it comes in quite large  you could have trouble getting this in some vehicles    breakdown  while set up is breeze breakdown is not  this took almost    minutes to break down  also make sure you open all the vents as this is a big plastic bag and if you don t you will never wrap it up unless you reset it up climb inside and open them  it took   people to do this task and we still had a hard time getting it back in the bag overall this was just too bulky  too wet  and too difficult to pack and travel with  i learned a lot from this tent my tent advice    get something smaller and lighter  even when car camping set up breakdown and packing your car will be easier with something smaller  plus you can take something smaller on a hike as well    get something that breathes  there are tents that keep the rain out and don t drip condensation  a dome with a rain fly will allow humidity out through the mesh onto the rain fly and then down the side of the rain fly  this is a better design than a one for all  water proof  tent like this    set it up and break it down before you need it at home  this was you know all the ins and outs ahead of time  it also allows you to test for missing or broken parts      
29,2.0,                       i bought   of these about a month apart because i was so impressed with the ease of putting it up  but the   i received were slightly different despite being made in the same location  having identicle model numbers only one had a  built  date of november      and the other march of       the newer one leaked like a sieve through the material  the sweat from the rain and humidity just leaked right through  this had nothing to do with the seams  the material was put together fine  it leaked right through the material  and after owning them both for a year the one that leaked has a weird sticky feeling inside like its melting rubber    so weird  older one is also about    taller at the center and the material is slightly darker brown  i am truly disappointed with the quality control        is not good odds of purchasing a faulty tent  i gave it   stars for the one that worked      
30,5.0,                       we love this tent  for our family of     bernese mountain dog  it gives us all of the room that we need and then a little extra  it s perfect for us for our rare  x a year camping excursions and also for movie nights in our backyard  the darkening feature   size was a major selling point for me as i don t typically enjoy sleeping on the floor outside and waking up when the sun wakes up  when this happens  i ll let you know how i feel about it  however  i can tell you that it is so dark and much cooler in there even during the day  so much so that i d definitely enjoy a peaceful afternoon nap in there   can t speak on the waterproof weatherproof aspect as i d simply refuse to ever go camping in the rain  so from a glampy mom who sleeps inside while her husband camps in the backyard with the kids  i would highly recommend this tent to every quarantined mom with age appropriate children looking for a peaceful evening inside with a bottle of wine while she catches up on bravo television      
31,3.0,                       so this tent was okay  like other photos i ve seen  it appears they have sealed the corners with    duct tape  i don t understand that but   i would recommend putting a tarp under your tent  plus get a decent thermal tarp to put on the floor inside to help insulate and provide additional water proofing i did use a mr  heater buddy inside the tent and got mild condensation around      f after running the heater     hours  wasn t ever enough to drip on me or build up on the walls  mostly found it on the corners of the floor maybe a few tablespoons worth ventilation is great  has a good two zipper door system  and the doors have windows you can unzip  with two large side windows with strong dual zippers  and one full wall  also has a a top vent that is so so final thoughts  if i had a family i would get the   person instant tent not only for the room but the extra height  my   person i can almost stand in but its only    tall so i have to hunch a bit    person has i believe more than    of head height  oh  also get the rain tarp that is sold separate  its much needed and keeps heat in      
32,5.0,                       after having to set up our shock cord  fiberglass pole tent in the dark last time we camped  i vowed to find a reasonable tent that was easier to set up  and this is it  i searched and researched kelty  ozark  rei  eddie bauer  and coleman  rei was the next closest  but their easy set up tent was not the right size pros  so easy to set up  i did it myself in   minute     seconds  not including the rain fly or staking   the floor seems solid and water proof  we left it out all night on a damp evening and of course it was wet on the bottom but there was no moisture inside  the door zippers are well covered by flaps keeping dirt and rain out   photo  the roof ceiling opens and has a screened vent for humid or hot climate   see photo  we can stand in it  i m       and i have a    clearance   photo   plenty of room for two people and their stuff  lots of ventilation and big windows  pole corners have padding on them so as not to tear the rainfly cons  does not come with a rainfly  don t forget to order one  took a lot long to take down and was difficult to get into the bag  came with webbed straps that were tied around the tent and don t have buckles and will never fit again  had to get themon amazon  poor planning when the rest of the tent was so well thought out  coleman i don t know about rain resistance but will edit later if we come across it so happy that i can set it up myselfquickly      
33,5.0,                       we wanted a simple but good starter tent and this fits the bill well  very good quality  i particularly like the weathertec system that seems very solid and should keep us dry in the event of rain  costs a few dollars more than some similar tents but has the quality  features to be with it  very roomy easily fits   adults and   year old with room to spare      
34,1.0,                       good only positive note about this tent is the setup   once it s taken out  setting it up is a breeze   unfold the legs and extend all fours and it s ready to go bad bulky and heavy definitely not waterproof or whatever this weather tec claims to be   i had the rainfly on  tarp underneath  even applied the sealant around all the stitchings but did not hold up against the rain this weekend   other tents around me got minimal rain inside  this one did not hold up well and puddles in all corners and by the entrance   my older tents held up much better in extreme weather trying to put the tent back in the bag is also a very daunting and challenging task   i am usually good rolling the tents up tightly but this onewas definitely not easy with the frame legs attached    and did i mention it s huge already  overall  i m not impressed with this tent if i could return it  i d do it in a heartbeat this will only be used knowing      there is no rain in the forecast      
35,4.0,                       what a fantastic and quick tent to put up literally under    seconds i have a very bad back and am limited  so i was in desperate need of an easy tent to put up by myself   i finally found a great one that is so quick and easy i also liked the fact that the top is solid material and not the typical mesh top  so this prevented any breeze from coming in   helped me stay warm in    f      f  temps in the sierras in october there are   windows that unzip so during the day i was able to open them up so i could get airflow the   person tent had plenty of room for my double high queen air mattress  a side table  a stand and my portable heater  as well as my belongings and i was able to stand up straight in it   i m      only   pet peeves about this tent and the first was that even after staking down the corners of the tent and back  the floor was not taught and had some buckling   my coleman montana   person dome tent was nice and taught   so that was a bit awkward  so i had to spread out my belongings along the bottom of the walls of the tent to push out the buckled material of the tent the other part that really does bother me is that the tent once taken down   just as quick as putting up   does not fold up as easily as a dome stake tent and this was extremely hard for me to put back into the bag it came in i struggled hard the second time and due to my back i gave up   i have yet to get it back in         
36,4.0,                       i m not a tenter   i used to have both a van set up for camping  and an old dodge champion motorhome   i m too old to mess with a tent   however a bluegrass festival came up that i did not want to miss  and my coleman tent trailer wasn t available so i took a chance and bought a coleman    person tent   first off  this tent would comfortably hold no more than four people   i can t imagine     secondly this tent should never be purchased without a rain fly     shame on coleman and amazon too       for letting this happen   that s the reason for the four star rating in the tent s favor  it really is  instant    a fellow camper insisted  curious about the tent   on  helping  me set the tent up   the tent was up before either of us knew exactly what happened   true   you take it out of it s carrying case  spread it out on the ground  and as soon as you start walking around it and erecting the tent poles       the tent just sorta      happens  no kidding   this tent went up so fast  i m still not sure how it sets up  but it does come time to take it down  it also was easy   one tip i got from reading another review  was to half open the windows  leave them zipped half way and tuck the flap between the tent and the screen mesh  in order to let the air out  when rolling the tent up   worked for me we had weather       unbelievable   up in the mountains  in upstate new york s lake george area and one minute there d be sweltering heat  and the next minute a huge dark grey cloud would show up  and a drownpour would happen   at one point  i ran to check the tent and the water around it was shoe top deep   no kidding     and  nothing and i mean no water at all  inside        except for a corner of the window i d left down  unfortunatley close to the air mattress   not good   but all in all the tent did fine wind      incredible wind     thru all of this  this tent stood up very well  the only water inside would come from condensation because no way could you leave a window open even the slightest   water would run down the sloping side of the tent and right thru the window screen  and this       is the reason i think it s a shame this tent is allowed to be sold without a rain fly   i just ordered mine   i m hoping that with this tent fly  i ll be able to at least partially open the windows if it s raining   this along with that clever top vent should help a lot hope this helps but again  this tent should never have been sold without the rainfly   shame on you coleman      
37,4.0,                       excellent tent  i give it a   star review on the tent alone  but  a   star rating just because it doesn t come with the rainfly  i should have read the description better  you have to turn around and spend approximately another        for the coleman rainfly that  in my opinion  should have been included  i have never purchased a tent that didn t have one included  hey coleman  i hope you end up reading this review and take care of that issue  i know that i am not the only person to say that  or even think that  it would be nice to send me one for the price of shipping      
38,3.0,                       i haven t taken this camping yet  i ll use it for real this weekend  but it arrived today and so i took it out back to set it up and make sure everything was in order it does go up as quick as they say it will  and without really needing to read the instructions or anything  it seems to be well made  and it has the features you would expect a tent to have  not a ton of bells and whistles  but that s not what tents are for but  for as well made as this seems to be  and for as easy as it is to set up  the take down is unacceptably difficult  not really the take down itself  but the packing it away  getting it back into the carrying case is    not going to happen for a lot of people unless they exercise a lot of patience  which sort of undermines the whole point of having a quick tent  however easy it might be to set up  putting it away is a hundred times harder  while a traditional stick and pole tent will take    to    minutes to set up  and       minutes to take down and put away  this might take   minute to set up and    minutes to put away  the instructions also offer no insight whatsoever into how to fold the fabric to get it small enough so that it goes back in smoothly to compound that problem  the carrying case is super cheap  if you force this tent into the bag  which you re going to have to do because there is no other way  you re going to break the bag sooner or later  probably sooner  it s super cheap to me  this is unacceptable  they could have offered instructions on how to fold it precisely while taking the tent down so that it fits back into the bag easily  or they could have just included a bag that was     larger and it wouldn t have mattered anyway  it does feel like a solid tent  and it is easy to set up  but  it s so abusively difficult to get it back into the bag  and the bag is so pointlessly tight and cheap  that this tent lost   stars it s probably a fine tent  but just don t be fooled by the  instant tent  branding  realize what you re getting yourself into  putting this thing away is a nightmare      
39,4.0,                       the tent is great   first time taking it out of the package  it took about   minutes for me to assemble because i m a guy that thinks it is a crime to look at the instructions  otherwise it would have been about    seconds as others have mentioned  there was some condensation on the inside of the tent when i woke up in the morning  but that is because coleman couldn t change the laws of physics   if it is humid and cold  water will condense on most types of matter i bought the rain fly tent combo   you should definitely not do that   the tent rain fly combo is for a   person tent and a   person tent rain fly       coleman   person instant cabin tent and coleman instant tent rainfly accessory                        i need to return the rain fly  but there isn t an option on amazon because i bought this a couple of months before i used it a little help with that coleman      
40,5.0,                       i ve had a regular tent my whole life and never knew any different   on a recent camping trip my cousin joined us   he got one of these used at an auction since he knew he needed a tent for this trip   he had no idea what he was buying  just a tent   he never bothered to even open it up to try it   my buddies and i laughed at him when we read the    second set up on a tent he never set up before or learned how to use   he opened it up and yes it may have taken him     seconds but there was no laughing only impressed faces looking at the heaps of canvas and poles that were our tents and he was going inside his   i never even bothered to set mine up  i just bunked with him   the   person was just right for   big guy and all their gear for a week   we camp heavy  needless to say  i had to have one before this years trip   i gave my old traditional tent to my son  lol   i saw the coleman darkroom version of these but i don t want a dark tent   i want all the light coming in   i m not sleeping all day and don t sleep late   i would really love it if they added the soft hinged door to this like some other coleman tents offer   the hinged door is so worth having   one of the other guys has that on their old fashion tent      
41,1.0,                       bought this and set it up  after two hours of rain on it the seems along the windows started drip water as well as the seem on the roof which then dripped from the lantern attachment which of course is right above where we were sleeping  i m sure they ll say it doesn t leak with the rain fly but if that s the case why does the description say that it doesn t leak without the rain fly and why is the rain fly sold separately  i gave three stars for the weight as it is a reasonable weight for car camping tent  obviously not a backpacking tent  set up and tear down were super easy and stows away great  the only problem is it leaks even in light rain  good by if you re not planning to for it rain at all      
42,2.0,                       overall  this is very easy and fast to set up  so much so that i could do it alone  that s about where the good ends  we watched countless videos with this coleman tent blowing about a storage facility with rainfall  i m here to tell you  this is not accurate  we awoke to morning dew penetrating through the closed windows  creating quite a bit of water underneath us  as far as we could see  the seams were not the issue but rather the breathing material on the sides of the tent  for       there are other  better options out there  we also sprung for the separately sold rain cover and still had water in the tent  we are going to try to spray a weather protector such as neverwet but this will be reserved for warm dry weather and we will continue to be on the hunt for a better tent      
43,5.0,                       we got this tent to car camp with our toddler and baby   it s spacious enough for a queen bed which we share with our   year old  and a pack n play for the baby  with room at the foot of the bed for luggage as well as plenty of entrance space to the tent which we also used as a play area it s very easy to set up and only takes a minute   also very easy to put away  but takes a little more time to roll it and get the air out so it ll fit back in the bag  leave the windows open to make this part easier  i know this has a  built in  rain fly but we went ahead and bought the  real  rain fly as an accessory   i m glad we did  we had a lot of rain our first night and it held up remarkably well   i wish they just included the detached rain fly with the tent no leaks in the seams  and all of the seams have a plastic clear seal over them that you can see   no leaks around the zippers it s a little big in the bag  but we were able to fit it in the back of our prius with spare room for our other gear and kid stuff we are very happy with the tent so far      
44,3.0,                       it is as easy to set up as advertised   we like the size and it has plenty of windows to let the breeze in   the only issue we had is that the first time it rained  we had a large amount of water come in the sides  several gallons by morning   even with the rain fly on   we have had many coleman tents in the past so we knew this was not normal   i would recommend this tent  but make sure to order the rain fly with it and check the waterproofing before going on a camp out   i have noticed others that had the same issue so it seems that there are some manufacturing issues from time to time      
45,2.0,                       bought htis in april because the tent i had was tight for   people  took it on its frist outing in june pros the setup was easy a  darkroom technology  is excellent  reall keeps light out and the tent interior did seem cooler during the day but this also has more than adequate venting hinged door is awesome  definately a benefit and the room divider is greathad a little weather during the   days i was out and the tent handled it well  no leakscons    peson tent  not quite  not sure how they figure the measurments to get that number    people comfortably durability  out of the box one of the corner poles very hard to extend  collapse  looking at it set up it appears to have a slight bend   i am going to inquire id there is a replacement or if this is covered while the floor seems durable the walls do not  at some point during mu drip the wind kicked up slightly and something like a small stome punchtured the tend wall a few inched abouve the floor seam  i can t imagine what would happen in a fall camp out where you can get real windit is an ex up but not so much an easy takedown for packing it all up     i get that they put thinner material to keep the tent light but people using a ten person cabin style tent aren t looking for lightweight  the wall fabric needs to be a little thicker to make it more durable only one use and   issues  not major but still irritating  i don t envision getting more than a few seasons before this on has to go update    jul    i removed another star aside form the issues listed above the back this gets packed away in blew out the seam on one end so quality issue with the tent and the bag  only   uses and this many issues disappointing product from colemen     
46,2.0,                       i had high hopes for this tent after reading reviews and watching videos  it does set up as easy as advertised  less than a minute and it is ready to stake down and use problem was the tent leaked badly during a thunderstorm  one entire wall section had water droplets leaking through  all   corners near the floor leaked  and it leaked in the top center  we had several cups of water in the tent  and much of our stuff got wet      
47,1.0,                       terribly disappointed in this coleman product  for petes sake coleman has been around forever  this tent has an image of a lightning bolt on the side and a rain cloud   on our first trip in this tent there was a rain storm  not terribly heavy but this tent leaked like a sieve  my wife and my    month old son were not pleased  i was not pleased with water dripping on my head as i lay on my air mattress  i am sorely disappointed and i will reconsider before buying another coleman tent  i will look in to other brands in dry weather this tent seems like it would do well  but this trip  its maiden voyage was a wet mess   i hope the return process is easy      
48,5.0,                       i am slow brained at mechanical things and my first coleman tent i bought a decade ago took way too much time and frustration from my vacation in the great outdoors to figure out and it had too many pieces so i had to keep referencing the manual   plus i had to buy a duffle bag to keep it in because no average human could refit it in the case it came in   looks like coleman too was slow brained  but now it s the opposite with this tent   it really did take just a few minutes my first time setting it up   i m sure my second will be    seconds or less   and afterward i was able to fit it in the carrying case  though i wish it were just a little bigger because i needed help squishing the sides together when zipping   like me now at size    trying to get into my wedding dress of    years ago   i m so glad i can put the tent up by myself   i use an extra long cot from walmart and had to set it on the diagonal to fit and even then it s poking the tent fabric a little on the outside   there isn t much room left on either side of the cot s interior   i ll keep this tent  but i wish i bought the tent for six people  even though i often camp alone   i like having space to set a little desk and walk around   i haven t been in rain yet  but i did spray the outside with water repellant   i looked all around at the seams and didn t see the seam irregularities some here complained about   it looks really pro   in the middle of the day i went inside to take a nap on a day that was about       degrees   it was pretty warm even with all the windows unzipped   the sun was beating down directly overhead  so i m ordering the rain top even though it doesn t rain much in so ca   i m thinking and hoping that maybe that rain top will deflect some of the heat from direct sunlight   if you too are slow brained  i d strongly suggest watching some online videos like on youtube to see how people set up this tent before you begin      
49,3.0,                       i ve been using this tent for a few years now and love how easy it is to set up   it s roomy and has lots of windows  as well as roof vents for a little extra circulation the big problem with this tent is how terrible it is in rain   i ve seam sealed the all seams    sprayed waterproofer on it  and even purchased the separate rain fly   the side walls that sink inwards when they get wet   the extra weight from the rain causes water to pool up on the seams near the floor  and then it simply drips inside the odd part is there are tabs in the middle of the front wall  and back walls to pull everything taught  which allows the rain to simply run down the sides of the tent to the ground   why they didn t include these on the side walls just baffles me overall great tent for dry weather   but if you re going to be dealing with a few hours of rain get a large tarp   this tent will not keep you dry      
50,4.0,                       my tent requirements are    to stay dry   to be able to stand up and change clothes   to be super easy and fast to put up and downi really loved our sundome    but the corner was ripped off of it  married to the hulk  and i decided to try something different i found the perfect tent on pinterest  but it s a coleman only sold in australia and i couldn t afford the shipping to the us  more than the price of the tent   australia and britain have way better tent designs than we get  but they cost more don t get me wrong  i really like this tent   it goes up in    seconds  down in      you can stand up in it   plenty of windows that roll up easily   the door doesn t swing  such a shame   but it has two separate door zippers  bottom zipper and top side zipper  not one continuous zipper  so if you only unzip the side zipper it doesn t flop in all over the floor like a traditional d shaped door   it does not have an e port for your power cord  so it goes in the gap of the front door zippers   great tent overall   but be prepared to buy these additional items    gorilla waterproof tape  black  for the floor    gear aid seam grip seam sealer  for the inside seams    gear aid tenacious tape  for the tent walls    atsko silicone waterproofing spray   ultralight backpacking tarp   flex tape clear  for your inflatable mattress  etc  i don t know where these tents are made  but my  th grade home economics class could sew better than this   there are several places where the stitching is crooked   the seam sealing tape from the factory was put on crooked as well  leaving many stitch holes unsealed   you can see through them   no wonder the tent leaks   the bathtub floor has places that look disintegrated  like it spent too long in a hot warehouse   why didn t i return it   i did   this is the second tent   i gave up and decided to fix the brand new tent myself   i love the instant cabin concept  but don t pay extra for the name coleman  because that doesn t mean anything anymore   plenty of other brands make instant cabin tents  even wallyworld  and they can t be any worse than this one   you re just going to have to waterproof it yourself   the rainfly  not provided and overpriced  doesn t even cover all the seams  so i went with an ultralight backpacking tarp  which i rigged up with bungees and does a nice job   the carrying case came with a rip out piece to expand the size of the bag to get the tent back in   which it does  barely   but my zipper promptly fell off  so i m holding it together with straps until i can find a duffle to fit in summary  great tent  but be prepared to finish the job line the interior seams with seam sealer   patch over any obvious holes or worn spots with the appropriate medium  and then silicone spray the outside of the tent liberally   the flex tape i ve used for both air mattresses and the lining of the bottom my swimming pool  it holds up great and will stick and seal even when wet you can use any kind of tarp  but i like ultralight because they feel like a taffeta rainfly   this tent needs a rainfly  but not the one they sell   that s a joke   the issue is if it rains  because of the shape of the tent  all windows must be zipped shut or you will flood out   there is a rooftop vent  but it s not enough and it gets too hot and downright miserable   the goal is to be able to unzip the side windows and let a breeze through   so the rainfly gets staked wide to keep rain from coming in the side windows  and then it s comfortable i eventually borrowed  stole  the rainfly from my coleman montana   tent and added pins to the front two feet to accommodate the pole   that way i get a vestibule to step out into the rain  and not let rain fall in the front door  why go through all this trouble   compromise   my husband detests putting up and taking down tents  and i can do this by myself   once i got a notice on my phone of a straight line wind storm headed our way and i was by myself   i was able to take down the tent  including rainfly  stakes  and ground cloth  and throw it inside in under   minutes   which was great because i don t know how it would have handled the   mph wind gusts that came at the   minute mark  but i doubt any tent would have survived it s not a perfect tent  but after all the improvements it now suits my needs   maybe i need to start designing my own tents      
51,1.0,                       worst product i ve bought from amazon  set this up in our yard to get the kids out of the house for a camping  trip  during this covid shut down time set it all up  water proofed it  camped in it two nights  the third night  it rains   in florida one of the included stakes to the rain top comes out as the wind gets trapped under the tarp and the tent  it sails off to one side and two of the legs bend the tent falls in on me and the family  i walk outside  see the damage  i m standing in the rain  to explain the strength of the wind  plastic cups on the cooler didn t even blow off  weather report said it had gotten up to   mph gusts after standing there a second  in disbelief  my wife and i grabbed the screaming kids and took them back to the house not happy  will include pictures      
52,1.0,                       when we set up the tent  two poles were defective and we were unable to set up the tent properly  i contacted amazon and they said i would need to contact coleman directly  i tried calling coleman but could never reach a live person  i had to spend time searching their website to find the link to submit a warranty request i provided   photos displaying the defect and wrote a description  they responded by saying i needed to take a picture with the reference number next to the logo  i did this and they responded that the reference number needed to be written in silver marker next to the logo directly on the tent  who has time to hunt down a silver marker   i didn t have one and had to go to the store to buy one  this was very likely the most tedious  bureaucratic  time consuming and senseless process i ve ever had to go through with a product under warranty  this tent would have likely been great without the defect but i m so disappointed with coleman s horrible customer service      
53,1.0,                       so it appeared easy to put up  but one corner did not snap in because the poles were assembled upside down from the manufacture  so after an hour to locate a philips screw driver from another camper you had to remove screws at tent base and elbow rotate     degrees and put screws back in  tent then worked fine was sagging on one corner it leaked about a     gallon of water during a thunder storm  so here where it gets worse breaking the tent down noticed the corner that was sagging all week was another pole assembled upside down but was some how locked in place i could not get the pole to compress or go in if that makes sense  there are little push buttons and pole collapse  so after a   hour setting up and an hour of trying to get pole in so tent would fit in the bag  i had no success i had to thow it away  i had no room in my truck to bring a big pile of tent with all my other gear  i had no other choice waste of money  colemans quality control sucks ass x       do not buy     
54,2.0,                       save your money    we have used this tent   times   there s definitely some design flaws along with poor craftsmanship by coleman with this tent  pros  its easy to set up  dark technology is great   you could sleep during the day if you wanted because it is so dark inside   at night you can barely tell there is a light on inside  spacious but would not try to put    people inside  the cons  not waterproof  even after coating the seams with a seam sealer and spraying the entire tent and rainfly with the coleman waterproof tent spray   x s we still had water pooling inside  rainfly does not cover the windows  the door has a curved pole that has snapped in a few places  only on the  rd set up    of course coleman can not help with replacement parts  coleman customer service is a joke    there are pictures online of a rainfly that goes all the way to the ground and covers the windows for this exact tent but it is not available in the united states at all  only in australia  ugh  so if you are not dealing with any rain this is a great tent  however if you are then i would recommend looking at other brands      
55,3.0,                       i just bought it  set it up on my lawn  easy  bought a bottle of coleman s seam sealer  it only was enough for the roof and part of the walls  i did not waterproof the seam between the wall and the floor  this seam is several inches off the ground and with the seam turned in it is not exposed to the outside  i did not think it would leak last night we had high winds and a light to moderate rain  no downpours this morning  there was a lot of water all round the sides of the inside of the tent  the roof did not seem to have leaked   i did buy the extra fly but i did not have it over the tent last night  this tent is advertised as having an integrated fly and that seems to have worked  my conclusion is that the high wind just blew the water into the seam between the wall and the floor so  off to rei to buy some seam sealer  i was unhappy with the coleman seam sealer since there was not much in the bottle and it had a pathetic applicator i will update after i seal the floor seams edit  i brought the rei seam sealer  comes in pathetic   oz bottles like the coleman sealant  it was like thin elmer s glue  no smell  it ran a lot and the applicator was far from ideal   the bottom seam is a nightmare  it is tucked in  so  which of the three resulting surfaces do you waterproof  you have    feet to work on  x   i did the outside tuck and the seam inside  which has two surfaces    it still leaked  although not quite as bad as before after a night s rain  but  it did not rain as hard as the other night   the entire seam on the inside was damp and water was inside the tent  but less than without the sealant  now what  i am going to buy more coleman sealant and repeat this process  since this coleman sealant seems to have been successful on the roof of the ten  what a sham  coleman should be ashamed of this tent   tucking in that bottom seam and not waterproofing it makes the consumer do triple the work to seal this seam      
56,1.0,                       do not buy this tent  not sure what s going on with coleman as they usually make a high quality product  the first tent i was sent had holes in the screen  the second tent leaked from almost every seam  luckily we were camping close to home so we could drive the kids home  there were puddles forming in the bottom of the tent   there will be no third tent also  be very careful with return windows  my first conversation with customer service left me with the understanding that i would be getting a full refund  when i contacted back to arrange pick up my estimated refund was about     shy  it took another contact with customer service before i had a written promise at a full refund  so i guess you need to spray your tent with water for about a half an hour or more if you cannot create a rainstorm on command      
57,5.0,                       i haven t camped since i was little so this is my first tent as an adult and i am so happy with this purchase   it s lightweight and so much more spacious than i thought it would be   we had a queen and twin airbed in there with room for our bags and accessories   it has two interior pockets that was handy for the flashlights  my book and some earplugs   with room to spare   it also has a hook at the top center for a light  which was super handy   i love all the mesh windows which all zip up at night   it s perfect for   people   i know it says   person but for it to function for us and leave room for bags and a little walkway between the beds  it fits   people very comfortably   if we had a fourth we would have gone with the   or    person tent   but i like size because it a smaller footprint so it fits into smaller campsites and you can still stand up fully in it   the set up was a breeze   it has this sort of  pop up  center that makes quick work of it and that s why i bought it  i m too old  and lazy  to be messing with inserting rods and all that jazz   the take down was just as easy   we took a small hand held broom and dust pan   swept the inside of the tent out and then as we collapsed the outside brushed off all the dirt and leaves before folding it all the way in  it s ready to pop up and move in next time   we went ahead and got some cots for next time  to lift the air mattresses up off the ground  so we are not having to get up and down off the floor to change clothes and dress  remember  we re old   lol and a little   foot folding bench for outside the tent door to take shoes on and off easier   pair that with a toilet tent and we can camp socially distanced quite well   i love our little tent so much   highly recommend for a small family      
58,4.0,                       i ve had numerous pole tents and decided it was time to move to something a little quicker to assemble   the coleman unit goes up in about a minute as advertised   you unfold the supports from the center then extend each corner  there is a metal tab that locks into place once you ve fully extended the poles  and that s it i tested it at home first  pictured  and found setup and tear down to be very manageable   i was even able to get the tent back into the bag  that s never happened  pictured is a queen air mattress that is   x  x     you could easily fit a twin on each side but wouldn t leave much walking room   i found the best configuration was perpendicular to the door in the corner  picture w  the light visible  versus parallel to the door  felt a little cramped   nd photo  with the queen in place there was easily enough room to talk in  you could store bags suitcases  and have a place to put your shoes   there is even a hook to hang a light fan and some storage on the walls ceiling area there are some cheap metal stakes  to stake the corners   some of the tents i ve had included a tarp mat to put dirty shoes on that this didn t have   it also didn t have a spot  that i noticed  to run a power cord   also doesn t come with a separate rain fly for the top but can be ordered separately  less than      if desired   i ordered one just in case overall  happy with the purchase and quality      
59,4.0,                       i recently got this tent because i was going on a solo mom and son camping trip  meaning no backup help if i couldn t get our normal tent up by myself  this tent was so easy to put up  just extend the legs  staking it down took the longest  first time not dreading setting it up again to clean and air it out  might use it inside during the winter for my son it ended up being a windy rainy weekend  and everything stayed dry for the most part  except the stuff touching the walls which was a  duh  moment for me    however there was another site in our campground that did not have the rainfly and they had to tarp it down  so if you spend the extra     for the rain fly it s a great tent       
60,3.0,                       ok the main problem  i had with this tent was the door size   only the right half of the door opens    if you do have a queen size mattress you have to blow it up while it s inside of the tent  also i went camping with my three year old daughter and was worried about her getting out at night   i figured i would zip the tent clothes and leave the zippers at the top so she couldn t reach    unfortunately the tent only zips in one direction and the zippers have to be at the bottom   also there s a small gap where the two zippers meet and i found multiple spiders in my tent  i like how fast the set up was in doing it by myself was easy but for the size of the tent when it s folded it still pretty large in comparison to other larger tent that collapse into a smaller size than the sta i like how fast the set up was and doing it by myself was easy but for the size of the tent when it s folded it s still pretty large in comparison to other larger tents that collapse into a smaller size than this tent  also one of the tent zippers broke after the first time using it    i think there are much better tents out there   it would be pretty snug for four adults to sleep in    also with a queen size air mattress there wasn t much room left so you d have to be able to fit four adults and a queen size mattress also i m      and my daughter is   fitting one more person would have been ok but that would have been it     
61,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          leaking from every seam  especially the  gear pockets  where your electronics should go  poor construction  false advertising  sloppy  sloppy tent  do not purchase if you wish to use in any sort of rain      
62,5.0,                       great tent  restored my lost love of camping  i set it up and took it down by myself   got it back into the included bag  by myself   can stand up in it           two people and gear would fit fine   i would not want to try to sleep   in it unless some were tiny and also well loved   good ventilation   good view from inside   sturdy even without guy wires  good quality fabric   waterproof  tarp like floor   i used the rain fly  purchased separately  and it was also very easy to put up and take down   have not experienced a rainstorm in it  but did camp in extremely humid east texas swamp conditions  and there was condensation dripping from the top of the fly and none at all on the inside of the tent   door easy to get in and out of   handy pocket for things like cell phone  glasses  keys  flashlight  and a useful loop at the top to hang a lantern from   the zippers worked easily   looking forward to more car camping  with  just one  buddy  in this tent      
63,1.0,                       pro  this tent is super easy and quick to set up  like a minute cons  all of your stuff and you will be soaked if there is any rain   just awful  i even sealed the seams and it still leaked  i think through the windows that were zipped closed  i went from a   person northface to this so tent for  car camping  and it s awful    my northface  never sealed  never let any water into the tent and it s been in the mountains and car camping by the beach   very disappointed with the quality  rain should not enter your tent leaving several inches of water on the floor  don t waste your money if you camp with a chance of rain   wish i could return this  too bad i never tested it until recently      
64,3.0,                       i bought this tent with full faith in the coleman brand  there were some negative reviews  but i disregarded them  i bought this tent for a trip to hocking hills with my girlfriend  as well as the proper rainfly  which is not the   person rainfly they suggest  along with the tent and rainfall i bought seam sealer and two cans of camp dry  the tent is extremely well designed and tall enough to stand and move in  all the internal seams have some sort of tape sealant on it so you won t need seam sealer  the zipper is flawless and is usually a   handed operation  i set the tent up for a trial run and sprayed it with both cans of camp dry for good measure  it rained at home and i went out to find water inside the next day  i really wasn t that concerned because i didn t have the rain fly on it and i figured it was necessary as some of the reviews said it rained our first night at hh  for several hours  but slow enough that i could count the raindrops hitting the top  rain began seeping in through the closed window flaps  and only the window flaps  and grew worse the more it rained  it eventually escalated into steady drips all throughout the tent and standing water  i m extremely dissatisfied as this is not a cheap tent  i have a feeling my tent my be a  one off  bad quality  based on all the other good reviews  if it was waterproof i d give it   stars  but mine was not other stuff can be assembled by one confident camper in a literal minute  tied down in under   one of the plastic feet in the   corners that holds the loop for the stakes broke on  st use  i was not being rough on the tent  it s just a shortcut in material quality  the rest of the tent and components seem great fits in bag without wrestling and even had extra room for a tarp in the bag  but the bag is huge  as a result of the quick and easy setup it doesn t break down very small  probably      tall and       tall wide  it s a knee banger if you don t wear it like a backpack i ll be contacting coleman to see if i can get some resolution on the tents quality update         coleman replaced the tent free of charge with a larger   person tent  we have been using that tent for us and our two dogs for a few years now and it performs flawlessly  faith restored in the coleman brand      
65,5.0,                       honestly i wasn t expecting the quality of this tent  especially after hours of research  seeing   person tents in the         dollar range the only con i can find with it  is it s size and weight   due to the robust attached pole system  the trade off of having an  instant tent     maybe it could be pitched in    seconds with a couple helpers  but to carefully unpack and put it up took me about    minutes alone the build quality is impressive   thick walls and thicker floor tub   zippers are neatly covered  the roof vents velcro into place and have ample coverage overlap from the mesh   i love the side pocket and lantern hook from the ceiling  it feels sturdy i don t plan to test it s waterproofness until i generously seal the seams with quality sealer  i plan to use gear aid seam grip and kiwi spray    i waited till the last minute to order before my trip this weekend   i brought a properly sized tarp which i plan to lay over and guy line out if rain turns up in the forecast breaking it down was a lot harder than putting it up  as it takes some elbow grease to get this monster back in it s carrying case  but it was manageable the most notable factor though was i left the windows all zipped up  and i literally could not break the tent down until i unzipped the entire door    the air was trapped inside   this tells me the tent will hold heat from a buddy heater pretty well  and keep the wind out   i wanted a tent that could be sealed up as much as possible for heat retention  and it seems like this will fit the bill warm weather shouldn t be an issue as all four large side windows zip down and the roof vents will let warm air escape i ll update if i m wrong about anything  but on first inspection this looks to be perfect for my needs      
66,5.0,                       i am a    yr old male and last time i camp in a tent was at least       years ago  i hated it because it was almost like building a little cottage with pulling  pushing  yanking  stretching materials  especially during summer those pipes were getting like fire after a while under the direct sunlight and burn our hands while constructing our masterpiece     yet at the end it never looked like the ones you see in the brochures  you know  all stretched out perfectly without any wrinkle on it etc  anyways  then lately my wife and i decided to try tent camping again because we saw this specific tent and read about how easy it was to setup  so  give it a shot long behold wow    they were correct  why nobody thought this years and years ago and made my life easier while i was younger it literally took about       seconds to put it up  including the stretch it with stakes and all  great tent   take down was even much faster than that  probably       secondsnow  i see at some reviews people talking about internal conditions related to waterproofing  temperature control etc   we are a good weather campers  i check the forecast before i go to camping trip  if there is a tornado warning  heavy rain storm forecast or similar conditions we do not go camping in a tent  nor we are climbing to himalayas with sherpas in tow  my only experience that we ve had a strong       mph wind one night with gusts to   mph and tent stood up very well in that conditions and we were very comfortable inside to sleep on  we used a self inflating twin airbed which becomes    inch high off the ground and my wife and i and our    lbs maltipoo were happy in the tent with lots of rooms for other camping gear too we have   person size and it is plenty of room if you are   or   people camping in it  for a family of    even with a young child i recommend   person version of this tent but if you are   or   adults camping this is a perfect tent      
67,5.0,                       i love this tent  practice at home before the trip  just so you know the mechanics i ve taken it camping three times  and it s been super easy to set up  i am usually the first one done  helping everyone else with their tents  i m petite  it takes me less than   minutes to set up with a tarp underneath  taking it down requires maybe      minutes just because you have to really decompress it to fit back into the bag i mainly camp on the beach  so i purchased extra long stakes  i didn t buy the rain fly for this  and it s been fine with humidity on one of the trips  there was an unexpected thunderstorm with   mph winds  which lasted about     hours  i had no extra rain fly  and had not treated the tent with water repellant beforehand  water started seeping into the corners of the tent after   or   hours  which i blotted with towels  but i mostly stayed dry  my family s tents were completely soaked that night  my tent also held up against the winds  overall i felt that this tent did well on its own under extreme weather  without an extra rain fly or water repellent i don t know how durable it is  since i ve only had it for a year and three trips  but it does seem to be a great buy      
68,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i was excited about this new tent and initially  it seemed great  it went up in a matter of minutes and was nice and spacious  after the first night i realized that the placement of the zippers on the windows and the  door  seemed fairly impractical  but i could overlook it  then came the rain  the first night it stormed  i didn t have an additional rain fly  as it seemed unnecessary  based on the video about the tents resistance to wind and rain  the tent was leaking through the zippers  the corners filled up with water  and rain was dripping through the material itself  the next day  i woke up in a drenched tent and decided to put an additional tarp over the tent  making it difficult for air and light to get in  but i figured  at least  it would be dry  it rained a second  night  and managed to fill the tent with water  again  it didn t  ruin my trip  or anything  but for lack of a better phrase  it sucked super bad      
69,5.0,                       i have bought several tents this year  this one is good  setup by one person in less than a minute  we camp in the desert where its cold and windy  tent material is thicker and keeps wind out  this tent has no rain fly  which is why i chose it  past tents with added rain fly end up to be a wind sail in high winds  it was windy this last trip and i could see the hinged tent legs moving and flexing with the wind  this seems to be a good design  two person maximum for this size  this is the best tent we have owned so far      
70,4.0,                       i ve delayed a review  as i wanted to put the tent through it s paces    it s been a year now    here s the report   it s is argument free setup    it s quick and easy to setup  lots of head room and good ventilation  albeit  in the desert  it gets hot no matter what you do    but it also gets really cold at night  the tent does well in both extremes    here are some details  more than most will want to read    i have some seam covering that is breaking loose in the corners at the top of the tent    not sure how i will repair it  but i m certain without the rain fly  it will now leak  though it hasn t leaked in the past    new seam tape will be necessary  and you have to make certain you understand how the zippers at the bottom need to be positioned to keep the water      out    so pay attention to the details of that little corner fabric  its there to keep the drips out   that said    it hasn t been rigorously put to a rain test    most of our camping is desert camping or high desert so not much to report  we ve stayed dry in the very light rain  with the rain fly attached now wind    we just returned from death valley  wind speeds reported at    mph  gusts      seemed like much more than that when you re in a tent    i had the tent staked down on the flooring using larger spikes than what comes with the tent  the tent pegs that come with it seem small to me   i also used the guy lines that attach to the tent canvas  here s where i think coleman needs to rethink on the design  with the large gusts of wind  the tent poles were giving way and threatening to bend inward  the wind we faced came directly at us  that is full on the front door    the wind was out of the south the day we setup camp    days later it was out of the north   there s a top  knuckle  where the tent pole bends from the roof line down the extended legs    when the winds picked up and the front started to bend inward  i grab paracord and tied off above the  knuckle  and tied down from there with two guy lines on each of the wind facing front tent poles  this provided support on the tent pole directly  i used a steep angle on the guy lines directly into the wind  mostly out of necessity as i had an  easy up  in front of the tent for shade  it required a number of new guy lines to take on the wind as well    with the gusts  i half expected the tent poles to bend    but they stood strong   it was a bit nerve racking    and we did loose a small   man coleman tent that was for my    year old    he s a bit upset that his tent blew away    but that small tent only had tent pegs holding it down  no guy lines     unfortunately it didn t hold up well  but this   man tent  with the extra guy lines held up well after a year of abuse at joshua tree  jackson flat and a few other places in between    it did very well if faced with winds like that again  i ll tie down as i did this time    just above that  knuckle    i ve thought about making my own modification  but i don t want to weaken the tent poles in any way    the paracord did fine  it s both strong and flexible enough to provide the extra support   maybe the only new thing to add to the kit is stronger  and longer  tent pegs stakes   i really wanted    to    inch rebar stakes    to reinforce the need to use guy lines    this death valley trip was part of a cub scout group event    there were others with similar tents  however  they did not use guy lines  the reason given was  the kids trip over them and the parents do as well      they just used the included pegs at the bottom corners    those tents did not survive the wind  the instant tents gave way under the strong winds  breaking at the hinge points  a few families ended up sleeping in their cars    a few others only tied down on the tabs on their canvas    those that didn t add guy lines to the tent poles  all bent    some less than others    but there are more than a few that will be looking to buy new tents for the season  sadly a few campers had a lot of money invested in their tents  but they didn t setup properly    if you re one that doesn t like to use the guy lines    i strongly suggest re thinking    if you add a pool noodle that you can slip over the guy line  they become more visible and you re less likely to trip on them    trust me    i get it    i ve tripped and fallen on a guy line in the dark because my headlamp went out    but guy lines saved my family from having to sleep in the truck  and the tent poles on this tent were strong enough to hold up to the winds of death valley at furnace creek            
71,1.0,                       i have never been so disappointed in a single piece of brand new camping gear in the     years i ve been camping  set up for the first time  by myself  took way more than    seconds  i get inside and see a spot of sunlight on the floor in the corner  there is a pinky sized hole in the seam where they just decided to stop stitching the pieces together     fine  i can stitch it up when i get home  for now  a piece of duct tape will work head out of camp for the day and a storm rolls in  i ve got my rain gear on and my brand new coleman tent with  weathertech  waiting to welcome me when i get back  except  when i open the door  i see water  just a little puddle  so i figure it s from the seam i duct taped  i clean it up with a rag and get ready for bed  lay down on my sleeping pad and squish  out comes the rest of the gallon of water that had leaked into the tent still i can handle this  the op of the pad and my sleeping bag are dry so i scoop out as much water as possible  mop up the rest with a rag  and lay down to get some sleep  only problem is it starts raining again and soon i feel a drop on my face  and another on the outside of my bag  then another on my arm  and pretty soon it s raining inside of the damn tent   returned and never purchasing another coleman tent       
72,5.0,                       ok so this tent has now been tried and tested on a few camping trips and i must say this is by far the sturdiest pop up tent i ve ever owned  it really is very quick to setup and take down  haven t tested it yet on really heavy rain but it did get sprayed on and seams held up even before i put seam sealer  plenty of room inside  we put a queen size air mattress in and you could still fit at least another queen air mattress and heaps of camping gear  the quick install is the best part  specially when you have limited daylight left  you don t waste time setting up  first time setting it up was actually pitch black and even then it was a breeze  highly recommend this tent  i might actually get another one as a spare  oh and it stays pretty cool in the socal summer heat too  plenty of ventilation  and even high winds it stays durable  very impressed      
73,3.0,                       wonderfully easy to set up  durable floor  camped on a gravel bar   good airflow with the windows down  very comfortable with a queen air mattress and some room on the sides   but holy cow  the zippers suck  they like to get snagged and not clasp  forcing you to yank on them until you can get them all the way unzipped and gently and carefully zip them up again  my tent was fully staked out with the  optional  rainfly to provide adequate tension  and the window zippers on the sides particularly were a problem when an unexpected thunderstorm rolled through  i ran back to the tent to close the side windows  because the     dollar rainfly doesn t even prevent rain from hitting the windows  and i spent about    minutes getting smacked with rain in the face because the zipper on my brand new tent decided to stop zipping together for a moment and instead leave a large open zipper behind it  i ended up throwing a tarp over the tent while i worked on the zipper because i didn t feel like getting my bedding and clothes soaked      
74,5.0,                       my girlfriend and i recently took this tent out for two nights in atlatl rock campground in valley of fire and it performed flawlessly  we used it with the coleman queen sized camping cot with inflatable mattress  it was easy to setup and break down  however we did struggle to zip up the bag after it was packed i do want to address the waterproof aspects  in the morning on our second day it rained for     hours with light to moderate rainfall  it could be   hours because the rain started while we were still asleep  i am happy to report that the interior was bone dry for us  i can t speak for everyone else but using the rainfly that we had to purchase separately we had zero issues with the rain  although it was loud  it handled heavy winds which we experienced on our second night and the rainfly also remained secure the entire time      
75,3.0,                       the coleman   person tent  i like this tent i got a lot of complements on it  while camping in moab ut  over the  memorial day weekend       easy to set up i didn t have a  reserved camping spot and it was kinda of a last minute trip  my son and i found a  primitive camping spot late in the day and the sun was starting to set never even pulled out of the box before set up and it was getting dark  my    year old who never been tent camping before helped and we got it up  literally from the box on the ground and set up in   minutes not counting the guide ropes  it  would ve probably been faster if i just did it myself but my son wanted to help and i showing him how the poles lock in place   there are some bad things with this tent the zipper pull tab on the front window broke  first time use the window was open when i set it up and i was closing it and the tab fell right off but the zipper still works so i was like that sucks  all of the other zipper pulls looked ok and haven t broke yet  also i can see in the other reviews that it leaked well i didn t have any rain there but i can see small holes in the seams of the  four large side panels  attach to one another  probably when they sewed the panels together i can light come through so some seam  sealer is order  so i gave it three stars i can over look something s and i can deal with it but some people can t and i can see why you pay for something and you want it to last  i m going camping again at the end of june      buena vista colorado  i will add to this if i have any problems with it pros easy set up  fast lots of space in side and i can stand up in it i m     big windows that zip cooled it downpacking up was also fast all fit back in its bagthe wtf   zipper pull broke off first pulli can see some pin holes of light in the  four main sections of the tent where sewed togetherupdate took it out again for a camping trip up to buena vista co  for  x  event there the first night we didn t have any rain but i had heavy condensation inside the tent and it was dripping a little but i felt that it was my fault because i didn t leave the two top vents open at night  the next night i did and was dry as a bone in there also when out on the trail we came back to a camp site that was hit by heavy winds my chairs and table where blown all around and some other peoples tent got wrecked but this tent did stand up and take it with no problems at all and we didn t have any trees helping to block the wind we were on a flat field  so i was happy about that  side note i did have heavy duty stakes at   main corners of the tent but i used the one that come with it on the other places all held down      
76,5.0,                       i bought the   person for under      and think it s incredible for that price  i did return it because i think i want the   person tent just to have some extra room  i was able to build it in my kitchen  super easy  good coleman quality  i also bought the rain fly which is sold separately and found highly recommended by other reviews overall  it fit my ultra high large queen blow up mattress with room around the edges to walk a bit  and there was a good entryway to leave some bags  i don t think you could fit a table or another sleep bag in there with the queen bed though  i want some extra space for my dogs crate which is why i think i ll buy bigger  also  i didn t like that i couldn t stand up in the middle of the   person which made me feel clausterphobic  i know a lot of tents are like this so it s just my preference  upon more research i saw the review i had been looking at was talking about the   person tent which apparently goes to   feet high in the middle which i could have been able to stand up in  so overall   quick  easy  good quality  decent price      
77,4.0,                       first  let s get the bad out of the way  the storage bag is too small  even by tent standards  i ended up damaging the zipper trying to stuff the tent back into the bag the first time i used it  and as i ve found out  the bag is not covered under the warranty  so just go ahead and budget         for a jumbo duffel bag if you buy this tent setup was just as easy as advertised  the mechanism is similar to a pack and play  i was easily able to do the basic setup in a couple of minutes by myself  there are four cords you can extend and stake to the ground  but i didn t bother  i don t think you need them except maybe in windy conditions the rain fly is not included but can be purchased separately  a thunderstorm rolled in before i had a chance to deploy the rain fly  so i was forced to put the tent s integrated rain fly to the test  after    minutes of heavy rain  and several hours of on and off light rain  the contents of the tent were dry  in the morning i did notice some water pooled near the door  but i think that was just from opening closing the door several times while it was raining take down is a little less intuitive  but also easy  except for the bag being too small  we had one adult and two grade school kids this trip  along with a luggage and other gear  i think you could reasonably fit two adults and two kids as long as the adults were sharing a mattress  i wouldn t recommend more than that overall i m happy with the tent and plan to keep using it  it is much easier to setup tear down than my other traditional tents      
78,4.0,                       i purchased this tent at the last minute for a camping trip with my mom   i got the   person tent and my son bought the    person black out tent   both tents were fantastic  i had read a couple of reviews that said it didn t work so i was a little nervous especially since we rolled into camp with about an hour of sunset light left and we were at least two hours away from any major shopping these tents are fantastic   they can be set up with one person but it is easier with two and takes no more than a minute or two   i didn t even need to put the stakes into mine once i threw all of our equipment into it   the six person tent is perfect for two people   lol  as most tents go  we know   person tent means if they are all laying side by side in sleeping bags only with no extra room for bags or anything the ten person tent is very room and was perfect for my son  his fiance and their large dog   you can stand up in both tents   the ten person comes with a rain fly but for the   person it has to be ordered separately it was very windy the first night and the wind did not blow thru the tent at all the only downside to these tents is that they are fairly difficult to fold and get back into the bag   i can t imagine one person doing this   unless there is a learning curve and it will get better with practice   because the tent is all one piece everything tends to bunch up at one end and it took a lot of stuffing  cursing  cajoling and teamwork to reach a point where the tent was inside the bag with the zipper closed      
79,5.0,                       i needed a tent that i could actually stand up straight in and change clothes  yet has the smallest possible footprint as i bunk alone with my large  oversize cot  this fit the bill   first weekend out  yep  it rained   and i also purchased the optional rain fly  not only did it hold in the heat well from my portable heater  but it also kept me dry  no leaks  no problems and i was able to set this up and take it down solo   we always rake up the tent area and always lay down an extra tarp under the tent for added protection from punctures   i can t recommend this tent enough    people  well  not sure about all that  but i would say you could comfortably sleep   adults      
80,5.0,                       we bought this one to replace our aging dome tent   we got it and right out of the box  without any instructions  we were able to have this set up within a minute or so   super easy to get set up   we planned on letting it air out and then i was going to give it a sprinkler test for water   mother nature tested it for me this tent is very light   make sure you stake it down  the wind was able to blow it around quite easily   as for the rain  it did get a little water in it  but that was primarily because i wasn t ready for the rain   the windows were down and the vent on top was open   i closed them all up and it rained again and we didn t have any issues   the seams were dry  the door was easy to open and close   i did put the rain fly  bought separately  after my test and it was even better   zero rain and water in the tent even with the driving wind at about    mph very satisfied and happy with the tent   i am still going to wax the seams just to be extra safe but it wasn t needed right out of the box      
81,4.0,                       these coleman instant setup cabin tents are a godsend for speed and ease of use   simply invert legs to the sides  lift the middle  then start extending the leg extensions  adjusting the tent as necessary   i can set the   person up by myself in     minutes  not counting staking    i can set the   person up by myself in about     minutes  not counting staking    the problem with being done so quickly is that you end up having to help all the annoying people who brought pole tents the tent offers great cover and lots of space   it s relatively tall inside  the   person feels taller than the   person    the zippers work great   i never use windows in my tents so i can t say much about those  but they work if you want to use them now the bad   i ve seam sealed and water proofed both my   person and my   person  and both leak in rain   the leaks are fairly isolated to the windows  likely because the windows are poorly designed   the screen of the windows is on the outside  and there s like a pocket gap under the screen where the window connects to the rest of the material of the tent   the water seems to have no where to go but either sit there or drip inside   definitely look into that rainfly accessory  it ll help stop water from dripping into those window pockets despite the leaks  i highly recommend this tent if you re a weekend camper looking to put up tents near your car   absolutely worth every penny and more      
82,2.0,                       i bought one of these in       so far very little leakage in the rain  i bought another one in       the first had a dark gray floor  the newer one has a light gray floor  a couple other design changes  but basically the same tent  took the newer one camping  rained a little  leaked from the top a little  bought a rain canopy  second trip  rained a lot  leaked more than a lot  you could actually watch rain almost go directly through the walls  like they were never treated with whatever waterproofing they use  half the trip was spent trying to empty the giant puddles that formed every time it rained a little  the canopy kept the top from leaking  but the walls were about as waterproof as mesh  i like the setup  but what happened  my kid was using the tent  slept in the truck rather than deal with the flood      
83,1.0,                       we bought this product four our yearly vacation the first night it stormed the tent leaked in the seams near the tarp bottom so our entire trip was wet from there on out  i also realized assembly was poorly executed when the top tent pole mounts were not sewn in symmetrically creating spots that pulled on the ten harder in some spots then others pulling at the seems excessively  finally this door setup i was originally thrilled with has many functional issues including the flaps constantly getting caught in the zippers  the zipper pulls are so short they are difficult to see and find in the daylight much less in the dark during a situation   do not open these doors quickly if you are trying to exit the tent quickly  period they are terrible  the other entryway into the tent worked reasonably well  sadly the rain fly is lacking and they geometry of the windows and rain protection make for a stuffy rainy day  better than the original instant set up tent with no rain fly however still not pleasant  a simple option  like some overhangs  in the center of the rain fly would allow for ventilation with open windows all in all coleman quality has gone downhill dramatically since my previous purchases going back to my youth were you had coleman you had quality      
84,5.0,                       used this tent for a trip to beaver ut  its a well built tent  i pulled the legs out taut and had no problems with it being loose or saggy  the zippers work well  there are   pouches inside for pocket contents  my buddy had a twin blowup mattress and there was plenty of room for my sleeping bag and about a foot between us  just like all   man tents though  i would never try to fit more than   men in it  things would get tight with   men    men would be   intimate  its a lot taller than most   man tents but im      and cant stand upright in it  setup and takedown are so easy its kinda funny  i set this one up alone in just a minute or two on the first try without using instructions  takedown actually takes an extra minute or so but still fast and easy      
85,4.0,                       i m liking this tent  i was able to set it up the first time in about    seconds  alone  it comes with the necessary metal stakes and has guy line attached to the tent for taking as well  as with any tent  you d be best served by buying some seam sealer and covering every seam  top and bottom  i used about   bottles for this tent  also  if you want to stay dry  make certain you purchase the optional tent fly and seam those seams as well  if you buy the fly  and you should   make certain you get a tent kit with it as you will need an additional   stakes   a rubber headed mallet also comes with the tent kit which makes driving the stakes into hard ground easy  it also has a tent dustpan   broom and a stake puller  a handy tool  again  as with any tent  you will want a ground cloth  i used a   x    plastic tarp that i cut to size  and it worked fine  without a ground cloth  water will likely seep into the tent during a heavy downpour keep in mind this is a relatively fair weather tent  dome tents usually have three sets of sleeved rods to help stabilize them in strong winds which can often occur in thunder storms  with only two sets of rods  integral with the tent   this likely would not sustain a good storm  it s profile is such that it would likely not do well in a heavy rain with winds of       mph or more  a similar sized dome tent  at much more expense  with a lower  more rounded profile  would do much better  keep this in mind before you purchase the tent has a plastic hanger on the inside roof for a light  but for safety sake  employ a carabiner or velcro loop if using a candle lantern  i was using a battery lantern that weighs almost   pounds with no issue  two battery lighting is recommended  i gave this tent   stars because although it is as good as any coleman or eureka tent i ve owned  it has only two mesh storage pockets  for a tent this size    person   it should have   or    two on each wall and another one or two the back wall  lord knows  there is room for them  on the overall  i would recommend this item for the price  as well  the door zipper needs some coaxing to get around the curve at the upper right of the door  it just doesn t  zip  as easily as other tents i have had      
86,3.0,                       i have had this tent over a year and put it to use mostly in the summers of the pacific northwest  mostly in dry weather  recently used it in a downpour  here are my impressions pros  large ten with lots of room  good height for standing up in   stays totally dark when closed up  stays dry in very light and short doses of rain  doors at both ends allow for easy access  set up fairly easy cons  super heavy and really needs   people to set up quickly and efficiently  walls stick out beyond rainfly  totally useless in anything but lights scattered rain  the only thing remotely water proof is the floor  water seeps in from the walls and pools in vast quantities if you live in a sunny warm dry place this is a good family or festival tent   if you live where it could possibly rain  don t waste your money      
87,5.0,                       i can t emphasize just how easy this was to set up  didn t read the directions and not a regular camper  my wife and i had this set up in about a minute  literally  plenty of windows and ventilation  roomy for two   we had two oversized cots and that was about all we could have in there and still move around some  it s not really a   person tent unless the persons are small kids and they only have sleeping bags the height is good  only around the edges was there any height issue  but again  we were limited in moving around because of the two oversized cots the only drawback on this otherwise awesome tent is the zipper for the front door  zipping around the rounded corner was a bit of a pain in the arse  in the middle of the night when you have to go answer the call of nature  it was annoying as all get out when the zipper wouldn t move around the rounded corner of the door easily  it was like that all the time no matter how anxious we were to get out also  keep in mind there is no rain hood included  but there is a cover over the ceiling vents just in case it rains  i wouldn t want to leave the windows open if it rained  without a rain hood  so you d probably want to get one or take the chance  if you close the windows during the rain you ll stay dry from the rain  but it ll get kind of stuffy in there also  it doesn t get put away quite as easily as it was put up  but it was pretty straightforward once we paid attention  lol  it took about   minutes to get it packed away neatly  still  that s nothing  i suspect the second time we use it  it will be about two minutes to pack it up we love how easy it was to set up and how awesome it was  however  if you are a camper who uses an air mattress or cot and likes to have stuff in your tent  this is more like a good sized tent for two grown adults  if you value space   not for up to   as it advertises overall  this exceeded our expectations and we would recommend it to others to use  whether novice or seasoned campers      
88,1.0,                       i really wanted to like this tent  it s roomy  and super easy to set up  there were some white spots on it that made me wonder if it was a repack instead of brand new  but i couldn t be sure so i set it up to test it  i m typing this right now wearing jeans that are soaked through at the knees  they are soaked through because when i went out to disassemble the tent  i found that it was filled with water  it rained last night so i thought maybe water got in through the roof vent  but my air mattress and sleeping bag were dry so the water could not have dripped down from above  it must have come in through the seams  when i say filled with water  i mean it took me an entire brand new roll of paper towels to begin the drying out process  after i had gone through an entire roll i decided to not kill any more trees  and decided to use a bath towel to mop up the rest  it is now sitting open on a sunny  windy day to ensure that the inside is completely dry before i ship it back  to make matters worse  i bought and installed the optional rainfly  it did absolutely nothing      
89,3.0,                       i bought this tent a few days before i went camping   got to the campground  pitched the tent  which was very easy and quick   wouldn t you know it  it rained for   days   it was storming off and on between medium rain   the top part of the tent was flat and held water   the hook on the inside of the tent to hold a light was made of some type of fabric   the hook was wicking water from the top of the tent into the tent   i used a pot to catch the water   the water wasn t streaming in  it was just a steady drip   other than that  no other water was coming into the tent   the tent was under a canopy of trees so i didn t experience any straight line winds or horizontal rain   but it was storming off and on      
90,5.0,                       i haven t had a chance to take this out camping yet  but did a couple test runs in the back yard   when i go camping it s usually just me and my   year old so i don t get a lot of help setting up   it s one of the easiest tents i ve every set up and i am able to set it up solo in under   minutes   i live in oregon where it rains     of the time and i was able to try it out on a rainy night and it held up great   there wasn t a single leak even after    hours of hard rain   i do scotch guard all of my tents inside and out  especially over the seals and windows so this might have been why people had leak issues      
91,3.0,                       purchased for car camping in the mountains of colorado and wyoming   lots of room for two adults and a toddler   us on a queen air mattress  little one on her own camp pad  still plenty of room for gear and a path to the door the good it is very easy to set up   anyone who can carry it would have no problem setting it up by themselves in practically no time once seam sealed  the tent by itself is waterproof enough for a typical afternoon thunderstorm   for prolonged rain  you will need the rain fly when fully staked out  it does a fine job of standing up to wind the  meh  it is heavy  and is quite bulky when packed up the top vents did a reasonable job of preventing condensation  never had problems with droplets landing on us   however  anything touching the side of the tent at night would be damp by morning   bear in mind  this is in a relatively dry region the bad only lasted three summers before the door zipper completely failed  and a tear developed in one of the walls      
92,1.0,                       i received this product on about   may     and had to throw it in the trash on   sep       i used it   times since receiving it   the  rd time i used it i noticed that the floor of the tent seemed very brittle to the touch and had a very crunchy sound   as i unzipped the horizontal zipper on the bottom of the entry  the floor material ripped horizontally  about   inches below the zipper   the rip was long and jagged   i should have taken pictures but i was so upset that i just disassembled the tent and threw it in the trash i never would have thought that this tent would only last for   years   this tent turned out to be a poor investment   i should have spent the extra money and purchased a better tent i hope others had no issues with this particular tent i do not recommend purchasing this tent      
93,4.0,                       i love this tent  but i swear it came as a used tent as there were a few patch jobs done to it  its definitely not waterproof but like most tents you should go out and buy the spray waterproofing sealant and give it a blast especially around the seams areas  that s what we did  for the most part the tent was dry except around the stitching areas was leaking but it was so small it was not a big deal  but yes the black room technology is amazing and it kept the tent cooler than expected  the rainfly did come with this    person instant cabin popup tent which was also awesome  i just wished i would of gotten a new tent for what i paid for which was supposed to be new   but even with that being said i m still happy with this tent     
94,5.0,                           heavy not super heavy but this thing is a beast     awkward spider leg poles like to move on you so don t set it up alone like i did  unless you can stay vigilant on its movements     be delicate looks like this will last a long time but the connector at the top of the tent is made out of hard plastic  the kind that breaks if abused or twisted too fast see number    other than that solid tent i wish the color was different i m not a person for bright colors hence the purchase of a a blackout tent lol but whatever sleeping in on a cold morning is going to be heavenly      
95,4.0,                       everyone we camped with was jealous of this tent  we slept hours past everyone because of the darkness it is easy to set up but it is heavy and i had a hard time lifting it in and out of the car we used the flap door but it didn t close completely and usually had a gap at the top  and when we didn t have it zipped and just used the flap door the tent did get water in it through that door still happy with the tent      
96,5.0,                       this is the third one of these i ve bought in the past    years my tents get more use than   normal tents as i practically live in it in various national parks around the country first one was   years old when i snapped a leg taking it down in the rain in ne on a   month cross country trip   years ago had to use a cabin at a campground at the badlands in sd a couple of days so amazon could bring me another one although this is a     man tent it s just the right size for one     grandmother   i can get my cot  a chair      tables to hold my coffee pot  crock pot  lamps  and laptop   with room left over for a potty when i m wild camping the door zipper on my last tent lost several teeth when i got it stuck on my jacket last fall in the lbl while camped at hillman ferry campground finally got tired of clothes pinning the door shut and discovered buying a new tent was cheaper than getting a new zipper put in one      
97,5.0,                       poured down rain for three days   the only water was condensation  and what i tracked in   setup minus stakes      seconds   omg   worth every penny   as dry as my         tent   we had two new ones   neither leaked a drop      
98,5.0,                       fantastic and easy to assemble  i am only   ft     lbs  but i had no problems setting this up by myself for my  st camping trip  along with the rainfly  i was able to stay nice and dry during the rains  plus  my tent stayed upright and in place during very violent winds on more than one occasion  while everyone s tents and structures went flying by  this one shook and had winds blowing all around it  but it stayed firmly in place  even in the craziest     mph winds  i was so scared  but i didn t need to be because my tent stayed in place  i was very happily surprised  thank you  and i would definitely recommend this tent to anyone         
99,5.0,                       took a few tries to get one that was defect free  had some zipper problems have only used it for one   day camping trip to a nfs hosted campground in nc  no rain or bad weather at all  so i can t comment on that  it did great and really does setup in under a minute  maybe a bit longer if you worry about staking it down and how hard the ground is now that i m old  i treated myself to a self inflating     high twin mattress   with this mattress and my stuff there was still plenty of room to move around   with   mattresses or a queen sized one there would have been no room for  stuff   if my wife had come we would have needed the   person model  we are into comfort after years of suffering when we camped with the kids  i can t believe i used to blow up a queen sized air mattress by just blowing i thought i saw someone say it was suitable for backpacking  not  it is heavy and bulky   it takes way more than a minute to take it down and get it back in the carrying bag   the bag does have an expansion option that would make packing easier  but i haven t cut it open yet to maintain the smallest traveling package possible      
100,2.0,                       unfortunately  coleman s quality control seems as leaky as their tents  we set up our tent and rain fly on a rainy day    left to get a bigger tarp in preparation for the coming storm  and came back to a swimming pool inside our tent  before the storm arrived  more rain came in through the night  though this time it was due to our mattress touching the tent wall  further testing with a garden hose once home showed water seeping through the tent walls     second water spray  on a positive note  this tent is very easy to set up and take down  one person can have this tent up in a minute  take down takes slightly longer to get everything packed right  but it will fit back in the original bag  you can also expand the bag if you don t want to be too tidy inside it is spacious and can potentially fit two queen mattresses  though they will be tight against tue side walls which may cause further leaking  even with two queens  there s still extra space for your shoes and gear  and two small pockets for flashlights  phones  etc unlike similar tents  this model does not include an opening for an extension cord  rain fly must be bought separately as well i returned my tent and fly due to the leaking      
101,5.0,                       just received my   person cabin tent      i am very pleased with my purchase  set up was easy by myself   took a little longer than    seconds but i admittedly i did not read directions and just jumped in   it was very quick to go up compared to my    year old   person coleman dome tent which is still in great shape   had it not been for the growing interest in camping from my two sons this purchase may not have happened   once set up i checked all seams  zippers  plastic connectors  mesh  velcro  and everything in between to ensure there were no tears  breaks  missed stitches  or seals     to my pleasure all was in order and the tent looks great  can t wait to use this as it is a significant upgrade   i did purchase the rain fly because why wouldn t you  i do agree it should be included just add it to the pricepoint   i m hoping i have the same luck i ve had with my current coleman tent as far as quality      
102,5.0,                       i ve owned a lot of tents  this is the besteasy to set up with   personzippers all work easilyi did buy the optional rainflyi purchased this particular tent after extensive reviewing of tents for burningman       was to be my first sojourn  panademic cancelled thati did get to use twice   first was in august        it got real damp at night  but no rain   the inside walls got damp  but no droplets second time was in sept   very warm   dry  with a good breeze   still had moisture  wasn t sure why   days in  i left   windows open  no moisture  i figure moisture was building up due to my breath     
103,5.0,                       the tent was delivered   i said to my wife  oh   the tent is in  let s set it up  here in the living room  she was confused and thought that perhaps i had lost my mind   but noooooo      seconds later  the tent was set up in the living room   she was dumbfounded and super excited to go camping this weekend with the newfound freedom of simple camp set up i do have one struggle with the tent  thought it s not the tent s fault at all   i also ordered   coleman comfortsmart deluxe cots   unfortunately  the cots are juuuuuust a bit too long to fit in the tent   we managed  but it was a pain in the booty   so i m probably going to return the tent and get a   person tent oh  as is the case with all tents  rating something as   person  means it s about ok for   people  tent makers are very standardized in this area  do not expect to sleep   people in this tent  unless you think   people sleeping in a king sized bed is normal and comfortable    if you do  well hey  congrats  the stakes included with the tent aren t really necessary  but they are also garbage which is again standard with all tents  throw them out and go to home depot and buy some     nails for cheap and durable tent stakes      
104,4.0,                       we aren t campers so maybe this is obvious to other people but the morning dew  and i assume rain  will soak through and wet anything touching the sides of the tent  basically  you and your belongings are dry as long as they aren t touching the tent material  my husband took the kids camping and my daughter rolled against the side of the tent in the middle of the night and woke up with a cold  wet sleeping bag  she was not a happy camper  ha  see what i did there   it s also a tight squeeze  plenty of room for   small kids and an adult        but not so much room when you bring your bags inside  they had   small duffel bags   not a big deal for except the bags have to be up against the side of the tent to make room for people and so    you guessed it     their bags were damp in the morning      
105,4.0,                       have used this on   trips now   easy setup as advertised   i am a solo traveler so plenty of room for me  my cot  port a potty  etc after reading the reviews i waterproofed the entire tent with with silicone waterproofing spray from walmart   also bought the rain fly  which is not included   i had no trouble with leaks  but the condensation does build up on the inside as others have stated  even with opening the top roof vent and leaving the windows open slightly at night   over all  this tent is good  but i would not use it for anything more rugged than state or national park campgrounds   definitely not for backpacking   too heavy   also walls are nylon parachute type material  so probably not for cold weather camping      
106,2.0,                       it was so easy to put up but i m very disappointed that this tent is not waterproof  we had multiple puddles inside the tent after it rained for   day  we woke up soaked in water  the video says their rain testing this was bone dry  thats either false advertising or this item is defective  not only did water seep through the fabric but also there are tiny holes in it everywhere it looks like the needle went the wrong way when they sewed it together and they just left it   see the pics  for the price this is very unacceptable  if it says waterproof we should not wake up in puddles of water  i used the rainfly and that also didn t fit well and the clip broke right away  is coleman getting to be a low quality brand  it seems like it from my experience  i need a replacement or refund  very disappointed    these pics show the floor and walls inside the tent the morning after it rained  last pic shows how half of my pillow was soaked  if it was actually waterproof this would be an awesome tent as the size and height is great  and so easy to set up      
107,1.0,                       this tent was a breeze to set up  i set it up previous to going camping and waterproofed  or so i thought  by sealing the seams and spraying the outside  first day  during a light rain it did well  but still leaked some around the windows  the next day  when it poured down rain  it poured in the tent  i am going to try waterproofing again  but have little faith it will work a lot of money for a fair weather tent      
108,1.0,                       we ve had this tent for two years and used it for less than    times   worked wonderfully  but a roof pole broke eventually   coleman would not help due to the warranty being up  nor would they sell me a replacement part even though it would be very easy to swap out the broken piece for a new one   i feel like i m out      because the tent would still be perfectly fine if coleman would be more helpful      
109,5.0,                       friend strongly recommend this coleman   person instant cabin tent do to ease of setup  break down  and roominess  and he was correct  this is the easiest medium size tent i have ever set up by myself  pole system is designed for one person setup  extension poles lock in place  letting you walk from one side to the other extending the poles  once poles are extended just pulled out sides and your done maybe    minutes or so  i had purchased tent pins but did not use them  break down is very easy flowing   storing the tent in case is an art  fits perfect with other camping gear in my ford flex  i had my service dog with me and one fold out cot there was plenty of room for the both of us  door access is wide and tall especially when you need to go out at night  widows are large and zip open and close neatly  use it as a shelter in the day time with the windows open and a breeze it worked out great  for me there were no negative things i could think of  oh  i was on san onofre beach marine corp base camp pendelton in california in february  there a heavy concentration of mist early in the morning i did not use a rain fly  but the tent held up great  prefect tent for the beach  i strongly recommend this tent     
110,3.0,                       i loved this tent on sunday  monday and tuesday  the weather was sunny and warm  it was the perfect tent sadly it rained a little on wednesday  by a little i mean sprinkles  in the woods  very little water  very little wind andit leaked  a lot  at the two side window botton seams   puddles of water inside our tent   we are very disappointed by the performance of this tent   oh and yes we did also buy and use the rain flyi filed a complaint with coleman about this tent the same day i wrote this review   i heard back from them today and they have offered me a different tent   we feel they are really trying to resolve this problem for us   i will update this review again as we progress      
111,4.0,                       this is my  nd    second setup from coleman  the first one was hastily broken apart during an attempt to take it down  evidently the user in my family was in a hurry and threw caution to the wind  i never saw the tent again  this time  we set the tent up in about   minutes without the guidelines and we were quite pleased with the clear   step instructions it was raining when we disassembled the tent  it literally took about    seconds to take it down and put it away properly   i love that coleman tents fit in their bags so  why   stars  well  the bottom of the tent already has a small tear in it and the tent has only been used once  granted  maybe we should have put a tarp below it  still  i think the flooring material must be weak to tear on the first use  the tent was on grass  not rocks all in all  i would set up camp with this tent anytime      
112,5.0,                       my old tent was so old  it was old school canvass and so heavy  finally the weather did it in after probably    years   no joke  i went with the coleman brand because they are always so highly recommended and this tent does not disappoint  i immediately had a camp out with myself and my furkids in my back yard  i haven t had a chance to break it in on an actual trip yet  but i am in love with this lightweight super easy setup tent and makes me wonder why i held onto that old canvass thing for so long   i guess it had some sentimental ties  but i couldn t be happier with this tent      
113,2.0,                       i stopped my choice on this particular tent because of the waterproof video only  i am from los andes and i had a long road ahead to yellowstone national park  what was the disappointment when it started to rain  you can t imagine   my wife and i had to sleep in a leaking tent  we moved closer to the center to stay out of dripping water  the seller s statement was clear that during moderate rain  from the video  it will be dry  in reality was a complete failure   i was very dissatisfied with all due respect i m looking forward for seller s response      
114,2.0,                       i bought this tent in april of       i used it for camping over a long weekend in may of       i thought it was pretty great  it goes up super easy  i bought the rain fly as well because sometimes we get some serious thunderstorms in ohio the tent without the fly seemed  pretty water tight over all  i could have possibly gotten away without a fly  it was roomy enough for myself and my campmate sharing a queen bed and having quite a bit of clothing and gear inside the tent i camped in it again in october of the same year and then june       when i was taking it down after the june      trip one of the poles that s attached to the top of the  instant up  frame sheared off making it a not exactly cheap pile of trash because i camp at least twice a year i have already replaced this tent with a more traditional design tent  also from coleman  that i hope will hold up better i also have a wenzel klondike tent that i ve had almost   years that is still usable  i have a canvas camp sibley     tent that i have been using for   years twice a year and i had an ll bean dome tent that i used for    years  so i know at least something about gear      
115,5.0,                       this is an amazing tent  i am not outdoorsy  but my sister is in girl scouts and wants to do every outdoor activity offered  we went on a troop weekend camp out that renting a cabin wasn t an option  i decided if i m going to have to set up a tent by myself  it s going to have to be easy  this tent is so easy to set up  it takes more effort to set up our canopy than this tent  literally it s set up in a minute  then another minute to stake it down  taking it down is maybe more like   minutes because wrangling it back in the bag takes a minute or two  i fit a queen size air mattress in it with plenty of storage space left in the tent  i m      and can fully stand up with plenty of head room  after seeing how easy my tent was to set up and take down    other girl scout moms ordered this tent      
116,1.0,                       my husband bought this   person tent and as promised  easy up  yes  literally in one minute there is one step that would make it waterproof  simply set it up inside a better tent first time using and it leaked everywhere top  sides  through fabric as well as seams which looked like they were factory sealed   the rain fly is not  optional   you will need it unless cmaping in a desert  however the bottom of the windows also leak so i doubt it will be much help there  i have owned and used several tents  from expensive ll bean s to cheap old ozark trails from walmart and i have never had a tent leak like this right out of the box  it s as though all the effort went into the setup mechanism and no thought was given to the actual tent seriously  just get a real tent with regular setup and learn how to set it up      
117,1.0,                       i had one of these   person coleman instant tents for a little over   years and it was great  it was watertight and i was satisfied  when it finally came time to retire that one last april  i decided to purchase the same model   i even ordered the tent rain fly  this tent looks the same but is not the quality of the one i had previously  this is by far the worst tent i ve ever had  it literally leeks through the side walls like a sieve   after only one hour of rain  there was at least   gallons of water that came through the walls and pooled up on the floor  what a wet and miserable camping experience  the tent sets up easily  which is about the only good thing going for it   buyer beware  if there is a rainstorm coming  get all your gear out quickly and spend the night in your vehicle      
118,5.0,                       i upgraded from a tent i couldn t stand up in  to this   a big improvement   the one thing that this tent has which most don t  is that all the side windows have zipper panels that completely close off the screens   this means that the dust of burning man won t come blowing in i took away one star because for some foolish reason  the designers didn t put a zipper panel that lets you close the two small vents in the top of the tent   so you will get some dust in that way    though you can also cover them with duct tape  or removable painter s tape  if you have to this tent was not great at insulating me from the hot sun    but a layer of shade cloth draped on poles above it worked wonders i did not get rained on  so can t comment on whether it s waterproof   but i did buy the separate rainfly based on others  comments      
119,4.0,                       our family went camping for the first time about a month ago   i m very partial to quick set up and break down  so after some research  i decided on this product for the   of us i knew we had to get larger than a   person tent  as the person number estimate is never close to practical  and   person seemed to make sense   in practical use  it was a bit small for the   of us  mattress pads  sleeping bags  and all of our other camping gear   however  it might be hard to go with the   person model due to size  set up and stored  as well as the additional cost  so we were satisfied with the   person make sure to purchase the rain fly that is sold separately  as this made a good difference for us   it rained each of the two nights at camp  and the rain fly helped with the condensation on the top of the tent   the sides had a fair amount of condensation  and if we didn t have the rain fly  it would ve been unpleasant      
120,4.0,                       used my tent for the  st time  i was up in humboldt  ca under giant redwoods  it set up  by myself  in about     minutes realistically it never rained  so i m going to do the backyard rain test  back to camping     at night it got down to about          turned on the ole buddy heater and i was nice n toasty    so a bonus is that this tent holds heat fairly well  i had only the two top vents open  as far as room   yes you can stand in it and  mine at least  two ppl stood  the wife n i   we got a rug  plus i put a tarp under the tent b  setup    helps the tent bottom although it was pretty thick  we had two twin air mattresses along with   small tables and a stool for sitting along with our duffel bags of clothes     it got filled quick but was still comfy  they could have done better with the door    have two doors   put those inserts into your doors so at least it ll act like a regular door       it s a pain to keep zippering n unzippingwindows could be a taste lower to actually see when you re in it relaxingbreak down yes  you can do it yourself but stuffing it back in the bag is better with two all in all i m pretty satisfied  unless the backyard rain makes my tent a leaker btw we buy   person tent for two        in a pinch you could get six      very small ppl though     
121,5.0,                       this is a great tent for the price   easy to erect in   minutes or less   does not leak in the rain   keeps all the bugs out   well built   a palace for one person   roomy  for   people   gets cozy with      not a backpacking tent due to weight but great for car camping   windows on   sides   somewhat warm for summer camping and the breeze will not hit you at ground level due to elevated window level   i use a fan in extreme summer  taking it down and packing it takes a little longer but it does go back in the bag it comes in i had to purchase a fly separately which is a must if you want to keep windows open while it is raining   there is an option to purchase tent and fly together which is probably more economical   surprised i don t see this tent at any retail outlets   i ve used this tent on   campouts and at a week long summer camp and it performed admirably in all conditions   the only thing missing is a vestibule      
122,4.0,                       first off i ordered this along with the rainfly combo  the rainfly that came with the   person tent was for the   person cabin tent  i contacted amazon and luckily they were able to send me the correct rainfly the same day at no cost  the rep couldn t understand why it was packaged with a   person rainfly either  so before you buy make sure it has been repackaged correctly   i don t think you can view it until you order it or at least put it in your cart as for the tent itself  i camped with my   daughters in monterey  it was super easy and quick to set up  and my    year old could do it by herself  the takedown is quick too  it takes more time trying to get the tent back into the bag  which i wish was just a little deeper  than to set up or take down  it was very damp the first night we camped with a thick marine layer  i wish the rainfly extended all the way to the ground because the insides do get quite a bit of moisture  the floor was dry  but the sides were wet  the second night it was not as foggy  but again the sides were very wet with moisture  on the plus side we had a lot of room for the   of us  i had a cot and the   girls slept on mats sleeping bags  you could fit a full size blow up mattress in there instead  and i will likely get that for the future  just keep your sleeping bags away from the walls if there s a lot of moisture outside or your bag will get wet  plenty of standing room  and very roomy so overall we enjoyed the tent  the floor i hope holds up because it does seem like a stiff thin tarp  i always use a thicker tarp underneath the tent so that should help      
123,1.0,                       i ve been a prime customer with amazon for the past   yrs  and i have never written a bad review until now  coleman should be ashamed of themselves  a tent should not leak at all  yeah maybe one or two miner ones but the coleman cabin tent with instant setup leaked at almost every seam  the tent arrived on march         on a friday  i set the tent up on saturday and my daughter and i sleep in it over night   good thing it didn t rain that night   i left it up so my daughter could play in it while on her spring break so the plan was    so its up saturday thur sunday  i go to work on monday and it starts to rain  it rains heavy on and off for the whole day  to my surprise when i get home i find a small lake on the inside of the tent  inflatable mattress  sleeping bags  tent mattress and table all soaked with water  at first i though there was a hole in the tent or that the windows where left down  that was not the case  it was leaking from ever seam in the tent  ridiculous     same on coleman    planning to do some camping i purchased all kinds of accessories to go with this tent and not to mention the camping equipment that is now soaked with water in a  waterproof  tent  this is by far the worst purchased ever  coleman is misleading the customer with that video of quality control on their tents  the video shows a woman inspecting the inside of this tent checking for water intrusion after they simulate a rainstorm  bs      that video is what convinced me to purchased this tent  it is now   days since the arrival of the tent and i ve made arrangements to return it and all the accessories that i purchased for it  coleman  is no longer a name you can trust  buy beware        don t buy this tent  would have been zero stars but amazon will not allow it      
124,4.0,                       i ve used this tent a couple of times in the north cascades  first of all  it sets up almost exactly as advertised     seconds is like an epa gas mileage rating  a trained expert in a laboratory setting could probably set this up in    seconds  but not the average person  still  it sets up quite fast  you definitely need the rain fly  which easily snaps into place i gave it two stars for light weight because this rig isn t light  having said that  i don t believe this was really promoted as being light weight  it s for car truck camping  obviously  which is exactly what i bought it for as far as striking the tent is concerned  it takes longer than    seconds  it takes time for the air to seep out  as with any tent  my only disappointment is the carrying bag  you are not going to get this tent folded back like it came in the bag  it just ain t gonna happen  even though the bag has a tear away expansion strip  that tent isn t going back into the bag neatly  i m looking for a large duffel bag for storing it on balance  this is pretty much what it purports to be  i think it s a great value for the money and i m happy with my purchase      
125,3.0,                       this is a very lightweight tent and easy to set up  but before we had completely set it up we noticed a plastic piece   that slides down one  leg  pulling the tent taut  was broken  whether that came that way or it happened when we set it up  we aren t sure  we bought the tent as an out of the sun play place for our grandson  so will try to rig something or will contact coleman and see if we can get the piece   buyers should just bear in mind that some of the pieces are plastic and take extra care opening the tent      
126,5.0,                       we purchased this tent before going on a two week cross country roadtrip   i particularly wanted a quick setup tent since we d be getting to camp sites late   this fit the bit and was even easier than i expected   my husband had no trouble setting it up within minutes  and i was able to help without getting frustrated over tent poles   we did not purchase a separate rain fly     the first night we camped it stormed very badly during the night   the tent held up and didn t leak at all   i think this is a    person tent   but unless you cram people in like sardines  this is a very comfortable   person tent  maybe   person tent   we also were able to put a queen size air mattress in with no problem   love this tent and hope to use it for many summers to come      
127,5.0,                       great first tent for my    year old daughter   we rv a lot and she wanted her own space so she asked for a tent she put the tent up in a couple of minutes      minutes later she was moved in   she lived in this for two weeks it stayed dry in severe down pours and stayed up in high winds    the tent also held the heat from he portable heater in freezing temps   using the vents is a must as condensate can build up tear down is another story   once out of the box  it s very bulky and hard to put back in the carry bag   i can live with it  just be patient  i don t recommend it for quick overnighters over all she s really happy with her new tent      
128,4.0,                       wow  the easiest tent i ve ever had to set up  truly  just think of an umbrella  and how it collapses to fold down to close   same concept  the geniuses at coleman    the tent is very large  even though it can easily accommodate   people in sleeping bags  i believe that for   adults and their belongings it is more suitable  and you may need another person to set it up  even though i am an able bodied male  i still had a bit of trouble doing it on my own    just a mild struggle  but not impossible the only downside is that it is not waterproof from the get go  yes  i tested it on a rainy weekend  and both occasions just a bit of water came through on the top highest center point and some on the seams  just droplets  not deluges  but that was because we did not have the rainfly that you have to buy separately  i can update you all once i try camping again in rainy weather with the rainfly that just arrived this week     other than that  you won t be disappointed  i do wish that coleman would include the rainfly with this particular tent  as they did with my previous coleman tent  but oh well  at least amazon sells it   it s a must have as most reviewers have attested to  https   www amazon com gp product b   gj nx  ref oh aui detailpage o   s   ie utf  psc       
129,3.0,                       i got this for a trip that i took last week  and i wanted another tent that i don t have to crawl into i got the   person tent  and also bought the rain fly that was recommended  i thought there must be a mistake  and maybe i got the   person tent   nope  i d hate to see the size of the   person tent as stated in the reviews  the door on this tent is not easy to zip closed  but it works  there is a one inch or so gap at the bottom where the two zippers meet  maybe meant for power cords  it s too bad that they didn t put the nice hinged door flap on this like some of their other tents i didn t have any trouble with leaking during the brief downpour that we had  and it was easy to set up alone for someone with lots of tent erecting experience  when packed away it s heavier and     times longer than my coleman montana   person tent i m not super excited about it  but it s a decent tent that should last quite a while      
130,1.0,                       we purchased this tent as a christmas gift  being that we live in the northern us  we waited until summer to go camping with our young children  when we set up the tent  the stitching was completely undone along the main seam on the front right corner  we immediately contacted coleman and sent photographs  and they never responded at all  we purchased it again to exchange the defective tent  but this tent came with a stitching issue in the same area with several holes in that spot and more holes along the front above the door  at that point we contacted amazon  and they were completely unhelpful   simply stating they can t  won t is more accurate  do anything about it  can t replace it  can t refund it  can t contact the manufacturer seller  coleman  on our behalf since they won t respond to us  so we re stuck with a      tent with holes in it  buy a different tent      
131,1.0,                       we bought this tent on         and the return window closed on           our camping trip on june got canceled due to medical issues  and now that we ve recovered and been able to set up the tent as a trial run  we discovered that one of the sliding poles for setup of the structure was assembled wrong by the factory   we have another camping trip set for           and if this can t be resolved i m going to be extremely angry   this tent was        and a birthday gift for me   we are supposed be going on this camping trip with our children  which will be their first trip   if we have to cancel again because of some bonehead s negligence in assembly they re going to be heartbroken i better get a response out of either amazon or coleman with a way to resolve this issue asap          
132,5.0,                       easy up is a breeze   fits two full size cots  maybe more  perfectly   our first use of the tent was a   day overlanding trip to death valley   we experienced sideways rain and heavy gusts of wind up to    mph   we staked down  we purchased heavier duty stakes  and tied off to our vehicle and hoped for the best through the night   no leaks and no weak points    this tent is structurally sound   a member of our group had a similar off brand easy up tent and it did not survive the heavy gusts of wind   in fact  theirs leaked and one of the sides collapsed in the night   but not our coleman side note   we originally purchased the smaller  pp instant setup by coleman but it didn t fit our cots   we loved the tent but again it just wasn t large enough for our needs      
133,4.0,                       i purchased this tent since my son is now in boy scouts and i am joining him on camping trips  i have the largest tent of all the dads  but i am able to set mine up quicker than they can  i wanted something easy as my son has to setup his own tent and i need to do this myself quickly  it is worth every penny to be able to put it up and take it down especially in the dark  when i got this i pulled it out and set it up in the living room to see how easy it would be  it took my son and i     minutes mostly because we had to work around the limited space we had  it went up easy and down easy though my son calls it a big marshmallow  it came a few days before our first camp out  note that we do mostly car camping and this is really not a hikers tent as it is too heavy for that we arrived at dusk  i got the tarp laid out and the tent setup in two minutes by myself  i found it is easier to stake a corner and stretch it out as you go around in order to set it up quickly  i also ordered the rain fly and found that i had to put it up   times in the dark because it was upside down  this took about    minutes total as a result  but still very quick if you are paying attention   it rained  sleeted  and snowed for   days while on the trip and the tent held up well with the proper lines  i did not scotch guard it  but will be after the last campout  a little water came in where the sleeping bag had touched the side and where the snow had collected and i did not shake it off before melting  nothing else was wet inside  it was easy to walk around inside the tent with lots of head room  there was room for us and our gear  i would say this is  man max as you would have trouble getting   into the tent to sleep my main reason for not having   stars is the door was very hard to zip  the zipper sticks in the curve along the top and halfway across the bottom as well  i had a tent mate since someone else s tent was broken  they could not figure out how to zipper the door leaving it open a lot  i expected a bit more here and was disappointed with how and where it caught  but as i looked closer it looked like i did miss a center stake for the door which may have resolved the problem  i replaced my previous tent because of the door zipper catching on the flap and shredding it  while this does not catch on the flap it gets stuck in the same place every time  i will update the review after i am able to verify in the next trip to see if this is either a quality control problem or simply setup error  it rained much of the time we were there and it felt a bit closter phobic in the tent at times  my previous tent that came with a rain fly allowed you to open windows partially to see out and allow air in  this one does not  there is also no cover over the door when raining to get out  i think this was excluded for quicker setup on purpose which may be a good trade off  the windows did have ways to roll up the flaps if necessary  but i never opened them when folding this up it was very puffy so it is better to partially unzip a few windows or the bottom of the door to let the air out  the tent collapsed and rolled up very easy and was back in the bag in only     minutes   quick setup and take down was key since i also had to dry out the tent when i got home making it easier  you also need to make sure you get the flaps on the door set correctly in order to prevent water from coming down the front of the door  if your tent is wet then it is easer to just strap it up and leave unzipped until you can dry it out  there are straps to tie the tent up when collapsed  but it would have been nice if they were longer and clipped together pros easy setup teardowntall and easy to walk around ineasily fits in the bag it comes incons zipper designs on the door stink and are difficultonly vents at the top can open when rainingsome ideas for improvement the lines could be reflective to prevent tripping peoplebetter door zipperinclude the rain fly  i am not sure why they sell it without oneinclude clip based straps instead of just tiesallow for windows to open to see and not let the rain inrain fly included could also cover the door better     
134,1.0,                       very disappointing tent by coleman   i was hoping for this tent to work out because i love how easy and fast this tent is to set up  but it fails in the water resistant waterproof category   water leaked through the thin fabric after an hour of rain   stitching at a couple of seams is terrible which also allowed water to leak in  doesn t come with a rain fly  which i bought separately which luckily worked and we had no water leaks at the roof   also came with a very small hole above the window area  which luckily was covered by the rain fly  sadly coleman products just are no longer made well  and it shows with this tent   amazon just needs to remove this product all together as a buying potion   will be returning for a refund      
135,5.0,                       i have never gone camping ever  my  yr old wanted to go camping so we decided to get him a tent and a few other camping essentials  i know the name coleman is a reputable one so we decided on a coleman  i had to buy one that was easy to assemble and disassemble since i have never done it  i watched a few videos and read a few reviews and decided on this one  it literally took me a minute to fully assemble it without staking it down of course  i am      and i could stand in the center and it just barely touched my head  it is huge and very well built  you could fit two maybe three queen size mattress  in it  very impressed with it overall  has durable zippers and openings for air flow and comes with tie downs attached and stakes  i think its a great deal for the money and a beginner at camping      
136,5.0,                       i read as many reviews as possible from different sites before ordering this tent   i camp at least   or   times a year and the worst part of it is setting up and breaking down the tent  i don t need to go into detail about how easy this tent is to set up   the videos speak for themselves   i will say that if you follow the instructions and watch the videos that you will have an easy time   don t get in too much of a hurry though or you may damage something or pinch your fingers   i will concentrate on the tent itself   this tent looks like any standard cabin tent from the inside and the outside   it is roomy and has no sagging due to the well fit pole frame   the windows all have sippers for screen ventilation   there are two ceiling vents   these are a great idea by coleman   the nice thing about the vents is that they can be completely closed or opened   i did order the rain fly with mine so i can leave the ceiling vents open even when it is raining   although this is billed as a   person tent i would rate it at a   person if you don t want it to be too crowded   there were   of us on our first outing in this tent   it was very roomy for   of us  our mattresses  a small table and then room for our packs   it is nice to stand up in a tent after years of having to crawl around in small dome tents when i was camping on my own   i will now also take this tent to camp when it s only me since it is so easy to set up   why should i put up with the cramped quarters of my backpack tent when i m car camping and this tent is so convenient   i will advise that i did waterproof this tent with silicone before using it and i always use a ground tarp underneath   with the windows cracked and the vents open we had zero dew inside the tent   it didn t rain on this first outing so i can t speak to how it would perform but i carefully inspected the seams and saw none of the tell tale pinholes that might mean a leak   this is a great tent for my purposes           i have now used this tent for   camp outs and it continues to impress me  it withstood a   hour rainstorm in the smoky mountains and was completely bone dry inside  again  it should be noted that i took the time to waterproof the tent before ever using it but i am can t imagine that this tent would have leaked   properly staked i can t see this tent even budging in the winds associated with a thunderstorm   one added benefit of the rainfly is that it also has guy ropes to help further anchor the tent   i always use a ground tarp under the tent  tucked under so water doesn t collect underneath the floor if it does rain   this is a great tent p s   my own touches   i use those interlocking multi color mats that you can by at home depot or lowes inside the tent for padding and protection and i bought the longest nails  spikes really that i could find at the hardware store which i use for stakes   they are inexpensive  around a buck each and they do a better job than the cheap stakes the tent comes with           have now used this tent several more times and i can t say enough good about it   remember that i did take the trouble to waterproof the tent with kiwi waterproofing aerosol and i also use the rain fly   it rained again on my most recent outing and we stayed completely dry while we heard those around us scrambling to avoid puddles or as in the case of one camper   just packed up and left   the ease of setting up and fast setup proved even more useful during the last day of my most recent trip   not only could i pack up my tent quickly in the rain  but when i got home i could quickly set it back up to dry once the sun came out   now that i ve practiced a few times i can set up and take down my tent by myself   bottom line  great tent that lets you enjoy camping instead of spending time matching poles or wrestling with inserting fiberglass poles into the sleeves of a dome tent   heed my advice though and use a ground cloth  get better tent pegs  use the rain fly and waterproof everything just to be on the safe side   you can have your tiny     dollar one or two person tents for car camping but i will continue to enjoy my tent that is more like a house and lets me stand up and stretch out with all my gear  btw i have an expensive catoma one person tent that takes longer to set up than my coleman instant tent      
137,4.0,                       we were in need of tent that could comfortably sleep three four people and one that we could stand up in  after looking at several tents we decided on the coleman   person instant tent  the tent truly is instant  it is up and operational in about   minute  the telescoping poles are built in or attached to the tent  so one person can easily set up or take down  quality is fairly standard   nothing fancy  most of the connecting pieces are plastic  so i don t expect this tent to have a long life   we will see  the tent has large  zippered windows  zippered vents at the top and standard small storage pocket  my husband is    and can stand up straight and move around in the tent  the only real drawback for me  the tent is quite large when stored  unlike our other tents that rollup fairly tight and store away in a small bag  all in all  we like it and i think if the plastic connectors don t break  we will get several years of use out of it other reviews stated the tent leaked   my opinion   i don t think the tent is made for extreme weather and only seems appropriate for summer or light weather  the tent did sweat some one night  but the windows and vents were shut tight  daughter was afraid of a bear attack   lol   the second night we left one of the windows slightly open and didn t have any problems      
138,1.0,                       i purchased this tent several years back  and initially i loved it  until we had rain one night  i actually thought it was a fluke that some of the rain filtered into the tent  maybe thru the seams  we just came back from camping out west and we used this tent again  not only did we use it  we talked my daughter into buying the same tent in hopes it was a fluke that some rain came in our tent  the adhesiveness of the seams was coming undone as well  i had purchased a rainfly a couple weeks ago in hopes that it would prevent any additional rain from seeping into the  waterproof  tent  but it did not  the first night my daughter had set up her tent  it had also rained and all of their blankets and clothes ended up wet   as you can imagine with temps in the    s in the mornings  up in the mountains   and all items wet  i am absolutely furious about the performance of this tent  i love the size  space  and ease of setting up  but what s the point when u smell must from rain that leaked in a tent      
139,5.0,                       bought this tent on a whim after my old faithful finally broke beyond repair  i did a decent amount of research and noticed that a lot of people stated they had issues with rain but decided to go for it anyways  my previous tent was also a coleman instant up but it took awhile to get it up and situated  this tent took seconds for set up and even tear down was just as simple  we did not get any rain but there was no morning condensation on the inside like i have experienced with previous tents  if you are on the fence  go for it  i am happy i did      
140,4.0,                       i received my   man easyup tent on monday   opened it today  all parts were there   no breaks or tears  setup is literally      minutes to set it up for   person  quick   easy  plenty of room to house my full size coleman cot with room to spare  it has   large screen window on each side  it has a d shape door with a half screen window  also  on the door side is another half screen window  it has a high tub floor to keep the water out  as well  it seems well built   sturdy construction   i purchased the rain fly for it also  being this is for me on my solo trips  it s perfect  plenty of room   comfortable  so far  considering  this is only a dry run  i can only give it   stars  i have a sierra trip coming up   i will do a follow up review after it has seen the wind  rain  snow   cold  but so far  i m happy with it      
141,5.0,                       we purchased the   person tent knowing that it would be for four people or fewer  we ve learned that you always buy a size or two up with tents  we did a   night camping trip with this tent and it rained the first two nights but there was no water inside the tent  we put a queen sized air bed in and it fit with a little room at the sides to spare  for my spouse and i  we need a bit more space but for our kids this would work well  i want to get a    person tent for next summer so we can have the bed plus ample room to stand and walk around  however it s a great tent and we are happy with how easy it was to assemble disassemble  we also bought the rain cover separately and had no problems with it      
142,1.0,                       very disappointed in this tent  set up could not be easier  but this tent is anything but waterproof  i sent this tent up and went on a float trip  during this time it started to rain  i was hoping to come back to a dry tent but that was not the case when i opened the tent i found that the floor had standing water  thankfully my air matress was an elevated model  or i d have been sleeping in water later on it began to rain again and water dripped in steadily through the top of the tent  for about   hours i had to endure chinese water torture as the water dripped on me all through out the night  i woke up a wet mess a friend who had also bought this tent had the same issue      
143,3.0,                       easy to set up  roomy inside  floor is nice and durable  ventilation is good in cooler climates flaws  need two hands to zip closed  still tricky to zip  which is not good when it rains as water can get in the corner of you don t zip it tight and make sure the flaps are in place corners leak when it rains  even with seam sealer  we waterproofed before using but water still came in the sides  thankfully our campsite was sloped so we had puddles only at the bottom of the tent  would have been a disaster otherwise rain fly can be purchased separately but it drops water all down the side  leaking into the tent  through the lower section darker half  also  does not have adequate covering over the entrance so if you open while it s raining  the inside gets soaked overall  we did not have major flooding in the tent but this needs a better rain fly and coleman should do better inspection before putting on the market      
144,1.0,                       it was fairly easy to set up  and saved us time but   this tent is not waterproof or  weatherproof   it rained one night of our camping trip  and our tent was filled with water  the water seeped through the sides of the tent and there were huge puddles of water in the tent by morning we ve never had this happen before with much cheaper tents  we were very very disappointed do not buy this tent my other family members got ozark s pop up tent and had no issues      
145,5.0,                       we have used this tent for a    day road trip through the national parks  worked great  i did apply waterproofing to all the seams  but you need to do that to any new tent and then as needed   had every kind of weather on the trip      degrees  hail  winds   mph  and woke up to   inch of snow one morning  in the high winds i added   extry guy lines half way up the legs on the wind side     mph winds are pretty strong for a tent this size  was always water tight in all weather  easy set up  it literally does go up in   minute  by the time you set up guy lines and stakes you may have      minutes into it max  i bought a  nd one just like it for my daughter and her boys  a great value for the price      
146,5.0,                       camped in the smokey mountains in a rainstorm  stayed dry and warm  this tent popped up right out of the case  i didn t even look at the directions  it took me   minutes to take it down   again  never looked at the directions  figured it had to be intuitive  it was  one of the best designs i have ever seen  worth twice the price  a bit tight for a very tall queen sized blow up mattress  but it worked fine  slept like a baby      
147,5.0,                       this is the best thing since sliced bread  if you re looking at it buy it  tall enough for some of    to stand in the middle  fits a queen sized air mattress with walking room on both sides  someone called my tent the  better homes and tent  because it was so big at the camp site  it really does go up so easily i as a woman with no muscle put it up by myself in the living room in under two min  this is for car camping or backyard camping only  its too heavy to lug very far  we didn t camp where there was rain so i cant comment on the elements  i didn t see a rainfly to fit it so i just threw a tarp over it  i don t think it would handle arctic elements  but then again if you re using this tent you re not far from your car  so if the weather is bad just get in your car and drive home         
148,4.0,                       very easy to install quickly with just one person  unfold and extend the   legs and voila you have a tent  the same can t be said about putting it back into a bag though  why companies feel the need to use the tightest possible bags is beyond me that hold these things  this is not a dark room tent despite what some of the info says  it filters some light but unless you use a canopy or rain fly you ll never block out enough light to really sleep in if you re sensitive to light  as for the rain fly that s said to be integrated    it s ok at best  you can survive light rainfall but the problem is that while it technically blocks a bit of water the second you touch any wet side the water bleeds through and whatever is against the edge will be wet  that s annoying  if this had better light filtering and the material truly resisted water it would be an amazing tent and would be worth   stars  instead it s just ok  btw it fits a queen mattress but if you have children they won t have much room to sleep  this is more of a roomy     person tent with standing room and no air mattresses  i don t think you can fit anything larger than a queen mattress through the front door  and yes there s only one door      
149,5.0,                       i bought this a few weeks ago   the day i got it we set it up in the back yard  it took about    seconds   and blasted it with the garden hose all along the seams and set the sprinkler on it for about an hour   no leaks at all   not a drop the real test was taking it on a   day camping trip to the florida keys   the second night we were there a storm blew in with driving rain        mile an hour gusts  thunder and lightning   the winds scared the heck out of us and the tent billowed back and forth violently   i just knew the tent would twist and collapse around us   it held up like a champ and we stayed dry all night   in the morning i saw the inside walls were all slightly damp but i don t think it was leakage   it appeared to be condensation but it wasn t even enough to drip down the walls in short  if my house ever catches on fire  i ll grab this tent and run      
150,5.0,                       great tent  it survived a   mph wind storm this spring while camping in sand wash basin colorado  really easy to set up  the rain storm didn t phase it  but i did buy the rain fly  which was sold seperate     wth       which annoyed me if you camp like we do you need stakes that will survive the weather too  i recommend these      aluminum cyclone shape tent stakes pegs for awning special pegs come with carry bag    https   www amazon com dp b   qjcvts ref cm sw r cp apa i kyn cb  ce   also available on amazon they are easy to drive in ground and hold their place the tent was great for two of us with cots  a mr buddy heater on an aluminum camp table and all our gear      
151,4.0,                       likes spaciouslarge windows and roof vents are great for airflowwith the rain fly you can partially open the tops of the windows for airflow even when rainingsuper simple and quick to set uprelatively water weatherproof out of the boxseems to stand up pretty well to wind  haven t used the guy lines yet dislikes need to seam seal the seam between the outside walls and the tarp bottom   i tried to seam seal the inside seams first with coleman seam sealer but some of the holes are rather large due to the difference in materials   after a large thunderstorm yesterday there was a bit of water inside but i didn t measure it to find out how much   i d say it is within the amount of water from their video claims   however  not liking the idea of waking up in even a small puddle  i used clear silicone to seal the outside seam and the bottom corners      
152,5.0,                           i am a    year old retired secretary  when it was delivered i asked my husband to help me carry it into the house   then told him nevermind  i ve got this      bought a used model in excellent condition and saved a bundle      set it up by following the directions included   my   yr old granddaughter helped  sorta       no way can this be set up in    seconds     but      minutes was the time needed to set up and orient it on my tarp   super easy   it definitely took more time for me to get it back in the bag than the start to finish setup process   best feature is the darker fabric that eliminates some of the sun   was able to sleep in a bit  which was fun      
153,5.0,                       we have taken this out twice  once for a two night stay with   adults  and   kids total  fit two queen size air mattresses  our bags and a couple of fans  nothing else could fit but we were car camping so thats ok and to be expected  the second was for the nights with just us two adults  very nice to have the extra room  it rained a little on both trips and nothing got in  we did buy the rainfly though as a precaution and i seem seal all my tents just because thats who i am  the tent goes up in literally seconds and only takes a few minutes to put back in the bag  so far this is the best car camping tent i ve ever owned for overall experience  we will probably get a small tent for the kids next time we take them though      
154,1.0,                       i received this tent and it was damaged  scuffed holes in the floor    amazon will not handle any returns or exchanges for this item and i have made at least a half dozen attempts to get a hold of coleman for a replacement and they have not responded to any of my attempts   phone  email  etc     as easy as it is to put this tent up  and as roomy as it is  i would not recommend in case you have any issues like we have      
155,5.0,                       have had the    x    instant tent for a couple of years and have loved it   but since young son entered boy scouts and dragging it along for a year decided i needed something better fit for just the two of us  the mom unit will not go along and the    x    was just too big for the two of us   this fits the bill nicely   plenty of space and headroom without being massive like the    x      for novice campers  take the stated  occupancy rate  and half it   that s reality if you don t want to be packed in like sardines  minus the oil  and  truthfully  i wouldn t even like to put three people into this  but you could  cheek to jowl for the raters who said this is tough to get back into the carry bag  turn the bag over   there is a sewn section you can remove to expand the carry bag   we didn t have any problems when we did this   it s still a bit tight  but it s do able didn t have any rain  so i didn t use the rain fly i bought  but you should buy one   not just for rain  but to have some stand off room to keep the tent cooler in the warmer months   we re pretty much finished with the camping season for the winter  but come spring i m going to buy some seam sealer to further waterproof the tent my only complaints is the lower part of the tent i got is black and i d have preferred another color for obvious reasons and my experience with the other model is it s virtually impossible to get replacement parts from coleman do buy some sturdier stakes though   i d suggest about    heavier steel stakes if you get the tent and rain fly  four at the bare minimum  two more wouldn t hurt  just in case overall  pleased with it   we ll see how well it stands up over time   nice for both or us to have some headroom and legroom to both be able to stand and dress or move at the same time with all the impedimenta in place      
156,2.0,                       i have never had a tent that leaked like this one does  purchased the fly along with the tent  i do quite a bit of camping but figured i would use this one when going with the truck  this tent leaks on all four walls and around all window seams  i am just writing this because i am now looking for a different tent to purchase and will sell this on a yard sale or give it away  it is just awful how it leaks  other wise its ok  easy set up and take down  a little bulky as it does not fold up good      
157,1.0,                       used to be you could depend on coleman for high quality gear  but no longer  easy enough to set up  but as soon as you start to look at it closely it s obvious that the people making testing these tents aren t being paid enough to care  the seams were sloppy and unfinished in many places  and the door was sewn with too little fabric   so much so that in zipping it shut the tent fabric gets pulled so tight the seams around the door started to tear the first time i set it up  a night of light rain  thankfully the test run and not our trip   left the interior floor covered with several massive puddles  sadly  i am returning this one      
158,5.0,                       this tent has been a game changer for me  it s portable for car camping  i wouldn t recommend for any backpacking trips  but larger than i expected when assembled  the easiest set up even for the not so savvy folk  saves time and frustration  with less pieces to fuss with  couldn t beat the price and after researching many similar tents i m glad i trusted my gut with coleman  i would to air out the tent for a day or so before use for any future buyers  does have a strong manufacture smell that s probably not too good to sleep in upon arrival      
159,5.0,                       i highly recommend this tent  the material is excellent  it is very big and comfortable  it is dark inside during day time so you definitely need to open all the windows to get good light inside  i went camping during winter time  and it doesn t get too cold inside  highly waterproof     it doesn t move at all  one night  it was raining  hard and very windy  and it passed the test  you can fit three twins air mattresses and you still will have extra space  it is very easy to built or assemble and disassemble or tear down  it is easy to cary  it is not too heavy      
160,5.0,                       coleman advertises that you can set up this tent in   minute  it took me   minutes  but i m disabled  taking the tent down and putting it into the carry sack took   minutes  i applied waterproofing to the tent before leaving on vacation  it stood up to a whole night of adirondack rain without a single drop of water coming in  even the walls stayed dry  the tent does less well in wind  i suspect that anything over    mph might present a problem despite being a    person  tent  this really fits   people comfortably  it s roomy and airy and you can stand upright if you re under    tall  great for car camping  highly recommended      
161,5.0,                       i had to sell my last  easy up  tent when i found myself a single mom that still wanted to continue our annual camping trip but couldn t get the tent up  even with the help of the camp hosts  i bought this tent because of the claims that it goes up in    seconds  i m     and i was easily able to set this tent up by myself in   minute with another   minutes for pounding in the stakes  we have only used it in summer in california so i don t know about any leaking issues  it held up with morning dew   i read about on other reviews but i highly recommend this to my fellow single moms  you can do it      
162,5.0,                       this tent was amazing for our camping experience   it was just   of us in the tent  myself  my husband and our   year old son   we had a queen sized air mattress in the tent   we had plenty of room to keep belongings and toys in our tent   we did not experience any rain or wind when we used our tent so i cant comment on that   but it was very sturdy  easy to put up and we loved are the mesh windows on the tent   my   year old was able to enter and exit the tent on his own   i didn t like how easy the gnats got in the tent but we really couldn t control that and it wasn t too many  maybe   or     if your camping when it s warm during the day make sure you open the mesh windows to get air circulating through the tent or it will get hot and muggy in there      
163,5.0,                       bought this tent because with my elderly hands  it has become difficult to put up a regular tent by myself   the first time i set it up it took me a little longer    min     that included hammering the tielines   i only use them when it is windy  so setting up the tent without them is super fast   fellow campers are amazed how fast an old lady puts up her tent the size is perfect for my dog and myself   i use a twin aero bed  a honeypot   and still have enough room to bring in my little table  in inclement weather   i can walk around fully erect   when i take my granddaughter  we have enough room to use it to sleep in   there is no rain flap so i bring along one of those shade things just in case it is called a   person tent   i suppose if all it was used for was putting your head on the ground to sleep  it might accommodate    mummy bags squished together      
164,5.0,                       i originally had a   person tent made by coleman and was very impressed but really didnt need a   room tent  i went to downgrade but ended up upgrading in a way  this tent is indeed smaller but fits a queen size matress and has about a foot left in one direction for your things  theres a pocked on the left and right side that fits my cellphones and the other nicely fits our toiletries  this tent is perfect for   people   not sure about    with a bed  and   backpacks  you have just enough room for all of it the best part is not that it can be put up by one person   no   the best part is that it goes back in the bag  unlike other tents which i just couldn t get to fit  this one folds up and fits without any issue  theres even enough room to store the camp cookware and matress inflation thing i bought  very nice      
165,5.0,                       i haven t used this tent yet but i did set it up in my front yard to see if the setup was as fast as they claimed it would be and i m impressed i was able to set this up quickly  and i even had my two year old climbing on me begging  mommy up  the entire time   i had it up in under a minute amd it was just easy to take down   i can t wait to take this camping  i definitely recommend this tent      
166,5.0,                       umm  i get that there has to be a standard to measure tents but this is called a   person tent and we had to stuff two twin mattresses and a cot in   eventually it was a quick set up after trying to set it up upside down   in the cold   in the rain   all by myself   young grandchildren are not much help   actually it was pretty miserable and the directions were not very explicit   next time when the weather conditions are better and nerves are a little more calm i m sure it will go better   once i got it set up and before i got the tarp over the roof it rained pretty hard but everything was dry except the opening for the door   after i wiped up the rain it stayed dry and we very comfortable   i would say this tent would be perfect for two people with a twin mattress on each side   i like using a cot because you can stow bags and gear under the cot leaving room on the floor to move around in   i always trust the coleman brand      
167,5.0,                       although i have only used this tent once  i pitched it alone in    to    mph winds  behind a small fence which gave me a little bit of wind protection   i have not tested it for water  etc   if i can use it   more times without a rip etc  the investment would be better than excellent   i had some help getting the tent back down and put away   i need to state for the record that i have zero instincts when it comes to all things mechanical  and i am working on getting my complete idiot certification   for those of you without a sense of humor  that means this tent was designed by geniuses so that we lesser mortals could use it      
168,1.0,                       wow  i lived the size and price  but we had issues the first time we took it out the bars got stuck and we realized they were broken  we were able to return it and get a replacement  once the replacement was received we took it out and used it in our backyard just to make sure it worked  it did fine but water did get in even with the tarp  no big deal but just fyi  the  we put it away and three months later  we went camping in utah  it was windy but man does that tent make noise  it woke us up constantly  it was horrible and the wind wasn t extreme  but the  when we were taking it down one of the bars just split and broke    and now i have no options to return it  get something else  don t waste your money      
169,4.0,                       we re using this as a covered  cat proof sand pit in the yard for our toddler so i had to find one an adult could comfortably spread time in  the set up was easy but required two people  the height is great  and it s sturdy enough i m sure it will last the season  unlike several paper thin tents we ve had the misfortune of previously trying   it also seems perfectly capable of standing up to our wind  my only negative is some small amount water from the sprinklers gets in through the windows or door every day because the closure zippers don t quite overlap completely  if i were using this for camping  i may never have noticed as rain falls down from the sky  not pressured against the windows and door from the side  but i m not so  it is what it is      
170,5.0,                       this tent was perfect for our quick   day camping trip  it really is super easy and quick to set up  so convenient  the reason i did   stars for water resistant is because you have to close all the windows if it s raining so you don t get much air flow and can t see outside  it s kind of hard to get back in the bag  but this was a great purchase for those spontaneous camping trips  it fit myself  my husband on a full size air mattress and our toddler on a toddler sized air mattress with a little room to walk between the two  i wouldn t sleep more than that unless you were planning to sleep on the ground right next to each other      
171,5.0,                       amazingly easy to set up in less than a minute  i was dubious but it s really well engineered  also used as a cold shelter for plants in freezing weather and worked superbly  it nearly fell out of the case  extend the four arms and they snap into place and now your tent is set up   as advertised  instant   unlike most everything i looked at  all the windows zip shut for great weather protection  there is a really easy simply roof vent that velcros open  ample tiedowns for windy weather  but it is really instantly self supporting    great quality and a rare purchase indeed when everything seems to work the way it was thoughtfully designed  five stars coleman   austin texas     
172,1.0,                       i guess the    sec setup time is accurate   just so long as you don t plan on staking this tent down  securing the guide lines  or putting on the rainfly  sold separately   disassembly time however is less than that if you are sleeping in the tent and a gust of wind comes up  i used this tent for one night and we had       mph winds and the tent collapsed   separate times throughout the night  each time resulted in someone getting hit in the head by one of the pole coming down  trying to set the tent back up in the wind resulted in every pole bending  whoever decided that a normal set of tent poles were to complicated and replaced them with this stupid design should be fired  none of the elbow joints between the walls and roof lock and the connection point at the peak just allows the poles to rotate     degrees  terrible and stupid design  i doubt you could even set this tent up indoors with a fan running on low speed and not have it collapse  my other complaint with this tent is that it doesn t come with a rain fly  who doesn t include a rainfly with their tent  coleman  that s who  and the rain fly they sell separately for this tent is utterly useless except to determine which way the wind is blowing  honestly i d have been better off sleeping under a tarp  save yourself the headache  literally  and buy a real tent      
173,3.0,                       it does hold up to strong winds especially when laden with goods  it is also very roomy  i m      and i can stand straight up inside this tent  i was able to set it up myself with no prior tent setting up experience  the down sides  this tent does not keep the water out as shown by this morning s pics  in fact  it bleeds the water in especially at the seams   it does not keep the cold out as i hoped it would but it does keep the breeze out  it gets very hot in spring and summer like climates but that is alleviated by exposing the netting  which lets air flow in  the netting  however  does not keep out mosquitoes or small flies  it does not live up to the hype but in moderate temperatures  dry weather  bug free and mild wind environments  this tent works great      
174,1.0,                       this tent was easy to setup  but mine came damaged  they did not assemble the poles correctly  so it was hard to put up and take down  my husband had to reassemble the poles  there was also a small tear on the floor of the tent  i have reached out to coleman  without any reply so far  other than these issues  seems like it will be a great tent  will update my review if coleman replies      
175,2.0,                       i bought this tent aware of mixed reviews as to rain resistance  i tested it last night in my backyard during a moderate  sustained rain  i carefully closed all the zippers and the roof vent the tent leaked a lot of water  much more than i d find acceptable while camping  it wasn t condensation as no one was in the tent during the testi feel that amazon s description of the tent  which describes an  integrated vented rainfly  and includes  weathertec system   patented welded floors and inverted seams help keep water out  borders on misleading several reviews state the additional rainfly is not helpful  although some say that it is in light of the delightfully easy setup  you might consider this for fair weather car camping  definitely not recommended if rain is forecast      
176,4.0,                       overall nice tent  especially for casual campers pros convenient  very quick and simple setup    minute or less of setup time and you have a free standing tent  i ve even set it up at night with very little hassle sturdy build   as long as it is staked down properly  it will hold up very well even in very windy conditions plenty of ventilation when you open up the windows  which are on all   sides  plus there s a zippered mesh roof vent that you can open or close from inside roomy if you accept the fact that no   man rated tent will actually fit   people and gear    this is really more suitable for   people max   fits a queen size air mattress and that leaves about     feet of storage space to spare running the length of the tent   ceiling height is just shy of   feet cons waterproofing out of the box is not great  i would recommend sealing the tent prior if you are expecting any kind of precipitation  on the same note  it is ridiculous that this tent does not come with the rain fly included only has one door flap  and it is fairly small when you consider the size of the tent   also  opening the door involves   separate zippers that meet at the lower outer corner of the door  rather than having one continuous run   this leaves a gap that ants and other small insects could use to gain entry weight and packed size  the tent is necessarily heavy due to it s construction  and does not pack compactly  folded down  the tent poles package is a little over three feet long  the included carry bag is sized appropriately though  so getting it back in there has not been an issue      
177,5.0,                       this tent is awesome  if you re like me and don t want to deal with poles and frames and nonsense setting a tent up   buy this  i didn t even look at the instructions  took    seconds to set up  the only things that could be better   increase rain coverage   it didn t rain on me and seems like it d be fine in regular rain  but if it starts going hard   could be an issue  then again  you re in a tent  soooo   also the zipper could be a bit more accessible   add a little plastic piece to the zipper handle so you don t need to search for it only have the leverage of a small zipper  all in all though seriously  super super happy w this tent  surprisingly happy  if you want an easy awesome experience  look no further  don t waste time with other  instant  tents  this is the one you want  for one person it was like a suite in the woods  for    tight  for    prob perfect      
178,5.0,                       when it comes to camping  my greatest pain in the  you know what  is set up and take down of the campsite  this tent makes it so simple and fast it is amazing that no one thought of it sooner  we just returned from a three night excursion in the desert and it held up just fine  what was even better was that i asked my kids to set it up at our second site and they had it up in about five minutes  if they weren t arguing  it could go much faster   very simple and fast  it takes longer to stake it down than it does to put the tent up we didn t have the rain  it was a desert  so i can t comment on the water  proofness  of the tent  but there was a continuous twenty plus mph wind with some gusts the first night  it got blown around quite a bit  but it didn t move  tear  or collapse from the strongest gusts    a neighboring tent had the old curved pole style tent skeleton from a brand sold by a big box store that doesn t even sell walls and their tent was wobbling back and forth like it was about to fall over so it seems sturdy   but we did invest in real stakes as this comes with the typical little wire type  it is a big box though   the bag it comes in is narrow  but long  and it is not very lightweight  definitely a car camper tent  the tent folded up is about four feet long  so it does take up space even collapsed   and i don t understand how you d get six in there   three was great   four would be a little tight  quality thus far seems outstanding   i m very happy with it      
179,1.0,                       completely ruined out camping trip and this tent turned it into a nightmare  first night it was only light rain and it leaked at every side so badly it was flooding our sleeping areas  this is even with the rainfly installed  not at all water proof and very far from even water resistant  bought it regardless of some reviews indicating theirs leaked because of the coleman advertisement with them testing it under extreme conditions of wind and rain  they don t test any apparently  only test one from production and call it good and everything else goes out to customers with flawed products  do not buy  save yourself the headache      
180,5.0,                       love this tent   i m a    petite woman and put the tent up myself   easy to take down and fold according to instructions   this tent made camping such a pleasure for me on how quickly it set up   it stood up so well to a huge  huge wind storm lasting day and night   the tent and support lines stayed sturdy and tight   make sure to extend the bottom floor of the tent to the most it will suitably expand   it s size is very comfortable for one or two persons   i do not like cramped spaces   i would buy again and recommend to others      
181,5.0,                       i loved how easy it was to set up  pretty much extend and click in place  it s large inside and tall  i am     and still had a couple inches till the top  even standing in the corner  we fit my husband and i and our   yr old inside  the weather was dewy and it did not leak through but had light condensation  i would believe it s not waterproof  if it rained it may have some condensation inside the tent  the tent was also easy to disassemble and put back into bag      
182,1.0,                       i purchased this tent back in december       with the intention of using it during our summer months in alaska  we finally have a weekend that s nice enough to go camping  so i just opened the box today and set it up in our yard to test it out  as soon as i closed the door  i found that the bottom zipper had come off its track  there appears to be several stitches at the end of the zipper that are frayed or missing  leaving us unable to securely close the bottom of the tent  with the amount of rain and bugs we have here  this defect pretty much negates the use of this tent for us  i m hoping this is just a one off  and that i can get a replacement sent to us  otherwise  the tent was very easy to set up  and has plenty of room inside      
183,5.0,                       this tent is the easiest and most lightweight tent out there   it arrived quickly and every day i told myself we need to set this up before we use it so we know what we are doing   well every day came and went   life is too busy for a practice run for us   we went on our vacation and packed it anyway   we finally got to a place where we could use the tent  took it out of the bag and set it up practically without reading the instructions   it was that simple   the downside was  our queen size air mattress  had to be filled inside the tent because it doesnt fit through the door   with that being said  it s probably in our best interest to find a smaller mattress as this one is nearly wall to wall   there are literally just inches on all four sides   but it was a good night as we did not get wet      
184,5.0,                       this tent is rated     mph winds  well i can attest to the strength fo this tent   this tent stood strong for at least   min  against tornado winds this yr  on my annual father s day fishing trip  it did get knocked down but it was the last tent to go down and i was in it when the rains started  when i realized it was time to vacate my tent  all the other tents were gone and being blown everwhere   dont think for   min  this tent is going to protect u in a bad storm like the one we were in cause it s not but this just shows how tough the tent really is  the tent is really easy to erect  one person job  it s not too heavy to carry unless its got  in  of water in it    lol   true story      
185,1.0,                       the description of the product got me into purchasing it  we finally tested it for one night camping  the set up is not hard and i had no problems i wish they had a double door concept so you can open the door with the second screen door like the windows in the morning the inside of the tent walls had an excessive moisture on it and my wife though it was due to the overnight rain  i am positive it was the condensation  i opened the top vents for the night bu it did not help  still thinking if i should return it update terrible one and i had to change it to one star  the tent doesn t hold any rain at all and the walls ar getting wet pretty fast  i had to scoop out the water today as the floor was flooded terrible         
186,3.0,                       tent is great  way smaller than expected  there is no chance that this is for   people    not even   honestly if you want to have your overnight bag near you  my boyfriend and i have a queen mattress inside and just enough room to keep our stuff next to us  we are pretty cramped unless we are laying down so we would strictly use it for sleeping  not to hangout in  also  tent is heavy so do not plan to travel with it on your back to camp somewhere we are also dealing with a fabrication issue with the door  we have a hard time shutting the door and it seems to be because the material is too tight between where zipper meets the fabric  we have noticed it start to cause stress on the material and zipper is pulling from material  might have to slit and sew in a new piece of fabric in order to levitate the stress      
187,5.0,                       this is the second coleman instant setup cabin tent i have purchased   the first one was a   person and i loved it   i added the second one for my expanding family with each tent i added the optional rainfly accessory plus treated the tent with some water proofing and seam sealer before taking it to the mountains   they have kept the elements off my head for a couple yrs now and do well against the wind these tents set up in seconds  seriously   i have had fellow campers offer to help set up the tents but politely said i didn t need assistance   a moment later the tent was set up and i heard comments from a neighboring camp site how quick it went up this tent is certainly the excellent quality everyone expects from coleman      
188,5.0,                       i can t believe how far tents have come  i literally set this up in under a minute   take down was under   mins  take down is longer because you have to get enough air out to get it in the bag  the carrying bag is also really well thought out  as it is larger than necessary  this was also larger than i imagined  we had   teens sleep in it with all their belongings for   nights  they had plenty of room   said they could have easily fit a few more  i also purchased the  used  option for a pretty good discount   it was brand new  only the box had been opened  very happy with this purchase      
189,5.0,                       i purchased this tent several years ago  i love it  for those who have complained about leaking  i would ask what they did about waterproofing  the first thing i did was set this tent up in my backyard  i used waterproofing on all seams and zippers  inside and out  i used a ground cloth and purchased the fly  which i also waterproofed  i used this tent for a solid month of camping on  my own  i was particularly interested in a tent i could manage on my own  i am a     year old woman  this was great  during the month of camping  i had rain and wind  and this tent held up like a charm  i highly recommend it  for the     it s a bargain      
190,3.0,                       i would say this is the perfect tent  the only downside to this is this tent will have it s limits  if it s raining you might as well pack up and go home  the seams and windows caused us to be soaked and cold all night  the fabric itself is not waterproof and still can have drips pour down from the ceiling   all in all its very nice  i am      and was able to stand in the center with just bending my head just a little bit which was nice  we had   full blow up beds and managed to still have plenty of room to store our things  plus  putting it up and taking it down is very simple  it was a champ when we had close to    mph winds  did not even have a stack rip out  pretty durable when it comes to staying in place  i would say it s fairly reasonable  but if it rains go grab a tarp      
191,4.0,                       i have been a camper for over    years  i am not a huge fan of the tents produced today   i camped with this tent last weekend  it poured in the middle of the night  in the morning there was some water in the tent but not a lot   i did use the rain fly and there was still a small amount   it was easy to put up by myself   it took not time to put up and down but i am an old goat when it comes to putting up tents   this is a good tent if you are going camping and there is a chance of rain but not a great tent if you are going to have a lot of rain   in my opinion      
192,1.0,                       i normally do not write these kinds of reviews  i take everything up with the company s customer service  however  i was working with customer service to submit a claim on my   person pop up tent and once i spoke with them the first time and submitted my claim it has been impossible to get into contact with anyone at coleman  i have tried to live chat on their website   times and each time i am connected with an agent it says to give them a moment to respond to my question and i have waited up to    minutes just to have them end the chat  i have sat on the phone   times for up to    minutes just to have the phone ring and disconnect me  i have sent     e mails inquiring on my case which i have not heard a response back  i started this claim a month ago on my tent because the tent ripped my second time using it  i just want to warn anyone else who buys from coleman that if something goes wrong with the tent good luck getting a hold of them to fix the issue and make it right i tried to be patient because i know everyone is understaffed due to covid however a month to wait on a reply to an e mail is too long of a wait when employees can respond to e mails from home      
193,4.0,                       setup is great and easy   much quicker than traditional tent setup   relatively easy to take down and store  smaller than traditional cabin tents  more flimsy than i tend to like   if camping in mild   dry conditions it works great   if camping in any rain or wind weather i would be concerned the dark technology definitely works   much darker than most tents      
194,5.0,                       we are the talk of the campgrounds with this instant tent  my husband can put it together by himself in about three minutes  and certainly in the    second range with my assistance we have huge family reunion style camping trips every year and every year our tent is the easiest to put up and take down  even though the time we save constructing and deconstructing it is immediately spent helping other family members with their cumbersome tents  it is nice to have one less big thing to do when camping and more time in the long run enjoying the outdoors i have had absolutely no issues with this tent  i have found that it also seems to do a better job keeping us warm in cooler weather  when other campers are talking about how cold the weather was overnight  we spend the evenings pretty comfortable  we don t tend to spend much time in it in the daytime  though  so i could imagine it getting pretty hot in there during a sunny summer day  that seems pretty standard for a tent though another note  bugs  i am completely uncomfortable with the idea of a tent teeming with bugs  i can say that we have not had any issues with bugs getting inside the tent  as long as you keep it zipped up  you shouldn t have any problems  it s pretty bug secure as far as capacity  i think   people  could  go inside tetris style  but it probably won t be the most comfortable arrangement  i can imagine if someone had to get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night  someone would end up getting stepped on  we have used it as a family of three and now a family of four  it is a pretty perfect size for our family of two adults and two children under the age of three if you are in the market for a family tent you can t go wrong with this one      
195,5.0,                        st time setup with my husband  and we re nubies to tent camping  apprx    minutes  but we laid down a tarp  st as added protection we re thinking  nd time setup will go much faster     stars though for the tent itself     st night we had a   hour thunderstorm   we didn t blow away nor did we get wet      for the roominess    we used   queen sized blow up mattress  we will have   this next trip      adults   stars for quality control though  we re missing a guy line other than that  super easy to setup   take down   held up well        
196,5.0,                       this is a great tent   i ve been looking for a tent that was easily deployed without having to mess with all the rods of all your standard ones   you can literally set this up in less than a minute   it s also very roomy   i m    and i have no trouble laying in any position in this tent   i have at least one foot of clearance from my head and feet at all times   you can fit a full sized air mattress in it with still plenty of space to store gear   i haven t seen the water resilience of it yet  but overall it is awesome      
197,5.0,                       the tent truly sets up in about a minute  but  it also is very quick and easy to tear down too very sturdy  a lot of ventilation when needed  water resistant  felt dampness on the tent  but water moisture did not get inside the easyness and quickness of setup and tear down is great for campers constantly on the go or those just not wanting to fiddle with tent poles another awesome feature is the carry bag has a pull tab where it widens  because we can never get bags or tents folded as nice and neat as the manufacturer  the bag being able to widen makes it so easy to pack the tent away      
198,1.0,                       we used this tent once  these are photos from   nights of just rain    no storm  no strong winds  this tent claims to be weatherproof  but our soaking wet sleeping bags say otherwise  the integrated rain fly was supposed to offer more protection  and it seemed non existent instead  aside from the fact it leaked all over us  this tent is almost half the size we were expecting  the details say it can fit   queen size air beds    this must be impossible  we had one cot and one single sleeping bag next to it and had no extra space  this made for an incredibly uncomfortable weekend  and we ve wasted our money      
199,5.0,                       oh my god buy this tent   i am a scoutmaster for a huge cubscout troop and this is the best tent i have ever seen for ease of use   we take    people camping at a time and these make the whole thing way more manageable where the heck was this awesome design all those years ago when i was doing all that camping   i ve just gotten back into regular camping in the past     years and wow   i don t know when mankind invented this variant of the  quick set up tent  but this thing is like jumping from an old mail order sears catalog to amazon prime i can not stress how much better this tent and it s variants    man   man   man  are than all the shock cord  easy assembly  tents out there note buy the rain fly   it should come with it  and coleman sucks for not just including it because this tent needs it  but even after buying the tent and rain fly  this is reasonable and totally worth every penny      
200,5.0,                       i bought this tent when our family went to a cub scout camp out   years ago  the first night  we had pour rain  this tent surprisingly held up well  i like this tent because i can set it up on my own and i can change my clothes inside standing up  the first few times  it might be hard for me to stuff the tent back in but after a few practices it s no problem  yesterday  a plastic part of this tent finally broke  again  we didn t do much maintenance for this tent  like applying seam sealant  drying it out after a wet camp out  probably transporting it roughly       
201,3.0,                       i ve had this product for a little over two years now  it s been through a couple of storms  one was pretty darn windy and it held its own  the rain did puddle up in the corners a little and did drip down the sides under the windows  we slept in it in    degree f nights and it did get pretty cold but not too bad  the seams have started to come undone this year   prior i did not use seam sealer  the assembly is crazy easy  the inside is very roomy  you can easily stand straight up inside  i m       and have room above you   makes it easy to change clothing  all windows do have a zipper and ties  disassembling the tent is easy but rolling it up and getting all the air out and trying to squeeze it together is a pain the a    especially when it s wet      
202,4.0,                       great car ca ping tent  kightweight  well designed  fpr dry climate use  think arizona  new mexico  and baja  sets up quickly and easilly with just one person   we had it setup for my daughter to quarrantine in on the back deck with an  x   waterproof tarp covering it and it still lraked everywhere flooding the inside and soaking my daughter   her matress and all her clothes and books  after a  heavy pinealpple express rainstorm the floor  needs a drain  was more like a bath tub holding    of cold rain water inside   as several reviewers said this otherwise excellent tent is not well waterproof sealed despite otherwise being of top design and materials   a tent not offering full dryness protection from rain is simply not suitable for camping use   the overall design and materials  fabric poles etc   seem to be of typical coleman quality  a brand one may normally rely upon   please believe the many honest user reviews on this product  thank you  lee kravitz      
203,4.0,                       i purchased this tent mainly for the cabin style  the ability to stand up in all areas  and the easy assembly  the tent is super easy to set up and we love it  my husband waterproofed it further  so we had no issues with mild rain  we love all the windows and that its tall enough to stand  i m giving this   stars for   reasons      its so hard to get back in the bag     oh my gosh i wish companies would catch on that the tent will never fit into the bag again as it does when packaged  it takes my husband wrestling it and then straddling it so i can tie the rope until we can get it into the bag  not a deal breaker   but it s not pleasant   don t disassemble this tent alone or with someone you love unless you feel like arguing lol  it does not go smoothly      i prefer a tent with a place for an extension cord to run through somewhere other than the door  all of our other tents have this      again  not a deal breaker   but the zipper starts at the bottom  and there is only    it got annoying having to constantly bend all the way down to try and reach it to pull it up  i prefer either   zippers so you can choose   or starting from the top so i can find the zipper when i m not bent over sweating in    degree weather   dall in all we live this tent  would definitely buy again      
204,2.0,                       i bought this tent during the winter so i got a good deal  went to test the tent out this week before we went camping to make sure the tent was ok to go  opened the brand new box pulled out the tent and when my boys and i went to set it up one of the poles was stuck  couldn t pull it out  checked it and they put the pole in backwards   tried to see if i could return it and get another one before we go camping and i couldn t find my order number because it s been so long  so i decided to take matters in my own hand and try to fix it myself   it took me over   hours to take that piece out and put it the right way  so lesson learned if your buying from amazon be sure to check your item first  i was thinking this was a return and they just put it back on the self to resell it      
205,2.0,                       item arrived damaged  it would be way too much of a chore to return it because that involves carrying it to another place  and is tent is really heavy to shoulder more than a mile  and my bike is damaged  so i have no way of transporting it except by hand  the roof leaks  so i had to put a tarp over it and there s a hole in the side  so i will eventually have to use duct tape  i don t mind  but other customers might mind   coleman or somebody should check the product before shipping it  since the tent is so heavy  the people handling it during shipping probably drop it or something      
206,5.0,                       before last night  i had never been in a tent  and certainly never put one up   i bought this tent because i currently cannot sleep in my house   after watching the youtube videos  i put it up in no time   got all my stuff in it and settled down for the night   then it started raining     boy  was i glad i had a tent   there was no problem with any rain leaking in   i love the big windows and the size is great for my bedding  a chair and my porta toilet    have lots of room to spare   in the am there was alot of condensation on the inner walls  but when i went outside  the humidity and the grass etc  was also full of moisture   i m in a tent  i don t expect to be in a hotel   i love it so far   also  the price i got was great   and it arrived very quickly after several days use  i still love this tent   however  we did have a heavy rain and though i did not see the rain or feel it  there was water on the floor when i awoke   i have just purchased the rainfly on amazon  and hopefully that will solve that problem one more update   i received the rainfly and it works great   we had some really heavy rain recently and absolutely none got inside the tent    i even forgot to zip up one of the windows   i am still very happy with this tent      
207,3.0,                       it really needs a fly  the first night i used the tent it didn t rain but there was a heavy dew   in the morning i woke up with water dripping on my head   it seems to leak above the window   it looks like there was some attempt to seal the seams in the factory   but it s not adequate  the next day   there was a thunderstorm and heavy downpour   the tent stood up well to that without any water coming in   later there was a long soaking rain   which did show up some leaks   again   above the back window and front window there is only one door and it s over to the side   it would be hard to use with two cots set up  the walls slope   i was using the teton xxl camp cot which stretched from the back wall to the front  the cot level was just below the windows  with all the windows opened the tent is airy and invites every breeze   nice on a hot day or night   and very useful for drying the tent out in the sunshine after the rain it is very easy to put up   takes straightly longer to pack down into the provided bag  when i took it down   i found there was a pool of water that had gotten trapped on top   not sure how that happened  the packed up tent is kind of long and took up a lot of space in the car the floor of this tent is that thick plasticy stuff that seems to be like tarp material  i don t feel the need for a groundsheet  the bath tub design was good protection against heavy rain  the floor is one of the best features of this tent so  in summary  easy to put up   needs a fly   kind of heavy and bulky to transport      
208,3.0,                       i purchased this tent a few weeks ago  it is alright  i noticed a tear on the inner right corner of the tent   on the outside is where the tent leg is  i used it a few times  i didn t noticed it before until i was sweeping it out   so i don t know if it was already there or if it is something new  but overall  this tent is easy to put up  putting it away takes a little bit of time but it is easier than most tent tear downs my rating is taking durability into account and also it is ok in light rain but can get wet  spray on tent sealant  you should be ok in light rain      
209,5.0,                       this is a fantastic tent  my daughter and i arrived at the campsite before my husband and were left to set this up on our own  we are  indoor girls  and it was dark so i was a little worried  we had it up in no time at all and high fived each other for our accomplishment  the real test came when we went to sleep as it was extremely cold  windy and some light rain through the night  we could hear the crazy wind howling yet did not feel so much as a draft  we stayed quite warm and very dry as well  this tent is extremely weather proof  the zippers also worked well and the material is nice and sturdy  what a wonderful little tent  i highly recommend to anyone who is looking to purchase  you will not regret it      
210,5.0,                       tried it out in the backyard and it took me and my    year old niece     seconds to set it up  took a camping on the beach and i love the panoramic view  we got two rounds of rain in the middle of the night   st round was heavy rain for about an hour and i was a bit nervous   nd round i was able to enjoy with confidence in my tent cabin  happy to say that not a single droplet got in  i recommend you get heavy duty spikes to keep it secure but that s true for any tent  my   year old son and i love it and highly recommend it  i got the rainfly and it was even better in the rain because i could keep the window open without getting water inside  later that day the santa ana winds kicked up something fierce      wind gust and the tent held its own like a champ   we didnt feel like there was much wind when inside the tent but once outside we could feel it  great tent  just invest on heavy duty spikes and go camping    love love love it        
211,3.0,                       after doing a little research i opted for this coleman instant tent     i actually thought it was made in the usa  silly me for assuming that     the demonstration videos seemed a little misleading  there is nothing instant about the pitching or the take down  regular pole setup tents pitch just as fast and weigh a lot less     we took the tent straight from the box to our camp site and noticed several small holes at the rear of the tent where the  thin  floor meets the wall needless to say that i am returning this tent and getting another pole style tent      
212,5.0,                       very easy to set up and take down  and a lot easier to stow than my old tension pole coleman tent   the storage bag allows the user to rip off the labels   and thusly  the storage bag will accommodate a newly re packed tent  because everybody knows that those danged bags don t properly store a tent once it s been unfurled     zips up well  and can easily store all your gear if you re one or two bodies with a queen sized air mattress  with the added rain fly  sold separately   works well for drizzly weather   a bit heavy  so something useful if you re not on a long trek to your site      
213,5.0,                       this defiantly improved our camping experience  setting up and taking down tent have always been so painful  this tent is a time saver  once it s pulled out from the bag  it took us less than   min  to set it up  amazing  it also can be set up by one person with no help   we bought   person tent  and it is perfect for   camping cots with walking space  i don t think it will hold   camping cots in there  maybe        
214,4.0,                       november   th        we just got our tent yesterday and put it up as a test in about   minutes  we were inside of family room so the delay was that we had to move some furniture around as we put it up    it went up with ease with two people and i can see me putting it up myself if needed  could standup well in tent   i am      and the roof is at least   inches above my head   also bought the sealer and matching coleman rainfly  will apply sealer today   going camping  in winter time  soon   will return and add to review about the tent s weather resistance   just did not see a special opening for electric cords   but the front door has a spot near the bottom where we can use for the electrical cord to come into the tent  see ya soon for part two      
215,1.0,                       worst tent system ever  product arrived with rips on bag and darkroom material  the legs  click  when extended but there is no locking mechanism at the elbows or connections so the poles constantly want to twist and bend the whole system back into itself  i setup in the yard for airing out and sealing the seams  i didn t have a chance to seal it because even with the rain fly on  a small gust of wind collapsed the tent right where we would have been sleeping if we were using it  i read other reviews with similar complaints before purchasing and wish i had heeded the warnings      
216,1.0,                       when this tent arrived  i put it up in the back yard  it went up very easy  adding the rainfly went on with ease also  i thought i would love this tent  it was spacious inside and the height was perfect as i wanted a tent we could stand up inside  then  i took the tent down and packed it for our camping trip  the take down was easy as putting it up   shortly after setting up the tent at our campsite  it began to rain  the tent leaked all around the seams  water was running down the seam at the door and one of the windows  we had to move our gear to the center of the tent and slept in our cars that night  i contacted coleman about our issues but have not received a reply  the positives i can say about this tent is that it was easy to put up take down  the size was great and it looked good  the negative  you will get wet if it rains  and that outweighs all the positives  i do  not recommend this tent      
217,5.0,                       did lots of research trying to find the best family tent for our family of   to go camping   i was nervous because my wife had never been tent camping before and insisted i buy a good tent to make a great experience  this tent has been awesome for the two trips we have taken so far here are some of my thoughts regarding cool features about this tent   size   we were able to fit   twin size air mattresses side by side in the tent  and that s it   that s from one edge of the tent to the other    that left a good amount of space for our gear and our dog at the foot of the bed great for sleeping   people  probably good for     definitely not     unless they re all kids and really comfortable with each other    height is nice   great for me  at       to be able to stand up in the tent   darkness  love the dark rest   it keeps the tent dark enough or us to be able to sleep in on a bright summer morning   keeps it nice and cool too   set up  super easy   i was able to set it up by myself in about      minutes  with a helper  probably would be under   minutes    for a tent that size that is amazing   weather  this one i was really worried about   we were lucky to have dry days both camping trips so i unfortunately can t comment on how waterproof it is   did hold up to wind nicely and the re enforcing strings it comes with are very helpful for this   note that the tent comes with a rainfly and without it the roof of the tent is just mesh   door  it is hinged  has a flexible pole inside the door to turn it into an actual  door  and not just a piece of fabric   not sure initially how i would like this  but in hindsight  i love it   most of the time  you can keep the door  closed  but not zipped shut  allowing you to go in and out of the tent without leaving the tent door  open    nice feature   weight   it s heavy   i can carry it easily from the car to the tent site but this is definitely not a backpacking tent  but then again  what     person tent  is   coleman provides a nice bag for it  that allows for extra room after unpacking from the factory  in summary  so far i m impressed with this tent   i m hoping it can stand up to a rainstorm or two  but for car camping it s got everything we need   love it      
218,1.0,                       i set it up in the back yard to test it out and spray it with kiwi  even after   coats of kiwi this tent leaked bad  it s a design flaw  it happens around the seams where it s was sewn because the holes are too big  it also leaked bad around the doors  i didn t spray it with a hose or anything  leaks occurred during a light to medium   hour rain period      
219,4.0,                       this is a pretty great tent  when buying a tent  always keep in mind that it s measured for kids  if it s a   person tent it will only really fit   adult comfortably  that s nothing against this tent specifically we did not have to waterproof this tent  it rained pretty heavily the first time using it  the only water inside was due to condensation from keeping it completely closed up while sleeping in the rain storm  although i did strap a separate tarp over it for added protection it s easy to put up  but a bit more difficult to take down as it doesn t have built in straps to go around it also the only other negative aspect is it has no rain fly over the door  the angle that the front of the tent is on will let water right in if opening the door while raining overall it s a well working tent for   adults    person tent       
220,5.0,                       i ve seen many comments about this tent not being good for camping if it s raining   keep in mind that almost all tents are water resistant  not water proof   i placed a tarp under the footprint of the tent to protect the tent  bathtub    this will help shield the bottom from sharp rocks  stickers  and glass pieces   also  we take our shoes off when entering the tent   i didn t want to spend     bucks for the rain fly  so i went to home depot and bought second tarp to cover the top so the water doesn t gather in the low spots   the first time i used the tent  easy to set up   the anchors are worthless  buy some better ones   it rained half the day  almost all night  during three days of camping   my family didn t get wet at all  even though i could feel water puddles under the bathtub   the side of the tent did  sweat  after so much water  but the tent kept us dry   would buy again      
221,5.0,                       tent was fast and easy to set up   i am      woman with a bad back and i was able to set it up myself   my husband is      and he can stand up in the center easily   you do have to bend over a fair bit to get in and out  with the slope of the tent the door is a bit short  love the hinged door when we got the tent the box was pretty messed up  didn t find anything broken until we put the rainfly on   we then found a good quarter sized hole in it and a rip or snag on the same side   started a case with coleman to see about getting it replaced  that was over a month and a half ago and we are going camping in   weeks   their automated phone system is the worst to navigate   so  we love the tent  not so much love for the company help system update   i started the support back in october     month later they did email me back asking for photos of the damage   today almost   months later  we got a brand new tent delivered to the house   so  very happy with column and we love the tent      
222,3.0,                       this is a update to my review of this tent coleman   person instant tent  the waterproof is not true it is water resistant water did not get inside from the top so the rain fly works but the walls became wet and misty  camping in winter zion national park            to              
223,5.0,                       it sure popped up and was ready in a minute  easy as any other tent to stake it down  i m a      guy and i can actually stand up in this thing  such a blessing over having to be on my knees in the smaller   person tents and still have my head hit the roof of the tent my only beef is that it takes    minutes to get the air out and figure out how to pack the thing up in the same bag in which it came out so nice and cozy  but that can be said about any tent i suppose the pop up bit makes it nice and easy to dry it off in the yard if you have to tear down camp when it s wet out      
224,2.0,                       i have been using coleman equipment almost exclusively for    years  we bought this tent with great expectations for the instant tent design  i must say that works well and is a wonderful idea however the basic function of a tent is shelter  i am afraid this tent fails at that two trips   light to moderate rain on both  major puddles all over the tent both times   bought and used rain fly after the first trip  no help    coleman  sorry i will try another brand   amazon was great and took it back      
225,3.0,                       got tricked into thinking that rainfly was not required   pure bs   first night with the tent  had rain   within    minutes  the ceiling of the tent was full of droplets of water   within    minutes  stuff started dripping down   this was not a major rain outside   just regular rain   we had to borrow a tarp from friends  but the damage was done and night ruined   ordering rainfly now   but c mon  include the damn thing and add the extra    bucks into the cost to compensate another con  the door is not that easy to close    it is very easy to open  but closing always requires both hands to keep the flaps properly aligned major pro  the setup is really     minutes   incredible      
226,5.0,                       the coleman pop up tent is surprisingly spacious and easy to put up   for those that want to be introduced to outdoor camping or just enjoying a quick    to   night camping trips   this is a great item to have   i have mainly used rei    person and their hobitat tent simply because quality and durability speaks volume to their name     and their prices   however  this item  although a bit heavy  thanks to the pop up poles themselves which obviously can t be helped    i believe the convenience and efficiency makes up far more than enough  if not  more with the price   value for the buck  it s great   durability and simplicity i have no issues with it   and even the inside space to the tent s usefulness i can t praise it enough      
227,5.0,                       we went camping recently  and this tent was easy to set up even though we set it up in the dark  we really like the tent  it is very spacious  love all the  windows  for airflow   as we were folding the tent we broke one of the joints  oops   we did not sleep much that night and were not thinking much lol   so i tried to search for the part to replace it and could not find it anywhere  i contacted coleman support  i registered the tent first  and explained that i was looking for a part if they could please help me  well  to my surprise  coleman sent me a new tent  now this is great support  i do not know why they could not send me the part but i am not complaining      
228,2.0,                       i very much like how easy the tent is to set up  as advertised you can set this tent up in less than   minute  to do a full set up including staking down the tent  less than    min however  it leaks like the democrats in congress  i went backyard camping with my granddaughter and an unexpected shower popped up that lasted about an hour   i had to wake her up and go in the house  we were soaked  i going to order the rain cover and see if that helps if not it was a big waste of money      
229,2.0,                       we ordered the tent after reading a review on how to weatherproof the tent  we followed the instruction but ended up with a wet and humid tent  basically even if you weatherproof the seams of the tent  the water sips through all walls of the tent including the bottom  the tent is not recommended to be used on rainy days   for us it rained moderately only for an hour   we even purchased the rainfly that goes with the tent  the rain fly basically covers the top part of the tent  the sides are still very much exposed the set up is really quick and convenient  and the price was good  that s why i would give   out of        
230,1.0,                       pros   this tent sets up very  very quickly cons   this item does not fit   people  the fact that it claims to fit   people should qualify as criminal negligence  my wife and i had to sleep outside the tent because it truly fits only   people   this item claims to be weatherproof and  will keep you dry  however  this is      false  my kids woke up in the middle of the night because one of them rolled over and all of the water collecting at the top of the tent  rained on them   huge disappointment  one of the zippers on one of the windows not there  so we could not zip up that side for privacy while changing  this was not surprising because the zippers on this tent were of very poor quality  i do not believe that this tent would last very long for serious campers      
231,1.0,                       after reading several reviews talking about leaks  i soaked mine with the hose for an hour   luckily  it didn t leak   i let it dry and was about to pack it away when i noticed one of the hooks wasn t connected   this is when the one star review begins one of the hooks that fasten the tent to the poles was defective   coleman s manufacturer sewed a smaller hook for the top part of the tent onto the bottom  where the poles are thicker   it snapped instantly when i tried to put it on the thicker pole      
232,4.0,                       this thing is tougher than wood pecker lips  obviously no tent is strong enough to outlast mother nature but they can darn sure try  we tent camp at lake powell and every trip this tent has seen wind  bought in june of    and we have spent about    days in it so far  doesn t sound like much but in reality that s a lot of camping now when you set this thing up you have to guy it down with the rain fly  most trips this has sufficed for me  if not i have to go drive stakes in the ground and put additional guys in and it holds up  if you don t put guys in the ground you need to find a new pleasure as no tent will suit your needs have to say  coleman  you dun guud on dis won       
233,3.0,                       so on its very first use some water leaked in via one of the corner seams from a very light rain   so coleman has some work to do on quality control  other than the   small leak it worked great but since they claim so much about how weather resistant they are i can t give anything about   stars   i haven t decided if i will return it or try to fix the seal myself   will see what coleman has to say   other than that easy to put up and not heavy at all   putting it back in its bag can be a bit of a pain though      
234,4.0,                       this has been a great tent so far  i set it up on my lot on an island in the middle of the mississippi  i have now had it set up about   weeks  i have only stayed in it   times  last night i road out a heavy storm and i didn t have a drop of water in it i set it up all by myself in about    minutes  this was without reading the directions  i could probably do it in   now  with help i could do it in   minutes i gave it a   rating because when i set it up there was a hole in the floor about as big as quarter  not happy about it but not going to pack it up and send it back for that  also  while the front  swinging door  is a very nice feature  it is a pain in the butt to zip a lot of the time other than than it was a great purchase  my plan is to just use this one and leave it set up for this summer while i work on rebuilding my cabin  then i will buy another one for camping in state parks and such  very nice tent for the money      
235,4.0,                       assembles as fast as advertised without any prior practice or trial  i bought this as an upgrade to my dome tent   as i am getting older i am less willing to crawl through little doors and crouch when getting dressed  i use this for   person car camping  plenty of room  decent quality  easy to assemble and break down  i purchased the rain fly separately  the price on this was great as they just released a newer design that is lighter  packs smaller  and is more spacious with the vertical walls  there s no free lunch  and my engineering brain tells me the poles are less substantial and the vertical walls are more vulnerable to wind with the new design  nobody is taking these things in a backpack so weight and packing size are not as big of a concern  this tent packs fairly large for what it is  i looked at some other tents  i thought about the quick assembly and whether or not i really needed it  it s not that setting up a traditional tent  takes a lot of time  it s more about the fact that usually setting up  for me  is at the end of the day or in the dark  it s nice that everything is together as a    piece  assembly  minus the stakes  etc   this was the case for my first time using the tent   it was just about dark and    seconds with a flashlight to review the instructions  printed clearly on the top of either the bag or the pole assembly  was enough to get moving and get the tent up in a minute zipper quality feels decent  the door zipper starts in the bottom right corner and zips up  so you have to open   zippers for a clear entry  or zip one zipper and step over the bottom corner  there are little fold out vents with supports in the roof that are a nice touch  ventilation was good  plenty of light visibility air with the windows down or cracked  all   sides have huge windows      and there are ties for the rolled down windows when needed everything is there that needs to be  it s not mountain hardware  but for the price it s great      
236,5.0,                       coleman instant tents really are the easiest to set up  if packed size weight isn t a factor  such as car or backyard camping   these are the way to go  have this and a larger model  both have spent a lot of time outdoors and have held up well i have seen a number of bad reviews because of leaking issues   my tents have been water tight on multiple days of monsoon heavy rain  without the rain fly accessory if when these tents do wear out  i will get another      
237,1.0,                       i have another   and a   man version of this tent  never had a problem with either in the rain   i used the   man version for a week this past summer at a boy scout summer camp  had a huge storm and only a few drops came in  i got this one for my weekend boy scout campouts as i gave my old one to my older son who is now an asst scoutmaster with the troop i run  it rained hard this past weekend and after about two hours the walls and roof leaked like there was no waterproofing on it  needless to say i had a sleepless night  must have been at least a gallon of water in my tent  i will never buy one of these again  the one i gave my son which is the same version but almost    years old didn t leak  very disappointed  will be returning this one asap     
238,5.0,                       i ve had this tent for   years and it s my go too when i m only taking a night or weekend trip with friends  i ve used several times over the years  i also have a popup jayco popup camper but on short trips just more trouble than it s worth  jayco takes    minutes at the least to set up  tent maybe   minutes  i have read reviews stating it doesn t fold as easy as set up  a real camper will laugh at that  it s simple and easy  i ve also read where it leaks  what i can say is it dose accumulate condensation around the bottom but no more than any other tent in moisture climate  the side walls and roof  well i ve never experienced any leaks unless i touch the tent wall      
239,5.0,                       i received my tent the other day  and i have not yet actually been able to use it  so  if anything changes  i will try to update this review  this appears to be a fabulous tent and in becoming colors  i am so happy to be able to trade in my old  bigger and much brighter one  even though it served me well  this appears to be a much better tent  better made than the brand i had  it goes up in a snap  only the four legs snap into place  the upper poles do not on this one  there are windows in the front  and on both sides  but the back does not have a window  also  my last tent had netting as most of the roof  but this one has a very small air pocket in the roof with what i think they called a  built in rain fly   i do not foresee this causing any ventilation issues  and it appears to actually cause the tent to be much more stable than my last one  even though it was stated that the rain fly is built in  i still purchased the rain fly separately in order to provide a double layer of protection from the rain and sun  the  coleman rainfly accessory for   person instant tent  for        on amazon fits perfectly      
240,2.0,                       tent was not water proof nor water resistant and it only took one test  glamping   trip to figure out we hate this tent  it was a foggy night and the tent was dripping with water on the inside  even with a rainfly the walls were soaked with water  even when venting the tent  because i thought it might have been condensation  the walls just absorbed all of the fog in the tent walls and ceiling  says that it s a   person tent  but in reality we had a very tight fit with my      boyfriend  myself and our mini aussie  i like the design of instantly popping up  super easy and simple  other than that this is a coleman dud  quite disappointing because i normally love the coleman brand      
241,1.0,                       this supposedly   person tent must mean   adults and   very small children because we could only fit one full size and one single air mattress and it filled the entire tent with no room to walk or set anything   then it was defective with holes in the screen and one small hole in the tent side   also  the entire tent absorbs water from morning dew or rain   we used the rain cover which deflected some rain but nothing can touch the tent sides because they are water soaked leaving sleeping bags or pillows wet   we have owned a couple of other tents and have never had to spray them with water repellent spray but it is a must with this tent  i would gladly trade the ease of set up with better quality any day   quick set up is the only thing good about this tent   we expected a better quality product from coleman      
242,1.0,                       this tent is not rain proof or even resistant  even with the optional rain fly the decal area and under the windows leak even in a drizzle there is no support from coleman they say video the leak    ok that s something i ll do in between gettin washed out and sipping up water sorry i chose coleman      
243,5.0,                       very pleased with this tent  we have a small meerkat travel trailer but  in summer  my husband likes to sleep more  outdoors  when we camp so we got this tent for him  it goes up in less than a minute and can be taken down in the same amount of time  it does fit the twin coleman cot with attached air mattress and a small side table with plenty of room in front of the door  has good ventilation  when the windows are opened  i roll the flaps inward and tuck them in against the mesh  seems to work well and they stay in place  we also purchased the rain tarp  just in case  but have not needed it yet  one thing my husband noticed  but i didn t see  was a possible  very small  space  hole   at the seam which he said he can seal  other than that   it s a great little tent      
244,5.0,                       took a minute or so to figure it out since the folding sequence is not obvious  especially when putting it away  but just take your time read the directions  really  i m a     year old grandma and got it up alone with no trouble  i m also a long time tent snob so purchasing a  gasp   coleman tent was not a natural choice  but i really have reached the point where i don t want to crawl on the ground or bend over to get in and out  and i didn t want to spend tons of money  this fit all my criterion  and stayed up with no problem during several wind and rain storms   i did buy the fly  too   and i used heavy duty stakes  only wish it had a flap over windows or door so you could keep them open more than just an inch or two during rain storm  it would be wonderful to sit in this little cabin and look out at the rain      
245,4.0,                       the tent is easy enough to set up and looks to be well made although i ve only used it one time so far  it seem to be a good value for the price but i wouldn t call it a dark or blackout tent by any regard  it doesn t seem to block sunlight any more or less than any other tent i ve owens over the years  also  for its size  once folded and put away it still takes up a lot of space  for the footprint the bag seems to be    to     larger than a similar tent      
246,5.0,                       i had the   person which i think was mislabelled and was a    person  it was   x    that was a real headache due to its sheer size  this is literally a   minute up and   minute down and bagged  they also made the bag so you can remove the stitching and it will expand to hold the tent when you put it away   you will need the rainfly and it does not hurt to seal the seams   i put damp rid hanger in the tent  they absorb moisture   also note that the inside is more   x     it holds two cots with room in between quite well      
247,1.0,                       very disappointed in this tent  at first i loved how easy it went up and the cute retro vibe but then the zipper came right off the track the very fist day  i thought coleman was supposed to be a reliable quality brand but this has definitely shook my confidence      
248,3.0,                       i m returning mine and get a regular tent with poles and a separate rain fly   instant tent is a good concept but poorly executed   the button that pops out when pole is extended to hold it in place works some of the time and i see this not lasting for years to come even if i didn t have problems with mine out of the box    not having a separate rain fly means you will have to zip up windows in a rain storm which means your not getting much air flow and that one is on me i should have looked at the pictures more closely because i should have known that is not going to work in the south where humidity is horrible      
249,5.0,                       went to campground on cape cod with sunny beautiful days  cloudy days with drizzle and light rain and one day with torrential down pours   set up at     pm with light rain and wanted to see how she held up  had tent up quickly  didn t time it  but no issue   put tarp under tent  the issue came in when i realized how disorganized i was and couldn t find all the stakes   next time will separate all tent items from kayak gear  i staked out the tent and staked the rain fly the following day  there wasn t much wind so rainfly was secure enough with velcro and snaps already on rainfly   opened vents at top center of tent and left open all week  slept great   recommend large sleeping bag as it s just more comfortable with more room   i m       and was great with inner cotton lining and was a coleman  get the coleman tent kit with rubble mallet stakes  small dust broom and collector   i used all of them  didn t have any water or even condensation in the tent all week   not even a drop  vents work great with rainfly and left open all week with no problems   tent was bone dry all week through all weather conditions  stake all parts of the tent  stretch it out and stake front and back middle too when no rain i left all windows wide open  wonderful air flow and great sleep   brought a few yoga mats  memory foam topper   worked great   i think gel memory foam would even be better  open door easily and when going around the corner just hold fabric behind and no issue   if you take care of this tent it will take care of you  it takes a lot of stress out of camping   went back into bag easily  just leave windows open a few inches so air comes out of tent easily whenfolding up   imo  this tent is well made of good fabric  ridiculously easy to put up and take down and provides dry bug free living space   two people with all gear will fit comfortably or add a couple kids and will still work but you would have to be well organized   i think this tent is an incredible value and remarkably easy to use      
250,4.0,                       was very excited when i got this tent for christmas  the zipper on my previous tent broke  the set up   break down for this tent was really easy   quick  there s plenty of space inside  we had our queen sized air mattress on one side of the curtain divider and a camping chair   small table on the other side  we used this space to change clothes   put on our boots  it was tall enough for my      boyfriend to maneuver around in  the hinge door on one side was so much nicer than just a zippered entry  only needed to zip the bottom half to keep critters out  there is another zipper door on the opposite side  love the dark room technology  was able to sleep in because it actually kept the tent cooler during the late morning  but would need to test this out when the weather gets warmer  it s really dark inside at night so make sure you have a bright lantern my one complaint is that it didn t hold up in the wind  we had steady wind at about       mph during the day   one side collapsed in  even with everything tied down  that was annoying  not sure how it will hold up in the rain  will have to update later      
251,4.0,                       single female  i was able to set up the tent myself in less than   minutes  i struggled only a bit because i m short  if i had longer arms it probably would have been even quicker     i have used the tent once  labor day weekend        it did rain every day  not a downpour  but a good amount of rain  none of my items in the tent got wet note  i appreciate the storage bag has a piece you can rip off to expand the size of the bag  made it easier when trying to put the tent back in the bag      
252,5.0,                       well to be honest it takes just a bit longer to set up than    but it was still pretty quick  more like   to    minutes start to finish  i m sure not complaining about that  i love the fact that i can stand up in it  i m       so maybe thats not saying much but its plenty tall  i also like the fact that you don t need a seperate rain fly  i haven t tested it in really heavy rain but its been raining all day and its stayed dry inside  it seems to be well made  non of the zippers catch like on my previous tent and it has nice large windows on all sides and two air vents on the ceiling for good ventilation  i have a queen air mattress in it and there is still plenty of room  says it sleeps six but in my opinion that may be a stretch  it will comfortably fit another queen mattess and still leave you some floor space   this is pretty decent tent for the price   i happy with it      
253,1.0,                       this tent is not waterproof at all the dew from the morning everything came in it also dose not insulate well at all     didn t cone with a trap for it either     so we had to go get one because it rained and everything in the tent was wet     it also either can with a small hole or tears easily  i would not recommend this tent to anyone     
254,4.0,                       so easy to set up that i thought i had done something wrong   literally hardest part of setting this up is unzipping the bag   my only gripes are minor ones   no place to run a power cord if you need to   hard to get back in the bag  but that could just be me being a big sloppy ogre   glad i bought this overall and i am quite happy      
255,5.0,                       this    person cabin tent has plenty of room  and it does a nice job blocking out the majority of the morning light  we used it for a   night camping trip for the first time last week  and our kids slept in past  am  yay    this coleman darkroom instant tent was sturdy and easy to set up and take down  we especially liked the frame velcro door option  we used an extra tarp underneath  and we sprayed it with waterproofing spray as a precaution  it didn t rain at all on our trip  so we can t speak to the weatherproof features  we re optimistic it will hold up in stormy conditions on any future trips  it seems well made with quality materials  it s a bit heavy  but that s what you d expect with a giant tent      
256,5.0,                       super easy to set up this tent   even alone   tent was completely staked in under   minutes i write this on my  th night of a week long camping excursion   so far   so good   stayed warm and dry at night in    degree   constant drizzle weather   lots of condensation on inside walls   but stayed dry   as the weather warmed   it doesn t overheat   vents well   strongly suggest you open inside windows about    during the day to allow condensation to evaporate   also strongly suggest the optional rainfly  offers added protection from the rain   allows you to open side windows an inch or two for ventilation during a light rain shower  and rain proofs the ceiling vent wouldn t want to attempt   in this tent     adults with single air beds was cramped  but comfortable      
257,3.0,                       super easy to set up  very  very quick   at      it s more of a one person tent  but worked out great for me for a week   my biggest complaint is how it holds up in the rain   if you buy this make sure you buy the rain attachment they sell separately   without it rain free flows through the top  it was bad enough i cut a camping trip   days short due to everything  all clothes  bed  blankets  in the tent being soaked   the rest of the tent seeped a little bit but i m hoping after i get my attachment and try that it will greatly reduce the amount of water coming in   but if you re a fair weather camper this is just what you need      
258,5.0,                       really love the tent  we took it to the redwoods for two weeks and absolutely loved it  we have a honda insight and were able to store the tent behind our front seats on the floorboard and it fit well  it s a long tent when packed but seeing as how a honda insight isnt very wide  you should be able to fit this tent almost anywhere super fast to set up and takedown it did not rain during our camping trip and there s no rainfly  so i dont know how it would handle wind or rain  i will say we stayed near the ocean and a couple days it was super wet inside    i am no camping pro so i dont know if there s anything you can do about it     
259,2.0,                       pros  tent was very easy to set up  seemed very roomy cons  either coleman sends out defective products and doesn t care or amazon sent us a used tent  we set this up in our back yard to apply seam sealer before camping our trip  once tent was up we noticed the floor had been patched  see attached pictures of inside and outside  my husband said one of the poles was dented  i didn t think to  get pictures of that because i was so upset about the floor      
260,5.0,                       it really does set up in    seconds  comes down in about    including rolling and tying  and easily fits back into the bag   the floor did develop two pinprick holes after setting up on a rocky surface  but they didn t let in water  even after a torrential downpour   this tent stayed up under extremely windy conditions and in pretty extreme weather  fantastic for touring when you re camping for only one night and moving on   i m really happy with this purchase      
261,5.0,                       this tent will be going to it s  th straight burning man next month  i was looking for a tent with fully closeable doors and windows  i can fit a full size cot  a huge cooler  and all my bags and gear in it   unless i keep the door open  the playa sand will not enter  even in the harsh conditions and windstorms  i have never used any stakes  or rebar to secure it to the ground   my gear is heavy enough to secure the tent  totally recommend it  this tent rocks      
262,5.0,                       the youtube videos make it look ridiculously easy to set this tent up   it really is that easy  after     years with an old school coleman tent  we wanted something that took a few minutes  not       minutes  we ordered this tent  and i set it up by myself in five minutes  half of that time was spent thinking that there must be more steps before i started extending the four legs  we spent a night in a rainstorm without the rainfly  and it was fine  however  we re getting the rainfly for extra security  packing the tent was almost as easy as setting it up     user tip  when taking down the tent  leave some screens partly unzipped  so the tent will pack down more easily  cons  the door zipper is a single slider  not the two that every other tent has  if you have to get out in the dark  it s a hassle  we are very glad we got this tent      
263,1.0,                       such a good design with no weatherproofing  this tent is incredibly easy to set up but has absolutely no weather ability  the sides were wet to the touch  the pockets dripped water all night  the only reason we were able to stay marginally dry was because i threw a tarp over top when i realized we were about to be rained on  and that helped stop us from getting wet from above by morning all sleeping bags were soaked from the water coming in from the sides  the bottom did a fine job of staying dry though  but for the price of this tent and all that it is supposed to do  i would not buy it again and would not recommend to anyone      
264,4.0,                       we just spent three days in our new coleman   person instant tent  no rain or strong winds so i don t know about those conditions   overall i think it was a good choice a few tips from the trip      if you keep all the windows and door closed at night it will build up some condensation inside   no drips but damp walls     use a tarp to cover the inside of the tent floor   kept the tent floor very clean      when taking down the tent keep the four corners staked down  fold the tent material into the center then take out the stakes and roll the tent      buy three or four cinch straps  buckles on it    we got them at big five for    a pair   these work much better than the ties that come with the tent   they also help make the tent small enough to go back into the bag      
265,1.0,                       if it sounds too good to be true  it is   i honestly thought i found a shiftpod alternative at a fifth the price   there were warnings of others who had the joint crack   i thought i could do it right  the first three were great and the last snagged and cracked   three observations   first  the plastic is not up to the task   a better quality reinforced plastic could be  d printed so it means that coleman chose not to use good quality materials in component that when fails results in a catastrophic failure   second  the floor was not waterproof   look at the second picture  right out of the box holes in the floor   third   a good design but poor quality materials   i am going to replace the tent with another and invest in   muffler clamps   they go on before the first assembly innovative design but poor execution at least in my product      
266,4.0,                       it is very easy to setup  but make sure you hold it up with ropes and place it in an area protected from wind we got this a while ago and have used it quite often  it s very fast to setup but it really needs a locking mechanism on the top to keep it up  once the wind gets above   mph the tent falls down or completely collapses  quite often  i took this tent to central utah and camped near delta  the wind was pretty bad that night but i ve always had good luck with our last tent we had  it was a small  cheap one  it held up great against the wind without using ropes  this coleman tent fell down every time a gust of wind hit it  it got so bad that we abandoned it and slept in the car that night it does work well at keeping out rain  the next morning we went out there and saw that it had collapsed and the rain had puddled on top of it  amazingly  the rain did not get inside and it was completely dry inside of it  the windows zippers kept the rain out too but we had shut them before leaving it  it s easy to clean inside and out also  i usually bring it home  spray it out inside and also on the outside with a garden hose  then i ll leave it to dry outside  it gets hot in utah  and it s dry here so it really dries fast one other drawback is that it is a bit heavy for a tent that size  probably because of the metal support rods  it s not bad if you only have to haul it a few feet to a campsite but if you re going to backpack with this  it s a little heavy to lug around overall  it is a good tent but i wish it were more  solid       
267,4.0,                       downsides  one of our zippers came with the tag sewn in  so we had to trim it to even open the back door  also  the feature of a catchfree zipper is not true  it seemed to be more of a problem and one of the windows  the zipper was sewn too close and tight  if we use it frequently it is going to cause a rip  one of the exterior tags instantly broke because of stitcing but didn t leave a hole in the tent and we figured out how to fix it to accomidate and not make another hole  we had our first experience in this tent while camping out in the boonies in western oregon  it was very misty and foggy and the tent weathered well and left us dry  no condensation on the interior even with two adults and   mouth breather kiddos  the dark room feature was nice and let us catch some extra zzzz s  i would still recommend this tent  but if you are going to be frequent camping  make sure to check all zippers and seams with care  we were lucky and i don t think anything is going to cause a major malfunction      
268,5.0,                       excellent quality  i love how it pops right up and you don t have a big pile of cloth and mess when you are setting things up or taking things down  the little extra the instant tent is over a regular one with poles is totally worth it  i ll never buy another tent with poles after using this  when i finally pack up to leave for camping i m tired and wore out  feeling kind of lazy about packing my things up and this just makes it easy to go      
269,5.0,                       we bought this for a recent camping trip with   adults and   kids  i loved the quick setup of it  though pay more attention to the words than the pictures  and that it stayed stable all night  it comes with   tie down ropes already attached  though we ended up buying paracord since we needed longer tiedowns than what it had  we also bought the tent kit which has beefier stakes  and i d recommend that  but all in all a great tent that was easy to setup and tear down and fit us well      
270,3.0,                       just set up my tent up for the first time  seems to be ok except i ve never had a tent that has to have staking to keep it stretched out  i go to several places where stakes can t be used  in those cases i have always just put all my equipment in the tent and it holds it s full shape fine as long as we don t have unusually high winds  but this tent remains all wrinkled and loose without the stakes  otherwise it was easy to erect      
271,5.0,                       this tent is awesome    it really is super simple to setup   you can do a   person setup with no problem take down and packing is easy as well with only   person   we havent experienced any inclimate weather while using our tent but it did a great job of keeping the wind cold out on some breezy nights it fits a large queen air mattress with room to spare  id say it would sleep a family of     comfortably overall happy with the purchase and product     
272,5.0,                       love this tent  super easy to set up  really is a one minute setup   and taking it down is no problem      we were in the desert   and the wind came up to       mph crazy had everything staked down and it took it like a champ   very happy with this product  also queen size mattress with plenty of room for all your stuff coolers food ect  haven t felt with rain yet but will update review when it happens  have already spent over    nights in it and love it             
273,4.0,                       this is a very nice little tent for the money   easy to raise and lower   goes back into the bag well   i ding it one star as i would have liked it to include a topper roof as most other tents do   doesn t seem like that should be an a la carte item   simply include it and charge accordingly   it is desirable to not have the dew of the night settling down into the sleeping area and getting all the bedding moist  that is where it loses on the weather proof and water resistance rating      
274,3.0,                       i ve purchased less expensive tents that seem to have been better quality  love the size of this double room  tent cabin  the color  and size are perfect for my backyard  man cave   but  apparently it is not weatherproof  with all windows unzipped  it is a perfect entryway for rain  not even a hard  wind driven rain  but even a steady drizzle  or even dew in the morning  have to dry up the floor and the furniture inside every time  kind of annoying  doesn t happen to my tent that i purchased at a quarter of the price from dick  s      
275,1.0,                       i bought this tent because my son started cub scouts and it is smaller than the   man tent i have for the whole family  we used it on our first outing and it worked just fine for one night  on the second outing over veteran s day weekend  upon setup the bottom zipper to the door broke  leaving it open to bugs  nature and weather  the overlapping flap did not cover the open bottom so had to deal with mosquitos and ants  it is now too late to return the item  not even    days after receiving it and have another outing coming up this weekend  guess i m going to resort to the   man tent and just wasted money buying this one      
276,2.0,                       despite this piece having screws to remove and replace it  coleman tells me there is not a replacement part for this   it is the main connection between the tent and the poles  which is a pretty critical piece   i am already discouraged that this tent will be a maintenance nightmare      
277,5.0,                       this tent is so simple to put up my  yo did it  taking it down to put it away  neatly  takes some extra time to have everything fold properly and tuck wrap the base around to fit in the bag used for     fall camping trips so far with different weather  held up to winds on last trip nicely the vent on the top is great for air circulation if you dont have the rainfly on fits a queen size matress with ample space to walk and store belongings if you put it longways on the back wall      
278,1.0,                       the hinged door feature and dark room technology is awesome  too bad this tent wasn t built stronger  the poles are too thin and caused it to buckle under heavy winds  you can see we had it solidly staked  but it buckled  it actually buckled in twice on this campout  the second time it snapped the poles      
279,2.0,                       started out good with easy   person setup  quickly turned to the worst after going to sleep  during the night it started to rain  i woke up to find the window seams to be dripping water and all the walls were damp  there was water collecting on the floor and our pillows and sleeping bags were wet  of course this is about    days past my return date so there is no way to return  i m hoping this review will reach one of the sellers and they will reach out to me to assist with a exchange  otherwise don t but this to far in advance because you won t be able to return it after you get wet update  i was able to contact the seller and they did grant a refund for the tent      
280,4.0,                       super easy to put up   lots of room inside   i put a queen size cot and small table and gear with room to spare  haven t had weather yet so i can t speak to the water resistance   had a cheaper off brand model that didn t come with a fly and broke after   trips   find this to be made better      
281,3.0,                       condinsation inside the tent  i purchased the coleman   person cabin tent for camping this pass weekend  for two nights with the air temperature    f and camped by a river  moderate condinsation build up inside the tent and the tent had to be set up back home to dry this is because the  built in rainfly   does not let moisture escape and the only effective way to vent the tent is to have the windows zipped open which negates privacy when sleeping in a campground with other people i m returning this product to amazon     
282,3.0,                       i purchased this tent over the core six person instant tent which is almost identical because i needed it short notice and the coleman had prime shipping  the core did not  after a three day camping trip with one night of rain i got a good first experience with this tent  the tent went up with ease and worked perfectly until it rained  unlike the core tent this dent does not come with a rain fly  the seams developed a slow drip around the depressions of the roof vents  my friend has the core tent and after careful comparison i would say the core is a better value since it is less expensive and includes a rain fly that the coleman does not but needs      
283,5.0,                       i have been looking for a really nice easy tent to put together for my    year old daughter  my husband and i have a small trailer and my daughter wanted to have her friends sleep in the tent next to us in the campground  the last thing i needed was one more thing to put together when on my vacation  this tent comes in a nice bag with fairly easy instructions  i m not one for reading the instructions so i just took the tent out of the bag  i wondered if it really was a one minute tent so my husband and i timed it in together just not reading the directions but just putting it together we re able to assemble this in   minute and    seconds  yes this tent is really that quick to put together  another thing i really like about this quality tent is that you can stand in it  for one person you can put in a twin mattress and have room for a chair and a small table  if you are a couple we have put in at times a queen blow up mattress and still had room for a little side and table and that is for a   man tent  i was so impressed by this tent but i ended up buying one for my other daughter for summer parties and also as a gift for a mom who is a single parent who enjoys camping  recommend this tent      
284,5.0,                       first time putting it up took about   minutes after reading instructions and unboxing  so easy  taking it down was equally simple and i loved that the bag expanded to make it easier to get the tent and the rain cover  it says for   people but after putting my queen size air mattress in there  i could probably only get another twin mattress in there if i needed  i would say it truly fits     people if you keep your clothes  etc in your tent with you and use air mattresses  almost wish i d bought the bigger one  considering our family is growing to   people this year  was made well  strong seams  double reinforced and covered with waterproof tape at corners  lots of windows make it nice and cool with a breeze     
285,5.0,                       this tent is the epitome of  easy up   i love taking this tent camping    not backpacking  way too heavy for any hiking purposes  but  for vehicle or campsite camping  it can t be beat  it is large inside and goes up and just a couple of minutes from nothing to staked out  it is durable    i used it all season at least    times in rain  wind  and sun and i foresee another    times that number in the future with no issues  do yourself a favor and buy the coleman rainfly too  you will need it but it is only a few bucks more  i will say  re packing this tent is a b  ch   it does not like to fit into the accompanying bag  enter bungee cords  lol     
286,5.0,                       we pitched the tent with the added optional rainfly on our back yard lawn which has about a    degree angle to the yard  had it out there for   days with on and off rainfall that was pretty strong and lengthy at times and there was barely any water in the tent after inspecting the tent inside  keep in mind that between the rainfall there was the strong sunlight hitting the tent and the tent got pretty hot inside with everything closed  with all the windows open the tent was cool and you still have some decent privacy with the windows open and some pretty good viewing through those windows  pretty close to bone dry inside the tent for those four days of on and off rainfall  wind max was about   mph  tent held up well  it was also super easy and fast to set up and to take down the tent  it took more time to peg the tent and rainfly then anything else  pretty roomy inside  walls are nearly vertical when the tent is set up correctly and for such a low profile tent there is pretty decent headroom  we plan to get some use out of this tent  for the amount that we paid for the tent and the optional rainfly we really can t complain at all  happy        
287,4.0,                           stars   i was hesitant to purchase this because of the water repelling issues people were having   i was tempted to buy the rainfly but that thing looks useless so i didnt   what i did do was buy   cans of water proofing spray   i set the tent up in my garage and went to town with the spray   i took this tent out a few weeks ago and we had a downpour of biblical proportions   the tent held up and i only saw a little puddle on the floor of the tent   for future weathery trips  ill bring a simple tarp to cover the tent as a precautionary step   the only issue i have so far is the neoprene junctions on the polls   ive had one junction jam up because of it      
288,3.0,                       just got back from a weekend camping trip and used this tent for the first time in a little rain       over a few hours   the tent leaked  rain came in from the top and dripped on us  we had to put a tarp over the tent  the next morning  even after the tarp  any clothes on the tent floor were completely soaked the tent is a breeze to set up with plenty of room  but i d consider it a fair weather tent  although it says on the bag   rain and weather resistant   it was not in our experience      
289,5.0,                       easy to deploy   surprisingly easy to stow   next time i will leave all the windows open a little so it takes less time to get the air out   it fit back in the carry bag   got   tarps  one for underneath and one inside   this protects the floor and provides extra insulation   also clean up is easier as i fold the tape carefully and dump outside   my      rei dome tent is now just barely possible for me to erect by myself   of course i still would go with rei if i had to carry it any distance      
290,2.0,                       straight of of the box very easy to set up and very light weight  inside i found several pinholes along the seams and floor  seams are ragged and appears to have been quickly pieced together and sealed for quick distribution   expected better from coleman  i suggest amazon or coleman send a rainfly and sealant with the tent free of charge      
291,2.0,                       i m sitting here writing this review from the inside of a wet coleman tent  for a tent that s advertising is all about being weather proof  it s lightly raining at the moment and water is infiltrating through the seems  i shouldn t  have to purchase and apply seam sealer and seal every seam in my tent when the tent s sales pitch is all about being water proof  i even purchased the rain shield too  i m very disappointed and will be returning this tent after my camping trip      
292,4.0,                       this tent is easy and quick to set up  one of the easiest i have ever used a couple of drawbacks is that it does not come with a rainfly   imo you should always use one and i purchased one directly from coleman that fits this tent   also  i spent the time to water proof the tent with a spray and have had no water leaking issues   also  it says   person tent   i don t know how they determine that but i would not sleep more than   people in it  six people would be absolutely crammed together  the walls are mostly vertical which gives you more room inside  but the trade off is that it will not do as well in high winds  for that a small dome would work better   i do think for the money it is worth it and a good buy as long as you understand the drawbacks      
293,5.0,                       great quality   not a lot of head room   could not fit the cots  had to use the air mattress and bags  but otherwise a great purchase   i will be buying the six man with the same construction qualities  more head space         
294,4.0,                       this tent sets up in less than one minute  it takes a bit longer to stake  camped last night and temps got into the fortys and it was somewhat warm  dew was coming through tent slightly  but nothing major other than a pillow got wet when touching sides  i am very happy with the size of the four person  my wife and i plus three kids fit nicely with a queen size airbed   the two mesh pockets were perfect for phones and glasses  it did not rain so i cant review if watertight  i did purchase the rainfly separately and it fits perfect  great product and i hope it last many years      
295,4.0,                       this tent is spacious  it does set up quick and is solid even in strong winds however     the biggest concern i have is the quality   they really don t make things like they use to  everything now a days is cheap quality   the first tent we received was defective  one of the  fast release  legs was stuck   instead of being an instant tent  it turned into a    min battle to try to collapse one leg   glad amazon sent us another right away   upon using our replacement tent  which came a different color from the  st   now twice we have noticed   holes in the fabric   this is a huge disappointment considering this thing is brand new and not inexpensive   my best advise is keep your old tent      
296,3.0,                       tent was as described  it opened and closed in a minute  super easy to set up and take down  exactly what i was looking for when going camping with two under     on my first trip  however  i did spot some areas on the floor with tiny holes and scratches  i had just bought this tent and even laid out a tarp to put the tent on to protect it  that s the reason for the low stars in weather proof and water resistance  otherwise it got the job done and was quick and easy to set up  only wish there was a bit more standing room  one more window  and something to tie the windows to when you want to keep it open      
297,3.0,                       some have written about leaking problems   the first time we used it we got caught in a short but heavy rain storm  but it did great   also tried spraying it with a hose  soaked it  but no leaking   although it does set up quickly  if you don t stake it down and there is any wind you will have problems   we had    mph winds one night and even though we had it full of gear it about blew over   i think it moved about   inches during the night   i wish there were more places to stake it down   the bottom of the tent lifts of the ground on the sides which i think would not happen if you could stake it down in more spots   you can only use stakes on the guy lines  poles and on two sides   it would be nice to be able to stake it down on all four sides   when we got home from out first trip and i was cleaning it out i saw a hole in the bottom  about the size of a penny    i called coleman and they are sending a new tent  but i take this as a sign it is bit on the cheap side   i even put a tarp down underneath it when it was set up because i was worried about this   so it might not be the highest quality  but it is an easy to set up  decent tent for        not bad in my opinion   if i had      to spend i would get a nicer one  but since i don t this is a good tent for the money      
298,4.0,                       it is insanely easy to set up  its awesome that you can stand upright in it  take down is pretty easy too  just make sure to leave the windows at unzipped or else it takes a long time to deflate and pack up i do not suggest using this if there is rain in the forecast  water does indeed leak through the walls  we put the rain fly  bought separately  on and thought we d be good  don t get me wrong  the rain fly does a great job and keeps the ceiling dry  but below the area that the rain fly covers  the walls were dripping on us  both times we ve used this in rain  we ve woken up in puddles with all of our gear soaked  i love this tent  and definitely recommend it   just not for use in rain one other thing i think is odd is that even though this sleeps   people  it still only has   pockets inside  you d think more people  more pockets  but nah           
299,5.0,                       this is the perfect tent for me  i m a    year old women who likes to camp  although my old tent lasted a good long time  it was time to get a new one  i searched the internet and found some fabulous tents out there but kept coming back to this one  at my age the fact that it was supposed to be easy to set up was very appealing  it didn t have all the bells and whistles like some of the other new tents w  their attached screen porches  electrical capabilities  many inside pouches  etc  but in the end i went with it  when i recieved it i immediately tried it out and bam  it went right up just like it advertised  i love the vents on top and the large windows all around  i also bought the rain fly and although it is smaller than i am used to  only covering the very top of the windows  it looks sufficient  i haven t had a chance to use it yet as we still have snow on the ground here  so i will update this later when i do use it  in the meantime  i will waterproof it as i always did with my other tent   i also bought a piece of indoor outdoor carpet for the inside  the same size as the tents footprint     x    and find that this helps hold the shape and makes it more comfortable  it is advertised as a six person tent  i will be very comfortable in there with my single size air mattress  my dog  my luggage and a small table and chair  there is still room for my young grandson who loves to join me  happy camping update  i used it four times this summer along with my dog and grandson  it was great  i highly recommend getting the indoor outdoor carpeting  it made it much quieter and more cozy  yes  it did rain and the rainfly was very sufficient  there were no leaks whatsoever      
300,4.0,                       junk garbage   tent leaked first time it rained  all around the top seams  and the seams that suround the base tub to the sidewall  it s garbage  sets up easy   nice roomy  well ventilation   but the thing is junk  sleeping bags wet  clothes wet  pillows wet  now i have to go threw the bullcrap of filing a return and shipping it back to themwhat a joke  coleman has gone down hill  walmarts ozark trail tents are where it s at these days  i got a two year old ozark trail tent never leaked  i used my last ozard trail tent for about ten years no leaks      
301,5.0,                       i did a ton of research on a tent my family could use  it was finally between this coleman   person instant tent  the coleman sundome   person tent and the red canyon   person tent  after i was done reviewing all the tents  i made the decision to purchase the coleman   person instant tent because it was important for me that i can get the tent up and taken down quickly  i knew that if i had a tent that took a long time to set up and take down  it would make me less enthusiastic about using it i was very happy when i received the tent  it s construction seems solid  after taking it out of the box  i decided to open the tent in my living room just to see how long it would take me to put it up  it took me about a minute to put up and   minutes to take down  i was able to use the tent the next night in our backyard and again  it seemed very durable and we had no problems  it did not rain and i did not get the rainfly so don t know how the tent would do in the rain after taking the tent down  even though i did not do the best job rolling the tent up  i was able to place it in the carrying case with no problems because the case was pretty big  would buy again overall  i am very happy with the tent  the instant nature of the tent allows me to set up the tent and take it down quickly without worrying that it will be a hassle      
302,1.0,                       so i just received this tent    person  no stakes luckily i have my old ones from my last tent  i set it up and there s dead bugs in it  cigarette ends  i don t smoke so i don t know what it s called  there s holes on the bottle floor of the tent  white stuff on the outside of the tent  i m going camping in two days and was really looking forward to using this  however just from the way i received it i m highly disappointed  was this tent looked at before packaging    i ve been a amazon customer since      and i ve never received anything like this before      
303,5.0,                       i ve used this tent for two years now  i go camping nearly every month with the boy scouts  it s a little bit heavy  but for car camping it s great  it sets up so easily by myself and it s fast  it s been through heavy rain  wind  and snow storms and still is in great condition  i like that the bag has the expandable area sewn in to it because it makes it much easier to pack it away  the tent doesn t fold down super tight when it is cold  so that extra space is nice in those situations  two suggestions  buy the rain fly not only for extra defense against rain  but also to keep the top of it shaded when you are camping for extended periods  and second buy some parafin wax and rub the zippers down to help them last longer  you won t be disappointed in this tent      
304,5.0,                       easy to setup and takedown  packaging is big and maybe on heavy side but hey if you have kids in tow  you better get this to save your energy pitching a tent  this goes up in just a minute  staking included  fits two full size bed with some space on the side  was a perfect buy      
305,4.0,                       very happy with this tent so far   easy to setup as advertised   me and my    year old set it up for the first time in    seconds   takes a few more minutes to tear down  but only because you have to wait for the air to escape as you roll it up   however it does have some negatives  otherwise i would have given this   stars if possible i ve had   issues so far listed below cons     the bottom already has a few small holes in it from being adjusted after it was setup   it did have sleeping bags already inside of it  but we do this all the time with our other tents that are    years old   but we are talking pinhole sized holes  nothing major   i saw them when hanging the tent up to dry before rolling it up   but the floor material should be stronger     the storage bag is large like they advertise   however  it s made of a very thin  weak material   we have only used the tent   times and the bag has already ripped bad enough that we can t use it anymore   now we have to wrap it in bungee cords until i can find a bag large enough to store it in   this almost cost this excellent product another star pros     sets up in a flash   even the kids can set it up themselves for a backyard campout    breaths well    makes the wife and kids are really happy that we don t have to fight setting up the tent anymore          sturdymiddle of the road     price   seems a little expensive still    rainfly   this should really come with one  and the option they sell is really overpriced  but i ll rate that one separately overall i would still highly recommend this tent for people that want a quick setup marriage saving tent   the cons can be fixed  and i hope that coleman actually reads these comments   now i just need to find a decent canvas bag to store this in   that still irritates me thanks for reading      
306,1.0,                       pros   instant setup and packing  spacious insidecons    huge  leaking all around after   hours of rain  add     to price  because tent has mesh on top and need to purchase additional roof coverwe only used tent twice    star because of leaking      
307,1.0,                       bought this tent because it was a weather tech  it said rain resistant   my first night was ok  it rained     of my trip and the tent leaked on every seam and even through the walls everything got wet if i could give zero stars better yet negative stars i would     
308,5.0,                       great tent for a great price  set up really is as quick and easy as described  obviously this isnt for backpacking campers but is perfect for  car camping  and has a good amount of room  we set up a queen air mattress and our   year olds pack n play bed and it was a good fit  i definitely recommend also purchasing the rain fly to go with it which is equally as easy to clip on and is good security to stay dry  this was just our first trip with this tent and we had a modest rain pass thru one morning and the tent did fine and no leaks  ultimately i know there are much higher end tents available but this seems to be a great tent to use with the family several times a year      
309,5.0,                       this tent is super easy to put up take down  it s pretty spacious for   people  but i don t see being able to fit more than   adults comfortably  we used the tent  with a rain fly purchased seperatley  in moderate rain and i have no complaints  this tent is awesome  we previously camped with a cheaper tent when it wasn t raining and were soaked from condensation   tropical island   buy this tent   do not get a cheap tent      
310,1.0,                       this tent started off great  took longer to take out of the box then it did to set up  but that s were the hype ended     putting this tent away took   people a struggle alot of swearing and good    minutes    it s rated as a   person tent but fits   large adults and a dog comfortably  ot sure how you would squeeze   in     rain fly is seperate really        thankfully it didn t rain on our trip but i always use tarps under my tent and bring enough to cover it      years of camping has taught me to bring lots of tarps      this tent sweats with condensation real bummer don t touch the walls    the door is a half door and a bit of a pain to climb over your partner to get to    also my first time use the bottomed had rips in it will now have to replace it for future trips        
311,2.0,                       i have been an avid camper for the past    years of my life and i have to say  this is the most disappointing tent i have ever owned  yes  it is incredibly easy to put up and take down and i do love that about it  what i don t love is that this tent  despite the words  weather tech  emblazoned on the front of it  does not seem to have anything of the sort  i had read other reviews complaining about water leaking into the tent through the walls but i wasn t too concerned  as i don t camp when there is going to be rain  well  let me tell you that rain is not required for this tent to leak  even the slightest moisture in the air turns the inside of this tent into a shower that will wake you with drips and drops in the middle of the night  yes  i read the review about buying seam sealer and i intend to get some  even still  in my    years of camping i have never once had to weatherproof my own tent  really disappointed considering coleman is supposed to be a superior brand  i think i ll stick to ozark trail from now on      
312,1.0,                       it s my fult as i should have opened and checked the tent when it first came in in june       but anywho took the tent camping recently fresh out of the box  and the tent wouldn t stand  come to find out from assembly where ever they put it together they installed one of the legs wrong  and to add the pad covering three of the joints looked rather used as if they were refurbished  when i did not and have never purchased a refurbished product without knowing it we had a good camping trip over all  the tent never stood strait up and i had to keep adjusting the tent  unfortunately i m past the return time as i should have opened the box and put the tent up to check everything when it came in  but being that it s suppose to be brand new and coming from colmen i didn t expect what happened to happen  so the moral is open the box take out the tent and pop it up and check it once you receive it      
313,1.0,                       i do not recommend buying this second hand  camping tent  arrived with too many cosmetic imperfections that disqualify it for recommended use   its appearance is acceptable but it has several broken corners and a broken plastic adapter  and arrived very dirty  a big headache return an article like that my recommendation to warehouse of amazon  do not sell items with cosmetic imperfections does not meet the minimum required for recommended use very satisfied with my previous purchases  but disgusted with this purchase      
314,1.0,                       we were so excited for this tent  it came pretty well reviewed and we lived the idea of a quick setup tent  we used it twice  each time we cleaned it and put it away carefully  we made sure not to mistreat it  not set it up in a bad rocky location and handle it with care  took it out for the third trip  just outside our return window  and it had multiple rips and a pole was broken at the joint  i m very disappointed and will not be buying another coleman tent  sad  since coleman s other products are so well a made and long lasting      
315,5.0,                       i love love love this tent   windows on all   sides for a great cross breeze   easy for me to set up by myself   i absolutely love it   but    set it up right away and check for defects   fortunately i set mine up   days before the return deadline   one of the windows had a defective zipper and could not be closed   i returned by doing the drop off at kohls  so simple    and within just a few days i had a replacement   i set it up today and there are no defects   i am a happy camper      
316,5.0,                       i loved this tent  it is extremely easy to set up  the entire process from unboxing to standing upright took about   minutes and a large portion of that time was spent inspecting the nifty bag it comes with  which has an extendable bottom incase you need extra room when putting it away  we did not need the extra room  as the tend folded up easily and fit back into the original size bag with room to spare  taking the tent down and putting it away took less time than erecting it  and was so easy that i actually set it back up a second time to make sure i hadn t done something wrong  i hadn t  it was just that easy to put away   this tent has only one door  which is not a double opening  at first i thought this would be a hindrance  however i wound up being very pleased as the door did not require using two hands and a pair of pliers to open or close  as so many tents do  the lack of the  double door  did not affect me at all  and i don t miss it  i would use this tent again and again  and i would recommend it for anyone  whether a first time camper or a seasoned one like myself after being suspicious of the claims made in the advertising i was relieved to find that all were accurate  i could not be happier with this tent      
317,5.0,                       love this tent    i camp alone  so i was hesitant to buy this tent as it mentions you ll need two people to pitch it  i put it up it once before my first camping trip  didn t quite take a minute  more like ten  and discovered it was fairly easy to do alone  i also bought the matching rainfly  and put it on the tent the first time  and was able to put that on by myself also  i ve heard other customers mention they couldn t get the rainfly on by themselves  but i didn t have a problem  i am also six foot tall and wonder if that s my saving grace  i think it would be problematic if i was shorter  all in all  good tent  love it ps  i also camp with a queen sized pillow top air mattress and the tent was the perfect size for me  my two dogs and all my gear  i don t think another bed could be squeezed in there  so be aware of that  but if you re looking for an easy tent with ample room for one or two people  this is your tent      
318,4.0,                       love the tent  but a queen size doesn t fit comfortably into the tent as previously stated in the notes  my air mattress pushed the sides of the tent out some which lead to the tent sweating  thinking about returning or selling the tent and buying the bigger quick up tent  but  without a doubt if you are looking for a quick tent that sets up easily and takes up little space  than this is the tent for you  great tent  sets up and breaks down quick and actually goes back into the bag fairly easily      
319,4.0,                       great tent  i needed a tent to take my dogs in  did not want to tear up my more expensive tents  and it is so easy to set up and take down  i camped in   days of rain and it did not leak  definitely get the   man at least  my friend bought the   and it is way to small  update  i just got back from wv mountains and we got hit with a monster storm and this tent did great  side ways rain  high winds and not a drop of water inside  i am going to purchase the rain fly though  the top of the tent where the vents are is kind of flat  the water never leaked but it puddled up there  the rain  fly will fix it     
320,5.0,                       this tent might be the best cheap buy i ever made on line   the price was low  reviews good  and light weight  so i gave it a try and ordered the rain hood  and a couple of oversized cots   when first delivered i was concerned that going cheap might not be good for durability   the fabric was light  much like the old wind breakers but when i counted it did all it was supposed to do   we camped for three weeks in heavy storms  wind  lighting  rain and not a leak  not a drop   it was easy to set up  and almost easy to put away   loved this tent  my husband is wondering why    years passed since the last time we went camping      
321,3.0,                       it is a super nice tent  i love that it is so easy to setup and take down  the problem is that it had a hole in the roof  right out of the packaging  i think there might have been another somewhere  but don t remember  the hole was small and circular  almost like someone burned it with a cigarette but  if it weren t so large  i probably would have just returned it  hopefully i won t go camping when it rains  i guess      
322,5.0,                       this tent is the second instant cabin coleman we ve purchased  we used to have the   person and upgraded to the   for some more room with the air mattress inside  we absolutely love it  it is insanely easy to put together and take down  putting it back in the bag takes a little bit of practice and a whole lot of muscle but its worth it  whenever we go camping our friends are super envious of the instant setup feature  its also extremely tall inside  i barely even have to bend over to fit through the door  and can stand      up inside  we weathered a pretty horrible storm in this at electric forest last year  the   person  and this year  the   person  and both years we were dry and still standing  highly recommend this tent      
323,5.0,                       wow    super quick set up    perfect size for   man and a well positioned table  chair  coffee pot and heater    and if  ourse the sleeping pad and bag  clothing   since i only used it this past week    i had forgotten how it was put up    it happened very quick    so i forgot how to take it down    so it took a while to figure out that the collapsed legs fold up and not down    that is easy and quick too if ya remember that this needs to be done      
324,4.0,                       i have had this for   years now  i have used it for approximately    days of camping easy to put up and take down    person can do it without trouble  it is a little difficult to fit in the carrying case but can be fully inserted  the carry bag is expandable if so desired making it very easy to fit in  the downside is the bag will be bulkier if this option is used you do have to keep it vented on humid nights or condensation will develop  the abundance of windows is nice for this the optional rain cover is a must  it should be included but isn t  buy it  you will need it in the rain the floor is the basic tarp material so you will probably want to have a tarp or plastic under the tent  it comes up the sides about    to prevent ground water fom coming in   twin sized inflatables fit inside with about   foot on the side open  perfect for   small adults or children  absolutely not for more than      large adults will have a very tight fit i am happy with this tent for the ease of up and down      
325,5.0,                       review update my wife and i just returned from a month in yellowstone np  the tetons np and rocky mountain np  this coleman insta tent performed great  we were in rain most every night  it never leaked a drop  and on several occasions we were in very high winds  out tent again performed great  not a single problem  i can highly recommend this tent  the best    i have spent in a long time very easy to set it up and to take it down   but like anything the more you do it  the easier it gets  after about     times  you should be able to set it up in     minutes  the only negative is trying to fold it up tight enough to get it back in the bag  but even that gets easier  we have found that if we leave the windows and door unzipped  open  the air can escape and it will fold up better  my wife and i have been married for    very happy years  and rarely ever fuss and fight  but in times past while trying to set up other tents we would be at the point of wanting to sign divorce papers  but not with this coleman insta tent  marriage is bliss  i highly recommend this tent  happy camping all      
326,1.0,                       i was super excited to buy this coleman tent   the last coleman tent evanston screaned  i bought lasted   years and survived many rain storms   my only issue was that it took about    minutes to set up and when i go camping  i want to enjoy the camping experience as soon as possible   at first the coleman cabin tent lived up to expectations   it took less then a minute to set up and had more than enough space for me  my friend   and dog totally about     pounds    i was thrilled i got to enjoy the nice weather and boat around the lake   little did i know that my enjoyment would end the next morning   throughout the night there was light rain and puddles in the inside of my tent  the water was seeping through the walls   i am totally shocked because this never happened with my old coleman tent   this almost ruined my camping experience   i encourage anyone that buys this tent to buy a tarp for the top of the tent and bottom of the tent   get as many towels as possible  an extra bathing suit  and advil   coleman you can do better      
327,3.0,                       i m glad i check the condition of this tent before i go camping  i got a bad one that have three holes and bad sewing everywhere  most of camping goods that i have is coleman but this product bit disappointed me  probably this product line manufactured from a low quality oem factoy in china      
328,4.0,                       i guess i m a little salty because of the price  i found the same tent at costco for      but didn t buy it while it was there because i didn t think i was going to be camping this year   this tent is an alright investment  it is pretty easy to assemble  it just opens kind of like an umbrella  we weather sealed it prior to our trip and compared to the people who were with us had much better results  the last night of the trip  we had a wicked thunderstorm  it was pouring buckets of rain and we only had a few tiny little puddles by windows and doors  the only part that i really didn t like was the zippers on the doors  there are   zippers on the main door of the tent and only   of them open the tent  the tent does have a pole that makes the door open and shut like a real door so unless we were sleeping or there was bad weather we didn t zip the tent  it was nice for sleeping in the morning so the sun wasn t beating into the tent  still got pretty warm in there though  lots of windows to open however      
329,5.0,                       this is the best tent ever my husband and i bought it for our first camping trip together and  of course  we got to the campsite way late  after  pm  expecting to have to fumble around in the dark setting up a tent  it was dark  but setting up the tent  for the first time  was so easy  it went up in under a minute and we didnt have to figure out which pole went where  the best the tent itself is spacious  my husband is      and he was able to stand up inside the tent  we also fit a queen sized air mattress  our bags  and had room left over   we are hoping this will be our tent for the future  aka with kids the only thing i wish we had done before setting up the tent was read the instructions on how to take it down  that process was also super simple once we read the instruction  but because we were just guessing  our bad  it was a little frustrating i would buy this tent again in a heartbeat      
330,5.0,                       easy quick set up  durable material sprayed with kiki water resistant stay and we had   very small minimal leak in the corner  we dried it up and resprayed the area and were time in the rain for   nights  i highly recommend this tent for   to   people but not    otherwise its the best easy to installed full height tent in the market  take down and storage is very easy as well      
331,5.0,                       this is the second tent like this i have bought   i had my other one for years and while it is in great shape still my son has seemed to have claimed it for himself easy setup and take down is what i enjoy most about this tent   also it s durability   it was able to withstand heavy rain and high oklahoma winds   we got caught in sever weather and it held up beautifully very roomy as well  we had a queen size mattress and a pac n play and still had plenty of room to move around comfortably      
332,5.0,                       love this tent  as a mom who camps with small kids with other moms with small kids this tent is a must have  easy for one mom quick set up  spacious inside  waterproof have had this tent on several trips and even in heavy storms not a drop inside  zipper door is smooth and easy even with kids in and out all day  take down is a breeze as well  i ve bought   of these tents and will continue to do so      
333,2.0,                       love the tent i have the   person for years and no issues   bought the   person for a smaller footprint  looks good  easy to use    sprayed with weather proofing twice  even got the the rain fly   notice small holes in the bath tub part  the floor   then to started to rain not hard  light drizzle and the water came in tent through the bottom part of the tent wall and in through the corners of the tent   my stuff got wet and ruin the trip     
334,5.0,                       this tent lived up to the billing   we initially tried it out in the driveway and it set up in less than a minute  there are just two of us and there is tons of room for our cots and porta potty  as well as a couple of folding chairs if we want to stay inside   good sized windows  speaking of which  consider leaving a couple of windows open because we closed them all when taking it down and ended up with a huge  unfoldable bubble  one additional cool feature was a gusset in the carry bag  it looks like a seam with white paper on the underside of the bag  but pull the white paper cord and you have all the extra room you need to put the tent comfortably back in the bag  we love it and can t wait to actually camp in it       
335,4.0,                       i have been a huge fan of coleman for many years  i started with the    person weather master  with the screen room  it withstood a     year flood that entailed a   foot river of water rushing around it  for hours  it did get water inside  which was      acceptable in such a freak of nature occurrence  we ended up having to cut a hole in the corner of the floor to drain the water out  it then stood until mid january  in wisconsin  when   foot of snow and high winds finally collapsed it  i then   mistakenly  bought the    person weather master  which i didn t like at all  it was hard to anchor and stabilize   st rain storm  with high winds  flipped it upside down with     s of pounds of camping equipment inside  poles bent as well  this black out tent could be a bit more roomy  but seems very stable and i love that it stays cool and dark all day long      
336,1.0,                       setting it up was not bad  walked inside and found   holes in the floor  closed it back up and had a heck of a time getting it back into the bag and box to ship back  also returning the rain fly  will never by another coleman tent again  it looked like a nice tent but their quality stinks  buying a different tent instead  one that comes with a flying this time      
337,1.0,                       i have bought   other tents from amazon in the past years   all coleman   the others are still great after many years   first time using it this past weekend and it leaked      very disappointed   before you buy check the size    probably could sleep   if close to each other on sleeping bags barely got   cots in there     my mistake for not measuring but to leak when first up   amazon  i have always been pleased with able to return which i hardly do but a month window to return   i m not one to take advantage of your company and always returned   coleman   you have a name to stand by     this camping trip i bought a lot of things with your name    but will do more research   sorry i feel bad with this review cause i like to be positive but was just hurt        
338,3.0,                       easy set up  bottom half of sides allowed water right through  tough trip  had rain fly and that kept upper portion bone dry but water in bottom of tent when you wake up is no fun  be sure to use camp dry on the entire tent before your first use     
339,4.0,                       when i saw it said the tent went up in one minute  i laughed to my husband and said  well it ll take us at least a half an hour then   but  it really did go up in five minutes or under  it s such a nice and simple design   all the poles just click right into place   and it s nice and tall inside so you really can stand up and not hunch over the whole time   we were very happy with this tent  and it packs up almost as fast as it opens up however  it will absolutely not fit two queen mattresses as it claims  that is seriously laughable   we purposely ordered this tent just for the two of us on a queen mattress and our little dog  so this is not a worry  but if you re trying to do really fit two queens or   people   consider a bigger tent   with the one queen mattress we had enough space for our bags and a couple things which was nice and it felt spacious   our tent also came in orange and taupe  which is totally fine  i actually like it better than the blue and gray pic   but just something to note as well one last thing to note  is that this tent does not pack small   it takes up alot of room   again  i knew i was trading easy for space on this one  and that s fine by me  but if you re looking for a tent that condenses down to not take up a lot of room in the car  it s another thing to take into consideration overall we re very happy with the tent and can t wait to use it more      
340,5.0,                       i love this tent  it s extremely easy to take up and down it looks great  i read other reviews and it is completely waterproof i ve never had any issues  and i have not even sprayed it yet or anything  but it s very spacious extremely comfortable  my kids love it  we ve had lots of great adventures this summer and plan on having many more      
341,5.0,                       we just went camping for the first time after   years of not being able to go and i love this tent  it took me about a minute to set up and less than   to take down  i thought i was going to struggle to get it back in the bag and i didn t  i did it by myself and it was so easy  i m so incredibly happy that i invested my time and money into this product  i m excited to camp again with it  coleman is the absolute best      
342,2.0,                       bought to supplement van camping   easy set up and nice to sit in if windy or cold but one major problem   it leaks   just regular steady rain  not a all out storm  and there were puddles everywhere   water dripping from center ceiling  gear pockets on side walls  etc   i used sponge and pitcher to clean up and there was     liters of water on the floor   perfect tent if      dry condition   epic fail if there is even a short  light rain   bummer since the  instant  up feature is really nice   i wanted this to be more weather worthy      
343,3.0,                       you pay for what you get  make sure you seam seal it really well before taking it out as water will get into your tent  especially in the corners where the bottom liner meets the tent  i also added additional water proofing to the outside of the tent   i had an older coleman tent that i never had to seam seal until years later  coleman isn t what it used to be      
344,5.0,                       i was very impressed with this tent  i m a single mother with young kids who has never camped by herself who wanted to take her kids camping for fall break  i was nervous because i had never set up a tent before so i wanted something easy  i was able to set this up all by myself and it took no time at all  even the take down was very simple and quick   it will not fit back in the bag though  don t bother trying  on top of that the second day it rained hard all day and not a drop got into the tent  i did purchase the fly made for the tent separately   overall  it was a great trip and i am so glad i bought this tent      
345,1.0,                       set it up at home first  i m glad i did  setting up only took a minute or two  great  large size  problem is one of those lock buttons won t press in  i m glad i tried it first  i m returning it   i eventually had to use a flat head screwdriver to pry   force it in      
346,1.0,                       on first use  one zipper sticking and another broken   snowed and rained   the snow and water from the roof go into the tent when going in and out  no matter how careful you are   easy to put up    but horrible to take down and get folded into the carry case   no fly so no roof ventilation      
347,4.0,                       easy set up   did it by myself in about one minute  took less time to break it down  took about   minutes to fold and roll it to get it back in the expandable storage bag  compared to my   person dome tent  this tent is much easier to assemble and breakdown and easy with just one person  i could see daylight through the corner seams as noted in the picture  water leakage is mentioned in other reviews  i purchased the rain fly and hope that helps if i m caught in the rain  plenty of head room and windows for ventilation  look forward to trying it out and if anything drastic occurs  i ll submit another review      
348,4.0,                       my husband and i set this up in the dark the first time we used it and we did it in under   minutes   it rained a decent amount during our trip and i didn t have time to water proof anything on the tent before hand   we had no problems   my husband is   ft   and i am   ft   and we both appreciated the height of this tent  we had a queen air mattress with room for our small carry on suitcase  duffel bag  and medium dogs off to the side  i especially liked the hook hanging from the top to hang our electric lantern   the tent is a bit difficult to pack up and it is larger than i thought it would be to carry   like others have said  this is certainly not a tent you would carry far from your car to set up      
349,4.0,                       cheap   but i d have paid double for this tent  this thing is great  i don t know if i set it up in under    seconds but it is the easiest and fastest tent i ve ever set up  i did some water proofing before i took it on a trip and along with the rain cover it worked perfectly  i d recommend this thing to anyone  and if it ever breaks i m buying it again      
350,1.0,                       i don t know how this tent had so many reviews with       stars  it rained the  st night we set it up and it leaked from everywhere  fortunately i set it up first at home  so that night we had to retreat to the house  the next morning i vacuumed out   gallons of water  unlike the coleman rain room video showing they mopped up a teaspoon of water  we did not purchase the rain fly  sold separately      because the reviews said it didn t even need one  we have called and emailed coleman multiple times with no response  unacceptable for a company like this  i ve since bought a gallon of waterproofer sealant and have sprayed it twice  it has improved tremendously but still have mopped up a quart of water  still unacceptable for a product claiming waterproof   do not buy into the lie      
351,5.0,                       literally goes up and down in minutes  recommend going to home depot or lowes and getting some    x     nails for tent stakes as the ones that come with it are the very flimsy aluminum ones  should be fine in bad weather as i bought some seem sealer and did the seams even though they looked ok  i also bought the optional fly but havent used it yet  also fyi the bag has a paper part that you cut so that the tent will fit in it after it has been deployed      
352,2.0,                       great tent  but only if it doesn t rain   it rained and water got in the tent in many places   then applied waterproofing to the entire tent  but it still leaked at many of the seams   then spent     on the rainfly accessory   but rain still gets in in several spots one thing is for sure  if you buy this and it rains  water will get in   there s nothing you can do to stop it      
353,5.0,                       set up in under a minute  without reading the instructions  large enough for a   foot high queen sized air mattress  with about a foot along the side and   inches on the end   windows on   sidesvery impressed with the design      
354,5.0,                       my husband and i were looking for a quick convenient tent to set up  especially because we have   toddlers and didn t want struggle with a tent  this tent was a great investment for us a queen size inflatable fits  small table and   medium size container fits as well  the only dislike would be the taking down process  you want make sure the bars are the correct way  but overall best tent      
355,5.0,                       i have a giant version of this tent that i ve been using for a long time and love it   my wife wanted to go camping on her own with friends  so i got her a smaller version   these are so awesome    takes literally   min to put it together alone   well made too    will withstand many camping trips   none of mine ever had anything go wrong with them      
356,4.0,                       went up soooo easy   i love it  broke down and packed up super easy  too  you do have to read the short easy instructions  though  the only problem is the door opens on only one side of the tent so you have to step over the person sleeping next to the door to get out  i was trying to get the zipper open and fell onto my nephew s air mattress and popped it and he couldn t sleep the rest of the night and was cranky the next day      
357,2.0,                       i bought one of these a few years ago and loved how easy it was to set up  it was useless in the rain so the the rainfly which is sold separately is a must  living in california  the lack of even water resistance wasn t as huge as a problem for us as it might be for others  we recently ordered another for family and the first time out both zippers on the door failed  extremely cheap zippers that really aren t suitable for any tent  by the time we used it we had already passed the return date  so we are stuck with a      useless tent  pay a little extra and buy something with zippers that won t self destruct  if you can buy an old one from a yard sale you should be fine  our old one is still going strong     
358,1.0,                       we were excited for this easy up tent  then we used it     first time we woke up to the whole tent being soaked in condensation inside and out  everything inside touching the sides of the tent  pillows  bags  blankets  were soaked  second time the condensation was so bad not only were the walls soaked  ruining our pillow and blankets again  there was was also a steady drip coming from the top of the tent  at  am  truly disappointed in this purchase      
359,5.0,                       i love our new tent  we re first time campers  so setting this up was very easy  it has enough room for a queen air mattress and some room around for walking changing  a l shape space about   ft wide   for children  they can walk straight  but an adult have to bend down a little  i love that the door is to one side  it makes it easier to get in into the empty corner  and not step directly on the mattress   in general  we love it      
360,5.0,                       set up first time in less than    seconds  not counting time to subsequently hammer in stakes  set up dozens of tents over the years  and this is by far the easiest  take down also easy  bag expands to facilitate tent going back in      
361,3.0,                       took this out to my property when the temps were in the   s  sat in the tent for a while and realized there was very little airflow coming in through the mesh screens  i was laying in a camp cot just below one of the screened windows  if i stood up  i could feel a little air coming through  but if you sit below the screen  you won t feel any air this tent might be better suited for camping in cooler weather  i ll try it again in the fall or winter      
362,2.0,                       i bought the   person version of this tent  set up is really easy  the downside of this tent is it leaks really bad  i took it camping last night and midway through the night it started a light rain  needless to say i woke up to wet blankets and water dripping inside very disappointed in it      
363,5.0,                       i love this tent  it s definitely a car camping tent as it does not pack down small at all  but man  it s so easy to set up and take down  my tiny self can set up the tent and take it down in under a minute  i have had this tent now for over half a year and it has held up in the desert and mountains  i recently came back from the sierras where we experienced a crazy hailstorm that lasted three hours  definitely get the rainfly    with the rainfly and an added tarp as protection  the tent came out of the storm hole free  i m about       and can stand up in the middle of the tent  no butt wiggling to put on pants  it comfortably sleeps three people  or two  or one  i can see four people being a bit cramped though  the only thing i would add on is a bottom window on one of the walls because it can get a little stuffy while sleeping  other than that this is by far my favorite tent  it s really not too hard to get it back in the bag either  which is awesome      
364,4.0,                       the easy up aspect of this tent could not be better  very spacious inside  the  dark room  technology really works  the  main door  is awesome   doesn t require zipping all the time  the fly on top would be better if it extended a little farther    water does get in when you open the doors  that s a definite design flaw  it didn t rain a ton when we were camping  but if it did  i d be less happy      
365,5.0,                       to say this tent is easy is an understatement  it literally sets up in a minute  taking it down is easy too  i just have to find a way to get it all in sync to wrap around the poles before trying to put it in the bag  it stayed dry  love the accessories pocket but wish there were more      
366,5.0,                       this tent can set up in   minuteshas a     view if you choose  this is really sized for two adults  or two adults and some kids it s a little heavy but i ll take it it s built well and it s sturdy  my first try i set it up in two minutesanother three minutes pinning it down     
367,5.0,                       just used it this past weekend for the first time  worked great  nice and big  and is as easy as they say to build up   break down if i had any complaints it would be that the tent gets hot  there is a small rain fly on the top  but no real vents or ways for heat to escape  only way to cool down is having all the windows unzipped  this works  unless you need to change  have adult time  or anything else that might need privacy  zipping up the windows  then it s going to get warm in there fast overall though for the price  size  and instant design you can t really go wrong with this tent      
368,4.0,                       i have put up this tent and used it a few nights   i liked the ease of putting it up   i did it alone and it only took about    minutes to get it all spread out to get it staked and ready to enter   the    second claim on the box is a bit silly   but yes it is quick to put up   poles are all located on the outside as stated and only need to be pulled apart in the middle until they snap into a locked position   that is it  the tent is up  plenty of head room inside  which i really like     i did put one queen air bed inside   ahh  now that is camping   those are the pros of this tent   the cons are it is a very lightweight material  and it does not come with a rain fly so that s why the low price   i did order the rain fly which i have not received yet   i would definitely not consider this a winter tent because the material is not heavy enough for that    so  if you only want to use it for a summer tent then there are no cons i guess   that is my purpose for this tent but since it is late summer with rain forecast here  i did order the rain fly   oh  yes  their are one or two improvements that need to  be made on the inside of this tent   the windows unzip from the top edge and sides and flaps hang down into room when tent windows are in the open position   there are no ties to  roll up and secure the flaps  so they hang inward into the tent and over your face since the walls slant outward at the bottom   ties really are necessary   other improvement would be to add more storage pockets inside   there are two very small  about    x     inside   only one hang ring up at peek of tent   no other places to hang anything  since poles are all on outside of tent   so you need to provide your own creative method of storing any small objects you do not want to loose track of   other than that  i am very pleased with this very roomy and very inexpensive easy to use tent   i can t speak to whether it is water proof at all as i just got it and no rain yet   i will update in a few days as rain is in the forecast for my area updateit did rain and quite a bit   i was really surprised to find that no water got into the tent at all   and i had not put the rain fly on yet   so it looks to be a better tent than i thought   it still is a summer tent in my opinion though because of the very light weight fabric   but a great buy all in all      
369,2.0,                       start with the good  easy set up and pack up  enough room inside for queen and twin air mattress and dog bed with a little room left over to move around bad  not waterproof at all  couldn t handle light rain lasting    minutes first time using it it leaked badly  mid afternoon we set up the tent  with optional fly  then a little later it rained lightly for    minutes  we could see moisture coming through the walls below where the fly sits  rain stopped  then later that evening started again  what i would consider normal rain  more than light but not heavy  within    minutes there were small puddles of water in every corner and visible water drops coming through all walls with the radar showing heavier rain lasting much longer than    minutes coming in the early hours of the morning  at   pm we decided to pack up and head home wet and disappointed don t know if we just got a dud tent  or if all are like this but we will be returning      
370,5.0,                       this tent is awesome  it definitely sets up in less than    seconds  putting it away took me about    minutes and i needed some help  me and my daughter camped in our yard with it this summer  it fit two twin air mattresses and it was snug  so if   people slept in it  it would be pretty tight  has nice windows  and pockets on the inside to store items  overall very happy with this tent     
371,5.0,                       they call it the instant tent and it truly is  i have fun dazzling other campers with the ease of putting it up  it really can be done in about a minute  the hardest part is driving in the tent pegs after the tent is up  it s easier than some umbrellas i ve used  when we first purchased it  i was aware that tent seams can be a source of water leaks so i sprayed them with camp dry to prevent leaks  even without a rain fly  it is water tight if you spray the seams a couple times a season  and wind  not a problem so far  sleeping in any tent in high winds is uncomfortable and annoying because of the noise and feeling of insecurity  coleman can t do anything about the noise but the tent is a rock in some very high  sustained winds up to       mph  it shakes and shifts and rocks and rolls but it stays put and stays up  the frame mechanism seems very sturdy  we have spent two seasons in this tent in all kinds of weather and are pleased with it  the floor is the typical tarp polyvinyl material and seems durable enough but i like to use a ground cloth underneath just to prolong the tents life  if you are going to be in rainy weather a lot  i would get a rain fly but with camp dry on the seams we ve stayed dry in some pretty good rain storms      
372,4.0,                       first you must remember that instant is a relative term  is it easier to put up  yes  is it instant  no  i actually was able to put up my smaller tent with normal poles quicker than this one  you see one of the reasons it is faster up is that it has no fly  the fly can be bought separately and if you are ever in harsh weather i recommend it  if you add the time to put the fly on by one person this actually took me longer now that being said  if you want a nice sized tent that is easy for the non experienced to put up this is a great tent  roomy and tall  height is something that many overlook  standing up to put your pants on is a comfort that many take for granted until you can t  as for the foot print two things to consider  one  all tents are comfortable for exactly half of the number of people the manufacturer says it is for  yes i said it  hey i like room for my gear   so this tent is really comfortable for     people  second  all tents have an angle  this makes them a bit smaller than their footprint would have you believe now for those who will say but john you seem to be saying that it is a good tent but that you don t like it for stuff that most campers know  my answer is yes bottom line on this tent  it is a good tent  with rain fly  for cool  warm weather for     people who are not experienced campers  easy to use and well built if you are a hiker or even camp three hundred yards from your car then you will want to skip this  it is large and heavy and not really built for distance camping  use it for family camping near your car and you should be very happy with it      
373,3.0,                       i bought this tent for camping with my kids   i chose a   person so   people could set up camp cots and sleep with a bit of room to spare   while i should have noted the measurements and cross checked that with the cot sizes  i trusted coleman when they said it was a   person tent   it is not a   person tent     cots won t even fit     cots work fine   other than that  it is amazingly easy to put up and take down and i have used it for several solo campouts because it is the easiest tent i have ever owned      
374,3.0,                       i read a lot of reviews about this tent and almost all of them said that it leaked like an old boat  i dicided to give it a try and guess what indeed it leaks like and old boat  i wll post pictures where it shows that with a tarp on top adn beneath a tree with light rain after   hours it leaked   whe where damp i nthe morning dont get me wrong  is a good quality tent  very nice a good built  not cheap made  great fabric  nice really big windows  but is for desert  beach camping  summer outdoors  but for mountain  or bad weather forget it you are gonna drown      
375,5.0,                       when they say    seconds it is no joke   it was easy to setup   i like the cabin configuration   set up an air mattress and with the   x    dimension your head does not come close to the walls   in subfreezing temperatures it is important so the condensation does not run down onto you   for a guy like me         a   foot tent is not long enough   my son and i did our first bulk elk hunt this year at       feet elevation      f nights and the tent provide good protection from the wind      
376,5.0,                       most horrible experience with a tent i ve ever had  in a survival situation it would be great for retaining water on the inside with as much as it leaks   brand new out of the box  ive used coleman products a lot  i believe in coleman and that they will make this right      
377,4.0,                       this tent sets up fast as advertised and is perfect for two people  nice and roomy  i use it as a one man tent at hunting base camp i would not use this tent for four people unless it s like for an adult and three small children  or you have four adults  who are really comfortable with each other if you know what i mean wink wink it survived a rainstorm  and i stayed dry even when a large puddle formed between the ground tarp and the tent floor  while it has a built in rain fly  i purchased the optional rain fly accessory  which is like having two rain flies this tent also went nowhere in high winds  it stakes down tight  i also replaced the cheap stakes with higher quality stakes      
378,5.0,                       this is my second coleman instant tent  the first broke after   years  when i loaded it to some friends  not sure what happened   i camp alone so i need to be able to put up the tent by myself but i also like having the space for me  my dog and my instruments  i m female and     and this tent is perfect  like a small bedroom rather than a tent  i got a generic instant tent at walmart to replace my broken coleman and gave it away to a homeless man i met after using it once  too hard for me to use when camping alone  went back to amazon and got the   person colman  used it once and and then sold it to a friend get another   person coleman tent  the   person was nice and fit my queen mattress but i love all the space i have in the   person tent  never had issues with leaking rain but then again i generally camp in extreme weather other than high wind  tons of room and it sets up in under   mins with only one person   which is the main reason i got it  breaking it down and fitting it back in the bag is a bit tricker but you get the hang of it  do not remove the poles   ever   they are meant to stay in  i know a few people who have tried and it ruins the tent  ithere is no rain fly yet somehow the vent system does not seem to get water or dew inside under non extreme conditions  i can t speak for harsher weather   i will probably never buy a different brand of tent      
379,5.0,                       oh  my god  this tent is incredible like most people  i ve struggled for a long time with setting up tents  connecting rods  staking them down  and unpacking it  not with this tent though  by myself  i was able to unpack  set up  and stake the tent in about     seconds  taking it down is obviously a little longer but again  alone  i was able to pack it up in the traveling case and head out once it s up  there s not much to say  it s a tent  it does what regular tents do  i waterproofed mine and had no leaks      
380,5.0,                       this couldn t be easier    we put this up for the first time after the sun had almost set  you take it out of the package and literally click the poles in two spots  boom  done   it was just as easy to take down  however  it was a bit hard to fold down the material to make fit back into the bag  still      better than traditional tents of having to stream poles through and clip on etc      
381,5.0,                       we brought this new tent on our first camping trip  it was much easier to put up and take down than a regular tent  we liked that we could stand up in it  it states it holds   persons  we were   persons and very comfortable in it  i didn t like that the door opening only had   zipper that was at the bottom when closed  i prefer the   zipper type that can be closed at the top or bottom  i would highly recommend putting the tent on a tarp  when you fold it up it was very dirty on the bottom  also  we could not get it back into the original bag  which is common place for all the tents i have ever owned  i reccomend this tent for   or   adults      
382,1.0,                       the first one i returned had a small hole in it  took it camping and the weather that day rained hard but only for a short period took it out camping and it has been raining for the last  hrs and will rain all now and water is leaking in from the corners  top is dripping  the pocket on the side is a guide for the rain to drip on spend the money and buy a different one  better one brand  not water resistant at all      
383,5.0,                       the roominess  the design  durability  we camped in this tent for one month  we went through intense heat and a few severe thunderstorms and the tent stayed secured with just a micro amount of water leak during the storm  the air circulation was excellent with plenty of screening  privacy was as to be expected   easy set up and take down      
384,5.0,                       i went camping for the first time  using this tent  it rained and did not leak  it was big enough for our queen size mattress and there was still room left over  i can t imagine two queen mattresses fitting in this tent but one queen and maybe one twin mattress  i can t wait to go camping again     would recommend this tent to anyone  super easy to put up and take down  worth every penny      
385,1.0,                       don t buy this tent  i gave coleman the benifit of the doubt as i have purchased many of their products in the past  i will no longer go that route  this tent leaked in numerous places which put a huge damper on our trip  literally   to my own fault missed the return date and stuck with this trash  don t make the mistake i did and keep shopping for something reliable      
386,4.0,                       i took my first camping trip alone with my   year old and   dogs earlier this year and needed all new camping gear since i had never been camping in a tent as an adult   when i saw the instant tent i knew this was exactly what i needed   i was nervous about camping alone with my   year old and dogs  especially with how long it normally takes to set up a tent   when we got to our campsite i left the car running with my son and dogs in the tent and had the tent up in about a minute   it reminds me of setting up my son s playpen   taking it down was easy too  though fitting it in the bag was a little tricky  but isn t that how it always is    the downside to this tent is  as someone else mentioned  when the windows are opened all the way there are no ties to tie them back   if you don t get them tucked in just right they fall in your face when you are lying on an air mattress   with a   year old in the tent jumping around and looking out the windows it was next to impossible to keep the windows tucked in just right   i ll agree with someone else who said they don t think   people could fit in this tent too   i had a queen size air mattress and a kids aerobed in the tent and there was about a foot and a half of space between the   matresses  though we did have some space for the dogs at the foot of the kids aerobed   if everyone was sleeping on sleeping bags with no air mattresses  perhaps you could fit   people in there   but i don t know anyone who camps without an air mattress or cot   next time we go camping i m taking my twin size air mattress instead of the queen   i accidentally grabbed the wrong one last time   so we ll have more space to move around in the tent      
387,1.0,                       i got it on sale this is not weatherproof or waterproof with the   x   tarp i bought it was       but winds going to blow rain right the zippers no matter what and the lower seal of the tarp to the nylon leaks badly if you don t seal it with some really good seam sealer  it is really dark in it which does make it easier to sleep past dawn at least  also the    second setup is a lie     
388,1.0,                       we are  avid  campers  this last trip  after only two years of ownership  and    camping trips   the main zipper into the cabin broke  we tried everything  but nothing worked  i even called companies to see if they would fix the zipper no one would  so now i have this tent  that s mostly working fine  that i need to replace because of a zipper issue i also will add this tent had a rip  which i fixed  and noticed it was also ripping on the bag itself and the stake straps  where straps attach to the tent  very disappointed that i need to replace this tent so soon  i will be going for a much higher quality with a different company for our next trip      
389,1.0,                       this tent is a piece of garbage  missing zippers  pointless rain fly restraints that blow off at the slightest gust of wind  and the door zipper on the bottom came off the first ti e we used it  it s about to rain  guess we ll see if their video is a lie      
390,5.0,                       went camping last weekend and arrived at campsite after    pm  it was late  dark and i was tired  tent was still in shipping box  owned box  pulled tent out and it went up super easy  this is a great tent next day   goof friday    th of april       a bad thunder storm rolled in  heavy winds and rain for several hours  no problems slept   adult    teenager  and   young boys and had room for gear and food supplies love this tent      
391,2.0,                       nice tent but two plastic corner joints are broke   called coleman and they don t have replacement parts for this so i have to pack the entire tent up after we sealed the seams and send back for a replacement  not convenient since the parts seem easy enough to replace    what a pain  the packaging was undamaged by mail so it makes me believe the tent was packed up already damaged and sold      
392,5.0,                       this tent stood up to   week of nonstop heavy rain and flooding  not one drop of water got in minus what came in when we opened the door to go in and out  it took on seriously heavy winds and didn t budge  it does not breath very well when zipped up but what do you expect with a weather proof tent  its bulky but worth it for ease of set up and packing up not to mention it can take beating from mother nature     
393,5.0,                       setup in    seconds   i don t think so  try about    seconds from bag to finish  seriously the easiest part of the last camping trip  the other people in the party are all selling their tents and purchasing these tents now  it folds back up and drops in the bag just as easy as taking it out  highly recommend purchasing one of these      i bought the rain fly as well  better be safe than sorry  and it rained the first night  not a drop of water in the tent  if i were to complain about anything at all it would be that there wasn t a rear window you could open up  only front and the sides  but seriously  amazing tent      
394,5.0,                       i could not be happier with the ease of setting up and especially taking down this tent  plus  the amazing people at coleman design the storage bag so that you can extend the size and actually pack this thing back in the bag for easy storage  they aren t lying on the video when it shows a setup that takes just a couple of minutes   you can definitely fit two queen air beds in this thing  but that is all you have room for so it may be worth paying a little bit more to get the   person tent so you have a bit more place for bags  etc      
395,1.0,                       i love coleman products for the most part  however this was an utter disappointment  used it for   days total  the tent leaked like a sive after only a few hours of rain  the condensation built up within hours and combined with nonstop rain for a few hours the inside of the tent was dripping everywhere  i ve never had any tent leak this much  my sleeping bags and clothing were drenched  not to mention when i slept i had to deal with water dripping on my face      
396,3.0,                       my husband   i put this tent up and took it down right out of the box in   minutes  and were very surprised at how easy it was  we will be using it over thanksgiving   campland on the bay in san diego  during our practice run it really felt like the right size for us and has plenty of room for extra stuff  not sure i would want   people in it but can surely see that if they were not too large it could be accomplished   we will really really love the ease in putting it up and taking it down ok so thanksgiving was this weekend and we used the tent for the  st time  others that were with us loved the ease it went up   down with my suggestions are the following material used on the top portion is very light in color  making the tent very bright at night  i don t think we had a full moon but for me it was way too bright inside has only   little pockets to hold items and they are on total different sides of tent  i would appreciate   on each side of the tent so we could each have a place to put our things laying on our air mattress i had to get up   out of bed to unzip the windows so i could peek out and see what the day looked like  they only flap down from the top and have no ties being on the bay we had moisture in the air and the tent seemed to hold tht so when i got up the sides got me wet had only one qn air mattress and any more would have been a tight squeeze so since we have experienced this tent i think we might return it for a different one and will also change my rating for this item the best thing about this tent is the ease of assembly      
397,4.0,                       i have enjoyed this tent now for two years  it definitely does not need the additional rain fly    at least for weather typical to the southeastern us  rain storms are not a problem for this tent  i love how roomy it is  perfect for two people who like a lot of room  i love not crawling  but walking into my tent  this was the reason i invested in a larger tent and i have been satisfied on this point  i have been extremely happy with how easy this tent is to set up and break down  literally taking less than five minutes for one person  that being said  i have two complaints about the design  the door zipper requires you to bend down each time to unzip  which is tiring  the windows do not have ties for the window covers  however the fabric will tuck neatly between the screen and window fabric if you do so carefully  otherwise  the windows hang at a funny angle when unzipped all the way  overall  i would look for a door that unzips differently  but the tent is great for what it does      
398,5.0,                       lovely tent  goes up fast   i don t know why it doesn t come with a rain fly  yes  i bought the one that goes with it  the rain fly is a must have item  my first trip in this tent was in flood conditions and everything inside stayed dry coleman customer service was good on the second try   the first try the line went dead like they hung up on me   i hope it was just a cell phone issue   i managed to break a screw putting the tent away in a thunderstorm   they don t sell the screw so they offered to replace the tent with a new one   i found a piece of welding rod that will hold it together until i find the right screw      
399,1.0,                       i was finally able to use this tent and this weekend proved that it has a defected  the set up was super easy but then came a night with some rain  we had rain this weekend an immediately noticed rain coming through the seems  i noticed the gaps on the side  everything in the back left corner got wet  i m really disappointed about how it all turned out  there is no way i can use this tent again  i had everything zipped up and the rain went right through it and some how found some daddy long legs crawling in the ceiling      
400,4.0,                       i bought this tent after seeing it at the campgrounds and reading about the ease of use  i have a smaller  cheaper  not coleman  tent that has been great  it s waterproof  and i can easily set up and take down by myself in about    minutes  but i wanted a larger option that i can stand in pros     super  super easy to put up and take down  i m a       female and can do it alone in under   minutes    i like that it has windows on all sides  providing good ventilation     great height and size  i can stand up in the tent  or even bring my beach camp chair inside in the evenings or if it s inclimate weather outside  big enough to share with one other person  our airbeds and bags     ppl is out of the question     large doorway you can walk through without crouching   there are two large pouches inside about mid high to store small items so they don t get lost in the tent  and there is one loop in the center of the ceiling that lanterns  etc  can be hooked from if you have the right hook or bungee cons     it most certainly is not waterproof  despite what anyone may try to tell you  don t believe them    rainfly   it doesn t come with one  but even with the fly  which i ordered and waited four months for  it is not rainproof   the sides seeped significantly because the fly only covers the top  it should come down lower  at least on three sides  it would also have been nice if they designed it with a vestible over the door since the walls of the instant tent slant outwards    the door zipper   this is one of my biggest issues with the tent  the zipper for the door starts ends at the bottom corner  instead of the top corner  this is an issue for convenience and bugs  there is a small gap even when it is fully zipped  and because it s at ground level  this will allow in bugs  coleman should know better than this  and to just stick your head out you have to unzip the whole darned door  not convenient    the windows are too high  i would prefer at least one of them to be a little lower to provide additional airflow and a view  the entire back of my smaller tent is mesh  which is great in the summer or for star viewing at night     despite the ads  there is no way two queen mattresses will fit in this tent  and it will not fit   people without someone smothering     it s heavy  but that s because of the structure required to make it so easy to use  no way i can drag this too far  but the bag is sturdy and has good handles  so it s easy to haul    it would be nice to have more than just the single loop in the middle of the ceiling  my smaller tent actually has four bottom line  it s a great tent for good weather  but don t expect to have a view from inside or to stay dry if there is more than a drizzle  even with the rainfly  however  i m going again this weekend and will be using waterproofing spray on the whole tent  we ll see if that makes a difference      
401,5.0,                       nice tent and fairly easy to setup the first time without anything more than briefly glancing at the instructions   it did require an extra pair of hands to hold two of the four legs steady while the other two were unfolded   it took around two minutes to assemble the first time and i believe it ll go much faster the next   this is not a  trail  tent and would be somewhat heavy to carry around if hiking hours at a time   the material is much thicker and construction more durable than a trail tent  this together with the provided tent hold downs  aka tent stakes and attached cords  should standup to windy conditions very well   others have commented about a  spider hole  that remains by the door zipper s  not closing to within each other   this is not true   if you close the zipper on the upper portion of the door first and bring it all the way down to the floor  then  follow this by closing the lower zipper it will meet the upper zipper to within  mm  we measured this    we noticed a slight problem with the design in that this tent lacks a rain fly   the rain fly is supposed to divert  some  of the rain from the main body of the tent   however even though coleman now sells a rain fly someone on this blog suggested  we believe  a better solution   purchasing a   x    tarp   at night the tarp can drape the entire tent providing rain protection   during the day the tarp could be detached from the back poles  flipped over and with a couple of extra poles made into an awning over the front doorway   the tarp then  while not as form fitting as a coleman rain fly  can serve double duty overall good purchase   glad i bought it      
402,3.0,                       my tent came with no stakes  luckily  i had some on hand  otherwise  i would have been pretty upset  another problem was with the zipper to the door  it was messed up on the curved part of the door and was almost impossible to close at times  my    year old could barely do it  i would have to pull both sides of the door together just to get it to zip and even then it was very difficult  i do have to say that this tent held up well through several thunderstorms  but i did have the rain fly on it to help  i purchased this tent specifically because it was coleman brand  i had certain expectations and was let down  i am trying to figure out how to get this situation resolved as i should not be responsible for shipping it back  but nor should i have to struggle with the zipper every single time i go in and out of the tent  i would buy this tent again  but check for stakes and check the zipper before camping      
403,5.0,                       easy pop up for single woman  too heavy for backpacking  but moderately light weight for a fairly solid tent  this isnt top of the line  but its not bad at all for the price  im  happy with my purchase  i bought the matching rain fly  it serves its purpose as a vent  but i would rather set up a large tarp above the tent for heavy rain  i wasnt rained on while using it  but feel like the windows could use protection to vent them too in a rain      
404,2.0,                       i love how easy to put up this tent is  it pops up in a minute  i went ahead and purchased the rainfly as an addon to this tent cause i was going on a several day camping trip with possible rain  well it did rain  not crazy rain but pretty steady for a night  water was dripping into the tent via the window areas  yes   it was closed  and the corners of the tent  everything was wet after one night of rain  this thing is great for a dry weekend trip but dont trust the  weather proof  tag on this      
405,3.0,                       positives  after i figured how to put it up took about   minute   extra time for staking  it was easy to take down  but a little hard to get back in the bag  you will need   people for this job to make it easier negatives  the door zips on the wrong side and this makes it hard to get in and out of tent  it will sleep    comfortably  if you sleep on the ground  it will sleep   and a dog it you sleep on cots  we used it once and on the side wall there were   tiny holes in the making when we started putting it up      
406,1.0,                       we are avid  experienced campers excited to set up our new    person coleman instant tent  our third in   years   we instantly realized this tent s build quality isn t close to previous versions  it is junk   it is flimsy and feels so cheap  we are coleman fans so this experience was really shocking  when i saw bad reviews i thought that can t be     we loved our previous versions  but it s true  coleman has completely cheapened this version and we ve sent it back  trying a competitor with hopes for decent quality  very disappointed with coleman      
407,5.0,                       these tents are the bees knees  super easy to set up and have a quality build  even after      days the tent just won t stop  sets up quick and easy even if it s just one person      
408,3.0,                       it went up fast and came down fast  just like it claims  the first time i used it  for a couple nights in july  it was sunny weather and the tent worked great  the next time i used it  last weekend  it rained the second day  all day  by evening  the inside of my tent looked like someone had set off a sprinkler  the tent wasn t exactly leaking as far as i could tell  but the top and sides of the tent had water droplets all over them  i m not sure what weathertec does exactly  but it cut my camping short      
409,5.0,                       product was good the only problem we has was that it sweat alot  it was very cold outside and it kept us warm but the walls kept sweating   otherwise it was a very easy to set up tent and kept us from freezing which made me happy because my other family that also took their tents complained about the weather that they couldn t sleep because it was too cold      
410,2.0,                       i do not leave comments often  usually others  comments provide enough information   in this case  i just could not let it go   the tent sets up very quickly  even if there is wind and you are attaching the fly  separate purchase    its height and dimensions make it ideal for limited tent pads you sometimes encounter at parks   however  i strongly recommend only using this tent when you know there will not be rain  like for a sun shelter at a track meet i seam sealed the tent prior to use and took it to the mountains for camping   it leaked significantly   i ve never been in a tent that leaked so prominently through the walls  even when we we very careful to not make contact with the inside walls   even after using  m tent waterproofing spray and and a mild rain  there were puddles of water on the inside floor  and this occurred when the tent was empty  we were testing it for another trip and left it set up overnight    perhaps if the fly were larger then water would not drip as much on to the screens  we think that is one weakness for the leaks   however  we saw water seeping through the material of the surfaces along all surfaces away from the windows      scotchgard outdoor water shield       ounce                            coleman            seam sealer    oz    quantity  
411,5.0,                       the size is perfect for a family of   with two kids  you could fit two queen size air bed but it leaves you with a small space to walking around and also less space for your bags  their is no spot to run the power outlet inside other than running it in the door it self  i don t suggest putting any electronic or anything that you don t want to get wet in the build it pocket inside the tent  the moist that builds inside the wall tend to drip inside the pocket  pay attention on the folding mechanism since it almost broke my finger when i was trying to relocate the tent  the tent is a little heavy and also longer when folded down compare to my old tent that folds in much smaller  the take on this is  instant tent equal longer and heavier  to be safe  i ended up buying the rain fly which help in making the tent a little harmer  i like the little vent on top and the hook in the top middle to the tent is nicely build and i m sure it could hold a heavy light or a fan for ventilation  the tent does not have anything build in to hold the window flap when it is open so when you have the windows flap is open  it just hang inside which is a little un organize  the only one that has it is the door screen alone which is guess a plus  for the price i got it which was on sale and the quality you get for it being  coleman  i would give it   out of    due to missing outlet port  missing window flap holder  pocket inside getting wet due to condensation and the water tend to drip inside the pocket  the folding mechanism that almost got me which is partly my fault  thank you amazon for the great product and price  no more late night setting of tent that normally takes me    or more minutes while raining      
412,5.0,                       we decided to go with the   person tent because my husband and i have   dogs  the tent was perfect on our recent camping trip  insanely spacious  especially  with   young  hyper fur babies running around inside before bed  the time it took to set up and break down was amazing  we had time to lounge around while our friends were still pitching their tents  we even got a compliment from a person at the campground  this will definitely take the headache out of pitching a tent  buy this unfortunately  it didn t rain during our trip  fortunate for us  not for review purposes  i will update if it rains during our next camping trip      
413,4.0,                       this tent is very easy to set up and put away and makes a great  guest  room or slumber party space  put up cousin bill in the backyard and reclaim your sofa or home office i recently stayed two weeks in a relative s backyard using this tent  and was quite comfortable  it had ample room for myself  my gear and my dog  it would be very comfortable for two adults  two kids and their gear  i was staying in fog bound coastal northern california  and stayed dry in the tent despite daily nightime fog and light rain  the evening temps dropped below   f a couple of nights  in july   and under those conditions there was light condensation in the tent in the morning even though the rooftop vents were kept open it s been several decades since i ve slept in a tent that i could stand up in  and i have to admit that it s nice  that being said  i wouldn t use this particular tent under high wind or stormy weather conditions  a lower profile tent with a full coverage fly will do better in those situations i bought this tent with the intent of leaving it with my relatives as a gift for them when i left town  unfortunately  the lower front door zipper broke three days into my visit  and i ll have to negotiate directly with coleman for repair or replacement of the tent  this is why i m giving the tent a four star rating  i applaud coleman for the instant tent feature  and hope that they can extend it to tents designed for harsher weather conditions comments added on           after speaking directly with the helpful folks at coleman i realized that i had two options for getting a replacement tent  i could go through amazon  which required returning the original tent to amazon   or i could provide coleman with several pieces of electronic documentation  including a photo of the original tent marked up with permanent marker with a code provided by them  and they would review my documentation and ship me a new tent  i opted to go the amazon route and am one happy camper  pun intended   as soon as i filled out the return info online  amazon shipped a brand new tent to my relatives  it was received by them in two days     meanwhile  i went to the ups store and had them pack up the original tent  i d tossed the box already  and send it back to amazon  it cost me about     for the package and packaging to return the tent  but it was worth it to get the speedy shipment of the new tent  thanks amazon   i m a member of amazon prime  which probably played a role in the quick delivery of the new tent       
414,5.0,                       this tent is by far the easiest tent i ve ever owned to put up    and also to take down  anyone who complains about putting it away simply didn t take the time to observe how it was as they unravelled it to know how to put it back  it has no fight in it because it s a pop up the tent bag is quite long  so it s not the space saver that traditional tents are  but if you have the room it ll save you so much time also  there s plenty of setup and take down videos on youtube so you can learn in advance      
415,5.0,                       it really did set up in   seconds  loved the spaciousness and my boyfriend loved being able to stand up  it was our home at burning man for three weeks  held up to the wind dust storms very well  the dust storms were kept at bay because of its ability to completely close all vents with the built in rain fly  it was not put through much rain at all  maybe a sprinkle one morning but nothing to really test its ability  we will be taking this on many more trips and i will be testing it in many more environments  this tent was bought for that trip specifically therefore i recommend it based on that      
416,4.0,                       just delivered yesterday so i haven t taken it out yet  hoping to this weekend  initial impressions  super easy set up  i did notice that the space between poles doesn t really stretch out so there seems like a lot of extra floor material and like my other tent  it doesn t have the hoops to steal that space down  i think the excess fabric may be reduced when staking the corners down but pulling the corners out didn t really seem to do anything  take down was easy  i was a little disappointed by the sloppy fold up  maybe i will find a way to make it a bit nicer with some practice  that s obviously not a functional problem though  i was able to get it back in the bag   anyway  very excited  i ll update once i have used it      
417,4.0,                       this is a bulky tent  i knew it when i bought it  but i have plenty of room when i travel to camp   the instant tent makes camping more fun   i hated breaking down camp with poles and it always took forever  not now   i love the ease of use   i would have given it   stars but the zipper is a bit difficult to close and open   the top right corner of the tent holds up the zipper   i have to hold either side of the tent and pull it together while i close it   also  there is a zipper on the bottom that goes horizontally only  it stops on the bottom   the second zipper then goes up and over to the right   if my kids are in the tent it is nice to pull both zippers high enough that they cant reach them in the middle of the night   overall  these are minor compared to the convenience of this tent      
418,5.0,                       setup process was easy thought the tent is a major pain in the neck to put back in  and packed  it is massive  it occupies almost the entire length of the backseat in my sedan   not good for windy conditions at all and it is very top heavy  i can easily stand inside the tent  and probably run a propane heater  one of the zipper is already broken     
419,4.0,                       i needed a good tent that was easy to set up by myself and handled the weather well  this was gold  set up of the tent is done in like    minutes  weather wise it handled rain well  though i would note that i always put a tarp over the top as a practice  if i didn t have the top  it may not handle heavy rain well  as it does not have a rain cover  plenty of room  i have the   person one  i had tried the   but a larger queen mattress  height  doesn t fit will in the     and very well ventilated  so air moves well and doesn t get overheated in there  breakdown and putting it away can be kind of tricky  if there is anything to prevent five stars that is it      
420,5.0,                             coleman   person instant tent                             coleman rainfly for coleman   person instant tent                       first  let s start out by stating this is not a   man tent   i can see   people  and for me  a trailer camper   that s pushing it   we basically use it to sleep in  with two blow up mattresses  and there is about     feet between them   that being said  let me state the following about the product a   yes folks  it really does go up that quick   i put this thing up  minus staking down  in about   minute the first time   i just watched the video on coleman s site and did it b   yes folks  it really comes down that quick   you just fold it up  and roll it on the ground  just to wrap it up   and it goes right back into it s carrying bag  which is nice and sturdy and has the clasps to keep the bag from wripping c   it has nice windows and a breathable top  meaning it has two  popup  vents  that use reinforced velcro  stands  to pop them up    the windows are huge  and every wall has one   they zip from top  down  so if you only want them part way  you just unzip  and fold the unzipped part back into the window d   the door is a  d  shape  and seems to work really well e   i had read on review s that you have to seal the seams  so we did  my wife did it in about    minutes or so using the coleman seam sealer    didn t spray seal the roof because of condensation issues and instead bought the rain fly f   the floor is bathtub design  meaning it extends up the sidewalls about   inches  keeping water from coming in g   the walls are supposed to be  x the thickness of regular tents  can t say for sure it is  but they seem thicker to me h   because the tent is completely attached to the poles  which literally just pop out and up  there is nothing to do but stake it down    great for me since i have to spend that time fighting with the shower tent    that s another story i   the rain fly   i bought it cause the reviewers kept saying you will need it   however  i have the following remarks on it       if it  is needed  why didn t coleman include it with the tent  at a slightly higher price       it is nothing like the rain fly on the oversea s model of the same tent  this one does not even extend over the windows  so you wouldn t be able to have the windows all the way unzipped in a rain storm       i cannot attest on it s performance  as i received it after our first trip  these things must be high demand and backorder from coleman    however  i sprayed water on it and it beaded right off   good sign       just like the tent  it goes on quick   you just unfold it over the tent  and it has built in straps that clamp  by pushing them onto the poles   had it on in    minutemy experience with the tent is very small  one trip overnight  however it was very good and i have no qualms about the tent  other than what i stated above    it seems to be high quality construction  and again  it goes up and tears down fast   you will be very very pleasantly surprised by that part  and it was a huge selling point for me   i will update this review after    oct       as we are camping for   nights in chimney rock  nc      to see the fall colors   i also want to see how my complete rig works  camp shower with propane water heater  camp toilet  etc    will update when we get back        
421,5.0,                       have used this tent for   years along with the rainfly  sold separately  for car camping  you know where you drive some where like a campgrounds and camp near your car   still no leaks  still super easy to put up  this year i even put it up completely in the dark and was fine   i ve been through some heavy downpours with it and the bathtub sides mean no leaks even with my queen size air mattress butted up right against the sides of the tent also it says it fits a queen size air mattress and it does but there isn t a ton of other room in the tent if you have one in there  just to let you know      
422,4.0,                       holy moly  the rain leaked through the tent  i also had a puddle on the floor of tent  i bought the two tents for the reason it was waterproof but the skipped that step when testing  had to put a tarp over it to keep rain from coming through walls       
423,4.0,                       can t get the lower legs to fold up toward the center so i can then roll it   put it in a bag  was a problem at the campsite  even an experienced tent camper had difficulty  now i m home and set up the tent in the living room so i could figure out some floor cushioning and now i can t get it folded up  i live in an efficiency apartment  help  otherwise  a terrific tent  i spend    days in it  two days we had constant rain  no problems with leakage  ample space for one person and a    pound dog  love the tent but want it out of my living room      
424,5.0,                          the tent is extremely simple to setup and take down   even for one person  there is no pinching of fingers when pressing the buttons to take down the legs  it easily zips back into the convenient storage bag with handles   with enough room to put a few other items like a tent light and the      coleman tent kit                           it is possible to change in a bent over position but only young children would be able to stand up straight in the tent  as always with the sizes on tents   this four person tent is more like   with an queen sized air mattress or   with foam mats and then room for your day packs and walking space  the tent door zipper opens and closes without any catches    there is little need to use the guy lines as the tent maintains good tension against the frame in normal breeze conditions  there is a nicely small covered vent at the top that can be adjusted from within the tent by opening a zipper  the window openings attach at the bottom so they can be opened a little across the top for light venting or opened fully and tucked into the bottom for a   sided cross breeze      
425,4.0,                       set this up expecting to use   military style cots inside   nope  if i had set up the  nd cot  there would have been zero floor space to walk into the tent  it is nice and waterproof  though  rained all evening and night  and nary a drop of water inside the tent  setup and take down were both super easy   instant cabin  is right      
426,4.0,                       i ve used my coleman instant tent several times this season  i did apply seam sealer and sprayed it down with silicone before first use  it certainly is easy to put up and down  i like the squared shape  allowing for head room  it is plenty roomy for me and my stuff  and i think would accommodate   people easily  i also have the rainfly  sold separately for        outrageous in my opinion   it should be included  tent easily managed light rain on and off  the final trip was a downpour    days and   nights with constant heavy rain  with thunder and lightening and downpours  i truly thought i d be washed off the mountain   of those nights  the tent did not leak  by the  rd day however  it was very damp inside  the rain fly hugs the sides of the tent too closely  this does not allow for having the windows open for air circulation  more importantly  it hugs the door  which encourages run off onto the door  a redesign of the rainfly  that would include fixed style awnings over the windows and doors would be a terrific improvement      
427,5.0,                       the    minute setup time  might be an exaggeration    it s more like    seconds  this tent is seriously awesome  there are only two negative things i can say about it    it does not come with a rain fly    when it s packed away  it s still huge but honestly  if you re car camping with the family  who wants to camp in the rain anyways  also  you probably are going to have a ton of other stuff taking up room in your prius anyways  so the large dimensions don t really matter that much i really like all the venting and the interior height  i m      and i can stand up fully inside the tent  it s a super nice feature that i ve never experienced before  normally i have to bend over at the waist and fall directly onto my face while i change into my pj s at the campground  never again  i hope this was helpful to all you glampers  like my wife and i  out there      
428,3.0,                       so this tent isn t so accurate i bought the tent for   people because it was just my   kids my husband and me well we didn t fit we were super tight inside the tent   we used this tent to camp in the desert and during the cool night the tent built moisture inside all around to the point that it seemed like it was raining my husband had to dry dry it down   it is very easy to set up and take down which we liked about the tent    i will probably have to purchase a bigger tent for   which sucks     
429,4.0,                       ok so this instand up tent is truly  instantly up  in less than a minute the problem is getting it packed back up   due to the frame being attached to the tent  it doesn t fold in the traditional sense   you have to more or less roll it up and  stuff  it back in the bag  which i warn you is about   times as big as a normal tent and yes   that causes wrinkles   i have yet to use the tent so i will save the rest of my review until afterwards  but i want to let people know that this tent s stored state is very large   otherwise  very pleased so far update   used the tent two or three times and i am completely satisfied and somewhat impressed with this tent   this past weekend rain started at around  pm  rained all night with no breaks whatsoever and into the next day until   am when we took it down   i did not notice a drop of leaking anywhere  during    hours of constant rainfall   i do have the optional rainfly   granted there was no wind and the rain was  moderate   but for the price and size of this tent it did great   the only complaint i have is the severe condensation  due to the tent s waterproof  non breathable fabric and wet conditions  with all this taken into account  i do not like the way it packs up   you more or less just wad it up and cram it into the bag   it just doesn t sit well with me   i believe i m going to sell it and get a tent i can fold up neatly and store in a more civil manner   if the sloppy storage and weight does not bother you  this is a great tent      
430,5.0,                       just used for the first time and just our luck  it rained  it did really well though and we stayed dry inside  super easy to set up and take down  especially in comparison of taking down the five joy instant tent  highly recommend  this video shows it lightly raining but it got a lot worse and took it like a champ      
431,2.0,                       love set up  very easy set up   i have waterproofed this item myself and will follow up with a later review   all seams leaked and floor gathered over      of water first time out this year  all was set up properly   it rained for about     hours to get the tent to fail the waterproofing test  the coleman video shows almost no leakage in the test   i felt duped   try again coleman   i swear by this brand  this may have me shopping elsewhere now  we shall see        
432,5.0,                       great tent  not sure why it took me so long to buy an easy assemble i camped near a river  and in the morning there would be lots of dew on the tent  and some of the water would seep through  i wouldn t trust this in the rain without a rain cover  for some reason not included  overall extremely happy with my purchase      
433,1.0,                       i would not recommend this tent to nobody  i assembly the tent and noticed the flooring had at least   small holes from the factory  it looked like a defect in the manufacturing process  it assembled quickly as describe but the craftsmanship was lacking it look as if was pieced together with fabric tape  i done some research and it turns out that its all over the internet about the defected tents the same faults as mine  i ended up getting a refund and purchasing a different tent made by a different company      
434,4.0,                       i live in  tornado alley  in the midwest  kansas city area  if you don t know  we get some of the worst possible thunderstorms here that you could possibly imagine      mph winds  torrential downpours  low and very loud thunder and lightening  it feels like the roof of your house is going to blow off  as it creaks and moans the entire night during the storm we had one of these storms this past weekend  and i was camping in it with two of my little girls  and of course  i had my coleman instant tent on it s maiden voyage  i knew we d have bad weather  so i set a heavy duty tarp under the tent  partially to keep the water away from the tent  but also to protect the tent floor from wear  it was a typical hot and sticky midwest summer evening  then about   am  the winds came howling in at gale forces of    mph  according to the weather service   followed by extremely loud and heavy rain and thunder  the wind was blowing so crazily that it was hitting the tent from every different direction  not one square inch of the tent exterior had any chance of staying dry  the rain and thunder continued for the next   or so hours with continued moments of very heavy rain and winds i am very pleased to say that we stayed totally dry and the tent incurred no damage from the storm  the also brand new tent  of a different coleman model  of my friend who was next to us caved in on him and his kids at some point during the night  although he did stay dry   this instant tent turned out to be a great investment pros   easy setup    almost too easy       this tent weathers the storm    remember  there is no fly on this tent  which is a great convenience for setup  but coleman makes up for it with it s great seams and stronger material on this tent    very spacious with lots of head room    strong  well stitched material    i like to take my tents home and put them up again so they will fully air dry before putting them away  the setup of this tent is so easy that it makes this very convenient    it s much harder to lose parts on a tent that is already put together cons   i ve been involved in the boy scout program for decades and i ve used my share of tents  this tent is sturdy  however  i can see how certain facets of the construction might not last through heavy regular use  for example the extension of the poles causes some wear on the painted surface which could cause rust  certain critical parts of the poles and pop up mechanism are plastic which i could see being points of failure after usage in several heavy storms or really cold weather  i can even see kids not caring for the mechanism as they should during setup and take down  however  don t let this deter you from this tent  the tent needs to be made of lighter parts in order to provide the convenience that makes this tent attractive  however  if you are planning on using this as your primary tent and or use it quite often  keep this in mind  in my particular case  i have several tents  but wanted one that was spacious and easy to setup for quick overnight trips    this tent is perfect    the bag that holds this thing is huge  i figure it s about twice the size  lengthwise  of a regular equivalent sized tent  this is expected because of the heavier material and the way the poles need to be constructed for the pop up mechanism to work  this isn t a terrible thing  just don t expect it to be a small bag i would buy this tent again      
435,5.0,                       we bought the   person tent for car camping and really wanted something that was easy to setup and take down  and would have plenty of room for our queen size air mattress  this tent really is extremely easy to use  it rained a little bit on our first day camping and we didn t have any issues with leaking just a bit humid inside the tent  make sure to buy the rain fly sold separately  we read from another reviewer that it helps to keep the windows partly open when rolling it up to let the air out  this tip worked really well and it probably took less than   minutes to take it down and have it in the bag      
436,1.0,                    compre la carpa porque supuestamente era resistente a la lluvia  anoche dormimos en la carpa  empez  a llover y el agua empez  a entrar por todos lados  totalmente insatisfecho con este producto  no entiendo como una marca como coleman dice que es resiente al agua y no es verdad         
437,4.0,                       we love the tent and the darkening light blocking feature  so great with all of our kids   lots of space  we fit   twins size mattresses with room to spare the only negative is the door drops quite a bit  like a     inch gap when using the hinge feature  currently waiting for a replacement to be delivered so hopefully the next one has a functional door because we really do love this tent and are excited to take it camping this summer      
438,4.0,                       set up  seriously easy to set up   i am a five foot tall woman and the tent is taller than me   i bought this tent after watching a few youtube videos showing the set up and take down   i could seriously set this up with my eyes closed having done it just once take down  it takes longer to get this tent into its carry bag than it does to set it up or take it down   to be honest  i failed on my first attempt at rolling this into its bag   currently the tent is in my car half in and half out of its carrying bag quality   i like the overall quality but am concerned a little that the zippers around the windows netting may tear   the zippers are solid and maybe more so than the plastic netting that they are sewed into   this is my one concern   some of the zippers are sticking too so i might spray them with a little spray oil storage bag   i think coleman needs to give us a break and create a bag that balloons a bit and makes it easier to pack   while i appreciate a bag  i m considering finding or sewing another that will make it easier for me to pack the tent into      
439,2.0,                       like everyone else has been saying  if you want to stay dry this is not the tent for you  we had it in michigan for a week and if you re going somewhere wet don t even both with this one  leaks from every seam and whoever designed the two top vents at the bottom should be fired  waste of money and will never use in the midwest again      
440,1.0,                       ok tent came in today  no visible damage on shipping package  set it up and it is the size i wanted and style  sets up super fast  did not like that it came with the supporting tent pole unattached and i had to repair  also the bottom of the tent had several small holes in it  i attached a photo so everyone could see  i have already seam sealed it and have a camping trip tomorrow so i can t return  very disappointed as this tent otherwise seemed to be a great deal  make sure you check this tent completely before you prep it for a trip     
441,1.0,                       use on sunny days only or be prepared to bail it out    needs to be waterproofed by you before using  nothing like waking up at   am with rain water dripping down on your face to start the day off rightvery easy to set up     
442,1.0,                       this tent does set up easily  can be done by i ve person  but it s a little on the heavy side for one person to move around  i can stand in this tent at        so it s good height for me  the two big downfalls are to zippers are really a struggle and it leaks even with the lightest rainfall  all down the seems and around all the zippers  very disappointing      
443,5.0,                       i was hesitant to buy an instant cabin because i ve been to a few camping events where other people s quick up tents have been destroyed by high winds  still  i really needed a smaller tent that i could put up by myself and since i trust the coleman brand  i decided to take the risk  sure enough  on my first camping trip  there was a serious wind storm  this little tent had no trouble with the wind whatsoever  it s incredibly hardy  i also noticed that all the seams are thoroughly sealed  impressive  i bet it would ve done great in rain  too      
444,2.0,                       love the style of this tent and the size    the instant tent feature is exceptional   literally    seconds is no joke  i love all that it offers   all except the feature we have all been waiting for   a truly weather proof material  a product that doesn t claim something it can t substantiate  leaks leaks leaks i have owned dozens of tents for the past    years of camping and backpacking and they all have ultimately succumbed to leaks  this tent is no different  in fact it rained the first   times we took it out and it leaked all three times   drips from the roof  more drips from the sewn inside pockets  and completely wet side walls  all night  the floor material was dry   the most disappointing part is that coleman s customer service didn t help at all  they just gave me the blow off  no explanations  no help  just gave me the big run around  i use to trust this company  bought many products from them    probably not so many any more      
445,1.0,                       i was so excited to finally use my tent for the first time until it started pouring at  am andeverything in my tent was soaked  i had such a bad experience  what a shame     
446,5.0,                       this goes up so easy  we finally had to give up on our    year old tent that we loved  and decided we would get something easier to set up  this definitely fits the bill   we did buy the fly separately  we would recommend that  but it s still a great price   the six people it says it s for would need to be children   but it s the same size as our old tent    gives us plenty of room for two adults and gear   and could put in two kids also   snuggly      
447,5.0,                       the easiest set up  even break down  even before we realized you can expand the bag   oops   used in cold  rainy  normal camping trips and it s great  did a lot of research  my partner did  and this won out and worth it       bought the rain cover with it and the set is awesome the only con we ve come across is there s no tie down anchor for the sides   we just put totes or bags to  weigh down  the sides      
448,5.0,                       this tent is amazingly easy to set up  it s so spacious we could fit a queen size mattress  all our gear including the cooler and extra jeep parts  a chair  and still had room for more if we wanted it  my boyfriend and i set it up in less than   minutes  i timed it  in the dark the first time  we have only taken it camping in nice weather  but it was plenty warm during late september and even when covered in dew it did not leak as an extra precaution we did use tent sealant on all of the seams  it only cost about    and i feel it was worth it overall this is a great tent for people who want to  car camp  and spend more time out in nature than setting up camp  this tent sets up faster and sturdier than my old   person dome tent  well worth the money     
449,3.0,                       i actually really like this tent and considered just replacing it but decided to try something new  we camped   weekends in a row  the first two i never even closed the front zipper because it was hot out  this last weekend it was raining and chilly so we closed the door and the zipper immediately came off at the end of the track  after hours trying to put it back on we gave up and just clipped it closed with some pins that we had  set up and take down though are crazy easy  i had it up within a minute or   and aside from stuffing it in the bag take down is super easy      
450,3.0,                       so i got the tent  the box was opened and all ripped up   i am thinking its okay since its brand new  took it to camping  it was a wreck   mini holes all over the tent  zipper was suck and broken  the zipper wasnt attached at some section   what am i going to     i am already at my campground    then in the morning the top of the tent was all wet and even dripping   my goodness  what a horrible experience with this tent and at the end couldnt even manage to get it into the bag    what a shame  only thing good about this is  set up the tent under a minute       
451,5.0,                       reasonably priced  much easier to put up than i thought and very spacious  i m a senior and had no problem putting this up by myself  i watched a video on youtube first  then it was simple  i put a queen sized mattress in the tent and there was still lots of room  nice breeze from the windows  and easy to zip up later  i love it      
452,2.0,                       easy setup as stated  but we did not realize until the end of our second week camping that three     inside corners had duct tape on the floor    i thought we had purchased a new tent   two outer sides have no tie down cords  see photos    and finally  the rain fly is an extra purchase   you stay      dryer with a regular tarp that can will   a  be cheaper   b  provide overall excellent covering and  c  offer total protection when weather goes damp on you      
453,5.0,                       i haven t camped in at least    years and had a husband to set up the tent back then   i m now in my mid    s and a solo camper with little to no patience for putting things together   i was very skeptical when i saw the reviews about how easy this tent is to set up  on a leap of faith i took it on my first camping trip  arriving just before dusk hours away from home  and with a backup plan of sleeping in the car   i was amazed that it took less than   minutes to get it out of the carrying bag  read the instructions and put it up   taking it down was just as easy  getting it back into the sack was the hardest part  but still less than a    minute task all totaled from take down to zip up i agree with the other reviewers that you would need to be very chummy with the   other people you share this tent with  and you d all have to be pretty skinny  i m average size with      pound dogs and it felt just right with all the stuff i want to keep inside the tent  bag of clothing  lantern  radio  etc   it s rooming enough to stand in and has   pockets to keep your ipod  bottled water for easy reach   the zippered windows are great to allow air circulation   i didn t have a problem that there was no way to tie down the flaps  like other reviewers i just tucked them in the window  sill  if you re looking for a basic roomy tent that s super easy to set up and take down  i highly recommend this one      
454,4.0,                       i set up this tent the moment i received it because i knew it was going to rain that weekend  it took me about   min to do it by myself  i think i can get it done a bit quicker next time  the tent is big my family     has plenty of space    people will fit but it might be crowded the material is water resistant  not water proof  it rained hard for about    min and water did go in  a few drops toward the edges of the floor  not at the center of the tent   i might not have done the best job setting the tent  i probably need to stretch the the a bit better  when it rained  water accumulated at the bottom of the sides where the tent was wrinkled and s few drop came in i wish that wasn t the case but other than that i have no issues with it  i m happy with my purchase updatethe tent is heavy    i went  camping where i had to walk    min up and down zand dunes to get to the campsite    and its no fun to  carry  its    pounds  plus i had to carry camera gear and other stuff  if you only carry the tent it may not be thag bad but consider howfar you need to walk  if you camp close to your  car its perfect      
455,5.0,                       taken this tent out in the summer  pouring rain in the fall and ensured some pretty high winds  only a little water infiltration around the door during some intense rain storms  but held up fine for me   just as advertised  this tent is up literally less than a minute after taking it out of the bag  this is its most desirable attribute to this old man camper      
456,5.0,                       looked at the coleman and ozark trails   person instant tents   decided to go with the coleman   the poles were thicker and the tent fabric was twice as thick   coleman says the tent is water proofed and no rainfly is needed  after reading reviews i decided to get the rainfly   set the tent up in the garage before our camping trip and was amazed at how fast and easy it goes up  i put seam sealer on all seams of the tent and rainfly then water proofed them both as well   any time you sew two pieces of cloth together with a needle there will be small holes and the seam sealer takes care of that issue   i do not trust the factory workers in china to water proof the tent as well as i would   all the extra effort paid off on our trip as it rained one night and we were dry as a bone   the tent will sleep   people comfortably and   if you like each other   we put   king sized cots in the tent and had enough room to stand up walk in the center of them   there is plenty of head room all around   i m      and had no issues  the windows are large and let in lots of air and there are   vents in the top to let hot air out and cool air in when the windows are closed   very nice feature this is a great tent and i would recommend it to anyone      
457,4.0,                       had a good soaking rain with some leaks around the bottom seams where the floor connects to the walls   i sprayed some water guard around the seams   that worked   quick and easy to put up   sturdy   plenty of windows  could use a slit for an electric cable   the tent storage bag is wide enough  but it could be a little longer   doesn t come with a rain fly   because the bottom angles out from the top  water will come in when you open the door in the rain   you will want to get something for that  but not the rain fly coleman makes for this tent   it just covers the top of the tent   overall  i like it      
458,5.0,                       i purchased this tent about two weeks ago and went on a boy scout camping trip with my son s troop this weekend   we arrived at our location about      pm   it was pitch black  i never read the instructions  and just like the you tube videos  had this erect within less than a minute   i was absolutely delighted with it   having read previous reviews  i did purchase the rain fly   we had some significant wind gusts reaching    mph the second night of camping and the rain fly partially blew off    my fault for not staking it down  not an equipment issue    i also learned that when taking the tent down  it is important to unzip the door to a significant degree  so that the air can be pushed out of it   it took me       minutes to break it down with the wind blowing  as i struggled to get the air pushed out of it   i was able to easily roll it up and get it back into the bag   we had a few sprinkles but no significant rain over the weekend  so comments on that will have to wait for the future   overall  this was the best initial experience with a tent i have ever had   the overall ease to put up and take down was phenomenal   while this is described as a   person tent  if your using cots  you could comfortably fit three in here      
459,5.0,                       this is the best tent ever  my husband and i are both blind and still managed to have it set up in less than   minutes straight out of the box without looking at the directions  it s really that easy when we went camping  we had sustained winds of    to    mph with gusts to    and the tent held up beautifully  we had light rain and the inside stayed nice and dry the big windows made for an awesome breeze the only negative thing i have to say is that the zipper on the carrying bag broke after one use  for such a sturdy tent  you d think they would craft the zippers on the bags better  i m going to contact coleman about a replacement     update     i contacted coleman shortly after writing this review  customer service was friendly and very helpful  they shipped us a new carrying bag that was nicer than the one that came with the tent  unfortunately  they don t sell them or we d buy a couple of others for the rest of our coleman stuff  i just wanted to provide this update to reflect the      positive experience we had with coleman customer service i plan to recommend this tent to all our friends everyone in our group was awed by how cool our tent was  if you want to be the envy of your fellow campers  or if you just like to have an easy set up experience  you definitely want this tent      
460,1.0,                       used this tent twice   first time i camped in it  it was beautiful weather  and other than some difficulty getting the tent back in its carrying case  i was more than happy   second time i camped in it  it rained both outside and inside the tent   basically every seam leaked water   not just the usual  wicking  problem of water seeping through porous tent material  this was big fat drops coming through visible pinholes in the seams   i don t know if someone on the assembly line had too much coffee that day and i just got unlucky  or if it s a problem for all tents of this model and they re just hoping your warranty runs out before you us it in the rain  but after writing to the company and receiving exactly zero reply  my lifetime of using and swearing by coleman products is at an end      
461,1.0,                       tent leaked  a lot  on the  st use   i even had the extra coleman rain fly installed  which it shouldn t have even needed as the tent is supposed to be waterproof without it   it was a medium rain and it leaked all night through the sides   when i reached out to coleman customer support for assistance  they never got back to me other than to send me a survey to see how i liked my customer service       this company has gone downhill in the past few years   they used to make quality products and have excellent customer service   look to another vendor for a tent unless you like a wet bottom tent experince      
462,5.0,                       i purchased the   person tent for my son and i to use for boy scout campouts  it is the perfect size for two cots along the walls and a small walk space between them  the only way you will sleep four in this tent is to sleep side by side on the floor  i m done with sleeping on the ground  so we went with the four person tent  the zippered sides fold down on three sides allowing good air flow through the tent on warm nights  we live and camp in texas  so i don t know about cold weather camping in this tent  i will say to check the measurements of your cot as mine is   feet long and just fits inside the tent  touching both ends  the quality of materials and construction is what you would expect from coleman  it seems to be pretty well put together and sturdy  you can put this tent up and take it down by yourself in the dark in a minute  it does not include the rainfly  so i bought one  you really don t need it though unless you are camping in a hurricane  the tent itself is pretty waterproof      
463,5.0,                       i love this tent   it was cheap   it s insanely easy to put up  even when doing it solo   it comes with stakes and guylines   side windows    windows on the front   hanging plastic ring from the roof inside to hang a light   it s listed as a   person tent and i guess you could put   people in there as long as you were awfully friendly with each other because it will be super tight inside   easily holds a queen bed airbed great buy      
464,5.0,                       we got this tent after not having one for    years  it was super easy to set up and once you figure it out the first time the next times after are a snap  very roomy and tall  my son is     and can stand up straight inside  it was plenty big enough for   adult sized people with room to spare for bags and what not      
465,5.0,                       we bought this tent for a recent week long  family camping trip i hadn t been camping in years  and i d never used any of the  instant  tents or pavilions i was amazed  with the help of one other person  i had this tent up in just a minute or two we used the optional rainfly      coleman   person instant tent rainfly accessory                        to keep us dry we pack heavy  so even though this tent says it s good for six people  we used it for two people  it had plenty of room for our air mattress      coleman company supportrest double high airbed   queen green                        plus backpacks  gear  etc it s a well put together tent      
466,5.0,                       nothing worse than starting off a camping trip all sweaty and frustrated from setting up the gear   this tent fixes that problem and others   if i m being honest  this tent would barely fit   adults and   children  and it won t set up  instantly  or in   minutes like the description says   but with all that being said  i love this tent   by myself and taking my sweet time it takes about   minutes to set up   i ve set up a queen size air mattress in it with room to spare  the zipper for the door is a little tighter than i d like  it takes both hands to really zip up  but other than that  its perfect      
467,5.0,                       this is a great tent  truly simple to put together  i am tall so i think that helps   so cozy and comfortable  it doesn t come with the rain fly though  i bought that separately  if you are a star gazer it s not the best for visibility  the roof is opaque and you can t see through it  there are beautiful huge windows though  great for car camping but too bulky and heavy for backpacking      
468,4.0,                       i like the tent  it works well   you don t need a rain fly  it will keep the water out if you zip it all up  but if you re going somewhere rainy  get the rain fly   if it does rain  and you don t have it  you have to have all of the windows closed and that can be very stuffy in the rain it opens up in less than a minute   it s very easy to pop it out   it s very roomy inside   the walls are fairly vertical so you get to use a lot of vertical space inside   it says this is   person   everyone knows these numbers are optimistic  but it s really very comfortable for two on a queen size air bed   i d do three in a pinch  but this is a couple s tent  i m      and can stand tall inside  as tall as that is   airflow is good with the windows open and it keeps the bugs out pretty well   the hook in the ceiling for the light is a nice touch there aren t a lot of trade offs to the instant tent design   i set it up after dark and it wasn t a problem at all   i find it really difficult to get the thing to retract enough to fit inside the included pouch   i don t know if it will ever fit in there again   i just wrap some bungees around it and transport it without the cover and it works fine   i m not patient enough to sit there and manipulate it to get it into the bag      
469,5.0,                       ok  i m not gonna lie  i was skeptical about how quickly the tent advertises it s set up time  but  seeing is believing  i am single and know all my guy friends get sick of helping me set up tents on camp trips  spending thirty minutes or so to get set up and then the    minute tear down  when i brought this tent camping everyone was happy about too  it literally took    seconds to set up  i haven t done this alone yet but i know i can if i have too  love love love this tent  there was plenty of room for my oversized queen air mattress and ventilation is great  being      tall  i barely had to duck getting in and once inside i could stand straight up  made for the best camping trip ever       
470,2.0,                       took this tent out a couple of weeks ago and was excited for a weekend of camping and canoeing  i ve owned another coleman insta tent and loved its roominess and ease of set up  when setting up this new tent  we discovered that   of the upper extension arms were installed upside down as compared to the others that pulled out easily and locked into the thumb tabs  the   that were installed incorrectly were extremely difficult to pull out  never extending to their full length  leaving the tent lopsided   tried removing screws to correct  but couldn t slide the bars out  when taking the tent down  we could not push the faulty arms back in fully  so it wouldn t fit into the carry case  kind of ruined our weekend  but at least the rain fly kept us dry      
471,3.0,                       this tent does leak  mine didnt leak too bad but it was enough for there to be wet spots  the main points where the tent leaked are the for corners at the base of the tent  additionally there are pouches on the inside of the tent to hold small things  the stitching by these areas leaked water too  whatever is put in the pouch will get wet  other than that  setting up the tent was really easy  it took me a few minutes and was finished in time to watch everyone else struggle with their tents  this tent also holds up great to strong winds  i watched other peoples tents collapse that were more pricey and this one held up just fine      
472,4.0,                       we bought this for swim meets  backyard campouts  and camping trips where there s only     of us and do not need to use our    man tent   as most everyone knows     person  means six  people  only in the most academic sense  because you are not going to fit   full grown adults in this tent   but when it was my wife and just one of our boys  we had plenty of room for   queen size air mattress   single air mattress  plus a couple good size gear bags setup of this tent is extremely simple   i ve done it myself in about     minutes  but with two people you can get it done in well under   minutes it would have been nice if  besides the small storage pockets on the inside  they had included   or   larger pockets the     times we ve used this have all been in mild weather  so i can t speak to its effectiveness in wind rain  nor to how well air moves through it on a very warm night   my gut tells me ventilation might not be so great  but just a hunch and cannot say with      certainty i don t think i would rely on this to be my  hardcore  tent to rely on in all conditions  but for what our intended purposes are  overall i am very pleased that we got this tent      
473,4.0,                       we loved the ease of this tent for camping on the beach  it withheld the mist from the ocean fantastically and is just big enough for a queen size blow up bed with room for other luggqge around the sides   it wasn t exactly  instant  but very very fast setup it did get a small tear around the bottom but easilly stiched with a needle and thread  some wear and tear is to be expected when teenage boys are the ones using the tent      
474,1.0,                       although it s easy to assemble as far as getting it up it is not easy getting it back down and fold it up properly and back in the bag  i finally use it for the first time and it rained the second night camping and it leaks on both sides of the tent where the inside pockets are and seeing as how the tent comes with no rain fly there is no way to stop it  severely unhappy with this tent the most unhappy i ve been with any tent i ve ever owned was not worth the money     
475,5.0,                       i loved it  we took it camping and put it to the test  i didn t open it till we went camping  i wanted to see if it was truly easy up  i was very happy  it took a second to read the steps and click click click it went right up  plenty of room  and it looked very nice  i look forward to using this tent for many years to come      
476,1.0,                       truly set up in    seconds   only lasted   months   my grandson is very disappointed the entrance flap zipper has failed after the third setup so we are unable to close to make the tent insect and waterproof   i was very happy with the purchase until the zipper failed and will have to discard it      
477,4.0,                       setup was easy   have not used yet will update  update   used over a raining weekend   leaked rain water and build up moisture inside tent before sleeping in tent  i haven t purchased the rain fly yet but after this test i will need to   also going to seam seal the whole text   i will update after the next rain   the door is a pain to zip up and getting back in the bag it a chore   tent is roomy and could fit two cots and still have plenty of room   update  purchased rain fly rained for most of the weekend and no water in tent   i did find damage to tent fabric near padded elbows will need to repair   still happy with purchase and so is the wife and that what really matters      
478,5.0,                       perfect size   assembled or collapsed   huge   but tiny in the trunk of a tiny car  it just plain fits so sturdy   so well designed    real value     
479,1.0,                       if i could give this colman weather tech tent a   i would i even bought     worth of camp dry and the stupid tent still leaked  even though it was on sale it was a waste of money  too bad i didn t know before our only vacation this year  colorado weather     it rained   day  was ruined by a leaking tent  all this after this  st tent we received was broken  with the replacement barely making it before we we leaving  super disappointed      
480,2.0,                       i returned the   person coleman  black  made of very good quality  for the   person coleman  black  what i received  is a blue white   person coleman  however the quality between the   tents is amazing  the   person coleman is not made of the same material  this is cheaper looking and also to the feel   i don t know what happen with the color or quality of this tent  i do see they had   different sellars     i m not returning cause that has gotten old as well  very disappointed in this purchase kind regardsfaye wilson     
481,5.0,                       i bought this tent for burning man  so far  four trips to the playa  and it s going again this year  i was really concerned at first that it would collapse in the wind  but no issues  i just make sure to stake it down really well with lots of playa staples      rebar staples  and extra parachute cord  i also bought the rainfly for it  and i stake that down really well  too  this tent goes up super easy and has lots of room for one person and ten days of gear and supplies  i m really happy with it      
482,2.0,                       i guess i shouldn t have folded it up on asphalt  but i didn t expect a hole to tear into the floor so easily   this thing is great for quick assembly  but is huge and is bit of a pain to pack in back in the bag  you also get directly lying on it to get the air out when you re trying to compress it before putting it in the bag      
483,5.0,                       great size tent  if you are going to buy a tent i highly recommend any of the instant tents  the only thing i wish for all the coleman products  is that they would have more loops in the ceiling   this one has one for a lantern  but i would like one in the upper corners as well  this tent has   sleeves to put items in  poles seem sturdy and it has the bathtub floor like it should  i have not had it in the rain yet  of all the tents  this is the perfect size and quality for what we were looking for      
484,1.0,                       this tent is huge   i mean heavy  and bulky  i was excited when i saw the video how it was weather proof this thing left my stuff drenched the first night   i am not happy at all  if the company is willing to issue a refund i will change my review  until then  thanks alot coleman      
485,5.0,                       this worked great for my   teenagers who practically lived inside of it while we were camping   we used a queen size air mattress which took up most of the tent but kept them high up off the ground  comfy and dry when in rained for a couple days      
486,5.0,                       my wife and i set this up for the first time in less than one minute and all we did was read the   step instruction tab on the top of the frame   it has everything we were looking for from room  more economy of space than a true dome tent  and ventilation  even has a roof vent covered by pop up rain fly  to quality of construction  poles are seriously strong and have lots of tie down points being on the exterior  so high wind is not an issue   i added two coleman cots and a battery lantern  which hangs from an o ring at top of tent   so i m as comfortable as i could be in a cabin   the weight makes this tent a great one for a short haul to the campsite  the purpose for which i bought it   but you aren t going to want to hike it in too far      
487,5.0,                       how do i rate an instant up tent  well  this one i rated by how fast it went up and how long it took me to actually get it back in the bag and close it  when have you ever been able to do that with a tent      as advertised     seconds up and  amazingly  i got it completely back into the bag and closed the bag in less than five minutes  wow     should have gotten one of these before  haven t had it in the rain yet but the seaming looks good enough that it shouldn t leak much on you even without the rain fly  which i also recommend  just in case you camp in the rain      
488,5.0,                       i love this tent  after my friend let me borrow her smaller version of it  i decided i needed to get my own  i went for the bigger version and i m glad i did  and now she wants to upgrade after seeing mine  they re both awesome but i love this one because i can stand up in it with a lot of head room to spare  i m        this really makes a difference when getting dressed  making the bed  really doing whatever  it fits my queen blowup mattress and then there s still half the tent of floor space and space left in front of the mattress too  very luxurious and roomy for   people  it would be decent for   people  i wouldn t attempt     yeah it would be physically possible but let s face it if you are buying this tent then you are probably into comfort and convenience and that would be cramped it is as easy and instant as it claims  it practically launches itself up  not kidding  i have put it up and taken it down on   camping trips now with my boyfriend watching me and drinking a beer  not lifting a finger  don t worry  i put him to work on other stuff   and i m proud i can do this by myself and i love showing off how easy it is  people are impressed and a few friends now want to buy their own  no more stupid poles    can you put it up in a minute  yes  can you take it down in a minute  yes  can you get the thing back in the damn bag in a minute  no  that part kind of sucks   there are   instructions on the bag tent about how to put the thing up but none about taking it down  but i have learned how to fold it back up again  much like you d fold up a tripod and its legs  and then roll the tent part tightly around it  then stuff the legs in the bag first  zip up partially and stuff the tent material into the bag and inch up the zipper while you keep doing that  takes me about   minutes on my own now that i have a good method  but it would be faster   easier with another set of hands to get it in the bag  it was really frustrating the first time as you might expect it s big in the bag  not something i d ever consider backpacking with or lugging more than   or    minutes  but for my purposes and festival camping  it s awesome  no extra parts  no rainfly to keep track of   it has a clever system for that built in  the tent stakes are your typical flimsy kind  so if you need to stake down your tent for real then invest in something better all that said  it s still a solid   stars for me  it does what it claims  it s nice quality  and i love how easy it is to do by myself      
489,4.0,                       i haven t been camping since i was a boy   i bought this tent for my family s first camping trip   my sweetheart and i kicked our daughters out and into their own little tent  so the size was more than enough for the two of us   i do think that   people could sleep in the tent  as long as they are good buddies and not restless sleepers   super easy to set up and tear down   of course i couldn t fold it up exactly like it was new  but it still fit in the bag   as other reviews have noted  the included stakes are cheap   buy some good stakes   it was fairly windy the day we went camping  and we were on a soft  sandy area   the shorter included stakes would not have held the tent down   i did put large rocks on the stakes i purchased  ended up having no problems      
490,5.0,                       i love this tent  it gets five stars because it is exactly how described on the site  we looked up the you tube videos for it and thought ok maybe they are exaggerating  but no it really is that easy to put up and take down  we bring this tent with us to sturgis rally and it was the talk of the camp ground  goes up easy peasy  and has so much space inside  we had a raised full size air mattress in here along with a medium cooler  small trash can  small fan  and small bag of snacks and there was plenty of room to walk along side of the bed to door and to change in the tent it rained and got pretty windy a couple days this last year in sturgis and our tent had no issues at all  i was very impressed  at night it was nice to open the side windows and the wind would flow through and cool off the tent nicely  no bugs got through at all  and take down was very easy  no messing with poles  no risk in ever loosing any poles  i would highly recommend this tent to anyone who loves camping and loves it when your tent setup goes smoothly   love it       
491,5.0,                       been camping with this tent   long weekends   works very well   i have the optional rain fly and the tent stayed dry during a torrential downpour and stayed stable during    mph gusting wind i m       and  while i can t stand up fully  it s easy to get dressed while upright   very spacious inside as always  the number of people claimed is accurate so long as everyone is willing to be cozy   for   adults and   kids  i m sure it will work fine  so long as no one is known for rolling around in their sleep   a queen sized air mattress fits fine with a little floor space to spare   camping solo with a folding metal cot is a pleasure very cleverly designed   the   minute setup claim is pretty accurate  not including the  st attempt    the only caveat  and this is far from a  real  problem  is that it s easy to put your fingers in the wrong place  near the peak  while folding collapsing the tent   after being careless once  you ll remember seems pretty well made   i d recommend it to family and friends      
492,5.0,                       it is      and we still have this tent  we have camped everywhere in this tent and she is just now starting to leak  super easy to assemble even for kids  we are always done and relaxing as others fight with twnt poles during their setup  light weight and easy to put back into bag  we will definitely buy another one      
493,5.0,                       i don t know what to say  i am a skeptic     seconds to set up   ha  i say well   even taking tons of time to be gentle its first time   it only took about     minutes     having done it once  oh  yeah   it totally went back into the bag after about     minutes of breakdown    i know    seconds will be plenty of time to set up this awesome tent      
494,5.0,                       took this camping this weekend  and was duly impressed we arrived late at the camp site   as usual   it was dark   i had never opened the tent  but after viewing the videos on youtube  it looked easy   and was it ever easy   it took longer to find the stakes in the dark than to assemble the tent      seconds was about right for setting it up   inside  quite large   large enough for two full size cots and all our stuff   it would likely have held many more arranged tetris tm  like on the floor  but it was comfy for two   it was low    s and there was some condensation on the inside in the morning  but nothing unusual   there are vents on the ceiling that allow for airflow i haven t been through a rainstorm in the tent  but the seams look tight i love this tent      
495,4.0,                       i bought this tent for me and my partner   i use a double high queen air mattress when i camp  the mattress would not fit through the door  let alone fit inside the tent  this may be my own negligence for not looking up dimensions  but for people that like the double high air mattress   either get a bigger tent  or blow the mattress up inside the tent  also it is very short at the center height   i bought this name brand tent in a hurry because i had a spontaneous camp trip come up other wise   a fantastic tent  a dream to set up   a nightmare to fold up back into the carry bag      
496,5.0,                       we shopped around for a while before replacing our cabella s alaskan guide model     person tent  we loved it  but the zippers were failing and we wanted a smaller tent that would save space and weight in our jeep  we also liked the idea of an easy setup the coleman   person tent had just the right dimensions for the two of us  it fit our queen size air bed with plenty of room left to store our gear out of the weather the price was great it took about a minute for me to put it up the first time  that is really good  no more fumbling around in the dark assembling all the pieces two minor complaints   the bottom of the tent may not be the most durable material  we managed to poke a small hole in it  i think it hit a sharp stick during setup or taking it down  as we have only used it on a tarp   as with about all new tents  the stakes are not worth the trouble  get two packs of      coleman    inch steel tent stakes                       overall it is a great buy and we are pretty happy with it      
497,5.0,                       i love it i put a battery operated fan inside and the wife and i laid down and listen to the crickets and watch the north star    until we heard a coyote then it was time to go inside lol        
498,5.0,                       o k   i received my   man coleman insta tent today   i set it up and i really like it   i can stand straight up inside  i m       and the walls are pretty straight up compared to most tents  si the soace unsude us efficient   it sets up real easy and comes down real easy  but it is a real pain to roll up and put in the bag   i notice the bag is expandable  which is a very smart idea   plus  the bag in it s original size is adequate  unlike most other bags i ve had where you really have to fight to get the tent back in after the original escape the tent is a perfect size for just me or even me and one other for a quick night i didn t leave the tent up for the rain today  but i notice that the weak spots in terms of leakage for most tents are better designed on this tent   the bottom right side of the door  where the two zippers meet is usually a very bad spot   this tent has an outside flap covering the zipper that is at least twice as big as on my other tents   i also has an inside triangle cover in that corner that keeps the zippers outside the that flap  so water running down the zipper should be directed outside instead of inside   a slightly different  but similarly effective design is used at the edges of all the windows where the zippers pull down to   in other words  the water running down those zippers should be directed outside the tent walls the window also cuts below the level that the zippers pull down to  so that the window flap  which a number of people complained about becausee it doesn t tie up and thus is flapping all night in the wind  can be tucked in to avoid any flapping at     x     a     x    tarp fits perfectly under the tent for extra protection and to keep the tent clean   it s nice to have the bottom of the tent clean  so you don t have to clean it off before you pack it or when you get home by taking it back out and messing around that way   i keep the plastic bag the     x    tarp came in so a dirty tarp can be placed in it  trapping the dirt  and pulled out separately when you get home to clean   i already have that tarp in the tent bag   it fit easily i m real anxious to see if water siphons in through the tent walls when something is touching the wall   even if that happens  i can deal with it  since there is just enough space to do so   however  it would be sooo nice not to have to worry about that      
499,4.0,                       the tent was for   people but we are fluffy family there was   of us at the time and we still had room for one more  it s super easy to set and out put away   the only thing you do have to leave a small opening for it to breath due the body heat it build up  over all good so far      
500,5.0,                       this tent went up so fast  that everybody in the area watched as my   year old son put it up in less than   minutes   like any    man  tent in the world  i would never put   people into a tent this size but for my   year old son and i  it was perfect   my son and i had actually put it up in our living room a few days earlier and so i told our scoutmaster that my   year old was going to put this tent up by himself at the campout   although skeptical  everybody watched as an   year old boy put this tent up in less than   minutes   it was truly a thing of beauty   i would not want to carry this tent too far into a camp site but for anything up to a mile of carrying  it is perfect      
501,1.0,                       currently sitting in a wet tent after a   minute rain  third time using it  with the rainfly accessory attached  i even have an additional tarp on the bottom  the rain is coming in from the seams of the tent  where the tent connects to the bottom of the tent  water seeps in from every side  all my things are wet  the floor is flooded  what a piece of crap   i thought coleman was supposed to be a good brand   what a disappointment   will be returning asap       
502,5.0,                       wow  this tent is so easy to set up that my wife    who had never set up a tent before in her life    set it up entirely herself in   minutes while i was still unloading our gear from the car step    take out of bag  lay on ground  and unfold step    extend and raise poles step    stake it in the ground and you re done even better  this tent is extremely durable and comfortable  the material is strong and it feels like it will last for years  i bought the accessories kit which comes with better stakes  and the extra rainfly which does help a lot you can t go wrong with this tent  i am extremely pleased with this purchase  coleman has really outdone themselves here      
503,1.0,                       this product is not weather resistant   it sets up easy  which is a nice feature but the product does not come with a rain guard and is advertised as rain resistant    first day we went camping it rained  not a heavy downpour but steady rain and the tent leaked everywhere  top  sides   front  back   woke up completely soaked   had to run to a nearby store and buy a tarp to throw over the tent   luckily it rained on our first trip and i am within the the return period    if the seller sent a rain guard or a credit to purchase one then i would keep the tent      
504,5.0,                       we can fit two cots in here comfortably  and there is still room for our bags   the height is terrific  easy to stand up inside   i often camp alone and can easily put this tent up and take it down alone   the bag is actually large enough to put it back inside of after use  though i do bungie cord the tent before bagging just to make it easier we have our tent up and ready before anyone   it is truly as easy as advertised   i retyped their directions and put mine on top of the tent in the bag to remind myself each time what to do  though it truly is easy worth the money   i ll never buy any other type for car camping   too heavy and large for backpacking      
505,1.0,                       literally    hours out of the box and it leaked so bad three days out of a five day trip   ruined  because i spent all the time drying stuff out  weather tech     yeah right  how about weatherless tech   the windows are useless if it rains because there s no stopping the rain from the top coming in the top of the window  it gets unbearably steamy and moist zipped up in the rain  the ventalation flaps on the top do nothing luckily i had a    year old ozark trail rain fly to save the camping trip  coleman is not what it used to be  when a    year old ozark trail rainfly saves a brand new coleman well they ve begun manufacturing crap  i will never buy coleman products again  if you buy this get a rain fly     you ll need it it only rained for three hours and was moderate  if the video were true  this tent should have been fine  i can t say it enough do not buy this tent   you will regret it       
506,5.0,                       this tent is awesome  it goes up quick and easy and goes away almost as quickly  you do need to be careful the neoprene sleeves that cover the leg joints aren t obstructing the joints from clicking and locking into place this tent is roomy and so easy to set up i would highly recommend it      
507,5.0,                       i was extremely surprised how easy this was to set up  i will say i was a little disappointed in the size of it i was hoping it would be a little bit bigger  but if you re looking for a tent that you can set up in a couple minutes this is at just make sure you have another person to help you out just to make it a little easier      
508,5.0,                       love this tent so far  i did not buy the rainfly and instead decided to buy two cans of silicone waterproofing spray from wally world  the cans were about    each and i tried to saturate the outside  first two nights i used the tent  it poured all night long waking us up constantly  there was a lot of humidity obviously but no puddles in the tent and no water on the   of us  i was very impressed  plenty of room to stand up in too  setting up the tent after a rainy weekend so all the condensation can dry isn t a chore either which makes me more likely to do that my only complaint is that it s a really big bag  i know it s a car camping tent but it barely fits inside my little car  it has a designated spot because that s the only place it will go      
509,5.0,                       we just bought this tent and took it to new braunfels  tx for a memorial day weekend camping trip  you may have seen it on the news   we had torrential rain  flash floods in the area  high winds  it was a record breaking weekend for rainfall  that being said  we stayed completely dry inside this tent  we had an inch of water around the base of the tent and it never leaked through the floors  i had set up a coleman   x   instant canopy over the tent and we were able to open the windows for air circulation  i always set up a canopy over my tent for both shade and protection from rain but i ve never stayed this dry in a storm this bad  and yes  it really only takes about a minute to set up the tent  i swear   it s the perfect size tent for   people and a queen air mattress      
510,5.0,                       i am so disappointed in this product   used it for the first time and it rained and we ended up soaked   puddles all inside because of drips and had tears at the seams i passed my time to return it but will be contacting amazon to see if they can make it right somehow as i am out      and a tent i can use     
511,5.0,                       super quick setup  easiest tent i have ever set up  it is pretty waterproof  so much so that we built up quite a bit of moisture while   people slept  i thought it poured outside but it was just us  so be sure to open the vent flaps this is not something you can back pack with  i have another     person tent that s   times smaller  but it s not as sturdy or easy to use  this tent is great  but it s heavy and big  it s quite roomy and durable and fits   people comfortably not so confident on   be sure to purchase the rain fly if you purchase this tent      
512,4.0,                       it does keep the sun out and it was pretty easy to set up  but    putting it away is a different story  plan on folding a lot of the tent within the poles to get it back in the bag  it can be done  it just takes time  overall i was impressed with how easy and how little time it took to set up   also  the bag is ok  not too tight or hard to zip up after putting the tent in  i do wish it was a tad bigger   the tent is    lbs  to carry       
513,5.0,                       decided on the lazy way to set up the tent and i don t think i ll go back to setting up tents the traditional way  this was so easy to set up and take down  the hardest part is folding it to fit in the bag but after you figure out the science of that  you re good to go  i would recommend this to anyone who are like me  a bit less motivated to assemble all the pieces together      
514,5.0,                       we car camp  we have tried many tents and screenhouses over the years and i am now done experimenting  we originally bought the larger version of this tent and we still use it for longer camping trips when we have more  stuff   this one we use for shorter trips  up to   days   it s light  and my daughter and i can set it up in seconds   yes   seconds  it hold up well even though we are not easy on our equipment  we have had this thing in ice  rain and      degree heat and it is still in great shape  it hold two standard sized cots with lots of padding with room for one of those little folding tables in between to use as a night stand  for two people it is just perfect  you could fit   kids in it if they were sleeping on the floor  but i would get the bigger one if you want more than two adults to be comfortable  taking it down is almost as easy as putting it up  and it fits easily back into the bag  effortless camping  i highly recommend both this one and the larger version      
515,3.0,                       used this tent over this weekend  it was very easy to put up  took like    seconds  compared to the    seconds advertised  overall we are happy with it  but found some screen damage which is a bummer  see attached photos   friends have asked us about this tent as they were struggling setting up theres      
516,5.0,                       i had low hopes for this tent and bought it just so i wouldn t have to sleep in a car or outside on my hunting trip  this thing held up to torrential train for a day and a half until we decided to just pack it up and leave  kept me dry every moment i was in it  however  like any other tent   dew on the inside walls in the morning was to be expected because of temperature differences  would buy again for sure     
517,5.0,                       i love this tent  it s ridiculously easy to set up  nice and roomy  the floor could be more durable  but most tent floors aren t  stop struggling with tents you have to put poles together and feed through sleeves to set up  this tent is way better and easier to stand up in  has done great in strong winds and rain     
518,4.0,                       how awesome that you can set up a tent in such a short amount of time   it literally took minutes to set up and take down   super great considering we had a baby to manage as well   the tent stayed pretty warm and held up in the wind and cold temps when we went beach camping   the first night we noticed condensation inside the tent  not sure what happened  but it was fine the next night   has great ventilation   kind of silly the stakes had to be purchase separately but whatever   it s a good tent   folds up unbelievably fast   loved how easy it was      
519,4.0,                       loved the tent until it started raining    make sure to get the waterproofing products for the tent  i got rained out   should have got the waterproof protection that was offered with the tent  but overall enjoyed the tent     
520,3.0,                       the main reason i bought this tent as opposed to other similar ones was the manufacturer s claim that  by blocking     of sunlight coming into the tent  this technology lets you get some z s while the sun s still up   i m not someone who camps all that often  but i can tell you that any light blocking difference from a regular tent was minimal  if any at all  the sun had me up at      am and it was certainly not dark inside the tent by any means at that time  this was on a cloudy and rainy weekend  by the way besides that  the tent was good  it was very easy to put up  a friend and i got it up within   minutes  it was a bit more difficult taking it down and compacting it to get it back in the carrying case  on a positive note  there were no rain leaks  i did not buy the rain fly add on or modify the tent in any way with sealant or anything  the rain was moderately heavy but it did just fine      
521,5.0,                       set this tent up the same day it was delivered and it worked great  while it didn t take  one minute  to set it up  it was less than    and the instructions provided were easy to follow  everything was intact  worked great  and was as expected  didn t really get to weather test it   but we did buy the rain fly      
522,3.0,                       this tent is outrageously quick and easy to set up   i set it up by myself in under a minute with a baby strapped to me in a bjorn   it s strong fabric and rain resistant   we had a steady drizzle the first night and stayed dry despite forgetting to put up the rain fly   the complaints about being wet in the morning are probably just regular condensation that you get from any tent   the reason for the three stars is that the tent cannot handle even a little wind   it is the opposite of aerodynamic and even a slight breeze flaps the tent sides so hard it will wake you up and have you out at   in the  morning trying to stake it down even tighter than before   in fact  ours broke on the second weekend of use at the plastic hinges after being up on a moderately windy day   not sure if they ll warranty or repair it  but i will check back in to comment on the customer service once i hear back      
523,5.0,                       very easy to assemble  in my opinion  it fits an    inch high queen air mattress  max  the    inch one was too high to have inside it  had enough room to put our stuff down   nice zipper vents  for circulation   monsoon rained for about    minutes  no leaks      
524,5.0,                       wow  we really love this tent  it goes up so easily and is really sturdy  we can fit our double tall queen size air mattress in the tent and still have plenty of room for our bags and to move around  little tip  we cant actually fit the huge air mattress though the door once it was fully inflated  we had to let some air out then re inflate once it was in the tent  the only thing we would change is the instructions  it s pretty simple to figure out without instructions  however taking it down and putting it back in the sack took us maybe      minutes to figure out      
525,1.0,                       it s large and sets up quickly  but leaks   as soon as the rain started  it started dripping in from several places   i was able to move my pop up canopy over it after the wind died down which stopped most of the leaking  but did nothing for the puddles that had already collected inside in spite of the claims in the listing and on the packaging this tent is not weatherpoof and the seams were not sealed      
526,5.0,                       i go camping a lot and the tent i had also taken like    minutes to set up and i look at instant tents for a while  i am so happy i went with this buy because it took not joking       seconds to put it  super super simple to do  it was raining when i went and it did not leak  i woke up with a dry tent   no problems at all  highly recommend this      
527,5.0,                       this cabin is great  use it a lot of times in the heavy wind and rain and it holds just fine  it doesn t come with a cover for the top but you can buy one for cheap and it will keep you cool warm  its also not rated for   people  overall its sturdy ans gets the job done      
528,5.0,                       oh my gosh    i love this tent  no more bickering while setting up the tent  it stinks to start out your camping trip bickering about whether part a connects to part b or does part c insert into pocket z  this tent literally set up in   minutes and take down was just as quick  it also fit back into the bag on the first try and that never happens for us  it has all kinds of room  we had a queen size bed and me and my husband could walk around freely  we have been camping   times already since we received the tent and have had no problems at all      
529,3.0,                       awesome setup and teardown  very quick and easy   leaks just as bad as any cheap tent   i sprayed mine with scotchgard and it still leaks anywhere the fabric is touching anything inside the tent  the floor is the worst part   it s thin poly tarp and seeps in water   tent was pretty sturdy in     mph winds with supplied stakes      
530,4.0,                       my wife and i were looking for a easy to set up   season tent for car camping  this was the perfect solution  it sets up and tears down in a matter of minutes  we use two additional straps to keep the legs and tent together to make placing into the bag easier  we also use a tarp for a foot print to reduce moisture when we pack it  the ome tent pegs are crap  go to rei and buy some good ones of your choice for the tent base and support lines  you will need     we also did take the precaution of seam sealing all the of the seams to prevent leaks  with a little preparation this is an excellent tent for it s design seasons  this tent is not designed for harsh weather with gale force winds or hard winter down pours  we use a   season northface tent for hard winter camping  if you are looking for a good easy to set up car tent for summer  spring and light winter camping  you should be very happy  be sure to order the rainfly   i was somewhat annoyed that it wasn t included  the lack of rainfly and crappy tent pegs keep it from being a   star   then again what do you expect for under           
531,3.0,                       ok  this overall is a good tent but it leaked from the roof and walls during its first use  and it was not even a heavy rain   to solve this i will apply sprayed on waterproofing plus a small tarp over the top   should not have to do this on first use   the tent does go up very quickly  as advertised      
532,5.0,                       i have had this tent for   years and have used the tent maybe       times  we bought this tent as our  big  tent to fit our cots and allow for space to stand  the interior is spacious and my      husband can stand very comfortably and the two cots fit with plenty of extra room  the tent opens and closes very easily and can be done by one person  when packed up in the bag the tent is pretty heavy and still pretty big  but this is expected of this kind of tent  this isn t a tent you would want take if you had to hike to a camp site    the walls and floor are well constructed  the floor is a thicker grade heavier material   we have used this tent in the rain without much leakage  however  we were using cots  so i can t say how it might feel if you had to sleep on the floor of the tent  my only complaint is that the door flap  because it is large without interior support  is sometimes difficult to zip closed with one hand  you need two hands to hold it taut to line up the zippers       
533,1.0,                       well  at least this tent was easy to set up  but that s about all it has going for it  on our first night camping  it rained and we had water pooling in all the corners  at least     inches deep  raindrops actually dripped on our heads as we tried  unsuccessfully  to sleep through the night  miserable  oh  and this is not one of those tents that block out light  very confusing description on amazon that gave me the impression that it was  avoid      
534,1.0,                       this is the most horrible tent i have ever bought  i have two coleman tents that are real nice and one ozark trail that is wonderful  i read reviews and decided to go ahead with my order   don t do it    it is not easy to put up like it says   i had to u twist the poles so they would lock into place  poles bend very easily  took me about    minutes to figure this out     frame is not sturdy at all   i midaswell have bought a tent with poles not attached   it doesn t go back in bag easily either  coleman has failed on this one    ozark hasn t failed me yet  i would have returned this tent if time would allow  bought it for a camping trip in nov  purchased in aug      
535,3.0,                       the zipper makes me so angry  how can a tent so expensive have a zipper that gets stuck so much  otherwise the tent is fantastic     
536,5.0,                       i have used the tent one time and slept in it for four nights  i was amazed at how easily  and quickly  the tent went up   i like the window set up and i really like having a high enough ceiling to be able to stand up inside  the tent is pretty heavy when it is packed up  but weighs less than one of those pop up shade structures  i car camp so its weight was not an issue  i have only two minor  issues  with the tent     when taking it down  i found it impossible to get the darn thing back into its case  i wrestled  tucked  and wrangled until i settled on using a shoestring to tie the case  closed   however  a few days later  when i was putting all of the camping gear away  i was able to tuck all of the fabric in and zip the case shut  maybe there was air trapped in the tarp area  maybe i was overly tired and a tad hungover when i had to break down camp  that part will forever remain a mystery      the door zipper  i didn t reduce the star rating for this issue because i was camping in a bone dry  concrete like campsite  at a music festival  don t be jealous   so i was unable to use any tie downs  therefore  there wasn t any tension on the walls of the tent  i believe  and hope  that  were i able to get some tension on the walls that the door zipper would not have caught at the corner each time i went in  or out  of the tent once i use the tent again  i will update my rating based on my   errrr    the tent s    issues      
537,5.0,                       great product   goes up in seconds     
538,1.0,                       this tent is horribly constructed  we used this tent once  upon set up two of the straps that connect the tent to the pole ripped out  this causes the tent to be less taught and made two holes in the stitching of the tent   also  the attachment that the connects the top of the tent to the center mechanism broke  this caused the roof of the tent to sag  we used the tent for three nights  when we took the tent down and removed the tent pole that inserts in the door it split in half and is no longer usable  ordinary i am a fan of coleman tents  to say i am extremely dissatisfied is an understatement      
539,1.0,                       slept at beacon rock state park  here in southern washington two days ago  set up on a light grade   being skeptical of the waterproof claims  woke up to a      of water on the ground on the lower side of the tent  usually fullproof these issues with tarps ropes and even create water collection poolswith tarp   ehh  not happy  can t get refunded without a return  and i m homeless  quick set up is great if it s claims of water proof are true  especially setting up camp at   at night in the rain  to fully water proof this  i would have to spend quicker with my own strategies  to stay dry bummeddon t buy     
540,4.0,                       receive the tent and immediately set it up without reading instruction   i had seen the youtube videos of the tent and was going from memory   i was able to set up tent in less than two minutes and completely set up including staking the corners an guidelines in less than five minutes   take down was just as fast   we still haven t use it camping but i always seal the seams and waterproof the roof and sides each season   i have never had any  water leak seepage  problems ever since i started sealing tents at the beginning of each season   putting the tent back into carrying bag took some doing   i just kept rolling it until all the air was expelled and the tent was small enough to go into the bag   i am only giving this   stars because it did not come with a rain fly   less expensive tents come with a rain fly and this would have been a nice added feature on this tent   with a rain fly  they could have added a mesh roof to increase the ventilation and lessen the condensation issues that some tents have   condensation seems to be a universal issue no matter what you do on how to prevent it   despite all this  i would definitely reccomend this tent      
541,3.0,                       i bought this last summer  it s roomy for two kids and i with gear with space to spare   setup was quick and easy and believe me  you need to be quick so you can keep an eye on your kids  you can stand in this as you know so changing clothes is no problem i took it camping twice and it drizzled just a little late one night  that morning  i touched the inner walls of the tent and it was wet  don t know if the cold air caused it to collect and sweat on the inside like a cold glass of water but it surely was wet  it dried up as the sun came up so no harm no foul  i always bring some large trash bags with me anyway for trash and i guess now in case it leaks so i can throw my backpacks and stuff quickly in a trash bag to keep my clothes and stuff dry  i sleep on an air mattress so it should still be ok if the tent gets too soaked as far as the rainfly for this  i ll just buy a tarp that s bigger than the one coleman is selling for this tent  stakes are wimpy for the tent and rainfly  i bought better ones and they didn t cost much so it s no biggie      
542,5.0,                       this is my  rd    man tent this is the one i wanted by didn t want to spend the money  finally caught a sale this thing is so easy to set up you will surprise yourself  i set it up in my living room i won a  nice  little bet with my wife about it going back in the bag  takes a little stuffing but not hard at all      minutes to set up  and      minutes to take down and  get it back in the bag   working alone not trying to break any records  i recommend a tarp to protect the tent floor  while camping and your knees when you roll it up to pack away      
543,4.0,                       overall i really like this tent  the instant setup in amazing  my wife timed me and i actually set it up from being in the bag by myself in    seconds  however by itself it is not waterproof  it rained on us on our first camping trip with it and we had lots of condensation and a decent ammount of dripping through the tent  rainfly addition is a must for camping in the rain     
544,5.0,                       tent really just folds out and clicks in  just standard staking after that  definately pricey but i love this tent  i have only used it in sunny weather  dont see any issues if i use it in worse weather i can fit a double stack queen size blow up bed inside and have about a  ft by  ft free space      
545,5.0,                       its just the right size for   adults  tall enough to stand in and very easy to put up by myself  i have neck and shoulder injuries  so lifting is very difficult for me  could use more inside pouches and or hooks or loops for hanging stuff  we did not experience rain so i cannot comment on that      
546,5.0,                       after watching my brother set his tent up in a couple minutes  after i had to fumble with mine for half an hour on our camping trip this summer  i decided i had to get one too  coleman always makes sturdy products that last   but they never make products that are lightweight  this is a pull up to the camping site and set up tent  so if that s your plan you can t go wrong      
547,3.0,                       definitely easy to put up and great standing room  that i like    i guess i didn t read carefully but i was disappointed the rain fly doesn t come with it  i ve never had to purchase a rain fly separate  that sucks    two queen size air mattresses    i don t think so  maybe if you want it busting at the seams with no room for your bags or to even walk around  i fit one queen size air mattress and my dog bed  had just enough room to stand and change      
548,2.0,                       popped up in a minute   thrilled at the ease to set up   but wondered why inside walls were sticky to the touch   think something went wrong in the weather tec process for our tent   with just a light rain for a couple hours the second evening  there was water running in streams down the inside walls   thank goodness we bought the separately sold rain fly  so at least we didn t have water coming in the roof   hoping we just got a lemon   will order a new one to try again next summer   also please note   person size is very small   barely had a walking path around queen air mattress   we kept about a   ft wide area going from door to back wall open for keeping our bags   changing  which meant we kept air mattress to the left with no walking path around it   so we will try a bigger size when we order again   loved the open feeling with windows fully zipped open and the little air vent built into roof was very helpful in keeping the air temp comfortable when windows were closed  this would have been a four star if ours was water proofed correctly  and a five star if it was also roomier with a d style door   had to use two hands to unzip door and always have to start at bottom and use two separate zippers   we ve owned bigger   man tents before   suggest you go by the actual dimensions   outline it somewhere and laoyout your stuff in the outline to see if it is truly enough space for your liking   and to make sure it s truly waterproof  perhaps raining on it with a hose in your yard before you head off on vacation would be a good idea   fortunately we had a dry week and it only rained one more time toward the end of our trip   we put up a huge tarp over the tent to stay mostly dry during the second rainstorm   we still got some water along the bottom of some of the walls   hope there aren t too many lemons in their manufacturing process   sounds like others have been pleased with the weather protection of their coleman   person instant cabin tent   we will try again as we loved the ease of setup and openness with windows fully unzipped      
549,3.0,                       love love love how instant this tent is  extremely easy to setup honestly though i do have a few issues with the quality of this tent  the seams were not tight  i could see little holes in between the seams  also the door zipper was a little awkward to close  zipping around the d curve was tricky  required   hands  since there is   zippers to close the door there is a small gap where the zippers meet at the bottom of the door another issue is size  height is awesome  my husband who is      can stand in there  but length is the same as my other   person tent  so  if you are looking for a true to size   person tent i would suggest trying the coleman   person instant tent putting the tent away isn t as instant  but that is expected all in all    the instant part is worth the negative parts  and for a price of      you can t go wrong      
550,5.0,                       product is as easy as it says to set up and take down   my disappointment is the size    man tent  not hardly   barely fits a queen size mattress   wish we would have purchased the   man tent for the small price difference even though there is only the two of us   there is no room to walk around as i said it is wall to wall mattress   thank goodness we never had bad weather as it would have been miserable   also disappointed that i missed it didn t come with a rain cover it is a separate purchase   had a little problem with condensation when it got so cold outside and the heat inside had to leave windows open in the evening to stop it from really building up      
551,4.0,                       this product is well made and is almost everything coleman says it is  we went on an eight night car camping trip and changed locations every night  the ease of set up and take down was wonderful the negative was we had a fairly heavy and unexpected rain storm one night  the tent held up to the wind and rain well in the beginning  the problem is where the roof vent is located there is a design flaw here  the water sheds from the covered vents well but a pool of water forms in two spots on either side of the vents  this standing water  which is easily a     inch deep  will seep through the fabric and stitching over the course of a rain shower and you get a steady drip  you can physically push the water out if you know it is happening  if you happen to be sleeping or away during the rain shower you will find wet gear if it is in the middle of the tent  another weak spot with this tent is without a rain fly the water has to run down and over the door  it does not leak but if you have to enter or exit the tent during or after a shower the door will fall to the inside and pour water into the tent from the little pool on top as you pull the zipper  i solved these problems by creating my own rain fly and vestibule with a nylon tarp  appx   x    two adjustable metal poles and some parachute cord  it would be nice if coleman offered an optional rain fly made for the tent so it could be used during inclement weather  i would recommend this tent to a friend but would give them the same information and warning i offered here      
552,5.0,                       broke thisbout when i had to quarantine  went up super easy and fasy for a guy who only went camping once in his life  how did they get it to fit so nice and neat in the box took me    minutes to put this thing up was a workout  can defiently fit   grown ups and   kids with ease      
553,5.0,                       amazingly easy and roomy tent    minute set up    with the rain fly  if your expecting rain  get the fly   we weathered the remnants of hurricane florence in new england    days of constant rain  minimal pooling of water in   corners  that s it  we used a huge queen sized air mattress with room for our stuff  i only wish it had a flap for an extension cord  it s nice to be able to stand inside      
554,5.0,                       first  it is a coleman  heavier duty material and overly satisfied workmanship of the zippers  does not come with the rainfly  comes as pictured  you really don t need the rainfly but would be nice to have for additional protection from those rain storms that blow up on your excursion  you can buy it separately which is something i think should be included  period  but the tent is nice and roomy with standing room also  i have a party of three  so i bought this six party tent  you need to be able to put some gear in the tent besides yourself ya know   and yeah  you can pop it in under a minute  but  that does not include staking it down  good rule of thumb i find is to buy double the size of your party so as to be able to put those duffel bags and extra clothes etc  inside and be able to move around some  especially if you use cots  not a hiking tent unless you are a giant or have a pack mule  not including or insinuating the wife  tip  leave the cardboard box inside the bag to put the tent back into for storage and protection  no need to thank me later  you are welcome  have fun      
555,5.0,                       this tent is excellent  it really is a    second set up   i just wish it was a    second take down and put away       great quality  we ve used it a few times already  i also like that i can almost stand up in it  this is a rare phenomenon in most tents i ve used  great product  would definitely recommend it      
556,4.0,                       so far i would say this tent is everthing the reviews said  easy  setup  did it by myself  i m a senior  i chose the   man because the reviews said it would hold a queen size mattress   plenty of room for luggage  i also have   small dogs  my husband had an astma attack the weekend we went camping and so i managed the whole set up   take down myself  the dogs even loved it  it rained at night  not a drop in the tent  i did waterproof before we went   just to be on the safe side  we have beautiful weather in hawaii but the rain   wind can be intense  depending on what side of the island you are on  haven t camped in years   are so glad we decided to do this occasionally  i would definetly recommend this tent     minute set up   take down      
557,5.0,                       home run   i used the rain fly as well as a tarp inside the tent floor  took less than   minutes to setup  my friends were still putting their tent poles together  i was drinking      
558,1.0,                       we set the tent up on sunday so i could spray it with some weather proofing  scotch guard   i was soooo hoping that this would be  the  tent for us  we were so tired of leaking tents  tuesday we had a brief rain storm during the morning  i came home from work at noon time and the inside of the tent was wet      so much for that     im soooooooooo mad                 
559,5.0,                       when i first heard about coleman instant tents  i was intrigued  and then when i saw this   person model on sale for      i bought one  i took it camping a couple of weeks ago  and i love it  this was far and away the easiest tent i have ever set up  it is only slightly heavier than a comparable conventional pole tent  but the   minute setup time and   minute takedown time more than make up for the slight increase in weight there is just enough room inside this   person model to fit one queen size coleman airbed  and this one is just barely too short for me to stand up straight in  i m         i highly recommend this tent to anyone who likes camping  but doesn t like tents that take    minutes to set up      
560,5.0,                       i love this tent it is the fastest and easiest tent i have ever set up  i needed a replacement for the old wenzel that i have had for over    years  the wenzel was always a pain with the poles constantly falling apart while trying to erect it and would leak some during a heavy rain  i bought the rain fly for this one so  hopefully that won t be an issue  my daughters were playing in it this morning and i noticed how well the roof vents work on releasing the built up heat in the tent  i had this tent up in less than a minute by myself and this was right after the unboxing without reading any directions  i have always been a loyal coleman customer when it came to my camping gear but  this is my first coleman tent  coleman has great customer service too  i have called them in the past on an issue i had on a propane stove and they sent me the part out fast at no charge  the material is heavy duty too being thicker than most tents on the market  great job coleman this is by far the best and easiest family tent to set up  no cussing required      
561,5.0,                       so easy to set up and take down   a fellow campers gave us some  mm painters drop cloth to line bottom   we were so glad we did  it stormed terribly   to this day we couldn t figure out where the leak derived from  overall  super fast shipping and great quality tent made our first camping trip so much easier      
562,3.0,                       this tent was extremely easy to put together  we did a test run in the backyard before a camping trip  unfortunately  it is just too small to sleep   comfortably  we are a family of      adults  and   kids and typically use one air mattress and two foam mattresses and that would simply be impossible so we had to return and go a different route  if you are looking for a lightweight  easy to assemble tent this is a great option  if you need a bit of space for a family of   or   adults this is not the tent for you  it would be perfect for a couple  and possibly a dog          
563,2.0,                       this is one great tent   we have had the smaller version for years and love it  this one straight out of the box had holes scrubbed thru the floor and one side of the tent    they did refund after return  putting this thing back in the original packaging was no pick nick        
564,5.0,                       before i found this tent  after a five year lapse in the camping trips that i love due to arthritis  bad back and deteriorating knees  i decided that life without camping trips is no longer an option     my mind and spirit were getting as feeble as my joints  so i took my old small pop up tent and hit the state park  not a good thing  after all the bending and wrestling spring rods through the pockets to set up and then crawling into my old tiny    high center tent and even worse trying to get back out  i only made it a couple nights before i gave up and went home then i searched amazon for a different tent  lo and behold the colman instant tent  i got it and took it to the yard and was absolutely amazed at how it practically set itself up  it took me       minutes but like i said  i m creaky in the knees  i know if i could walk at a normal pace it would have been just a minute or less inside it is huge and will easily accommodate a large queen size air mattress and my gear and a sturdy chair for getting up and down and leaning my cane for easy grabbing in the night  and  it still leaves plenty of room to move around and stand up straight  glorious     i read some reviews that say it may leak but after zipping it all up  including the roof vents which i believe those reviewers may have missed  i sprayed it from all angles with the hose and really soaked it     not a drop inside i do think that those leak reviews may also have had to do with the vents  if you seal it up too tight there may be condensation that might seem like leakage but is really just from the camper breathing this tent is going to change my life in a very good way      
565,5.0,                       excellent tent   quite roomy  it s got enough room for me to have a folding coleman camping cot  a small round table  a plastic yard chair   still have plenty of room to move around in it  very well made  not sure if it s a   season tent  but i will find out this winter  thanks coleman   amazon      
566,5.0,                       not much to say  pop up tents are amazing and this coleman   person tent is no exception  i paid    dollars for it during a sale and couldn t be happier with the purchase  i don t even need the rain guard  it took a    hour rain day like a champ with just some coleman waterproofing spray i hit it with the day before  would definitely buy again      
567,2.0,                       this tent it easy to set up  just as advertised  unfortunately  the bottom does not lay flat against the ground even with the stakes  causing you to lose surface space inside  our tent also arrived with a hole on one of the walls  we didn t notice until we set it up this last week while camping  and sadly it s now too late to return  we ve had many coleman products we loved  but this one missed the mark  bummer      
568,2.0,                       tent seems great  set up easily in less than a minute   when i put the tent back into carry bag i noticed it had a broken zipper   called coleman to see if i  could get the bag replaced   after over    minutes on the phone  mostly on hold   i was given the option to purchase a different size carry bag tent appears to be as advertised carry bag and coleman customer service  both poor quality      
569,5.0,                       survived and thrived through everything burning man      has to throw at it  it won t keep the heat out  the instant the playa sun hits it  but  it will keep the wind borne dust at bay  if you keep it properly zipped up  i had a large  round inflatable bed  and still had room for all my gear and that of itinerant guests      
570,4.0,                       i was a bit nervous setting this up the first time   i got to the campground well after dark  had to find a space  didn t want to use lanterns due to insects  etc   with no experience with these tents i got it up in about   minutes   i m about    tall and could stand up straight in a decent portion of the tent  with minor bending in the rest   i put a queen size inflatable mattress in it  some chairs for sitting  and had plenty of room for gear   taking the tent down was also easy  though two of us combined to stuff it back into the cardboard it came in before putting it back in the carry sack   the carry sack  as i noticed later  has a portion you can rip apart to make putting the tent back in easier  without struggling to fit it back into its original dimensions   i would be concerned about water condensation on the inside if you don t leave the windows cracked  though if you do that you re giving up on some of the rain proofing   because of that i decided to get the rainfly for this tent   in all  i think this is a great tent as long as you re car camping   i would never try to pack this in on a trail      
571,1.0,                       this tent is really not a   person tent  my husband and i are average weight and height  we put our queen blow up mattress in there and barely had enough room for our bags  we had to climb over each other to get out  if you have   little kids and you want a tent for them this will work      
572,1.0,                       not weather or waterproof  i bought this very excited for a no fly tent  yes  this tent is very easy to set up  less than    seconds  it rained my first night using it  and i was soaked  all window zips were closed  but continuous condensation and water coming into the tent  there were multiple puddles  and my sheets and pillow were saturated  i dried it out  assumes user error  then tried it again  same thing  very wet  not just damp  i ended up throwing it away the next morning  sure        for   nights is cheaper than a hotel  though would have thought it would have at least been somewhat waterproof  i do not recommend unless you re sure you ll never see precipitation     
573,4.0,                       we purchased this tent as a second tent needed  the ease of set up was as expected  taking it down was easy as well however pay attention to how it s folded up  it will be difficult to pack inside the included storage bag if not folded up perfectly fortunately it was gorgeous at the coast so we can t attest to how it holds up in inclement weather  overall we are happy we decided to purchase this tent      
574,2.0,                       as soon as i got the tent i propped it up in my backyard  there was light rain at night for a couple hours  in the morning there were a few small puddles in the tent and clearly wet spots on the roof where water leaked from it s good for a beach day but not much else     
575,5.0,                       i bought this tent after reading lots of reviews   some good and some not so good   however  i have not been disappointed   it sets up very easily even with only one person   best with two   it holds up very well even in rainy weather  don t touch the sides of a tent when it is wet or it will leak   campers should know this    however  i had problems with a massive rainy week and it leaked a lot   i have waterproofed it but the seam was where the water came from that week   i bought seam sealer so hopefully that will help next time   i also found the rain fly on sale this winter but have not used it yet   as you see  i don t intend to let a little rain keep me from camping   i m a tent camper from way back i would definitely recommend the coleman instant tent      
576,5.0,                       replaced a conventional tent   setup is e a s y   i set it up alone in under a minute   it is a bit bulky   not for backpacking very stable in wind   previous tent would bend in the wind and slap me in the face no rain yet  so i have no opinion on water resistance      
577,1.0,                       didnt even come with a tarp  would prbably done good is it had one never impressed with coleman  its hardf not to they sware up and down how good quality  i almost bought the larger one  im glad i didnt  whay are they npot watter proof  dont you test them anymore   i would give less stars if i could  what a waste of time money  thanks for nothing     
578,5.0,                       it s the perfect tent  easy to set up  roomy enough for a group of people  or just one with enough supplies for several days  i used it last weekend  the first night it rained like hell  but not a single leak  i had a large cot  camping chair  and folding table inside with me  there was still plenty of room to move around inside  like a fold able little apartment      
579,3.0,                       i loved this tent   used it for a week in dec      and a week in dec      camping at a yoga retreat in florida   perfect   but this year it rained hard and had very strong winds   tent held up perfectly to constant        mph winds  but not the rain   i moved everything to center so nothing touching walls prior to rain starting  just in case   but after about    hours of strong rain  had over     inches of water in bottom of tent   i think it was coming in both from walls and floor  and yes  i had an appropriate sized ground cloth under it   would recommend tent only if there is zero chance of rain      
580,5.0,                       all the reviews say one person can easily set up the tent and that is for sure  the directions that come with the tent say assembly requires at least two people  i called the company before i set it up in my living room and they were very patient with my questions i didn t want a partially assembled tent in my living room   i am an older woman and set it up in a couple of minutes  taking it down is easy too  extend the bag by ripping off the white tabs and it slips right in the bag  i haven t used it to camp yet so i can t comment on any other issues      
581,5.0,                       setup was around    minutes  windows allow a lot of airflow  withstood wind gusts near beach during florida storm season  after reading other reviews we used spider tent for cover and no water entered when heavy rain came  we needed to close window zippers due to the rain  we had twin air and twin foam mattresses  third would ve been crammed  we re really happy with this purchase      
582,5.0,                       love this tent    it is the most amazing tent i ve ever seen or owned  i put it up alone the first time in less than   minutes then took it down and got it back in the bag in less than   minutes  it is amazing  it s large enough on the inside for a tall type  double size air mattress with room to walk around it and keep your stuff  had a little hanging circle in the middle of the ceiling  i hung my lantern from it   very convienent  would highly recomend      
583,5.0,                       just like the add says  these things are very simple to set up  even someone that s never put up a tent could set this thing up  very quickly  it s made just as well as any other tent  it is a bit heavy  but i was willing to sacrifice that for the ease of set up      
584,4.0,                       this thing is pretty darn good it s true  you basically take it out of the box  bend the big joints in the tent poles the other way  and it pops up it s really not too bad putting it back into the tent bag  either  unlike most tents be careful not to get your fingers stuck between the folded poles when the tent is closed  or closing  you could crush your finger pretty good  i almost did but other than that  i m pretty satisfied with this tent  it even held up well in  oh  i d say       mph winds  i had one side of it guy lined to my honda element and the other side guy lined with rebar stakes  and no problems even if the wind does collapse it  since the tent poles have joints in the middle  think of a knee  only it bends both ways   high winds don t really hurt the tent  they just make it much smaller i don t quite know why i m not giving it   stars  i m not totally in love with it  but it s pretty good and i respect it      
585,5.0,                       last year i went on a   month xcountry trip  camping all the way    wish i had bought this before my trip instead of after     this thing goes up very quickly and simply   it s a no brainer   one word of caution tho  do not trip on the doorway flap and grab the tent to stop your fall  or you  too  will tear the fabric that holds the tent to the pole   not bad design on coleman s part  just clumsiness on mine   fits a queen size w  room on the sides for all your gear   when you re ready to pack up the campsite  open all the windows in the tent  then let it down  it takes some time to flatten out  doesn t pack up as compactly as they show  so you ll probably have to open up that extra gusset in the carrying bag   or mayhaps i m just an idiot   i ll re post in the future to let you know how it fares over time      
586,5.0,                       i ve just lived alone in this tent for a month  in all that time  it has been especially comfortable  because i could stand up  it also handled some  big summer storms  while i was living in the woods now my daughter is living in it for one more month at the same place where she is working i m impressed  it s supposed to be big enough for   people    i think of it more as a two person tent      
587,1.0,                       material so thin a normal wind creates holes in the very thin fabric material  holes in bottom  see thru holes on side of tent  door opening high so you trip  water pours in even with waterproofing   came with mis aligned pole  i cant think of one good thing      
588,5.0,                       i had to return mine s because i had a deal where i got the   person version  i did setup both  and it only takes about   minutes to setup  probably about    minutes to unpack  time it takes to take out air and to cram into it s compressed carrying bag   the zippers seem durable and this feels much better than the bargin no named branded tents  this really is quality you can feel  it also feels really spacious  even the   person tent  i could get up and walk around  i m     tall  on the downside  the tent itself is much bigger than the cheaper tents  if you re taking a flight to go camping  this in itself is its own luggage      
589,5.0,                       my wife and i had an older instant set up style tent we confiscated from her daughter and we liked it   we wanted a bigger one but nobody seemed to make them anymore   now everyone seems to sell the coleman ones and at pretty good prices too   we bought this for our daughter to replace the one we confiscated for our use years ago   she really likes it and had no problem setting it up on a recent trip   my wife and i have a bigger version of this tent and like it too   keep in mind that a   person tent only sleeps   if you really like each other   i think this   person tent allows    square feet of floor space per person   our larger one allows    square feet per person    that s    x      so by looking at the floor space it s easy to see that the number of people they are rated for is somewhat inflated   if you camp in areas that have a lot of rain the way to go is to place your tent under a tarp  that way you know you ll stay dry and it keeps all the tree sap and stuff off your tent too      
590,4.0,                       the only complaint i have is that even though it takes me    seconds to put up  it takes like six or seven minutes to put away because the bag it goes in is an inch or two too small  but sadly this is the case of anything made in china  i guess they save big    making the bags super small      
591,4.0,                       great size and easy set up  would ve given   stars  but it rained the   times i used it  and if it had rained harder we would ve soaked  there was water running through the seams  and water was dropping from one spot through the integrated rainfly  if coleman would add a more resistant rainfly it would be perfect  i can t find a separate rainfly for this size of tent  only for the   person one      
592,5.0,                       i sent a bad review for what i thought was this tent but the bad tent review was for an american camper fastpitch  don t ever buy that  every thing i said is true about that  it was never used  and never will be  straight to the trash bin   i bought it from fred meyer store  i was sort of leery to by the coleman instant because if the fastpitch now to the coleman tent   it is a dream to set up and to take down  my grand daughter did it very well at the camp site tonight  thank you coleman for making a great easy to put up take down tent  years ago we had two coleman tents that were super and very easy like this one  we used them for years and were very sad when they finally gave up material wise  i hope this tent gives us the same long term service as our last coleman tents did i am glad coleman came out with a more modern instant tent  glad to have it      
593,5.0,                       my family went camping   got caught in a major thunderstorm windstorm  our canopy   other items were destroyed and blown into the lake but this tent held up because of the flexible joints  i think the only reason water got in the tent was because we didn t zip it up in time      
594,3.0,                       first use was in an unexpected downpour  can t keep the flaps open for ventilation or water will enter through the mesh  everyone got rained on periodically through the night but it was so hot and muggy inside the tent that the water cooling wasn t entirely unwelcome setup and takedown were easy as advertised  google around for ways to jerryrig a tarp rainflap  you ll need it      
595,5.0,                       this tent is a winner  took it on a family camping trip this weekend and it took me about two minutes to set up by myself  we were all amazed  i purchased the rain fly as well and although it didn t rain  it looks nice  it fits a queen size air mattress and cot and i also put down a  x  rug  i like the windows on all sides for great airflow  if i could change one thing in the manufacturing  i would add a couple extra rings or hooks for hanging a toiletry bag or laundry sack  there is one ring at the top of the tent which i used to hang a lantern  great job coleman  i m instant tent for life      
596,5.0,                       we ve been using the old school tents for years and finally upgraded to these when our old one ripped  before i hated helping my husband set up the tent but the first time we used this  i set it up by myself and it was so easy  getting it back into the bag is a little tricky but overall great      
597,4.0,                       love that it is easy to put up  once u figure it out   it s big   darker which is great on the eyes   uv absorption  i tested it and it s not waterproof  but it needs to come with a rain fly  selling it separately is a bad biz move  all tents need to come with their own rainfly      
598,5.0,                       took this tent on a   week camping trip this last fall  it is super easy to set up and take down  it was great to be able to stand up in it  plenty of room for   with a queen sized mattress  after a few days of rain the inside walls started to seep water  we bought the rainfly  but we never got wet  sprayed some waterproofer on it and it seemed to help  camped one night in       mph winds and it held up fine      
599,4.0,                       i have a huge cabin style coleman tent that i use for family camping  but i bought this one to use for just me and or one other person   it is amazing   i literally set it up by myself in less than two minutes and can break it down in less than two minutes  i was concerned when i first unpacked it at the campsite and i realized there was no rain fly  but it did rain for a few hours and nothing inside got wet so i don t really know why they sell a separate rain fly      
600,2.0,                       i got the   person tent and was very disappointed after setting it up at my campsite  it was much  much smaller than described  i am     and could not stand up completely  luckily we had an extra twin sized air mattress and used that because the full sized did not fit  well  it did  but it literally took up the entire tent minus a few inches  the zipper was also a big issue  it would not stop getting stuck  our tent was full of mosquitoes  and since it was such a small tent with   people it was extremely hot and muggy all night long  overall  extremely disappointing and will be returning       
601,5.0,                       loved it  favorie tent i have owned  was nervous it would not be as easy as reviews stated but it was  just unfold  extend poles until they snap in place and stake down  took my   min to put up by myself  it also rained a lot first weekend i used it and it was dry on inside  couldn t ask for more  only negative is like most tents the estimated persons it can hold is off  i had two twin size air mattresses with two people in the tent it was perfect  could do   if just sleeping bags      
602,5.0,                       really easy to set up  the only thing is that the door on the one side   the door with the pole that bends into the door frame  it can be a pain because you have to open the tent door all the way in order to enter the tent efficiently  the zipper gets caught often but once you figure it out its manageable  but more importantly  the tent definitely keeps out the sunlight  during the day you can enter the tent and need a light to see  or you can just open a window that isnt facing the sun  over you can stand up and change really easily over all great purchase       
603,5.0,                       tent was the perfect size for what i needed  two adults and a queen air mattress plus room for gear and space to change while standing up the only complaint i have is that the bottom seam was not sealed  fortunately i noticed before i took it camping and manually sealed that seam myself i also purchased the optional rain fly  all together it was a great tent and stayed dry during heavy rain      
604,5.0,                       as advertised  this tent is exceptionally easy both to take down and to put up  which is exactly what i was looking for  it s roomy inside  has a nice big footprint   x   i think   and i can easily stand up in it  the windows are a nice height for privacy  but less than ideal if you want to get much of a breeze inside the tent while you re sleeping  though even that part isn t bad overall  i m very happy with this tent for weight  ease of transport  and ease of set up and tear down update  i ve had this tent for more than two years now  and despite regular use  it s still holding strong  i ve got one foolish puncture in the floor i need to mend  but that was my fault for dropping a knife on the floor inside the tent i ve gotten nervous about the lack of rainfly  but i still haven t had any leaks in the tent  despite use in heavy rain  i would absolutely buy this tent all over again  and highly recommend it for convenience and ease of use      
605,3.0,                       best suited for backyard camping with the kids or car camping in clear weather   tent goes up   comes down fast but you pay a price in added weight and bulk    integrated rain fly  means no rain fly   seams are taped but my tent leaked significantly at two windows during a moderate summer rainstorm   i returned mine  for the price you can buy a waterproof tent that will be better in summer showers      
606,5.0,                       this tent really did go up in less than a minute   you do need to allow a few extra minutes to stake it out   we were concerned about the reviews that stated it leaked  but we used it in the rain twice on a long road trip with no problems   the first time we put it up  we noticed that the very top tie  which creates the point at the top of the tent  near the vents  was loose   if we had not tightened that  the rain would have puddled on the roof and poured in through the ventilation screens   i m wondering if that could have caused some of the leak problems other campers reported we were comfortable with   adult sized people    adults    teens  but we don t put anything in our tent other than sleeping bags   if we had added chairs  air mattresses  or the two other people it can supposedly house  it would have been a very snug space   we felt the tent was roomy due to the head room   we could easily stand and change in the tent  which was a nice feature      
607,5.0,                       i have used this tent on two camping trips now  it s great when you re camping close to your car and don t need to hike in  sets up  like advertised  in a minute  all parts are attached  the rainfly  sold separately  hasn t been needs   haven t camped in rainy conditions  the   foot head room is great when setting up  changing or packing back up  packing away in to the bag also works pretty well  there s even a tear away expansion to the tent bag to fit in easier      
608,1.0,                       ordered the  like new  condition option for a discount  tent stakes were bent  tent was covered inside   out with dirt grass  there was trash   food inside the tent  there was sticky candy   others substances stuck on the inside walls and dried bird poop outside roof   sides  absolutely disgusting  i don t know how it got listed as  like new   this was not suitable for resale      
609,5.0,                       so i was a cub boy scout from  st grade through age    and must have gone camping at least      times a year as a kid   now that i am older and have a son who is a cub scout  i needed to upgrade my equipment  on our first campout we borrowed a very nice north face dome tent   it kept us dry and warm and i thought i wanted to buy the same tent for myself until i came accross this tent   there is no way to express how quickly and easily it goes up and comes down   it can easily be done by one person while your little campers  help    i watched as other fathers struggled to get up standard tents and ours was up in well under   minutes   i did spring for better stakes to hold it down  the coleman upgrade stakes fit perfectly into the slots    i have the rain fly although we didn t need it given the weather   i did a ton of research before i bought this tent  and honestly almost didn t purchase it because it was so inexpensive       for tent fly and stakes    the review that sold me was a video review that stated they would use this tent more often than their expensive tents because of ease of use  they were absolutely correct   buy this with confidence if you are doing any family or scout camping   with all this said  it is obviously not a backpacking tent but it does come in a nice duffle bag so can easily be carried by an adult from you car to the campsite      
610,4.0,                       been using tents for over    yrs   got tired of all the hassles of poles and it was time to get a new on   this is by far the easiest tent to set up   iwas impressed at how thick and durable the material is  this tent takes out all the hassle of setting up camp and allows more time for enjoying your experiance  great job coleman  definatly money well spent      
611,5.0,                       a few years ago i borrowed this tent from a friend  and have always wanted to buy one myself  i ended up buying it last summer just to have it  and i do not regret my purchase  it took about   minute to set up and that is my kind of tent  it s definitely not meant to fit   people  i would say only   with my air mattress  but that didn t stop me from buying it  it s very good quality and can t wait to use it again camping this upcoming summer      
612,5.0,                       i cannot say enough about this tent  i m a       woman and i was able to open it by myself in less than a minute  you simply fold out the legs then bend them until they snap up  then you extend the   poles and it s up  i was shocked at how easy it was  i bought this for backyard camp outs this summer and my son and i were so excited that i decided to open it in my living room  that was a mistake  the tent is way bigger than i expected it to be  i couldn t even extend it all the way taking it down was just as easy but rolling it up was a little harder  it took me      minutes to get it compressed enough to have it zipped back in its carrying bag  like i said  i did this in my living room so i did not have a ton of space to work in  it probably would have been much easier to get it rolled up if i had been outside      
613,4.0,                       i m glad we bought this tent  we were planning a camping trip for our family of four and we needed a bigger tent because we wanted extra space  after reading reviews  we decided to get it but i was honestly skeptical on the easy and quick setup  fast forward to setting up our tent at our campsite   it only took about a minute or two to set it up  i was impressed  it s a great size  but i can t imagine   people fitting in this tent  i would say   but   would be cramped   i also like that the tent has pockets inside so you can put keys  phones  etc  but  there was one issue   so you can hang a lantern fan from the inside top of the tent  a light fan was hanging from it when it decided to rain on our trip   went inside the tent after the rain stopped to change clothes and noticed there was a small puddle of water in the tent  i guess there is a vent at the top and it gets exposed when you hang a lantern or fan because it pulls the fabric down which is normally not a big deal but it is when it rains  i now know for next time      
614,1.0,                       set up was easy but it rained and everything went downhill from there  i bought the product back in june and did not use it until july and there was a tear on one side when it had never been used before  i have bought numerous tents from coleman but this one was horrible  it totally ruined the weekend and we had to cram into the car to sleep because the tent was flooded  do not recommend     
615,2.0,                       a very easy tent to set up and take down    just as advertised   very spacious inside with plenty of room for my seven foot long cot and gear with space to spare  the problem i had with this tent was it leaked like a sieve along the seam under the window on the left side of the tent in what i would call a steady light rainfall  no i didn t spray the seams with a silicone spray but i figured a tent with weather tech in its name wouldn t need it  i believe this to be a manufacturer defect since it only leaked on one side  nice tent as long as it doesn t rain      
616,5.0,                       i wanted a tent i could stand up in and room for all my gear  and ventilation on all   sides  and i got it all  this old lady is luxuriating in the coleman   person instant tent   assembly is recommended for two people but i trusted the other reviews and decided to go for it   yes  one person can handle it   it s up and down very quickly and it s a dream come true i had one surprise  and that is the amount of wet even though there was no rain  i was at the beach    when i touched the fabric on the inside  i got water on my hands   i was therefore glad that my sleeping bag  etc  was not touching the walls   however  for me it won t be much of an issue as i do not camp in inclement weather   for actual rainy conditions  maybe spray repellant is needed as for amazon customer service  the word is spectacular  which is what i had heard   this was my first amazon purchase and now i know for myself how responsive and helpful they are      
617,5.0,                       just used this for the first time in a remote area on a mountain this week in western nc   it is easy to put up and take down   we had to carry it     yards up a steep hill and it was manageable  its says sleeps   but not   adults in my opinion   it sleeps     adults   it kept all the insects out  zippers are well done and easy to get in and out   it did not rain so i can t comment on keeping a large amount of water out   there was a lot of dew in the morning but our tent was dry   i do recommend this tent for normal recreational use      
618,4.0,                       cool idea  great execution at this price  it was a breeze to set up and break down  i got it back into its original bag fairly easy  it has good air flow  i did wish it had a rain fly just for shade reasons  broken down in the bag  it s pretty big and a little heavy   i also felt like i should ve gotten the bigger version  with   of us and our gear it was a little tight all around   mind you we were car camping and were on tri fold twin mattresses and im       i expect to let the kids have this one and im gonna get the big boy one for car camping   that way i can stand up in it      
619,5.0,                       so happy that i have this item now all i have to do is make sure i ll be ready for my summer camp my finger have one and what made me get this because it started raining and we both was in her tent and it was no water nowhere so hey i hate to give me     
620,4.0,                       i just got this tent today  it s very easy to setup in less than    seconds  we are having a rain storm today  here in florida  i thought this would be the perfect time to test the problems people said they were having with this tent  they are true  the tent leaks along the seams were the inside pockets meet the tent walls  the pan seams leak if you don t have something to keep against the side wall  so the pan stays tight  i used two towels on both sides to do that  the leaks on the pockets could have been avoided if they would have just run the seam tape they used around the edge of the pockets  or folded over the pockets before they stitched it to the side walls  the pan leak could have been avoided if they used  steak tie downs in those places  to strech the fabric just like they did in the front and back of the tent  the top vent leaked very little  just tie the center tie snug to the top support post  that stop that leak  keep in mind i put this tent up in a heavy rain storm with wind  my review seams pretty critical of this tent  but i still gave it four star  the tents fabric is nice and thick and didn t leak  just keep a towel handy to dry those spots  none of the leaks i spoke of are bad  i would feel comfortable taking this tent anywhere as long it s not in a blizzer or hurricane  i am a avid hunter and it s coming with me this season  i have own many tents before  all came with rain flys  they all leaked in heavy rain worst than this one  the ease of this tent to put up is great when you what to get to your activity quick  the height on the inside makes it easy to move around  the space inside is roomy for two full size air beds  with the mild winters we have here in florida  i don t think we will cold at all      
621,5.0,                       i am going to keep it simple because there are lots of reviews that go into details  i am not a frequent camper so i didn t want to spend a fortune on a tent  but i also wanted a decent tent so i would have a nice camping experience  and hopefully want to go again in the future  this tent takes under   minutes to set up and under    minutes to pack up  the only reason it takes longer to break down is if you are really careful about getting it folded up neatly  i was worried when there was no rain cover included  especially when it started raining during our trip  it was just a moderate rain  not a downpour  but the tent did not leak at all  that said  i will probably spray it will some fabric sealant before the next trip just to be on the safe said  the tent is roomy and comfortable  would definitely buy it again and recommend it  it is a great  simple tent      
622,5.0,                    esta modelo de intant tent para             personas  son las mejores casa de acampar de coleman  resistentes a la interperie  impermeables  duraderas  es muy resistente y de peso ligero se las recomiendo  van a comprar calidad y garant a gracias a amazon por distribuir este producto         
623,5.0,                       this tent was easy to set up  i m a little slow in my movements and still got it all up and ready in   minutes  it was spacious inside  enough to fit a queen size air mattress and a full size air mattress  lots of ventilation options  we love this tent      
624,4.0,                       ridiculously easy to set up   i ordered the tent because on family vacations i find myself swearing when putting up the tent  i swear easily  but not the way i want to start a vacation    it was a swear free set up  and most of it was done by my    year old   taking it down was a bit more   challenging i felt like i was faced with the fitted sheet of a super king size bed   no matter how i attempted to take it down  it turned into a wad fest   i did get it into the bag it came with  but i have no idea how the only other issue we had was lots of condensation on the inside of the tent   hard not to touch the door wall  which was a bit clammy   okay  soaking wet have no idea how it will be in rain  we shall find out soon      
625,3.0,                       i loved how easy this tent was to set up  the instant poles are so convenient and easy  i also think the roominess is good  however  we experienced a rain storm  and water leaked right into the tent from the top and the sides  the inside was very wet with puddles all over the bottom  i was very bummed about the water issue because it was a good tent otherwise  i ended up sending it back because it tends to rain every year at my favorite camping spot      
626,5.0,                       i can t say how it does in the rain or bad weather because i haven t used it in either  but when i did use it  it was so easy to put up and a pure pleasure to use i m very careful with my camping stuff and i think it will last me many years      
627,4.0,                       setup is pretty easy even for someone who doesnt camp much   ever   i used this tent at low temps in the mid   s and was okay   the zipper for the door does like to get caught  a little bit but once you figure out the best way to open and close it  it s just fine as others have noted  it does not come with the rain fly   we had a small rainstorm overnight and i stayed dry i d recommend this tent for ease of setup      
628,4.0,                       this tent was really great  and easy quick to set up   i really love it  but it doesn t come with a rain fly  which was annoying   also  this tent probably would only sleep four if you weren t using cots or air mattresses  and didn t have much of anything else inside the tent   i don t recommend trying this tent for four people      
629,5.0,                       i can now say that this tent has been thru a complete test with the changing oklahoma weather  it held up great  kept me dry in an all day down poor and warm with my little heater in the middle of the winter with temps down in the    s  i have to add that i did purchase the rainfly and it was a big help to the keepin dry portion      
630,4.0,                       love the tent once it is put up  yet i was super super confused and disappointed to find out the whole reason why i bought this tent was to have fun with my   year old son and camp out on the yard and it said about    second set up  i thought i was crazy when i went to put it up and the middle part of the tent was inside out it was not on the outside of the material and netting  i would have returned right away but i asked someone next door to help me to make sure i was not doing it wrong and he said it was completely inside out  he then unhooked ever part and turned everything the right way  if it wasn t for him i wouldn t have a tent      
631,5.0,                       do you need to save your relationship  buy this tent for an end to the strife that putting up the tent brings bought this for a camping trip and was not disappointed  it goes up and comes down in under two minutes and is so easy my ten year old can do it  stayed in it during a wicked wind and rain storm  forgot to put the rain fly on  and no water got in it  for the price  you cannot beat the convenience      
632,5.0,                       two thumbs up for easy setup  i was able to setup by my self in a few minutes and also put a way  not sure if i would say it s a   person tent  but   people  sleep comfortable and they re still room for bags  lot s of windows and  ventilation      
633,4.0,                       as a treat for surviving out first year of law school  our   person team set out for a trip in the michigan wilderness  the ten slept three perfectly and allowed us room to store our gear at the foot of our sleeping bags  the net covered vents were perfect for adjusting the temperature inside our tent and airing it out  best part about the pop up style is that assembly takes all of   minutes  it is perfect for those of us who have a lack of camping skills do not like to read directions the only downside was being forced to insulate ourselves by keeping the vents closed every night and waking up to a muggy and wet tent  condensation   not sure if this can be avoided in tents made of more breathable materials   the first time i ordered this  my package was stolen and i panicked because our trip was days away  however  amazon saved the day by express shipping new gear and saving the trip from disaster  also  they responded to my  p m  email right away  it was fantastic customer service      
634,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i purchase the tent in june and i just used today during our weekend camping trip the zipper for the door came apart i had to use safety pins to have the door close really upset     
635,1.0,                       there s a video from coleman showing this tent sustaining a    mph wind tunnel and an extreme storm test where the competitor s test was wet  but the inside of the coleman tent was  bone dry    when the tent arrives  it advises the user that the tent will only survive a    mph wind  and the tent should not be used in heavy rains  and further website checks reveal that a rainfly is sold separately   reviews on the rainfly describe it as not being effective   i m sending the tent back  certainly in the hopes of receiving a full refund   a tent that doesn t keep you dry in a rainstorm is useless      
636,3.0,                       awful tent for rainy weather  the video that i watched prior to purchasing it gave me the impression that it would withstand light rain  which it did not  the entire tent lining inside was condensated and all of our belongings got wet  would not recommend this tent for any weather other than sunshine after this recent trip  however  the durability was great and getting it set up was fairly simple      
637,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          ok  so  this thing leaked like crazy  all   corners looked like this  dripped from roof as well   has tape in the corners like someone had it  returned it and now i got it   gonna return it and try another one   maybe i ll change my review  holla at me coleman          
638,5.0,                       took it out for the first time this weekend and had a huge thunderstorm  it was in a koa and while other tents were being blown dow this one held up perfectly  it did take on a little water but the rain was coming in sideways  except for some janky zippers this is perfect       
639,5.0,                       great tent  took me and my wife one minute to set up  first of all  get rid of the stakes that come with it  and get some better quality stakes  the tent has windows on all   sides and has fantastic ventilation    feet in height inside  great to be able to stand up inside  i treated ours with silicone spray to be safe  took it on a week long camping trip  and had compliments from other campers of its versatility  for the price  its worth every penny  get one  you will love it     
640,3.0,                       i have only taken this tent out on   occasions  the first was a   days     nights on the beach  it was very windy the first day and one of the support ropes actually broke  the second trip was just over night at the lake  during pack up a support rod broke on the side  so all in all not really happy with the durability of the assembly pieces  the actual tent was great very dark on the inside when you wanr it to be and open  airy and bright when you choose      
641,5.0,                       we love this tent   we took it camping a few times this summer and used it in yellowstone   it poured rain and we had heavy winds in  yellowstone and you do not need to purchase the rainfly for this tent as some reviewers have stated   the way it s designed  it has a built in rainfly   we never got a drop of water in our tent   we did have morning condensation of course  but i ve never found a tent that solves that problem   this tent is so incredibly easy to put up and take down and even fits without any problem into the bag   it s just my daughter and i and other campers were seriously jealous we got ours up in a  matter of a minute or     we inflated   full size air mattresses and had room on each side and down the middle  and at the opening to spare for our bags  a side table and shoe bins   the top of the tent has a hanging hook  which is perfect to hang a lantern for an overhead light   highly recommend this tent      
642,4.0,                       set it up by myself today  was pretty simple  there are plenty of screens  looks to be well built  there are no tie backs on the screens but its ok its just as easy to roll and tuck against the screen bottom  before buying this size  i staked out a  x   area in the yard  put all of my items in that square  everything fit pretty well  so i bought the  x    problem is that its not actually  x    that is the size of the  tub  that is sown in the bottom  u lose    inches all the way around cause it rolls up the sides  roughly    sq ft lost  and the wall angle causes even more lost space  im suprised that no one has said anything about the size in the reviews  im assuming that the instant   is  x    since it says its  x    we ll see  returning this one and getting the        
643,5.0,                       we have used this tent for   years now and we love it  i ve read people complaining about water leaks  we have not had issues wit water  any tent has to have seam sealer on seams and it must be set up  wet it down good and let it dry in the sun  it s a great tent for the money      
644,4.0,                       bought for my son for scouting   easy to set up   haven t been out in heavy rain but appears to be good quality   he has enough room for an air mattress and all of his gear for weekend trips   could double up if needed   nice tent      
645,5.0,                       it sets up very  very quickly  fairly compact for the design   my only issue is you can not stand upright but  so long as you do not intend on hanging out inside you tent  it is perfect for a good nights sleep and quick set up   take down     
646,4.0,                       i took this tent car camping for   days   nights with my boys  ages    and     near our home  it took them no time to set it up and i have set it up by myself in a couple of minutes  i am under     and did not have a problem extending the poles fully  it is a little heavy  but they did not have to carry it far and we had plenty of room between us with a twin matress for me and a queen for them  it was well ventilated and though the windows do not go all the way down  this was no problem for me as i like my privacy when asleep  glare from  asin b    vvob  kindle fire  full color    multi touch display  wi fi    we had a tent fan with the convenient clip at the ceiling which worked well for us   i think the two pockets seem chintzy with the tents size and i did keep looking for more near the roof  don t use the two vent pockets as your contents will slide down inside the tent   i was able to get the tent closed all the way even with two zippers and rounded corners it did not rain so we had no chance to test leakage  this is about the fourth tent i have used in my four years camping experience  going only     times a year   but i think it is a winner  i agree with other reviewers that it is difficult to put back in the bag and i started off with my own stakes from the outset      
647,5.0,                       best tent ever   i have used this tent for many years as have many of my friends   i have slept dry through rain storms in it  with the rain fly on  and it holds up to wind   also great in the dessert   i can set it up and take it down easily myself in less than   minutes   there are two inside pockets great for storage inside and vents on top      
648,5.0,                       best tent ever i used to have other instant tents  most instant tents were easy to setup but not quite easy to fold  this one is perfect  easy set up easy fold  highly recommend        
649,4.0,                       hard to put back in the bag      of the tent is sticking out  don t like that i have to unzip the front door at the bottom  ain t gonna lie  but when you gotta get out in the middle of the night for a pee  bending down and trying to find the zipper when you all kinds of tired is not fun  so much easier if the zipper was at the top      
650,4.0,                       i had this tent up only twice   it is everything coleman says it is   easiest tent i have ever pitched  i purchased a six man tent just for myself because i am using a large cot and wanted some room for a chair and storage   it is perfect   if i wanted a tent for two people i would not hesitate to get an eight man tent   i love the     ceiling i was a little surpirise  a good deal of moisture accumulates on the interior of the tent overnight with just one person a nice basic tent that really does go up in a minute and i have difficulties with my legs and back  finally found a tent i can set up      
651,5.0,                       the   min set up is true  one thing that confused me was the roof joint was not to be fixed  it is designed to be flexible  i tried to fix the roof joint touching around but it is just joint moving     degree perfectly fit with   full size air mats      
652,1.0,                       i ordered this tent  it went up beautifully  it looks nice  i put it up in my backyard  the next day it rained a little  and it leaked near both of the inside mesh pockets  that s also with the additional rainfly accessory attached  i was very disappointed  i sent it back and am waiting for a replacement  i hope it was just a fluke  that such a minimal amount of rain could get in to be continued         
653,5.0,                       i absolutely love this tent  i went camping with some friends and we weathered a storm  we had to collapse their tent and put rocks on it so that it wouldn t blow away  this tent never even moved  i was able to set this tent up in less than   minute and take it down just as fast  i had   queen size mattress inside  pushed about an inch from one edge  and still had about     feet of space      
654,4.0,                       good product but its cold inside  i think too much air gets in  have not tested in rain but high winds are no problem it seems we got last minute wind alerts and winds of upward of    mph and while there was tons of noise and rattle the thing did hold up all night the stakes that come with it were not used as i had heavy duty ones and that is what we used whlie trying to get it staked in one of the lower attachments broke off  my fault but still should have been steel not plastic i think      
655,5.0,                       love my new tent   used it this summer on our  great western excursion  with our scout troop and i was the envy of everyone   we moved to a different spot every day and my tent was always the first one up and the first one packed away    i did get the option rain fly and the accessory kit with upgraded steaks   you need a rubber mallet in the utah arizona colorado area  everyone borrowed it when i was finished         
656,5.0,                       it s a big tent  open or closed  it really does set up in under    seconds  i love how the poles don t detach from the fabric  there s really nothing to figure out in order to set it up when the tent is collapsed i was able to get it back in it s storage bag fairly easily  that s not something i can say with all other tents i ve owned      
657,5.0,                       the tent was in great shape even being used  the original set up took a bit longer then    minutes  but that was because of doing alone and reading the instructions at the same time  this is a really roomy tent for   or   people  it can hold   people  but will leave no real moving space  what got me was after it was up i tested it    degrees temperature with a mr heater buddy heater inside  it not only held the temps inside so good  i was just in shorts and t shirt      
658,5.0,                       this roomy tent goes up in under a minute  enough square footage inside for my queen size air mattress without filling the space  i recommend getting the rainfly just in case  tent folds and stows in the bag almost as easily as it went up  plenty of zippered windows for ventalation  very pleased with my purchase      
659,5.0,                       this tent is an engineering marvel   when i went camping and just bought this  i didn t try it out before hand or anything   when we got to our camp site it was already dark  so we had our car lights give us some  minor  light   as my friends struggled to lay out their tents  arranging the poles  needing two people  mine was out of the bag  and set up in    seconds in the dark   unbelievable   i m not kidding you  the demo picture on the side of the bag was all i needed to see   after mine was done  i helped my friends finish theirs  lol this tent is also great because it s tall enough to stand in   im       but someone    would have no problem standing straight up inside even breakdown was quick   when i started to take it down to the time it was in the bags was probably   mins   it would have been quicker if i opened some zippers for air release      
660,4.0,                       just like it says  instant tent  it goes up in about a minute  now lets talk taking it down  it will take about   min to get it down and it is a bit of a struggle to fit in back in its bag  there is a white ribbon along the side of the bag  rip pull this off and the bag will get a bit bigger but it is still a tight fit  all and all we love this tent  lots of windows  good size      
661,5.0,                       love this tent  seriously sets up in     minutes   taking it down takes a few extra minutes since you need to get it back into the bag   the only negatives about this tent is the size when stowed   if you low on cargo space these instant tents could be an issue for you   my   person coleman instant tent takes up almost  x the space as my   person normal tent      
662,1.0,                       this tent must not have been sprayed with the waterproof chemicals  i used it for the first time recently and it drizzled for   hour  the tent pooled water and leaked from the top for the next day  the sides of the tent were soaked from a drizzle  this tent is supposed to be waterproof not water resistant  it couldn t even handle drizzle  look at other reviews  apparently coleman makes mistakes and not every tent leaves their factory with the appropriate coating to make it waterproof  amazon says this is not returnable and i m extremely disappointed  do not buy this tent      
663,2.0,                       leaked badly from sides  not seams  during  nd camping trip  even tried sealing all seams though you could see it was the sides leaking  it didn t even slow down the leaking  time had expired to return tent so we ended up trashing it  i have always bought coleman tents but never will again      
664,5.0,                       this think goes up so easy  i laughed the first time i set it up  can easily set up and take down with one person  watch the youtube videos to see how   i highly highly recommend this product  great coleman quality  i have used it four times camping since  you don t want to skimp out on your camping gear   pay a bit more for quality  i can stand up in it easy and i m       pro tip  when taking down you fold it back up and have to kinda roll the air out of it  keep the winds unzipped about a     so the air gets out easily      
665,4.0,                       easy one person set up   i used the rain fly and still had gallons of water on the floor after a rain   the second night the winds were pretty strong and i lost the rain fly in the storm but the tent held up  although seams were weakened and now leak water in a slight rain   i found it not that easy to  take down  fold up and pack back into the bag      
666,4.0,                       two things that you need to know before purchasing this tent  you have to purchase a seperate rain fly that is not included and secondly  you need to purchase a trap or something to place the tent on because a hole can be ripped in the bottom with small rocks or debris that may be on the ground  i know because this happened to the first tent i brought  just as adevertised  it is easy to assemble in minutes  while others are still trying to put the rods through theirs  but they don t give good instructions as to how you can easly fold it to place in back in the bag that it comes in  you can however find better instructions online  i also don t feel that this is truly a   person tent unless you want to be packed in like sardines in a can  i purposely brought it to have room for my wife and myself to have room to move around in the tent with our queen sized air mattress      
667,4.0,                       great tent  camped in it for   weeks in all kinds of weather  never leaked a drop  i did use seam sealer on the outside but coleman seals the inside seams with a special tape  one storm had wind shear and i knew the tent was coming down but it held up fine  it rained very hard and not one drop  i do use     tent stakes which is important for storms  buy the ones that look like nails my only complaint is i ve been trying to buy the rain fly since july and it s still on back order  it s suppose to be available          so if you want one you better jump on it quick because they don t stay in stock but only a couple days  amazon and coleman are the only reasonable places to buy one  that auction site asks up to five times more      
668,5.0,                       it is true this sets up in about a minute flat and can be setup by a single person   the flooring material is heavy duty and extends about a foot up from the ground all around to keep water and muck out   the tent material is heavy duty grade  the seams are sewn inside out and covered  its got plenty of ventilation  this product does everything its supposed to   but one note  it is advertised as a   man tent   technically you could stuff six men in there but it would be unbearably cramped   allowing for room to move about  and room for gear storage i say this is a   man tent   it is most ideal and perfect as a family tent for two adults and two kids      
669,5.0,                       this tent was so easy to set up and take down  i was able to do it by myself and i m short only       it also rained during my camping trip and from reading other review i was afraid that the inside would be wet but no leaking at all stayed dry and comfy      
670,4.0,                       they aren t kidding about the short set up time   we had our tent up  staked and ready to go in less than   minutes  and that was mostly into staking into hard ground   although it s advertised as a   man tent  with queen air mattress and our suitcases  i was more like a       man tent   you could fit   sleeping bags side by side  but there wouldn t be room for anything else      
671,5.0,                       super easy to setup and take down   i have many tents and this one is my favorite because of the integrated poles and how easy it is to setup   you can even fit a queen size inflatable mattress inside tent quality is just like any other coleman      
672,4.0,                       only gave it   stars because there is no way that you ll be able to fit   people in it  yet  it s a great tent  it sets up insanely quick and it also deconstructs quick as well  it fit my girlfriend and i perfectly with extra room to get dressed      
673,4.0,                       we took this tent out for the first time over turkey day weekend    ahhh cold weather camping  as some others have mentioned if you have ever purchased a tent before the man rating is not what it says  the man rating is for the amount of    lb men at      stuffed into the tent like sardines  this tent will fit three grown men with a little bit of extra room  my spouse    year old daughter and i fit with two cots and a little space at our feet for the dog tent is a quality product and yes i got it set up in less than    seconds the first time out of the bag  of course that doesnt including staking it down  tear down was pretty simple as well and fit back in the back pretty easily  still a little disappointed that it does not come with a rain fly  i mean come on what tent does not need a rain fly and     of them come with the tent  but for an extra     i will use a tarp thank you very much      
674,3.0,                       there are some good and bad qualities to this tent  i like this tent for  it s ease to put up and take down  the zipper windows  store nicely when open  it s also big and roomy  i don t like the sewing on this tent  there are many places where the edges of the fabric are exposed and not tucked into the sewn seam as they should be  it is very difficult to get into carrying bag after taking it down   i suppose this will get better as i figure out how to fold it better   the directions to put away aren t very good  there was also a pinched and torn cover on one of the  elbows   it took a lot of work to get it moved into the right spot  over all  it s a pretty good tent  just not the quality i m used to from coleman      
675,5.0,                       this tent is so great   i needed to downsize a little from my   man and this was just what i wanted  i watched to video that talked about how waterproof and wind resistant it is and just thought  ya  whatever  it s only     bucks  but it was  we encountered a morning of rain on our camp out that was unexpected and i watched it carefully no water inside the only thing i would say is this is a   man  and maybe a child  tent  unless you squeezed in like sardines oh  and it was super easy to put up and take down  best money i ever spent on camping       
676,4.0,                       the tent is very easy to set up and take down once you figure out how to bend the legs   my son  a scout leader  use it for a week at camp and was very pleased with it  he loved the fast set up and tear down time    i m not giving it   stars because i haven t seen how it stands up to high wind or rain yet   i do wish that it came with a rain fly as i d feel better if there was another layer to put on to help protect in that regard   he is   ft   and it was tall enough that it was comfortable for him to change clothes inside it and he had a cot which fit with no problem too   of course like every tent i ve ever bought this one is over rated on capacity  most people don t sleep with their bags touching  i d say it would be comfortable for   maybe   but i d lean towards   when you consider cot sleeping space and some room to store clothes or other gear      
677,5.0,                       i got this tent for a camping trip in october and it worked great   it sets up so fast   i was with a group of people and we set up camp every evening in a new place and broke down every morning   every day i got a lot of comments about how fast this thing sets up   not necessarily all that important  but definitely nice   its big   plenty of room for my wife and me and to lay out a blanket for the dogs to sleep on and still room for our bags   also nice to be able to stand up and get dressed without having to hunch over the down side is it is big and heavy   my camping trip was in airplanes and space and weight are always issues in planes   this thing weighs over    pounds and all folded up its close to   feet long   i thought about taking my old dome tent until i spent a night in this tent   that was all it took  quick set up tear down and room to stand to change clothes made it worth making room for it in the plane i got the rain fly just in case and used it just about every night  every morning the outside was soaked with dew  except for the couple mornings that it was covered with frost or ice  but it was always dry inside      
678,1.0,                       do not buy this tent  zipper broke the first time i used it  it leaked in multiple places after it had rained for about an hour  the only positive is the dark room tech  save your money and buy a different one instead      
679,5.0,                       as first time campers  and generally indoor people  my husband and i selected this tent to take on his son s first boy scout camping trip  we got the tent quickly  and when it came time to set it up at the campsite  we were able to do it easily  i watched a few of the videos on you tube so i d have some idea of how to do it  but the directions were easy to follow on the inside of the tent case when we got ready to pack up and head out  in a bit of a rush  breaking down the tent and getting it back into the case was super simple   the case itself is a little bit large so that you can get it back in without having to fold it map like to be exactly the same as it came out  most of our trouble was trying to get the air out of the tent that had been trapped in it when we took it down we had a tarp over it through some serious rain and wind  so i can t vouch for leaking issues  but we had a great trip and this tent was a big part of that i was very pleased with this tent      
680,5.0,                       temporarily turned into a diy sweat lodge sauna    but love it  set up easy wouldn t recommend for light hiking camping     but if the design appeals to ya  i d wager this would suit your needs    that said  i wouldn t try cramming more than   people avg adult size bodies  sleeping in this thing      
681,2.0,                       i bought it to go to a lake  the water came into the temp when it drizzled outside  i returned it      
682,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          good product overall  one missing seal caused the leaking in the middle of the night of christmas eve that i had to constantly wipe out the leak and could not sleep well  the video will explain everything  but glad my wife and daughter were sleeping tight while i was trying to keep them dry  lol      
683,1.0,                       not waterproof nor water resistant   water drips down the center ceiling   more of a   person tent      
684,1.0,                       it got a little breezy and the poles started bending  a coupling cracked and yes it was staked down  the bag it came in tore  disappointed with coleman  let s see if they honor the warranty as i am trying to send it back      
685,3.0,                       the side with one large door has enough slack that is is not vertical  when dry   which allows it to pool water  i ll add seam sealer  but the sides of the tent should be shedding water  not holding it  i ve triple checked all poles and readjusted stakes  still leaks    tbl spoons after   minutes of light spray from hose the darkness of the tent is nice  but if it is raining you are forced to shelter in the dark  which is why i would prefer some of the european styles that make only half the tent dark  with dark room divider      
686,3.0,                       the tent was okay but if you buy one make sure it has tent stakes before you head out for camping   opened ours the first time when we were ready to set it up and found it did not have the tent stakes included it was supposed to   had to run find tent stakes to use it   got with coleman on the issue and they wanted me to return the entire tent back to them versus reimbursing me the     bucks for tent stakes   packing it up and taking it to the post office was more trouble than it would be worth so after multiple emails i finally told them to forget it      
687,5.0,                       i don t often leave feedback  but had to share what a wonderful tent this is  especially given the price  we previously purchased a coleman dome    which we returned after we got wet during a rainstorm  it leaked from the top   this tent is just as easy to put up   takes less than a minute   but the fabric is much thicker than the dome    we know it won t leak from the top with the optional rainfly  and we love that we can stand up while inside  we were originally planning to purchase a very similar  much more expensive tent from rei   the rapid    which retails for          but are pleased to report that the coleman seems more durable  we tested the rapid   in the store   the fabric is thicker  and it was      less  anything rei sells is supposed to be exceptional quality whereas coleman is supposed to be    well    affordable     but i think this particular coleman tent is a gem      
688,4.0,                       i am glad i got this tent  though the expense was a bit high for camping     times a year  with arthritis issues creeping into my joints i m very happy with the ability to put the tent up by myself   i take the help  but i don t have to  the first time i used it turned out to be the one trip in    years that we had the worst weather  heavy rain and wind gusts up to   mph and temperatures in the    s   that all lasted hours before we decided to escape in the early morning  the thickness of the tent did provide some warmth with the windows closed  so glad i had packed the silk long johns   the not so sure news is there were leaks  the tent was well anchored but being blown around which created some wicking and some puddles from zippers  the rain managed to find the vunerable spots  nothing i couldn t mop up  but after several hours i was running out of towels and needed all my clothes to stay warm  i will probably seal the tent before the next use  though one weekend in    years is a good track record  suggestion  be sure you know where the hub zipper is inside the tent and that it s well velcroed if the weather turns nasty and pay attention to how you steak down the tent as too much pull can cause stress on the seams  other than those issues  i do like this tent and would recommend it  my   person instant tent is the perfect trump tower for my husband less camping trips with friends      
689,5.0,                       this tent is amazing  super easy and fast set up  lots of room  we didn t have any rain when we went camping so i can t say anything about being waterproof  but it s made very well and i bet it is      
690,5.0,                       we went camping for easter  it was very easy and quick for my son and i to put the tent up and bring down the only thing that took a little longer was packing it up into the bag it comes with but was successful we didn t encounter rain but had the rain fly on  just incase   hope it works if we ever do get rain while using it we were able to fit   twin size air mattresses side by side   had a little space by feet to walk out to exit or small tote bags      
691,5.0,                       the tent took me and my son under one minute to set up   easy to set up and take down   great tent  it didn t rain where i was  so don t know about water resistance  but all other things work great   i would recommend this tent  my friends also have bought these with all liking them very much      
692,3.0,                       sets up fast  purchased rain fly and   cans of camp dry  as you can see  not at all rainproof  good thing i just set it up in the yard before i used it       
693,5.0,                       my husband was able to put this tent up  alone  in under two minutes   we will never go back to the old style of tent   good quality too   as far as sizing   we are a family of    i don t know that you could fit any more people than        
694,5.0,                         years of use now and i still love it it s so easy to put up and take down     min tops it s held up to weather too  including multiple storms and prolonged saturating rain  not a drop got in my only complaint is that there is no rainfly included so you have to close the windows when its raining  the tent will not leak with the windows closed   the tent does have open ventilation on the top though so it doesn t get too muggy inside keep in mind though  this opening convenience comes at the expense of size   packaged in its carrying case  the tent is about    long it may be difficult to transport this in a small vehicle      
695,5.0,                       this tent has elevated our car camping experience dramatically  why use a smaller tent when you are rolling right up with your car  i wish i would have asked myself this years ago  the tent was super easy to set up  and break down   has tons of airflow when the many windows are unzipped  and seems sturdy enough  we ve only used it twice though and rain wind was not an issue both of these times so i can t comment on how it stands up to more challenging conditions  i love in southern california now and these conditions are really an issue for us  overall great purchase and highly recommend it to others     
696,5.0,                       so far this is a great tent   i had it up in less than a minute and began setting up my camping cot in seconds  the less time i spend fooling with my base camp the more time i have to snatch the lips off some fish   i slept in august in georgia and all the windows allowed for a nice breeze to blow through and keep me cool  interested to see how this thing handles some rain   i also ordered the rain fly for it but didn t see the point on putting it on as there was no rain      
697,2.0,                       great product but there shipping method is terrible  why would you ship it usps  product attempted to deliver on a friday and they said it wouldn t fit in the mail box  lol  ofcourse it won t  i had it prime and it took me   days to get what i purchased   i had to wait through the weekend to pick up the box at my local usps which was very busy in a monday  would buy another product like this but wouldn t at the same time because i dont wanna have to go through the same process again  its a hassle and its pointless paying prime if you have to wait   days to get your product      
698,5.0,                       why repeat what others have said  it goes up very easily   i found that the poles are very sturdy   yes this tent is bulky   it can fit in the bag that they provided if you swear a little  or just buy a bigger bag   we waterproofed the seams   no bugs  and not wetness even in the rain  it is roomy  not the biggest tent out there but considering the ease of instant setup  it does great    remember  no matter how many people the tent says it is for  you will feel more comfortable with fewer people   i can fit my wife and i and a queen blow up mattress with ease  but three sleeping bags would also work for two adults and a pre teen or child      
699,5.0,                       absolutely love this tent  i am a life changing camper and this is my  rd tent as an adult  love that the poles are integrated into the tent and all you do is extend them  i was somewhat skeptical but the reviews were really good so i took a shot and it couldn t be worse than my tent at the time that leaked like a sieve  disappointed that the rain fly is separate but it s a must and extremely easy to attach  as someone who takes good care of their camping equipment the one thing i struggle with is that for the final step of packing it essentially just gets stuffed into the tent bag and can t be folded up nicely      
700,3.0,                       really easy to set up and take down but  the floor is basically paper thin and tears super easy  a basic walmart folding chair ripped the floor in the first use  coleman wouldn t honor the warranty  said it s my fault  then on the second use small rocks on the dirt ground made several small holes  i d put this tent as almost useless and wouldn t recommend it unless you purchase a desperate tarp to lay down  if not for the easy of set up      
701,1.0,                       i read multiple reviews on this product but figured it was a coleman so it should hold up   i have now used it twice and it no longer works   one of the poles bent while putting away along with two zippers   one on the main cabin door  which is a joke by the way  their are flaps that get in the way of the zipper while trying to go up and down  and the  nd zipper that broke is on the carry case i tried to send back to amazon and they do not have another in stock so they are trying to give me a   person tent as a replacement and credit me back the balance   i wouldn t recommend buying this      
702,5.0,                       i had my doubts  but it was great  so easy to setup  it took   minutes to unbox and setup   this was our first tent camping trip as mom  son amd    lb german shepherd   we used a queen and single air mattress and had toom at the foot of the tent for our clothes   we had   hours of rain and the tent stayed dried   i did use seam sealer prior to our camping trip   this tent is durable and delivered everything it said it would  the only con was when packing to go home we couldnt get it small enough to fix back in storage bag      
703,5.0,                       this tent is amazing   i took it on a weekend camping trip at the beach  it s by far the easiest and fastest tent i have ever put up  we had a rain shower come through the first night  but had no problems staying dry inside the tent even without a rain fly  in the morning we unzipped a couple of the windows to let air circulate  friends were jealous and i could not recommend this tent more       
704,4.0,                       amazingly easy to set up   takes less than a minute to open and stand  and a couple more minutes to stake it down and run the guide wires   we ve used it a couple times  but not in any bad weather   the mechanism is a little counter intuitive   the bars actually seem to fold backwards   if it isn t used correctly  it seems like it would be easy to break  but once you know how to work it  we have not had any problems and the mechanism works smoothly   set it up about a half dozen times now   last trip we set it up  found a better camp site  broke it down  moved it and set it back up in much less time than we could have set up our last tent once door zipper seems to want to catch and the less than rugged design are the reasons for   instead of   stars      
705,1.0,                       brand new purchase for a camping trip   at first was really pleased with the ease of setup   all went well setting it up  then on the second time entering the tent the zipper ripped and we could not get out of the tent  it started to rain as well and the tent was not water proof   not happy with this purchase at all      
706,1.0,                       leaks from the top   triple checked set up instructions and product photo  but water still pooled a bit at the very top and dripped continuously through the fabric itself   not even a seam  soaking everything in the middle of he tent   of course we didn t use it till the return period had passed  so a real waste for us     
707,4.0,                       very easy to put up  my husband and i can get the tent set up and ready to go within      minutes  including unrolling it from the bag  the poles just click into place  i m      and can stand up straight just fine  my husband is  ft and can stand up straight in the very middle but has to bend his head a little around the sides  we got the   person tent for just the two of us for the extra room for bags and air mattress and we re glad we got the extra room to move around easy and store extra bins inside if needed      
708,5.0,                       first thought on receiving this box was    holy crap this thing is heavy  trying to open it   amazed at how well packaged it is  also the bag for holding this thing actually has room  most of the time its fitted for one time and bam ya need a tote  i will update with use later but i had to get that out there  its on sale right now for     normally      its got to be worth it      
709,5.0,                       pleasant purchase  works as advertised  could be a little more generous with the storage bag  plenty big  i m      and room to spare standing up      
710,1.0,                       it was easy to put and to take down  that s all the pros  the first time we used the tent    zippers broke  there s also no  or extremely little  storage  and no hooks or hanging straps to add any   one of the   mesh pockets built in wasn t even a pocket  more of a vent  which i learned when i stored my headlamp in there and it slid down the outside front of the tent  great that it takes    seconds to put up  but it s terribly made      
711,5.0,                       tent is great  easy set up and take down  plenty of room for   of us this is a tall tent with headspace to move around in only issue we had last trip was the outside zipper was a bit sticky  not sure if it is going to be a major issue in the future      
712,3.0,                       this tent is very easy to set up and take down  overall design is great  size is good for   people  i had this tent spring a leak the first time i used it though  right under the side windows where the hanging pockets are  i would highly recommend getting a sealant before using  you don t want to wake up in the middle of the mountains with an inch of rain on the bottom of your tent         
713,5.0,                       this tent is super easy to set up  and put back together again  it is a little bit heavy so it s not something you want to carry up to the top of the mountain  that s for the average user who just goes to a campsite it is very convenient      
714,5.0,                       excellent value  held up good in stong winds  well ventilated  we were able to fit a queen air matress and a single cot simultaneously  setup is ridiculously easy  taking it down was only slightly trickier  highly recommend for car camping      
715,1.0,                       purchased this because we do a lot of scout camping even with the rain fly the tent floods drastically any time it rains  any one that knows anything about scout camping we camp in all weather  found a cheap walmart tent that we stayed dryer in   we are now having to go look for a new tent      
716,4.0,                       arrived early  perfect condition  first setup took   minute  very nice tent with great features  only minor complain is a fairly strong mildew musty smell that hopefully will go away  tents seems well designed and built      
717,5.0,                       this tent is roomy  i am      tall  i can stand up in it with my head just touching the roof  i tested the water resistance by spraying it down with a garden hose  with the accessory rain fly it stayed bone dry inside  the tent does as advertised by setting up very quickly  taking it down took a little longer  i m sure with a few more set ups and take downs that will improve with practice  overall i m very impressed with the tent      
718,5.0,                       i have been backpacking for years but have slowly getting my wife and   boys into camping  this tent offers a ton of room for our big family  the black out tech is really something awesome  like total darkness      
719,5.0,                       this tent was easy to set up  it fit my queen size air bed with room for a child s sleeping bag and some rooms for dogs  not sure about the built in rain protection though      
720,1.0,                       i saw the dimensions were   x  online   not the case inside   i opened it up to try putting our air mattress in it and it fits with only a little space on the side  the description said it could hold    queen air mattresses there is barley room for   queen and hardly any other space  very unhappy  my fault for waiting so long to use it  ordered it around black friday  not going camping till april  but calling this a   person tent is a joke      
721,5.0,                       everyone laughed at me because i showed up on a camping trip and never opened my new tent  they thought i should of practiced putting up first at home   i had this sucker up in literally    seconds and now i can do it in under    seconds  great tent for the money and easy to use  now all buddies are buying one  hahaha     
722,5.0,                       took a couple practices to get it figured it out but once you do it s very simple to set up and take down  i could probably even do it  in the dark after drinking now but wouldn t recommend that for the first set up if you re used to the bendy fiberglass pole type tent  used it for   days straight  no leaks during the rain  no bugs getting through the screens  zippers seem to be holding up fine  i m      and can stand upright everywhere expect the corners which is awesome  has a couple little pouches for storage  i guess the only downside is it s kind of heavy and bulky  you definitely wouldn t want to bring it hiking or carry it very far  and maybe one of those little zippers to run an extension cord through wold be cool but not a deal breaker  overall great tent and i would recommend to a friend  or a stranger shopping on amazon      
723,5.0,                       the ease of set up is the least of the joys of owning this tent  it took me only     minutes to set up the tent   alone  the door is off set on the front of this tent  making it easier to come in and out without stepping on all of your gear  the zipper is hardy and the windows are generously large  i can stand up  mostly  in the center of the tent  the greatest feature of this tent is apparent when you go to take it down  it is a fast fold   like a folding unbrella  the tent bag has the surprise  on the back you can remove a strip of label to uncover a hidden gusset in the tent bag  finally  a tent bag that is big enough to put the tent back in  i love this tent so much that i have been bragging about it to every camper i know  don t be surprised if there is a backorder on these  they are that good      
724,4.0,                       only complaint i had was during the teardown that it did not fold back up as easy as it was to set up  refolding the layers or seams is time consuming to do  otherwise i love the tent and have no complaints      
725,3.0,                       i received my coleman   person instant tent and immediately set it up to check it out   it s exactly as described   after reading reviews  i opted to buy a fan to help with condensation issues on my first camping trip  a   nighter in the adirondacks  our second day brought us an issue with the tent   we noticed that one of the roof hooks that connected to a front pole had a broken seem and the hook was pulling away from the main tent   we hadn t experienced any high winds  and being only the second time this tent had seen fresh air  i was obviously upset that it lacked the quality i was promised i unclipped the hook  and left it off  rather than cause more of a tear  and the tent appeared okay   rather than send the tent back  i ll find a way to fix it the second day and night of our trip was extremely wet   heavy rains lasted throughout the day and night   the tent did act as if it repelled the water but i will say that it was not a pleasant night s sleep   we closed the windows and relied on the fan and ceiling vents to help with air circulation   obviously  there was some condensation  but it couldn t have been the sole cause of the hours of dripping water from the high point of the ceiling all in all  i m more upset with the tear in the roof hook then the condensation leak issue in the ceiling   it poured rain for hours all day and night and the tent stayed relatively dry  other than the dripping during the night i ve decided that on our next trip  i will set up a tarp over our tent so that we can sleep with the windows open and not worry about an annoying drip all night long      
726,5.0,                       i love this tent   i am      and i can stand in the center of it without hitting my head or fearing that i will   it literally goes up in a couple of minutes   hats off to coleman on this one      
727,2.0,                       i give an extra star for being easy to set up which i ll have to say was pretty cool at first  however  the purpose of a tent is to provide shelter in any weather and our camp out involved scattered showers over the course of a weekend  it rained the first night we were there and rain started dripping on us in our sleep through the ceiling  when i finally got up i also noticed that water was seeping through the walls of the tent as well  all of the stuff that was in the tent was soaking wet for the whole weekend  we had to dry what we could by the fire but it was a huge hassle to deal with  i am very disappointed in the performance of this tent and it s lack of durability to the elements      
728,5.0,                       this tent is fantastic for quick set up and breakdown    person tent  i don t think i d recommend that but absolutely perfect for   people  pop up tents have come along way and this one is cutting edge      
729,1.0,                       easy to set up  floor seems solid this will be returned however because in the first night we used it we got very wet just from the dew  no rain at all  and we had lots of water in the tent      
730,2.0,                       no weather resistance at all  got drenched inside  their video of how rainproof it is and their test lab is a complete sham  the only good thing about it is it s easy and quick setup  that s about it  if you camp at rainy spots please go find something else     
731,5.0,                       this tent does pop up in under a min  it was fabulous  it didn t rain nor did we really tighten it down in case it rained on our trip so i can t speak for that part   it had a great amount of room to stand up in   we put a double bed cot in there and it was perfect i think it is a great buy      
732,4.0,                       super easy to set it up and very comfortable  it s just me and my husband  and the dog  honestly i would not get a smaller one  we had company a couple of times and it worked but definitely would not fit a fourth person  that s said  i do use the blow up mattress  which takes a lot of room the downside for has just been the packing  after you open it the first time it is hard to put it back in the bag  it gathers air and it get so big  i m trying to be more patient and i also use a rope to keep it together      
733,4.0,                       this was as good as advertised  i didn t even have to read the instructions while putting this up for the first time one late night  it took literally   minutes  my camp mates were green with envy   the tent is easy to adjust and very stable without staking it down in low to moderate winds  it had enough room for me  my sleeping bag  backpack and miscellaneous items but may be a little small for more than one person  it would have gotten five stars but it had a small amount of water inside  condensation  on one morning after it had rained a lot the previous night and the temperature had gone down to about    degrees  the thing dries really fast when left in the sun  is fairly light and is easy to put back into the bag  definitely a good idea to buy the rainfly just in case      
734,3.0,                       this is very easy to set up and gives you alot of room     my issues with it is that the zippers get stuck constantly infact had to return the first one i recieved because the sewing on one of the windows was done so bad that you couldnt moe the zipper at all   plan on getting the rain fly because it is not water proof found that out the hard way n all in all it is a nice tent and like i said is an easy quick set up not like the tents with the polls that you struggle putting together then trying to slide them in the slots       
735,5.0,                       love this tent   it truly goes up in a minute  i had my younger son time me     well constructed and sturdy   great price too      
736,3.0,                       does not fit   queens  maybe little thin air mattresses  i have a queen and twin and no room for our stuff      
737,4.0,                       not waterproof at all    night of rain and everything inside got wet  held up well in heavy wind  one plastic piece broke on the bottom that holds the corner to the pole but i fixed it  super easy to set up  i wish the windows had something to hold the flaps when they are open but it has great air flow  when it s in the bag it s kinda big  twice the size of the typical tent  needs waterproofing but love how easy it is to set up      
738,1.0,                       it states in the description  that the tent has room for two queen size mattresses   not   after inflating each queen size mattress  they pushed out the sides   i had to let air out of one mattress and it still was a tight squeeze   specifications state it has a   foot center height  that s it   just the center   it tapers down  so with two mattresses  there is no space for camping gear or personal items      
739,5.0,                       at first this tent seemed a bit too big  but i personally think that s its the perfect size  it s a   person tent if you get pretty close together  but it will fit   or   people no problem  we literally took it out of the bag and set it up in less than   minutes  i love how there are windows on all   sides and it is tall enough to stand up inside of it  but we are both shorter than  ft   we did not have a rain fly so the morning dew made its way inside in the morning  but it was only like   drops  i m sure a rainfly would take tare of that no problem  also  there s two small vents at the top to help circulate air without compromising privacy  it also has small zip pockets inside for your smaller items  also  in the past i have always had a hard time putting tents back in the bag and actually zipping it up  i have successfully set up this tent and zipped it back up in the bag without having to resort to breaking the extra release strap    twice  also  in the bag  it is fairly compact  i would definitely buy again  but make sure to get the rainfly if there s a chance of moisture      
740,5.0,                       i really like this tent  it is very easy to put up and lightweight  i ve used this tent a few time with my rv and i love the added convenience of having an additional area to put things or people in      
741,4.0,                       great tent and easy to put up  one person can put this tent up in   minutes  also  all the window options allow for plenty of ventilation  however  if you have   people  it will be a tight fit  it s good for   adults  a dog  or  rd person   and your gear update  june       still going strong  great tent update  july       just got back from camping and this sucker has got to go  gave us   years but now there are little pin holes forming here and there and the weather stripping along the seams on the inside have began to peel away in several places  had to knock a star off      
742,5.0,                       super easy to set up just lock the bars in place  to take it apart just push a button on each bar and it collapses  fold them backwards  roll it up and put it back in the case and you re ready to go     
743,5.0,                       it s a great tent that s incredibly easy to put up and take take  can tell it was well designed i m      so the   person is a bit too small so i need to get the   person since there s a little lady and a dog included highly recommend      
744,4.0,                       i ve only used this tent once and it worked great  it feels comfortable with two twin air mattresses in side  i don t like that there are two zips on the front door instead of one continuous curved zip   it seems like bugs can get in easily that way  i also don t like that it didn t come with a rain flap the plus side   it goes up in literally    seconds  it says two minutes but honestly you don t need that much time  i impressed everyone at my campsite with it      
745,5.0,                       if they would make a   person tent with the exact setup for backpacking  it would be perfect   to be able to stand up in a tent makes any trip better   i am trying to modify the   person one i have now until they make a  person tent      
746,4.0,                       this is the best tent ever  was a bit concerned with acouple if the negative reviews but did as other users suggested and bought the rain fly and sprayed with sealant  piped up in less than five minutes and not a drop of rain entered from the camping storm we encountered      
747,3.0,                       the tent does not come with stakes   went camping nit knowing   not good      
748,1.0,                       first trip out and water seeps right through the walls even in light rain  we had the rain fly and without that water would be dripping on us and our gear  i even sprayed an entire can of waterproof spray before we went out  i have had many tents over the years but none that leaked this bad  this is for the   person cabin tent  weathertec  some sort of sadistic joke  sending it right back for a refund      
749,4.0,                       great tent  simple setup and plenty of room for    i wouldn t sleep six unless we re all hauled away to a refugee camp  the seams do need to be attended too  nothing seam seal won t take care of  purchase tarp to put the tent on  as the bottom is very thin  i picked up a roll of indoor outdoor carpet to lay inside also  optional  to ward off sharp rocks     
750,2.0,                       definitely need a rain hood for this  i set up straight out of the box and it rained night   into our camping trip  there was a complete flood in the tent      
751,3.0,                       do not use this in inclement weather  we got rained on first night in it and woke up to puddles inside  every seam leaked and water came through the too vents that you can t seal up  it does set up and take down super easy  great for good weather      
752,5.0,                       even though i won t actually go camping again until spring  i am excited about using my new coleman tent first of all  the purchase transaction was excellent   a great product  at a great price  with free shipping  the only thing amazon didn t do was actually give me the product for free as for the coleman   person instant tent  it is a fantastic product if my initial observations are true   having fought with traditional tents in the past  i took this tent out on my driveway and in less than    minutes i had it out of the box  read simple instructions  and actually had it completely set up    all by myself    unbelievable  coleman has outdone itself with this line of instant up tents      
753,5.0,                       my son goes with his atv often up to the mountains and camps out  he absolutely loves this tent  he is    and can stand upright in the tent  it has plenty of space for storage  exactly as posted      
754,5.0,                       super easy to put up and take down   held up great in the rain and the wind  just don t touch the sides when its raining or it does feel moist   it fit our queen mattress great with a little room to spare   loved this tent and highly recommend it      
755,5.0,                       just bought my second one  this  new  version has a top that won t leak  no need for a rainfly on these new ones  there are no more openings on top    i bought my first one     years ago  used it a lot  but it started leaking water both from the top and fabric  i learned never to store tents in super hot southern sheds  and never spray insect repellent inside of a tent  super quick to put up and very spacious inside  great ventilation and very sturdy  please  coleman  bring your aussie version to the us   their s has a nifty roof panel rainfly front door roof attachment   the tent fits nicely in it s carry case with strap but it is a little heavy and bulky so not good for hiking trips  worth the money      
756,5.0,                       i delayed buying this tent until the rainfly became available and in stock  it is kind of strange that the tent does not come with a rainfly  although some say you can get by without the rainfly  good luck with that if it rains hard  now that i have bought and used the   person tent  with the rainfly  i was totally impressed with how easy it is to set up  one person can truly erect this tent in a couple of minutes  it is well made and practical  like all tents  you can only sleep   people comfortably in the   person tent  it is tall allowing one to stand up when inside the tent  the tent spikes are rather wimpy so i recommend you buy some decent stakes to use instead  the tent folds up fast and surprisingly  easily fit in its tote bag  i highly recommend it     
757,5.0,                       this tent was awesome   well made  went up quickly   don t expect it to comfortably fit as many people as it claims  but that s true of every tent ever   my girlfriend and i were very comfortable in here with a really large queen sized air mattress and out stuff      
758,2.0,                       didn t come with a rain cover  that cost     more  very heavy    times the weight of a normal tent   i got soaked when it rained   use it with a cot if you can  you ll get water in the  bottom      
759,4.0,                       this is a great tent  i highly recommend it however if you are actually looking for a tent that is   person this is not your tent  you cannot fit   air mattresses in this tent  this tent is great for me and my husband with enough room to stand and change along side the air mattress however we cannot use this tent if we are taking the children  size up for    people      
760,5.0,                       it was given as a gift   bride and groom very pleased     
761,4.0,                       this tent is nice and tall perfect for   people  its breaks down rather large so sometimes if our car is tight on space we opt for a standard dome tent  my biggest complaint is that water condeses heavily on the inside of the tent even on dry days   it gets so wet inside it feels like a rainy day  it also does not include a rainfly      
762,5.0,                       i just received this and am very pleased  it goes up very easily  it is also taller than i expected  the description lists the height as       but i am      and my head did not touch the ceiling when standing in the middle   i would call this a good two person tent  or two people with a child  don t expect to sleep   people in here  also one queen sized inflatable will fit with space on each side to roll out of bed  i bought the rain fly to go with it just because i don t feel comfortable without a rain fly over me in a rainstorm  the vents in the roof are very modestly sized and the windows when unzipped form a natural pocket to tuck into to keep them out of the way  for the price it seems like a good value      
763,2.0,                       after watching the video in the ad  and seeing the reviews   i was very confident in ordering this tent to take to the beach  unfortunately  i was thoroughly disappointed with its performance  there was a very light rain at the beach and i woke up to droplets falling on my face  water seeped in at every seam  at the lake  there was no rain  but condensation seeped in  i would not order this again and am contimplating returning it      
764,5.0,                       this tent is great  it takes about    seconds to set up with ease  this tent has been set up for   days in rain and did not leak  however it did have a lot of condensation in the morning  i will be purchasing a   person tent for my next tent because i own a queen mattress and it takes up about     of the tents space     
765,5.0,                       set up the tent in my backyard shortly after receiving it   i had watched several youtube videos on setting up tent which made set up even easier   i also read the instructions which it seems some of the people in the videos didn t do   i took my time since it was the first time and it took about   minutes to get it opened up  i didn t stake it out or run guy lines which would naturally add to the set up time   i haven t received the rain fly yet so can t comment on that   looked it over to make sure it was all there  and it was  this tent is well made and will be perfect size for me and the wife  my first impression   stars  i will update this review if i have any issues in the future      
766,3.0,                       tent set up and came down very quickly   tent claims to be for six people  but had barely enough space for three with air mattresses and packs   when it rained  small amount of water came in through seams near bottom and sides of tent  from rain fly runoff   not very happy to say had to spray seams with sealer after camping trip      
767,5.0,                       easy set up  sturdy quality tent   take down and fold up not quite so quick   took a bit of trial and error but it does easily go back in the bag after expansion   next use will be much easier now that i have the process down      
768,5.0,                       well made  lightweight and easy to set up with one person     
769,5.0,                       when i ordered it  i didn t know what i can expect  even there are some bad reviews  i still decide to give it a try  gosh  that was a right decision  i am so pleased with this purchase   soooooo easy to set up  it takes one person    seconds to set up  it would take a little more time to tire down  but it is still very easy  the time you need to spend is to get the area out of tent to fold it   great color  very nice size  you can stand up inside  i love the windows that you can unzip and just leave the screen window  over all  i have nothing not to like about this items haven t used it in rain or wind  don t know how it would work in that whether      
770,5.0,                       i was a little concerned buying this tent based on reviews on it  however i have taken it out three times in the last   months and it has worked flawlessly  it goes up in minutes and breaks down as quickly  i recently had it out in a bad pacific northwest down pour that lasted all night and everything inside was bone dry      
771,3.0,                       i hate this marketing bs where they tell you it is a   person tent and it is more like a     person  if they had told me it was this small  i would have happily paid extra to buy the bigger one  so frustrated  we bought   single airbeds and they don t fit in it      
772,3.0,                       easy up   down  appeared to be well made  however   zipper to close up tent was missing   not good when camping in mountains with bears  raccoons and coyotes and a very curious and active toy poodle   returned the tent and purchased one i csn stand up in      
773,4.0,                       super quick and easy set up but deff does get damp and the sides so if your bedding s touching it  it also gets damp     
774,3.0,                       i live in washington and it s literally always raining  i thought i would be okay because the description says build it rain fly  buy an extra rainfly because you don t want to wake up in the middle of the night and have i ve cold water dripping on you  i had to get up and cover the tent with a extra tarp we had  not cool other than that the tent was nice a spacious  i fit a double queen air mattress and still had room for maybe a standard twin mattress or a nice folding table if you want to make it look pretty inside      
775,2.0,                       pros  nice size inside  can fit two queen air mattress but with little other room  color extremely easy to set upcons  went camping by the ocean and the condensation in the inside of the tent was immense  door zipper gets caught easily on the flap covering it      
776,1.0,                       the tent was missing a zipper on the door  which we didn t find until we were     miles away from home with the tent  the idea of a bear walking into the tent is unsettling  the stitching is very poor  threads are broken and hanging all over the inside  so disappointed      
777,4.0,                       love this tent  so easy to put up  especially when we setup in the dark   recommend the fly  didn t use and water came in from the top  otherwise perfect tent for scout family camping        
778,4.0,                       this tent was really easy to set up  i like how tall it is  you can stand inside  but it rained pretty hard at times and the inside walls of the tent we re just as wet as the outside  if anything was touching the inside of the tent it was wet    we had little puddles on the inside  nothing major and i guess it could have been worse  the rain fly that we ordered separately was the only part that didn t let rain get through on the top of the tent   also hard to put away when you re done with it especially if it s wet and the poles being attached   is there really such a thing as a totally waterproof tent        
779,5.0,                       i setup the tent in quartzsite az and the first night had winds of    to    mph and the tent had with stood all of the buffering   very happy with this purchase   bravo for the design      
780,4.0,                       i love these tents and it does set up in one minute  however  the storage bag is way too small to get the tent back in  i have an older tent just like this and the storage back is much bigger  why in the world would coleman make the storage bag smaller makes no sense  that is why i only gave   stars  the storage bag is useless  it s like trying to stuff    pounds of kitty litter in a  lb bag      
781,4.0,                       i will give it the  th star if it lasts   years i took this tent out camping last week for the first time  this thing is awesome  my girlfriend set it up while i set up a friend s   man tent since he hadn t arrived yet  before i got the other tent poles out of the bag  she already finished putting this thing up  truely instant we comfortably fit a queen     air mattress in it  what else can i say      
782,1.0,                       this is a horrible tent  easy to set up but moisture goes through the tent  this is also not big enough for   people  even with two people hardly any room to keep your other belongings  very difficult to get in and out since there s only one side opens up in the front  i had a horrible camping because of this tent       
783,5.0,                       i m glad i spent the extra money for this tent  we went camping in south georgia and sure enough  a summer storm hit   we experienced wind and heavy rain  we were completely dry nothing got wet and the tent held together as it should      
784,4.0,                       set up was extremely easy only took us    seconds and we had never set it up before so it was just very simple  durability is very good zippers don t seem to be very flimsy it also rained when we were camping for about   days so it s very waterproof  slightly smaller inside than i expected but still very roomy and comfortable  only downside is that it doesn t keep heat very well otherwise  great buy      
785,1.0,                       do not trust this tent  i took my chance  we camped right on klamath river  beautiful weather but a night since we were literally  feet away from river  the breeze from the river penetrated easily  walls were cover with water and drops kept running down throughout the night lucky we had extra blankets and clothing we used to block the water at the bottom  this tent is over priced for cheap material       
786,2.0,                       i love the size and speed of set up  however  even a light rain fills the tent with water despite having the rain fly on  don t waste your money on this or the rain fly unless you can control the weather      
787,5.0,                       i wanted a functional tent for car camping in national parks   a    year old grandma and   year old boy got this up in    minutes  the tent stayed dry in spring rain   the additional rain fly is necessary    it is much too heavy for backpacking but for my purpose  casual family camping four or five times a year  it works perfectly      
788,1.0,                       super unhappy with this purchase    my family and i were super excited to use this for camping this weekend  set it up in the living room  it has holes in the corners  it s dirty  the stickers and labels are worn     i will admit it s very easy to set up and take down  it fits my family and i perfectly     i am returning it because it s not fair for the price  i wanted a new one not a used tent         
789,5.0,                       man i couldn t believe the darkroom tech had it in the snow the first weekend through rain  hail  snow    it held strong with common sense of clearing snowload  also   i am six feet six inches tall and i can stand up fully in the middle of the tent and barley bend at the neck in the corners      
790,4.0,                       used this while on a camping trip  good tent  never rained  so i don t about how waterproof it is  gave it   stars because the door is a very bad design  only on one side of tent and almost impossible to zip up or down one handed      
791,5.0,                       these tents are so easy to put up and take down  i already owned one  but i bought this one for my mom as a present  i love how tall it is  you can stand up inside of it      
792,5.0,                       was very pleased with tent on it s first camping trip to the rockies          no complaints   is amazingly easy to set up and tear down   do recommend getting a rain tarp to avoid walls getting damp to the touch         
793,5.0,                       wow  talk about easy to set up  and only a one person setup  i fly my queen sized mattress in it with some room to store some additional items  i didn t have to get through any storms in it  but i had no concerns if it did storm      
794,1.0,                       it arrived too late for my camping trip but when i opened it i noticed it didnt have a rain cover  turns out you have to spend akother    bucks or more  the description said in came with rainfly but it doesn t      
795,3.0,                       it s not very weather resistant unless you buy the rain fly for the top of it which is separate of course which i think sucks but what are you going to do they have to get their money somehow     
796,5.0,                       well it has a good point and a bad pointlet me tell u bad points well we camped near the lake and i could see water droplets inside the tent good point its amazing for   people very spacious      
797,1.0,                       the tent itself is nice  however  the legs are fragile  if someone or something falls on the tent  the legs snap in two  i called coleman to try to get a replacement leg  the service representative said the legs are not replaceable  they can be replaced be removing a couple screws  so this really surprised me  they tried to sell me a new tent instead  what a waste of money  i got only one use out of this tent      
798,2.0,                       but the design of this tent left me feeling like i got a cheap version of a coleman product  the seems are off and the zipper probably won t last through one more trip  i m very disappointed in this tent      
799,2.0,                       camped two nights during july  th weekend for the very first time use  then the zipper on the entrance got broken  can t fix it  sadly the return window closed as this item was ordered in april and it has a one month return policy      
800,5.0,                       just got this tent today so we have never taken it camping     but it is a good size for two people and very easy to set up   i think you could fit a full   queen size mattress with some room to spare the only thing i wish was different was that the door would open up all the way instead of being like a half door on one side      
801,1.0,                       throwing this in the trash  not waterproof  easy setup so for quick exit and quick start for the camping  but this is  repeat is not  water proof  water hits the tent and then sink through and drips inside  extremely sadden  had hopes this tent would last years but nope  now i m looking for a pop up tent that s waterproof      
802,5.0,                       my husband and i are not serious campers  we really only get out maybe once or twice a year   we wanted a simple and roomy tent  he is      but not so big finding a spot for it is difficult  we recently purchased and used this tent on a   day trip   it is tall enough for my husband to stand in with a little head clearance   we had no problem with moisture or bugs or whatever   but we were camping   water and bugs are outside   it is not a big concern of ours   the ease of putting up the tent and comfort is   this tent went up in maybe     mins   we were comfortable on a queen air mattress with plenty of room for our bags and backpacks   we did purchase and use a rain fly   we had a fun four days and packed up and left in record time   the tent was just as easy to collapse and roll up and setting it up   we loved it      
803,5.0,                       got to finely use this state of the art tent  why have we not thought of a tent that goes up in    seconds  is made very well and slides right back in it s cary case is beyond me  this tent is so cool  love it  you have to buy the rain fly for this tent   it will leak in the rain without it      sold seperatly           
804,4.0,                       great tent only issue exit zipper was a little tightly sewn    reminder leave windows slightly open when sleeping    condensation does build up   up in about a minute  down about   minutes    again leave windows slightly open to let air out otherwise going to take longer to colapse and fold up      
805,5.0,                       camping good in high winds  not recommended for long distances  i have a four man version  recommend the six man version  durable  do not forget the rain fly cover is sold separately   but in short i  do like this tenet very much      
806,1.0,                       ordered in march  easy setup   used it for the first time today   had to leave camp ground in middle of night because it was raining and this tent leaks   several places on zipper seams and in walls      
807,5.0,                       perfect  i bought this to break the monotony of  staying at home  so my boys could camp out in my backyard  i m a single mom and was able to erect it and break it down by myself rather quickly  and my boys loved it      
808,4.0,                       i usually don t review things but felt that i had to  i used to use a small sundome tent and decided to buy this one for more room  it does set up very quickly  you can do it yourself even though the directions say to use   people  one reason i wanted it was so i can stand up in the tent  i m not that tall but the sundome is very small  the other thing was that i can put a queen sized air mattress in it and have more room for luggage or whatever  i only used it for   people  i m dubious that you could actually fit    but   would work comfortably i read all the reviews before buying and i saw all the reviews saying that it leaks in rain  i went ahead because i don t plan to camp in the rain  well  the first trip  one of the nights  it rained  hard  we moved our chairs and a little table into the tent and ate our dinner inside the tent while it pounded outside  i was afraid of leaks and kept running my fingers down the seams but never felt anything wet  it rained for a couple hours and intermittently over night and not a drop got inside  so  i don t know if i just got a good tent or if coleman listened to all the complaints about leaks and improved it so  i like it a lot and would recommend it  the one thing to realize about it  this was sort of a problem in a couple camp sites  is that the footprint is quite large  the tent is   x  and the guy lines add several feet on each side  so if you use the guy lines  the footprint may be    feet or more in each direction  you can leave the guy lines off if there is no wind  i was just afraid that any wind would damage it as it is so tall      
809,2.0,                       the   person text was spacious  i like the fact that it s extreme easy to set up  as i was packing it up after my one day camping trip  i noticed it already had a rip  so i returned it instantly it s devastating  you would think that coleman will use a better and more durable material  if it was price at     i would have kept it  but to pay over      with taxes for a tent that r ps after one use doesn t make sense coleman let me down     
810,4.0,                       i love how fast and easy it is to put up and take down  i hate there is not a window on all sides of the tent  there was   ventilation  i live in the desert so that was a bit of a problem      
811,1.0,                       i bought this tent for a camping trip with my family  we expected to find a nice new clean tent  and instead we were met with a dirty and trashy tent with nasty socks inside  i was appalled and embarrassed by this product  the distributor should be ashamed of themselves  because  i refused to let this dirty purchase ruin our camping trip  we were forced to spend our quality family time cleaning and disinfecting the tent before using it  this purchase was the worst in my entire life  i will never buy another tent from amazon      
812,5.0,                       this tent is fantastic  we survived a microburst in it  the walls bowed in  the rain fly fluttered madly  and we got a little rain that came in the corners  but the tent held  i highly recommend getting the rainfly  and better stakes than it comes with  but with those  this tent probably saved our lives      
813,5.0,                       we ve used this tent a few times now and it s been great   it literally is a   minute setup  and just as fast to breakdown   this tent is a perfect balance between  no hassle  setup and  instant tents  that might save a few seconds but are very tiny and cheap   of course  as all tents  it s way too small to fit      but that s to be expected        
814,4.0,                       setting up a tent isn t the most difficult task in the world  but it does require some time   the coleman instant tent is a great step in the evolution of the tent   initially i was skeptical about how  instant  this could really be but after watching a few setup videos on youtube i was sold   when i got it through amazon prime  free shipping    i immediately opened up the box and set it up by myself   it took me   minutes by myself the first time out without reading instructions   why take the extra time to get camp setup  enjoy the outdoors and the experience without having to spend time putting together some poles   there s enough room for me to stand up fully  i m        and while it could use a few more interior pockets and and a rain hood  overall i highly recommend this tent   after both me and my sister have used this  we don t know if we can ever go back to non instant setups      
815,2.0,                       i ordered the   person tent   got sent a   person tent in a case that said   person  this was the most claustrophobic tent i ve ever had   gotten  i had a a queen size mattress in there   there was no room for my other things that i needed      
816,4.0,                       i received the tent defective  one of the window meshes had a hole in it  other than that a great tent and i highly recommend it  amazon did replace the tent for me though      
817,4.0,                       we purchased this tent to mostly use in our boyscout outings of course the  st weekend trip we went on with the scouts  we had one of the worst rainstorms we have had all year  it rained almost    in       hours and the wind was blowing between      mph  it seemed like we were in the middle of a hurricane the tent didn t leak at all  in fact we were one of the only families that tent didn t leak  no we didn t spray any after market tent sealer on on it either  it didn t leak right out of the box we had purchased the rainfly separately just in case  as so many of the reviews stated it leaked this is our  st coleman tent  it was expensive but was a good buy we are happy      
818,5.0,                       didn t know exactly what to expect  but really glad we went with this tent  the set up couldn t be easier  i love the ceiling nights  wood be nice if the rain cover came with it but all in all it s a good tent      
819,3.0,                       not rain proof  water comes in even with canopy  not good with moisture or humidity      
820,5.0,                       never seen a tent that is so hassle free and easy to setup even solo   i did have any issue with one of the zippers coming off track the first time i used it but they sent me a replacement immediately          
821,5.0,                       so easy to assemble and popped up quickly  and very lightweight   used with the rainfly accessory   survived   days of torrential rain in the tent with no leakage problems   dried out easily  too   highly recommended      
822,2.0,                       extremely disappointed  made this purchased because of its waterproof claims and patented technology for my family who are victims of     earthquake in puerto rico three weeks ago and are forced to camp outdoors  tent and rain fly  purchased separately  arrived jan      set up was easy  however when it rained earlier this week  water began coming directly through the walls  rain fly helps stop rain from coming through the top  but the wall leaks regardless      
823,5.0,                       just youtube videos of how easy this tent is to set up and take down  can very literally and easily be unpacked  set up  taken down  and packed back up in under four minutes  i loved the huge open windows on all four sides  and the vents at the top were great to prevent condensation  it says it will find two queen size air mattresses  but it would probably be a tight squeeze  fortunately  it was just me  one  big  queen size air mattress  and my    lb  german shepherd and we had plenty of room  love the coleman brand of camping stuff in general  and this tent definitely didn t disappoint  highly recommended      
824,5.0,                       i have to say  this tent is awesome  it says    second up but its more like       its great that it sets up easily and has room for two twin air mattresses and a large cooler in between them    i used it in the rain and stayed dry    till i left the windows down before going off to hike      
825,5.0,                       greatest tent ever  so easy to set up and take down      
826,5.0,                       i havent used this in rain yet  but just used it for the first time   it was super simple to set up and take down   easy enough for one person to do quickly and easily      
827,5.0,                       so much fun  this tent is like a room  it is very comfortable for a couple  with bags and everything  we loved it and will use it as much as possible  very highly recommended      
828,1.0,                       product came with holes in rainfly and missing parts was next to impossible to set up in other than absolutely perfect  tough terrain  zero wind conditions     mph wind took  the short stakes right in up  any force in any direction pulled short stakes out with ease during beach setup product instructions are vague at best  good luck finding a video on this item that isnt a northstar model  totaly different product is difficult to stow away      
829,5.0,                       it really only takes    seconds to set up  great tent    and    it fits back in the bag no problem     
830,5.0,                       first time single mom camper here  it rained and was so windy  we camped with    other boy scout families  majority of others had ants and water leaking in their tents  i however  did not  i was able to put up the tent by myself with my   year old  little assistance on his part  but it was so easy  amazing tent      
831,4.0,                       great tent  easy to put it together    minute  and easy to put it back in it s bag  but make sure that you leave some ventilation in it  else you find some dew in the morning inside the cabin  few questions i still have for myself  how does it do in the rain  specially as when it rains  and you open the door  it might get wet inside  as there is not  roof  above the entrance  and the frame on the outside might attract bird  leaving some dirt behind  and how about strong storms  it looks very shaky  should be good for   persons  still don t know why all those tents are overrated  in this case   persons  yes  will fit  when you are with a very  close  group of people      
832,5.0,                       i love this tent   i used it for the first time a few weeks ago   when they say    seconds to put up they aren t kidding   for my first time  doing it alone  it still took less than   minutes to have it completely up   i also purchased the rainfly for  added protection   i love the fact that you can just about stand in the center of it too   i see lots of camping in my future           
833,5.0,                       i didn t realize the size  my bad   we need at least a six man we used it about   weeks  ago and it was great  we had two larger people    cots    dogs and all of our stuff  the first night it poured with thunder  we were dry and very comfortable  its super easy to se up  we will definitely be getting another one  only larger      
834,5.0,                       just love love love love this tent and it seriously takes seconds to set up  perfect for myself  husband  and our dog plus our gear  you do need to buy the rain flap separately unfortunately      
835,5.0,                       buy this tent  and then sit back while everyone else stares at you enviously about how quickly you set up  i had it in the rain       not one drop in the tent  it really does take about    seconds to set up  as a bonus  the bag is a reasonable size and you can actually get the tent back in it i have a double high queen air mattress in it with plenty of room for the gear inside  great  amazing tent     
836,5.0,                       the tent is truly a sign of the times  i sometimes like to go camping by myself and my previous tents took me way to long to set up  as stated in many of the reviews  it can be set up in   min  i did it in a minute and a half  all by myself  and put the rainfly on within a minute as well     fits my queen aerobed nicely and have room to have a changing area and place for my clothes  ice chest etc the only thing that was not included was a way to roll your window material up when you have the windows unzipped  i had some nice clips i will use but it would have been nice to have that built in i would highly recommend this tent for those that want a great tent and a  no fuss  installation      
837,1.0,                       do not buy  i bought the   person really fits only   twin mattresses  and    person tent both didn t last two seasons  large one became a moat and kept collapsing in light rain and minor wind  small tent was just taken out of dry room and al the tape around the seams is coming off  i will never buy another coleman tent  so disappointed      
838,1.0,                       i am highly disappointed in this tent  do not buy if attempting any weather with rain  we set this up and was pleased with how easy but it was raining and we left set up for about   hours in a constant drizzle before we headed in to air up our mattresses   was surprised at puddles in the corners and water literally dripping down from the middle and all the walls were wet  needless to say we had to sleep in car for the next   nights due to rainy conditions and a tent that just kept filling up with water      
839,1.0,                       this tent was wet every morning inside even without rain  suppose it was from condensation inside tent  not a   season tent  even bought the rain fly and sealed it with waterproofing sealant  did not matter when it did rain   used it in moab over spring break      
840,1.0,                       not waterproof at all  absolutely terrible  i found myself wishing i had my old coleman tent instead of this brand new unit it did go up very fast  but proved to be useless against the moderate rain we experienced  if i didn t have my air mattress  i could have drown in my sleep due to all the water pooling in the floor of this terribly ineffective  shelter fyi i had the additional rainfly as well  didn t matter  water was coming straight through the walls on this tent      
841,4.0,                       this tent was very simple to put up   i was able to do it completely by myself in under   minutes   however  it was not waterproof   on a test run in our back yard  i stood in the tent in the pouring rain  and i could feel the water coming through the roof of the tent and onto my face   i tried to order the optional rain fly  but it was not available   instead  i bought a     tarp and some bungee cords   when it poured rain while we were camping  i was very thankful for the tarp   however  rain still seeped in through the sides and we had water on the floor of the tent     quite thankful we purchased cots so we were up off the floor   i still really like the tent though  but wanted to be sure to make comments about the fact that it is not waterproof   i know that tents don t really fit as many people as they say  but with three of us in this tent which is advertised to fit   people  we still felt cramped  i know this is part of the tent rating system  and not something necessarily bad about this tent in particular  so i didn t take off a star for this detail   overall though  i am happy with the tent      
842,5.0,                       i have never camped before  but now we are   i put it up all by myself and it withstood a horrid rain storm and a light snow   the rain cover  separate  was noisy in the wind      
843,4.0,                       i used it for the first time last weekend  it went up quickly and i was pleased  i wish i d gotten the   person instead  it was just cramped when i inflated the twin sized air mattress  other than that it was great     
844,5.0,                       great tent  pops up in seconds  very roomy  love that i can stand up insideclosing it down is a little on the tough side  easier with a  nd set of handsdid not try in rain     
845,5.0,                       as a single mom this tent has made camping life so much easier  super easy to put up so spacious and stays nice and dark for those afternoon nappers      
846,5.0,                       first off i also own the   person instant tent by coleman  it is the    x    it is huge but nice  this   person tent was an very nice addition for the kids  very easy to put up  although i wish on the   man tent they would have have the cool zipper top openings for air they have on the   person  i love it  the six person design is nice  holds up well in wind and snow  however i always use a ground cover before laying the tent and a tarp on the top if i know its going to snow or rain  it does not have a rain fly  yet coleman sells those too  and its worth the extra  its tall so you don t have to feel scrunched when moving around in it either  we fit two portable cots  a mini fridge and all of our gear in it      
847,4.0,                       time i used it there was a big storm  the tent was still standing when it was over and it was dry inside  to say this is a four person tent is a huge stretch  it is best used as a one person tent      
848,2.0,                       i loved the easy set up and put away  i was very disappointed  with what i thought was waterproof  was absolutely not  thank goodness we didnt get rain  but we had a heavy fog  water was dripping all in the tent  it was    degrees out  and me and my   year old grandson were wet and very cold  everything in the tent was wet  his first experience camping was a bad one   i seen the mixed reviews  but my bad choice was to go with it  so if you are expecting a waterproof tent  dont buy this one      
849,4.0,                       very quick to set up  as advertised   keeps dry in heavy rain  we have the fly as well    only downside is it s difficult to get back in the storage bag length wise   you really need to pull the sides away from the ends and even then you have to shoe horn it into the bag   if the bag was an inch or two longer it would be easy      
850,5.0,                       i love how easy this tent is to pop up  my husband and i love to car camp and this bad boy sets up in such a short amount of time  it definitely saved out marriage  something about setting up a regular pole tent tests everyone s relationship      
851,1.0,                       i love the ease of putting up this tent but it leaks   i have treated and treated the fabric to be able to keep using it   no luck stopping the abundance of water that comes in with even a light rain   i will be getting rid of it  short story  don t waste your money if camp in the rain   otherwise  i ll give you a real good deal on mine      
852,1.0,                       i loved this tent until it rained  it leaked from everywhere  i was using the rainfly add on  it still leaked  our camping trip was a disaster  everything wet and soggy  plus we froze   coleman claims their  wethertec  system is not for rain  what   i feel complelty ripped off warning   do not use this tent in the rain      
853,2.0,                       we ordered this tent for a last minute camping trip  so it s extra frustrating that it arrived without stakes and with a small tear in the bottom   we ll tape the tear and try to find somewhere local to our destination that sells stakes  but in other circumstances i d return it giving it a second star because it seems fine otherwise and is fast to set up      
854,5.0,                       only tent that didn t blow over only problem is if you stake it down so the bottom is out all the way and flat it makes it hard to pull the zipper around the door to open and close it     
855,2.0,                       this was in no way weatherproof  the first time i took it out  it rained and water came right through the sides  i had to spray three cans of waterproofing crap just to make sure it didn t leak anymore  also  the bottom zipper on the door broke  my son had to cut the door a little bit so he could remove the zipper and replace it  the only plus to this tent is how easy it is to set up and take down  for the cost and how much they boast about how weatherproof it is  i was very disappointed      
856,5.0,                       best tent i ever owned  goes up fast and easy  i ve been through light rain with zero problems  i have been through very heavy storms with   inches of water streaming on the back side of my tent  that time the floor just got very moist with small puddles  but i did almost have a stream running under my tent   i wish i could post the video i took that night where my coke bottle was moving up and down due to the water under my tent   one time i was an idiot and didn t stake it down as i let it dry out after a rainy trip and it blew over  to my relief it didn t damage it  really love this tent      
857,4.0,                       it is very easy and quick to put up and take down  my only gripe would be that it s not really for   people  we slept two people on air beds and it was the max  it wouldn t be comfortable to try and squish   people into the tent  if you re looking for a comfortable family tent definitely go bigger      
858,5.0,                       this is an excellent family tent for backyard adventures and maybe true camping  very roomy and unbelievably quick set up and tear down it would not be ideal for any hiking whatsoever as it is very large and heavy still would recommend for quality  price and ease of use      
859,1.0,                       i purchased this for a hunting trip i was going on  we had light rain fall and everything inside the tent was soaked  i had to pack everything up and leave because of this  total waist of time and money  very disappointed in coleman and also amazon for giving this tent good reviews  do not buy this tent      
860,3.0,                       i have a   person instant tent from coleman and the setup as well as take down are amazing   it takes me alone about       seconds to do each  its mind blowing how easy and fast it is to put up   despite having a rain fly  it does not fare well when its raining   every time it rains  a lot of water gets inside  through the walls  seams  floor   when im camping with this tent and it rains for more than    minutes  its time to pack up and get out of there   if not for this major drawback this would be an amazing tent      
861,4.0,                       nice tent  easy to set up and large enough inside to fit two extremely comfortably  could fit six but that s in a uncomfortable manner description says this tent is suppose to block     of light  i highly disagree with that claim      
862,4.0,                       this tent was super easy to set up  it had plenty of room for myself and two young kids  the second night we used it  it ended up storming pretty heavily  despite how hard the wind was raging the tent stayed in place  it did leak through the night  mostly at the door  i was surprised that it didn t out right flood on the inside      
863,5.0,                       the first time it was arrived an used one  request a replacement and received a new on in a week  i have been used it on a cold weather at around   degf  instant setup  i got the rainfly on top to prevent snow falls at night  nice tent  it is highly recommended      
864,1.0,                       this is not an dark room instant tent its a quick pitch tent which does not set up in    seconds   beware description does not match   i sent it back in august and are still waiting for the refund      
865,5.0,                       haven t tried it in the rain  but just used it for   nights camping   great tent  lots of ventilation including at the very top   super easy to set up and take it back down   definitely a car camping tent   it s huge      but worth it to have a tent you can stand up in and i even used a cot with room to spare  plus my dog    lot of value for the money     
866,2.0,                       great tent if you don t have rain   bought this   years ago and use it once or twice a year   this trip will be its last   it is easy to set up   so easy   but as you can see in the pics  the seam tape is massively failing   didn t know this when we set out  so got to spend one night completely rained on  no way to buy a tarp in the middle of the night    so wish it were more rain proof  because we love this tent otherwise      
867,5.0,                       i have used this tent on two car camping trips so far     super fast up   take down a breeze    fits back into bag it came with np     second weekend was cool  and rainy stayed dry and comfortable  great head room for a   person tent    i purchased the optional rain fly must have add on for northern new england weather    in this price range amazing     
868,5.0,                       the main reason i bought this tent is because of its size and ease of setup  i am      tall  so smaller tent shared with anyone else makes for an uncomfortable night  the length and width are long enough to accommodate me  even when sleeping at the edges  it is tall enough that i can at least stand up while leaning over just a bit  i cant fullt stand up in it  but i dont have to crouch down on my knees to move around in it i decided to try the tent out for the first time this weekend while taking my son on a boy scout campout  without having ever taken it out of the bag  and without previously watching any videos or reading instructions on set up  it still was a very quick setup  it took about   minutes to set up and get the   stakes down  and that was with a lot of wind  this did not include the   support stakes for the cords  it took me another couple of minutes to get the knots undone and stake those down    takedown the next morning was just as easy  there was a bit of struggle getting it rolled back up to fit in the bag easily but that is the case with any tent ive had the main reason i am giving it   stars though is because it actually made it through the night  we stayed at the very tip of dauphin island in alabama  inside ft gaines to be exact  on a weekend with a pretty big storm rolling in  although it did not rain while i was there  the wind was blowing at     mph for the entire night  i set it up around  pm  and took it down the next morning around  am and it stayed standing the entire time  this was not just an occasional gust of wind coming in  it was a steady   mph  nonstop  the entire night  occasionally there were some gusts that reached     mpg  every now and then  the top of the tent would shift and i thought the arms were going to give out  but they never did  i left all of the windows open throughout the night to keep some of the pressure of the wind off  but i think it would have stayed up even if they were closed i did not have any leaks on mine  but it did not rain on us while the tent was up  there was a little spray from the ocean  but the wind was so strong it did not have time to sit on the tent and get in because of the design  its not a light or compact tent  but i would not expect one like this to be  so that s not a problem or negative to me  it will still fit in the trunk of a small car  so its not terribly long  i intend on using this on typical campouts with the family and do not intend on hiking long distances with it there is only one negative thing about it to me  and that is the stakes that are included  they are the typical l shaped cheap tent stakes that come with every tent  i forgot to bring my good stakes with me  so i had to use these  several were bent or pulled half up the next morning  so i will be buying another set of good ones to keep in the bag  i am not removing any stars from my rating just because it did hold up after all  even in the very sandy terrain i had it in  but it is worth noting that you should purchase a decent set  and that goes for any tent you buy   while you are at it  go ahead and buy a small cheap mallet to keep in the tent bag too  then you never have to remember to pack one  or have to hunt for something hard enough to drive them down      
869,2.0,                       sets up quickly  poor design for rain  water rushes in the door when unzipped even with rain fly  why not a canopy over the entrance  use in dry conditions only      
870,5.0,                       went camping out in the desert for    days  it worked great  kept out all bugs and it was very easy to setup and take down  it never rained so we dont know how well it holds up in that regard  i personally couldnt stand up inside  im       so next time were getting the   person coleman pop up      
871,3.0,                       the tent was great for setup and roomy   the stitching right above my head have small gaps in them though   when it rained little drops of water would get through them and drip on my head   not too much  but more than i wanted   even with the stitching pulled apart the tent would have stayed dry if they had supplied a small canopy over the top   i ve owned several tents and they all had a separate second fabric top for water to run off before hitting tent top      
872,3.0,                       we used this tent one time and in one hour of light rain it leaked through all the seams and seeped through the walls  i m calling coleman today to see if this is normal  and in the meantime purchasing a separate rain fly and seam sealer  i ve never had to use seam sealer before  and this tent said it was rain tested  i m not sure what they tested but this was definitely not rainproof      
873,1.0,                       i recently bought this tent for camping   the space was just right   setup was also not that bad   but we got a horrible shock when it started raining   the rain water seeped right through it   looked like the rainfly actually diverted the water right into the tent   we regret not talking the picture of the tent with water   all our stuff inside   mattress   bags etc all got wet   we took out atleast   bucket of water from in that tent  what a waste of time and money   please stay away or buy at your own risk     
874,2.0,                       decent tent but not big enough for   queen air mattresses nor   sleeping bags   bought   to take on a trip   my mistake not setting them up before arriving at campground and expecting to fit   queen air mattresses   zippers are also very touchy and hard to zip   for the price i paid  disappointed in the size  quality and poor description      
875,5.0,                       i bought this trip to take my   kids camping    having never purchased a tent before i was somewhat overwhelmed with the various tents but this one really caught my eye as it promised to basically pop itself up    i was delighted that it really lived up to it s promise  i had this tent out of the bag and up within   minutes    takedown was just as quick and simple and it even fit back in the bag   it seemed to be very sturdy and we did not have any problems with the construction or quality   my only complaint would be that it claims to be a   person tent   i put three twin sized air mattresses and one portable crib in here and we were a very tight fit   luggage needed to be left in the suv   overall very happy with this purchase      
876,3.0,                       i have always used coleman tents and decided to try this for my adventures  great for normal beautiful weather  even with the rain fly which you have to buy separate rain gets in tent  crappie design  very unpleased with coleman     
877,5.0,                       can fit our queen size inflatable and two pack and plays for our girls  plus enough room for our clothing bags and such  plus setup couldn t be much easier      
878,5.0,                       this is a great tent  i truly give it   stars for setup time  i set it up in the living room right out of the box in about a minutes time  it is freestanding  but when staked out    i think it would hold up well   i have many years camping experience and i would say    this is as easy as it gets for a large tent  as far a s water proof    to me  it doesn t seem any different than any other nylon tent  however  i waited until the fly was available before ordering and buying this tent  it is a large tent  x   and has high waterproof side walls  i give it a recommend tent        
879,5.0,                       this tent is a great buy besides buying the waterproof cover separate          also  i like the netted windows and door features  easy set up and take down  still haven t used in rain but will update     
880,3.0,                       i used this tent for   consecutive days during a biking ride  the tent is advertised as an instant tent with easy setup and take down  this is an accurate description  as i found i could setup the tent in minutes  and equally take it down in minutes  very nice the tent as a whole is adequate for light rain protection   any storm with wind will cause the poles to buckle and the tent will collapse   your instant tent then will become an instant pool   tent should be setup in areas where there is shelter from straight line winds the   person tent is really a tight   person tent or a comfortable single person tent the windows and doors will provide adequate ventilation during the night if privacy screens are down   however  if you zip them all up for privacy  it will become stuffy in the tent i studied the product descriptions and reviews for the rainfly  and i don t understand what value the rainfly will provide outside of additional top layer protection      
881,5.0,                       it s easy to set up and the perfect size  the only problem i have is in the morning there s quite a bit of condensation that will drip on you  im going to see if the rain fly will help that      
882,5.0,                       after returning first tent because of leaking i set this one up and sprayed seams with water protection it went through   rains of               with flying colors no leaks  o i now also have received the rain fly which looks like it will work well with tent i will review it as soon as i have tent set up and get some rain   o this is a great tent for easy setup for an old man of    and plan on using it a lot instead of my pop up thats setting out in my driveway its getting to hard for me to handle hillbillygene     
883,5.0,                       i took this camping with my girlfriend  and it does the job great  we had to move our campsite three times while camping and setting up and tearing down took maybe ten minutes  the inside is spacious  for two people  though i feel that four people might be a tight fit  though not undoable  i love the height of it  i m      and i can fairly easily get changed inside while standing  only needing to bend over a little bit i would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants a decent sized tent that has a super easy set up  it s sturdy  just like how you d expect a colman tent      
884,3.0,                       had a hard rain and my boys had a puddle of water in the tent the next morning  the water was running down the walls and their sleeping bags and air mattresses where wet  i recommend the rain fly and and heavy duty tarp      
885,5.0,                       i love this tent   i m a festival girl so i live out of this tent about    weekends a year  i ve had many tents before this one and this is by far my favorite  many of my friends have purchased it since seeing mine  it s the perfect size for my glamping style pros  super easy      person set up and take down  seriously minutes and it s up you can stand up inside it  it s affordable  i found it on here for     it s the prefect size for a long weekend of festival camping  it fits a queen sized bed  suitcase  tubs  and a side table with plenty of room to spare and walk around  stays relatively cool in the sun  it s got some vents at the top that help with airflow and heat fits easily back into the tent bag with room to spare cons  it holds up in the light rain and wind pretty well but leaked in a heavy downpour  nowhere to hang things  there is only one little loop in the center of the tent that barely fits the hook on my lantern  it would be nice to see some loops or pockets high up and in the corners to hang lights on my only qulam is that it came with a rip in it  i didn t notice until i used it for the first time  i patched it and it s fine but i would have prefered a brand new tent with no holes in it      
886,5.0,                       this tent is an outstanding product  sturdy  easy to set up and relatively inexpensive  our small family was relieved to have such a great tent for camping  good job coleman      
887,5.0,                       i have both a   person and a   person    tent math  applies so i use the   as a single for just me and my weeks worth of gear  but   would be comfortable with gear for a long weekend  the   is perfect for   people with gear   its as easy as they say it is  and the quality is top notch but thats what i have come to expect from coleman   be sure and get the rain fly   both are heavy enough to use with a heater in cold temps  but with the windows open it will work for summer camping too   note  if you get the   read carefully the rainfly description  a lot of times stores skip this size and only have the         
888,5.0,                       besides the good quality of construction  short setup time  it has an adjustable ceiling vent system  a must for changes in weather this  is a nice tent       
889,1.0,                       first and only set up  easy set up  but rain poured in and soaked our sleeping bags  we had to put an ezup over it to stay dry  it s too late to return it       
890,4.0,                       this tent comfortably fits three people  six people fit only if you pack  em in like sardines  with one person sleeping in front of the door  so it s not a comfortable fit  height clearance is good for a tent  i m   ft and could stand upright in the middle of the tent we are able to fit a queen size blow up mattress with room in the front and the side of the mattress  and  it could fit three over sized cots   although it is advertised as fitting two queen size mattresses  that s really only if you squeeze them in  with no more room to spare this is the gen    version of the tent   amazon sells the newer version  gen     of the tent for slightly more  listed as the instant cabin   it has a slightly different roof shape design  and only one window on the door side  gen    and gen    have two windows    i believe they switched from two to one window on the door side because two windows left slack in the tent material which made zipping the door closed sometimes difficult   basically  you have to pull the slack out of the material on the earlier versions to zip the door shut  which is easier to do on the outside than the inside of the tent  very easy and quick set up  less than    seconds with just one person  the initial takedown is quick  but getting it completely folded up and in the bag takes some work  even with more than one person on a side note  even though the bottom of the tent has tarp like material  i would recommend putting a separate tarp underneath the tent so that when it comes time to put it away it makes the wiping down of the tent easier the tent is essentially water resistant  but  the first tent i received had to be exchanged  because it leaked water through portions of some of the seems   the replacement tent  an earlier version   gen    leaked both from some of the seems as well as the general tent material  so  there may be a quality control issue or you may need to spray the tent down with something like kiwi cap dry heavy duty and then also seam seal although the tent is basically water resistant  and the door and windows have a small built in rain fly  this tent would be better if coleman included a standard rain fly for it  as rain gets inside when  for example  you open the door fully to exit   although coleman initially did not make a rainfly for this version of the tent  you can now purchase one for around       i purchased it for my tent  and highly recommend it if you are going to purchase one of these tents   it eliminates the problems of the roof vents  discussed below  and makes for cleaning the tent easier  keep in mind that this is what is known as a single wall tent  that means that it will develop condensation on the inside from breathing  you have to be mindful where you set it up  for example  a setup near water is more likely to develop condensation  you can spray the inside of the tent with something like kiwi camp dry to help with this problem the roof of the tent has two vents  each opposite from another  that are secured with a flimsy velcro strap  the first time i set the tent up there was wind  and the vents were oriented in the direction of the wind  although the wind was not strong  it was strong enough to constantly open the vents because of the flimsy arms that hold them down  this created an uncomfortable draft in    degree whether  when setting the tent up you just need to be cognizant of where these vents are relative to the wind  simply place that side of the tent that doesn t have the vent facing the direction of the wind the stakes that come with it are low quality and you are going to eventually have to replace them as they bend easily  we replaced ours with high visibility  read  bright orange colored  stakes  made out of lightweight aluminium the ad text an amazon references  back packing  and  dark room   neither is accurate  this is not even remotely close to a backpacking tent in terms of weight and packed size   and  it even has quite a large packed size for a car  the   and   person tent pictured  and the one we received  are also not the dark room tents  the    person tent does appear to be the dark room  but that s definitely not a backpacking tent one final point  in considering which tent to buy  don t just look at the cost of this tent  but also factor in the cost of new tent stakes  the rain fly  seam sealer and dwr spray  several cans over several coatings   plus  the time you invest  couple of hours  in treating the inside and outside of the tent  in hindsight  i definitely would have went with a different tent      
891,4.0,                       we use this tent a few times a year for about   years now the good  easy to raise  easy ish to fold  good build quality  comes with everything you need the bad  this is not a small or a light tent so if this is your need  opt out to something else      
892,5.0,                       first time camping  non primitive  and was intimidated at the prospect of  pitching a tent  so to speak  i was very pleased at how easy this tent was to assemble and ready when i got out there  and how cosy and useful it was once i was inside of it trying to sleep  i would highly recommend it due it s ease of assembly and dis assembly beyond the features  especially for newcomers like myself      
893,5.0,                       exactly as represented  two absolutes to start     all tents  including this one  need to be first set up at home  given   days of fair weather  and seamsealed and treated with weatherproofing spray  it will require two each of the seam sealing dauber and wp spray cans  an extra one of each if buying the rainfly      do not get hung up on the     second  gimmick  take your time and open the legs for opposing corners at one time  tall folks can stay on one side and reach across and pull each of the legs up on the opposite side  after extending each of the legs  you will want to peg out the corners to keep the footprint tight tips  do the seam seal first and do the  roof  portion before extending the legs  also do the roof now with wp spray   so you can reach into the hub area  when doing the corner seams  pinch the fabric to one side of it to pull it tight while daubing it  note the dauber  as it empties  will need to be kept tilted upward  toward the end  finish the dauber off with the floor to wall seams as the dauber can be kept upright while doing it  pay particular attention to the seam intrusions by the straps for pole attachments and guy line deltas  when spraying wp  spray vertical sections above the bottom of the windows  then from the windows down  as soon as it s all done  get the windows open  do not smoke in  or around  the tent while doing the daubing and spraying until it is dried and aired out the door is a pain to close while tent is pegged out tight  spray zipper with silicone lube  not wd     and gently press in on the nearest leg corner while closing around the top corner an e port would be a nice addition as well as   more mesh pockets  otherwise  i found the tent to be exactly as expected another point that was heartening for me was the fact that the tent  once staked out  including guy lines the tent has a perfect shape  just like the brochure pictures  it s all taught and in its place  all the videos  and pictures  i ve seen  show sagging walls  pulled up floor  and a lot of lufting great tent that i m sure will serve me well for years to come sorry  one more general item  i see a lot of questions and concerns for more dimunitive females and elders with bad backs  like me  about the setup of this tent  i m      and an old guy  lucky to be a bit more fit than some my age  and i can get this tent up in less than    seconds  if i want to  if i were a lot shorter or less coordinated or less fit or         i still would be able to get this tent up in less than    minutes and so can anybody else  it s all a matter of which limitation slows you down  but there s not another tent that you can buy that will make camping easier for you and at a reasonable price try it  you ll like it update            having set up and struck about    times in the last year  i can tell you that this tent is equipped to handle the realities of rough camping use and extreme weather  a surprise wind driven heavy rain storm hit us hard while still fighting to set the large rain tarp up over one side of the tent  it tore the upwind tarp corner out of my hands and therefore fully one half of the tarp slammed into one side of the tent with force  the tent bent in more than a little on that side but stood in its footprint  when i recovered  i grabbed the tarp corner off the tent and again it was ripped out of my hands  this time blowing up and out over the tent  the tent then was subject to very heavy rain  driven horizontally by    mph winds  bottom line  not a drop  tent was undamaged and i spent the rest of the night getting little fits of sleep  all in all  it just added to the confidence that i bought the best all around car camping tent note that i bought the rainfly  not as protection from rain  rather as a guard against uv damage  better to replace a rainfly than a most trustworthy tent  going out this next weekend without the tarp  just to save time and because i don t need it      
894,5.0,                       we go tent camping on average about once a month from may through september  we re a family of four and we ve owned this tent for   years now  no holes  no rips or tears  perfectly stable still and it has proven to be the best tent we ve ever owned  the ease of use is the best feature  one person can put this tent up by themselves within a matter of minutes  it keeps bugs and water out and has plenty of ventilation for those cool summer nights  i m    tall and i can stand in this tent without having to bend over  it s roomy and comfortable  i would buy this tent a million times over  not regrets  get it      
895,2.0,                       the entry door did not have a functional zipper at the bottom seal   everything else was as expected   but without a zipper to seal the door the tent is not usable   i have always owned coleman tents and camping equipment and never had an issue  washington   minnesota   alaska     star when this issue is resolved      
896,1.0,                       this tent is not waterproof  even with the rain fly  sold separately   it still leaks on the sides  i even sprayed it with silicone weatherproofing prior to using and it ended up leaking on three sides   it is easy to setup  but quite awkward to pack up   do not recommend this tent      
897,5.0,                       the only reason why i gave   stars on the water and weather is because if there is fog it will seep through a little  other then that this is an awesome tent and i was able to fit   queen and   full  it was for my wife    kids and myself  i placed a larger size tarp on the outside and a same size on the inside  i also had the rain fly installed  hope this helps      
898,3.0,                       i set it up in the back yard prior to some rain coming through  moderate rain no wind  one day  leaked like crazy  the floor holds water real good  puddles of standing water within a couple hours  that s without the rain fly  hard to see how the fly will help much  leaks all over the place      
899,5.0,                       love the new tent  literally tales about   minute and    seconds for one person to set up  taking down is about the same  pretty tall compared to other   person tents  can fit a queen air mattress nicelunch with a little extra room to get changed  light rain fall didn t end up causing a leak but during a downpour water did tend to slip in  i would suggest a rainfall if camping threw a major storm  overall though i am very satisfied with thia purchase      
900,5.0,                       gooooooood     
901,5.0,                       easy setup  st  time setup took about    to    minutes that included staking the tie downs   i know we can reduce setup time after a couple of trips       
902,1.0,                       do not buy this if there s a chance of rain  it leaks instantly in light rain     
903,5.0,                       love the black out  you don t have the bright sun and warmth in the tent in the morning  love the hinged door    so much easier to go in and out of the tent for bathroom at night  don t have to zip  and unzip  etc  just open and shut  once you set the tent up and take down  very quick      
904,5.0,                       this tent was easy to set up  first use was a   day  camping trip with   days of constant rain  stayed dry   definitely needed the tent rainfly  extra purchase but would not have stayed  dry without it   that took a little time to set up but worked great  tent floor is water proof  tent sides and top are water weather resistence   with rain fly it is water proof       
905,5.0,                       took hubby less than    second to setup but a bit longer to take down and get it back into the bag  we love the tent  great height and plenty of room for a family of four      
906,3.0,                       no rain or sprinklers last night just the nightly dew collected on the tent and the second i touch the zipper and barely moved it  the entire tent starts dripping everywhere inside  i don t think there is any water resistant seal     aside from that which is a huge downer and a reason i won t be able to keep it  the tent popped up in like a minute as said and i was really excited about having purchased it      
907,5.0,                       this tent is awesome super easy to put up and take down  took more time trying to put it back in the bag after taking it down than anything but i would buy it again there was two adults and two young kids under   there wasn t much extra space     
908,5.0,                       bought this tent for the fast setup and it did go up in about a minute  exactly as advertised  fitting it back in the bag after taking it down however  is kind of a pain  would definitely recommend buying it for the instant up aspect though  i was up and grinning while my buddies were still poking  stretching and swearing with their pup tents  fyi  definitely use the tent stakes  as the tent tends to creep inward from the corners and get  baggy  otherwise  zzz s     
909,3.0,                       upgraded to a   person tent for more room of course  the set up was easy but as soon as we got it set up and opened the zipper door we realized the zipper was busted  it bunched up and when trying to close the door it kept opening back up forcing us to try the whole thing over  closing it up and getting it back inside the storage bag was also a problem    minute set up    minute take down with no instructions on how to do so      
910,4.0,                       everything is great on this tent  i only used a   person tent so i didnt have to spend   mins setting up  i m      and a   person tent is tight  this coleman tent takes   mins total to set up and that s with steaking it all down  the only thing i wish this tent had is an electric port hole like most newer tents and be about   inches taller   otherwise its great and roomy      
911,1.0,                       i like the instant feature and the size  but just regular rain and it leaked everywhere   totally disappointed with coleman   i bought this tent after i recently tried another coleman tent that also leaked a lot and had holes in it  so i returned it and bought the instant up cabin tent  what s up coleman   how can you advertise these tents with weather tech feature   i ve been camping for    years and used a lot of coleman products  but i will not ever by another coleman tent      
912,5.0,                       i absolutely love this tent  it s a breeze to put up  the people in the campsite next to us actually told us that it was unfair how quick it was up  can t say enough good things  luckily there was no rain when we went  so i can t comment on waterproofness      
913,5.0,                       to start this is not for backpackers  this is for the people who camp out of jeeps  cars or trucks  it is pretty heavy  but very easy to handle  it really does go up in   minute and the take down is about   minutes tops  i love this tent  i have owned about   other tents in my    years of camping  this one puts them all to shame  it is very well built and roomy too  i love being able to set up camp in    minutes and start relaxing  if you drive in late  it is very easy to assemble in near dark or with a flash light  i would not really consider it a   person though  more like   very comfortable people tent      
914,5.0,                       super easy to set up and to take off  we had a queen size air mattress for   people and the space was perfect  i recommend to buy for more people so you can have more space      
915,5.0,                       watched a few reviews on this tent and it seemed perfect for what we have planned  won t be using it in freezing conditions so not too worried about that  seems well built floor looks to be fairly water proof also with how it s made  biggest pro is it literally took about a minute to setup the day we got it  took longer to get it out of the box  as of now we are very happy with it  time will tell if we have any issues      
916,5.0,                       sets up and comes down in less than a minute with   person  fits a queen air mattress and   people perfectly  had some rain and none came in  did not have any issues with dew on the inside  so glad we picked this one      
917,5.0,                       fast tent set up  literally took me two minutes to set up  tall enough for me to stand in  i m        and it seems to be pretty weather proof  can t wait to go camping in it      
918,5.0,                       could not have asked for an easier tent for using at a festival  the most dreaded part of any music festival is the breakdown of the campsite  this tent was a breeze to set up and take down  the other folks around us saw how quickly we were done and asked where we got it plenty of space for   grown men  though a bit snug if your other half insists on putting a queen  sized blow up mattress s in  but it all for and we slept great      
919,5.0,                       i love this tent   it goes up as fast as an ez up   when you are done  it easily folds back down   no detached poles and parts to contend with   while i think one person can do it  it would be better to have two  just because of the size   great tent  though   we have been very happy with it      
920,5.0,                       definitely would not consider this a   person tent unless   skinny individuals in their sleeping bags fit  probably a   person max  hubby and i got this for a camping trip  it was pretty spacious with our air mattress  we slept with our two pups inside and our gear pretty cozy  i do recommend getting the rain fly cuz it saved our butts since it rained all weekend long while camping  i like that it has zippered mesh air vents to allow air in and keeps bugs out  favorite feature is that it does set up in very few minutes      
921,4.0,                       purchased the six man tent due to the size and ease of setup takedown   i used this during a weekend at the beach  the tent doesn t take any time to set up and take down was just as easy   one word of caution   it s easy to trap a finger in the assembly when you fold the tent up   take care to ensure your hand is free of the hinges when closing   you do need to stake the tent and use the tie lines  otherwise the tent sags badly and you lose a lot of floor space    i don t believe you can have two queen mattresses in the tent as advertise   for one queen mattress the tent size is perfect   the tent has enough height you can walk in and immeadiatly stand up   one night it rained and with the windows partly open for ventilation we had some drips on the floor   i would recommend purchasing the rain fly from amazon   like others  i wonder why it s not included with the tent   overall for two people and two dogs  this is a great car camping tent      
922,1.0,                       product tore open on second use   literally while extending the pole  do not buy     
923,4.0,                       this is truly an  instant  tent  me and my girlfriend can set the whole thing up in under a minute  i am      and can stand comfortably in      of the tent  because of it s unique design the reason i am rating it   stars instead of   is that this tent does not come with a rainfly  which is a necessity in my opinion  you do not want to be in this tent if it is raining and you don t have the rainfly for it  i also recommend buying the  coleman tent kit   as it has higher quality stakes than the ones that come with this tent      
924,2.0,                       rain fly is sold separately and even with that the rain comes straight through the walls of the tent   water just running down the walls and puddling      
925,5.0,                       i got this for my son s scout camping trip and it is awesome  we had the best looking tent there   i m       and had plenty of head room standing up   it was like being in a house compared to the  man tent we carried last year   it is very very easy to put up  instant up is no bs  it is the easiest tent i ve ever put up      
926,5.0,                       sturdy tent even in pretty high winds  easy to set up  nice to have a hassle free set up for camping  less set up and take down time  more enjoy camping time      
927,5.0,                       fastest set up   take down i have ever experienced with any tent i ve ever used  i ve been camping several times each year ever since i was little   this is a great tent for both beginners and experienced campers  this tent has lasted for nearly   years and numerous trips   it will fit the stated   people  unless you are using a larger air bed  which i do  queen size double high coleman air mattress   since i ve upgraded my air mattress i now need to upgrade the size of my tent  but i will definitely be sticking with the instant tent series  love this tent       
928,4.0,                       great tent   easy set up and take down   rain fly has to be purchased separate tho  otherwise five star     
929,3.0,                       smaller than what i thought a   person tent would be  you might fit   adults and a kid in it  it rained the first day i had it up and water got into it pretty bad  it doesn t breath at all when windows are closed yet still gets water in it   however it is really light weight and super easy to set up      
930,5.0,                       this tent is large  water resistant  and so easy to set up  i recommend the rain fly accessory  together  the tent and rain fly make camping a great experience      
931,4.0,                       east to setup and lots of room  i have used it once and have had no problems  seems well made and of good quality  we will see how it holds up to time      
932,4.0,                       tent was purchased for a single overnight campout on the grounds of our country club  the quality of the tent is very good and it does assemble and disassembles quickly   it too  is a good looking tent i m          lbs  and my son is          lbs  and his two sons ages eight and ten  avg weight  spent the night together in this tent   the size was very comfortable for us   a fifth person or weekend gear would have made accommodations very snug and i don t know where we could have put a sixth person my suggestion is that if you need a six person tent buy coleman s   person version of this tent nice product      
933,2.0,                       first trip with the tent i was unzipping the carrying case and the zipper broke off in my hand   wasn t trying to force it just a gentle unzip and it popped right off  could not fix it myself   that was irritating  but the tent was super easy to assemble  popped right up just as advertised   that was pretty great   later that trip the door zipper broke off too  but i did accidently apply a little too much force   was a cold night with the door not fully zipped up   the tent was just as easy to take down so i loved that part   amazon took it back and gave me a refund      
934,5.0,                       i had a similar     man tent i used in the field in the jungles of bolivia back in        i was hoping to find a similar quick set tent but larger for years   i finally found it in this one   it sets up in virtually seconds  it takes a bit longer if you want to secure it in higher winds   i is airy and well ventilated for sultry nights  i live in houston so the four sided screened walls are great   it also has a nice crest vent as well to let out moisture   i have no used it in the rain  so cannot attest to how well the abreviated rain fly will work  but all in all i am well satisfied with the tent      
935,2.0,                       we bought this tent last year and used it for our camping trip  the tent was great in terms of the setup  it took us less than   mins to get everything ready  the next morning  we noticed small water puddles on our sleeping bags   it was strange  because it had not rained at night  it was just the water from the dew that had condensed on the tent  as soon as we woke up and the tent shook a little bit    it started pouring inside  this was completely unacceptable because our   year old   person coleman tent has never leaked even when we camped for   days of pouring rain we returned the tent and bought a regular   person coleman tent      
936,1.0,                       i was excited when i saw that you didn t need a rain tarp with this tent  after using this tent   times i can tell you the only good thing about this tent is how easy it sets up   if you ever camp in the rain  bring a rain coat because this tent leaks   we go camping once a year during the rainy season and after the last trip i didn t even bother to bring the tent home   as for putting   queen air mattresses no way can you get   in there and be able to walk      
937,5.0,                       we do a lot of camping on the beach  needed a tent that wasn t all screen on top  this tent has a velcro vent on top  that severely reduces the sand  on padre island nation seashore  the tide came up and around the tent about   am  couple of good surges and a bout half a foot of water rushing around the tent  my   and   yr old never knew  not a drop came in  the third day it rained all day and the sides got damp  but i was very pleased how the tent held up from a   degrees cold front to    degrees in a four day weekend      
938,5.0,                       so easy to set up and take down  literally set it up in minutes  could fit two queen sized blow up mattress inside with a little room to spare on the end for bags  kept us warm and dry      
939,1.0,                       i bought this because coleman has a good name in the camping industry and it said weather tech and looked very rain resistant  however  with the light rain at  am i found out that the tent was indeed nothing like it claimed with water coming in from the top and from the side of the tent  the only good thing about it was it took   minute to set up  i would not recommend this tent if there is rain in the forecast      
940,1.0,                       we just opened new package  we saw couple of holes on tent but today is   st day and we don t see replacement option  we can t proceed with our camping plan  need help in replacement so that we can reschedule our campaign plan      
941,5.0,                       lives up to the instant claim  took   ft     lb pensioner less than   minute to get it standing without stakes  this is the third  easy set up  tent i tried    returns  third time a charm  this one is a keeper  also i can stand up in it  sending away for the rain fly      
942,5.0,                       the positive reviews are true   this is a fantastic tent   our family needed a tent and i wasn t very excited about the old dome tent experience of putting the segmented poles together and running them through the fabric channels to setup the tent   taking them out is always such a pain so i started searching around and found this tent   after reading some reviews  i went and checked out a couple youtube videos of people actually setting this tent up   it looked really easy so i bought it   we had the tent up in under a minute on the first try   repacking is just as easy although the tent was filled with air and had to be compressed before packing   finally   a bag that the tent can fit back in to   i would definitely recommend this one for a minimal hassle tent with nice features  no need for a separate rainfly  and a bathtub bottom      
943,1.0,                       this tent leaks  do not buy    i even had a tarp on top which did absolutely nothing because it leaks from the all the sides walls under the windows  i seam sealed and scotch guarded it  take a look at the pictures after an hour of rain  had to leave my campsite and come home to dry everything out  i trust coleman but so disappointed and aggravated with this tent      
944,5.0,                       this tent impresses me every time i use it  as well as everyone else  i ve set this up and torn it down about       times  at least  since purchasing it the summer of       i almost find reasons to camp because i know i won t be dreading setting up or tearing down i ve also camped in a multitude of temps and weather  and it s done well with keeping the wind  rain  and cold out  i absolutely love this thing          
945,5.0,                       the grandkids lives have been enriched by their new christmas present  it is set up in their lower level and they routinely sleep in it      
946,2.0,                       was finally able to set up on it s maiden voyage  no rainfly  leaked through the sides and roof  the roof  held a puddle of water that i had to physically dump out and had to leave a bowl under all night to catch the water shame on you coleman     
947,5.0,                       as advertised  super easy and quick to set up   i haven t used it in the rain yet   i don t understand how   people could fit in it   for my taste this is a   person tent with inflatable twin cot air mattresses and just enough room to walk  move and change clothes between the two cots      
948,1.0,                       the water leaks from all the seam even with rainfly which bought separately  our air mattress was soaked from the rain   easy to set up but can t use this tent for rainy days     
949,1.0,                    la mercanc a nunca lleg  y ustedes me informaron que me devolv an el dinero en tres d as h biles y ahora dicen que fue entregado   y es mentira  o la entregaron en otra direcci n        
950,5.0,                       weather proof water resistant and light pop up tent made easy no problem  you don t need to read directions  pop it up i wish they made a pop up tent years ago      
951,5.0,                       just received my new tent and set it up   took me about   minutes because i was figuring out how to do it   next time it will take about   minute now that i am familiar with it   it seems well constructed and while it says it is rain proof i will still go and get the rainfly when they are available   i have never seen any low priced tent that didnt need a rainfly in a good rain   i think some of these reviews are written by people that know nothing about camping   if you want to be protected from the weather you need to use good stakes  not the cheap ones provided and anchor all points well   then use a tarp or something as a ground cover so the bottom of the tent doesnt get punctured and a rainfly   that is not just for this tent but all tents   there are some tents that that dont need a rainfly but they cost many times what this tent costs  actually saw a youtube video of this tent settting in inches of water and the floor was dry for what it worth i recommend this tent for what it is a car camping easy to put up casual camping tent      
952,3.0,                         cots cannot fit comfortably in tent  however it is very nice and simple to set up and take down  stayed dry in rainy weather   this is a maybe a   person tent  and you can stand up comfortably in it   recently used it as a supply tent and used the big tent to sleep in   just definitely not a   person tent as advertised      
953,5.0,                       this tent really pops up quick nd so easy  i love how tall it is because my boyfriend is so tall and can never fit in tents but this one was nice and tall and had lots of space  super happy with the purchase  my only complaint is we were a little confused on how to take it down at first and took a while to figure out but we got it after a while      
954,3.0,                       if you like to go camping a lot  i d say buy a better tent    this one is not very  heavy duty  and i think frequent use would render it into junk   however  if you only camp a couple of times a year  this is a great value it will fit a queen sized air mattress  the floor is    by    so it would theoretically fit a king size air mattress   and it does in fact go up in less than a minute   if you set up your camp ground  properly  it will take about       minutes to finish    but if you just want to pop up the tent and climb in  it is only   minute away things i like    lots of ventilation    good for summer camping   nice big door and the bottom zips separately from the side and top    so you can run an electrical cord into the tent  we used it for a fan and a light    the is a pass through spot near the roof and a place to hang a hooked light  i used a drop light and it was perfect  major problem    the rain fly does not come with this tent and the tent stakes that do are cheap         so you have to order additional pieces to get a complete tent set up   to me that is a cheesy way of bringing down the quality of what would otherwise be a decent tent for occasional campers overall i would have given     because it works for me  but they lose a star for the cheap tent stakes and the lack of an included rain fly      
955,4.0,                       good product prosrelatively light weightwater proof  although we did spray waterproofing on whole tent easily fits back into bagfits a queen air mattress    dog beds and all gear comfortablytall ceiling heightscons couple of areas of loose stitching large amount of condensation inside the tent with   people and   dogs   even with condensation vents open tiny puncture mark at the top of tent      
956,1.0,                       the tent is not water resistant   leaks water when it rains  i live on the pnw and used this tent for the first time camping  i loved everything about this tent until it decided to rain and leaked water through the entire bottom half where the darker gray material is  woke up to multiple puddles in the tent as well as my bedding being wet  i had to drive an hour away to buy tarps to place over it  very disappointing especially for a coleman tent     
957,4.0,                       we had minor showers after i put up the tent  there was not much wind but there was definitely some donwpour  the tent can get very stuffy and it did leak water inside at the zippers for the windows  it wasn t much but droplets started percolating inside after about    minutes of rain the structure of the tent  and its size is excellent though  i am not that happy with the water resistant property of the tent  its puts up in   minutes and the only extra      mins needed are to stake it to the ground overall a great tent  but if you are expecting to stay dry without a rainfly  good luck      
958,5.0,                       nothing could be easier   this tent is a less that five minute setup that can actually be done by one person if necessary   the weather tech system feature keeps everything nice and dry inside should your weekend get a little  or a lot   of rain   the only negative it has  or doesn t have and it can be worked around  is not having a ground entry  except for the door  for a power cord should you decide to use a site with electric and it could use a few more hanging side pockets for a tent of this size   overall  it has served us well      
959,1.0,                       used this for the first time this week  had a light rain for a full day  made sure everything was on the mattress in the middle of the tent not touching the walls  we came back to over   gallons of water in the tent it was coming through all the seams and zippers and through the walls  of course i cant return it anymore so i m stuck with a tent that cant keep the dew out     
960,5.0,                       used this as an  overflow  room when me and a group of friends went pop up camping this past summer  was very easy to put up and take down  and even managed to fit the tent back into the bag it came in      
961,5.0,                       coleman   person instant tent i camp maybe three times a year for the past    years and was ready for a new tent   did lots of research and decided to try the coleman   person instant tent extra items purchased coleman   person rain flycamp site floor covering for inside the tenttarp for under the tentcoleman heavy duty metal tent stakesresults lots of room for two people and a dog  not sure i could fit sixeasy up for one person  up in less than five minutes  got great instructions from youtube rained several nights and not a drop of water inside w o having to use a seam sealerable to stand up w o touching the ceiling throughout the entire tent  i m      easy put down and fits back into the bag without any problems  again i did use youtube for instructions before i went camping great air circulation  loved having so many windows only three negativesthe stakes provided are wimpyyou will have to use two hands to open and close the zippered door  what a pain can t zip the windows down very far when it s raining  even with the rain fly  which would be a problem in the summeroverall the positives far out weight the negatives and i would recommend this  with the purchase of the rain fly  to anyone happy camping      
962,1.0,                       total disappointment  first it was assembled wrong on one of the legs  jammed in it looks like they did  having it not be able to push up  do we had to unassemble it to hammer it out to make it work for tge   nights  also these tents leak    light rain fall one night and water was right in it      
963,5.0,                       to say this is a    second stand up is an understatement  once started it almost stood itself up  no more taking forever for shelter      
964,5.0,                       love  love  love  this tent  i used a whole bottle of waterproofing on it before ever using it and was a very smart decision  when it does rain  the condensation still seems to seep in on the sides from place to place but it doesn t drip from the ceiling and it is not as bad as i ve experienced in other tents  there is enough room to get away from the walls and sleep without ever getting wet  i love the ease at putting it up and taking it down  while you could squeeze   people in here  easily if it s all kids   i ll personally do no more than   or        
965,5.0,                       i just got back from   nights of camping in a storm   gale force winds  according to the park rangers  rain so heavy that it scared my dog  trees falling down  etc  amazon was sold out of the rainfly for this tent  so instead i bought a tarp on amazon and used that      x     dry top heavy duty white full size    mil poly tarp item          which didn t need any additional ropes to attach  i just used some rope that the tent had attached that i assume was for the rainfly  the tent help up extremely well  there were two adults and a large dog in it and plenty of extra room  the floor stayed dry  despite pools of water underneath tent all night  so yeah  floor is waterproof   there was some condensation on the walls but that was probably partially due that we had all the windows closed  pretty neat that it can be set up in    seconds too  i definitely would recommend the tent  unless you have to carry it a distance hiking beforehand  but then you really should be looking at smaller tents anyway      
966,2.0,                       we ve been tent camping for over thirty years  that said  we have the knowledge and experience to know quality tents when we have them   just bought this tent for a two night weekend trip  two adults at a really well maintained campground  i added that part to point out that they prepare tenting areas with soft mulch material  and we use a strong ground cloth  we had queen size air mattress  that pretty much took up most of the floor space   we never allowed shoes inside our tents  we closed up the tent and found a hole and tear on the floor material  i couldn t believe it  in all the years with three sons and large dogs using our tents for     weeks at a time  we never wore out a floor   we only replaced them for larger ones as the boys grew  very disappointing  i loved the quick set up  i loved that it has a solid material roof and windows that can be opened from inside   the door zipper was a problem turning the top corner   you need two hands and it was still difficult  i was afraid that would break   never expected the floor to tear   poor quality material      
967,5.0,                       i love my tent  i work for a company that provides shower services for firefighters fighting wildfires  and have lived in this tent for almost    days straight  i have a full size air mattress  table  clothes hamper  travel bags and gear bags all packed in here and still have plenty of floor space  best tent i ve ever owned  and we ll buy another in the future when this one wears out      
968,5.0,                       good product  went up easy  nice and roomy      
969,3.0,                       easy to set up  handled rain ok  there was condensation throughout tent but only small puddle in one corner and no drips on sleeping bags  etc  dried out easily  major problem with door zipper  first trip out and we could not get it to zip shut and had to spend a long time getting it past two spots that wanted to come apart  finally just used door half unzipped and ducked in and out  likely to return      
970,4.0,                       used this tent for   days at winfield bluegrass festival  temperatures ranged from low   f to low   f  had one solid day of very heavy rain and gusting winds  for about   hours straight tent performed very well  though i do recommend the rainfly with the windows zip closed in rainy situations  the ventilation is poor  but managable  in hot sunny weather  with windows unzipped  it is very pleasant as a      burly dude  i had plenty of room to stand inside  fit me  a queen air mattress  and all clothing without issues setup and teardown is delightfullt easy  just remember there is a panel on the bottom of the shipping bag that tears away yo make it easier to stuff back in      
971,3.0,                       love the easy setup  able to setup by myself in under   minutes   straight out of the box  i never pitched a tent before this hate that it leaks in the slightest of storms  my sons bed looked like the attached photo from a light rain      
972,3.0,                       it was alot smaller than it looked  it did fit a queen size air mattress  but that was about all  left very little room to walk around the mattress the seems in the corners  you could actually see daylight through some of them  ggo thing it did not rain while we were using      
973,5.0,                       easiest tent setup i ve ever seen  i m set up cooking smores while my team struggles to piece together their tents  the mosquito netting makes it good for warm weather camping  crack open a screen flap when collapsing  the thing is airtight when its all zipped shut  i d trust this thing under rain or snow  collapses small enough to fit on my kayak along with all my other gear      
974,5.0,                       so  coleman has a video up on how to put up take down their instant tents  i watched it once  i got this tent today and i just put it up by myself in   minute  the take down was even quicker  the only thing you re struggling with is rolling it to get the air out  and it wasn t even a struggle  it just took longer than putting it up and taking it down   all together lol  i seriously don t even know why anyone would by any other tent  other than these instant tents i tried all the zippers  they work perfectly fine  it even had a cute little pop up vent at the top of the tent  seams were well done  i can t wait to go camping      
975,5.0,                       this tent is impressive  i set it up straight out of the box alone  in less than   minutes  its design makes you wonder why tents were not designed like this before  it is roomy  you can easily stand and walk around in it  the air vents at the top with velcro closures are great  it is full of screens and windows  the only thing i would add is ties to tie up the window flaps when open  but on the whole  this tent is fabulous  i remember past years struggling for a long time to get the poles right to hold up cabin tents  but this thing does all that work for you and fast  i love this tent      
976,5.0,                       this   person tent is great for   people max  i can put it up or take it down in under a minute  just purchased the rainfly and hope i will never need it but it will be on the tent when i use it  great for putting up camp after a long day of driving and very quick to take down the next morning when you are ready to move on  i wish the zipper was in the center of the door rather than the d shape  it would make it easier for the person on the other side of the tent to open the zipper without climbing over the person closest to the zipper  very well made  great for horse camping too      
977,5.0,                       this is a great tent   and it literally takes seconds to set up   very durable in heavy rain and high winds   i live in an island and it s a great tent      
978,5.0,                       up and ready to go within    seconds   unfortunately  the first night of use a random guy ended up inside of it so i slept in my car  then  the second night a girl threw up in it   times so i had to leave it behind   sadly  i never got to actually use it fully  i ll probably buy it again next summer      
979,4.0,                       great tent and extremely easy to set up used at a few music festivals and still holding up had some rain then a lake formed under the tent  just had a little bit of water  seep through they should make more this way but use dark room tech      
980,5.0,                       love these   i had two tents that were coleman give away thru marlboro years ago   these are very similar with added attention for wind and a little more sturdy   wish i could find some like those i first had though   set up in less that a minute      
981,5.0,                       this tent was amazingly easy to set up and take down   i love it  it takes camping to a whole new level   we had rain and wind on our first overnight  no leak  no blowdown  no problems      
982,5.0,                       i haven t actually used the new tent yet but i ve owned the   man instant tent for several years now and wouldn t change it a bit  this new tent is actually a replacement for the one we ve worn out  everything about it is perfect  setup and teardown is a snap  only drawback is folded size  a bit large but for car camping it s worth it  love it     
983,4.0,                       even the first time i used this tent  it went up and came down in about a minute   it has plenty of rain flaps and pockets around the tent   for a tent that size the head room is great  i m       and with a slight lean forward i could get dressed standing up   my son and i used it for a cub scout camping trip  and he thought it was awesome   to say this is a   person tent is a bit of a stretch  unless it s four oompa loompas   to get three full size sleeping bags in there would make for a very snug fit and cozy evening   i d definitely recommend this tent for the occasional camper or young teen      
984,1.0,                       first use  it stormed and everything in the tent was soaked  not damp  there was standing water on the floor a friend said these new tents need waterproofed before use  so i did not return it  i got it home  set it up in garage to dry out and then waterproofed the tent  i guess my next outing in the rain will say the truth  if things get wet  oh  coleman will hear from this usually satisfied customer of coleman      
985,4.0,                       this tent is as easy to put up as they say it is  and it s sturdy and resilient  we haven t tested the waterproof qualities  but we were pleasantly surprised by how dustproof sandproof it is  we had trouble taking it down because of dust in the joints  i would recommend bringing along some wd    if you are going somewhere dusty  but that s an easy solution  i agree that it this tent could use more hooks loops pockets for interior storage  but that feels to me like a pretty small issue  for the amount of space  ability to stand up inside  and the manufacturing quality this tent is a very good deal and i would definitely recommend it      
986,4.0,                       bought this because the tent we had was too small for both of us and a dog comfortably  it did rain  and i was stupid and didnt buy the rain fly  usually tents come with one so i was surprised this one didn t  but it set up within    seconds and was easy to take down  i will definitely buy the rain fly and the water resistance seam sealer  so be warned you may get wet if it rains      
987,1.0,                       if you re in an area with small snakes and insects don t buy this tent  the doors do not completely close  coleman has gone away from the d style door which is the best seal you re going to get in a tent  they ve now started using t or l style door where two separate zippers come together at a point and it is a horrible design      
988,3.0,                       so far  the tent is nice   it setup quickly and went down easy   when i rolled it up and placed it back in the bag  i noticed a seam in the bag had split by the handle   as i had only had the tent for about    minutes at that point  i followed the directions to submit a claim online   finally    days later i get a response of  i am sorry but the bag does not have a warranty the warranty is only on the tent  not a great way to start off a relationship with your customers      
989,5.0,                       this tent was very easy to put up and take down  the weather was dry because it had not rained in over a month here   we were at an off road weekend ride with probably     or more razors and off road vehicles   there was a lot of dust and dirt in the camp ground so we kept the tent zipped up during the day   when we got back in the evening our bed and the inside of tent was surprisingly dirt free      
990,5.0,                       it really does set up in    seconds with one person  i can stand erect inside  i m    tall    i can put two cots inside with a nice walkway in the middle      
991,1.0,                       it leaked the  st time we used it  i returned it     
992,2.0,                       update   i contacted amazon about the issue and they sent us a new one with no trouble  we are very happy with our purchase this tent was amazing  so easy to pop up and use in a minute  the only problem was the whole in the floor of the tent  the first time we set it up was at our campsite so we couldn t do anything about it  with the price of the tent i was hoping for a higher quality      
993,5.0,                       very impressed with this tent  i have many tents for every type of camping from drive up to week long back country pack in  my biggest issue with any of my tents is the poles  and the set up take down this tent set up in less than a minute  and it s first use encountered very heavy winds at zion national park the tent passed with flying colors i would and do recommend this tent      
994,2.0,                       this tent was maybe for   people only   it says water proof but it s not reallymaybe for a light rain but if is rain hard get ready because all your stuff will get wet  i don t recommended it at all  the only good about this tent it was easy to setup     
995,5.0,                       camping made simple when it comes to this product  it was so easy to set up  no assembly required  the material is very high quality and i would highly recommend this tent  my only criticism is that it s advertised as a six person tent  when it s really a comfortable two person tent  if you have a queen sized air mattress the amount of room left is perfect for luggage and having a small walkway      
996,1.0,                       just purchased this tent for a week long camping trip  during a typical summer rain storm  the tent leaked significantly  we had to leave and stay in a hotel  it is not waterproof  nor water resistant  the tent was a disappointment as it s supposed to be built for outdoors and it can t handle the weather as advertised  if you re camping in your backyard and there s no chance of rain  i m sure it s suited for that      
997,2.0,                       very easy to put up and take down  this tent is not in any way weather proof  rain got in the windows and in through the top vents      
998,5.0,                       rained on our second night camping   we stayed dry   love the interior height  able to stand              not sure how it will hold up in extreme wind  but for our purposes    adults    small dogs  doing light camping from the car  this tent is ideal      
999,5.0,                       i put this up the first time by myself and it took me a total of   minutes  breaking it down is just as easy and it fits pretty well in the bag  even when rushing and not folding everything up tightly  i always hate when you buy something that is nearly impossible to fit bag in its bag    this is definitely not the case with this tent it does not come with a rainfly so you will need to buy that separately  it s     here on amazon   you never know when rain is going to hit  so i would definitely recommend picking that up along with this purchase      
1000,2.0,                       this tent had the potential to be great  first time using it we had light rain for two hours  it leaked along the entire bottom seam and d door  had puddles throughout the tent with wet air mattresses  what a waste of money on a name brand tent   assembly was quick and easy too  too bad i can never rely on it again and will be collecting dust in storage now      
1001,5.0,                       these are the best tents we ve ever owned  everyone is jealous when we whip our tent up in minutes  we love them so much we have the   man and   man for our family of    the   man is our very own camping castle      
1002,4.0,                       the setup for this tent is very easy as is the breakdown  very spacious for a family of four  we were able to fit two queen size blow up mattresses inside and slept comfortably  the only downside is that upon opening it for the first time we noticed four small holes in the bottom of the tent that i had to fill on my own with a seam sealer      
1003,5.0,                       we haven t used the tent yet  but i did set it up in my living room to check it out before we take it camping  it was  nice and large  my husband could stand up no problem  he s          however  i don t think   people would be too comfortable in here  def not   adults  unless you want to be real real cozy  haha  it s perfect for four though  the set up was way easy  i did it by myself in about a minute  just be careful not to get your fingers in the way while propping the poles up or folding them down  i pinched my finger setting it up  and my husband did the same thing while taking it down  seems like good quality      
1004,4.0,                       mixed feelings about this tent   i m used to camping tents of a higher quality price and this one feels cheap and dark   i can smell the plastic used for the floor   however  it is a good buy for the money and can be pretty easy to put up      
1005,1.0,                       first time taking it camping the whole tent leaked from the seams  walls  and roof  it lasted through the first night that was a bad down pour but the next night with a light rain was leaking all over the tent  i used a seam sealer a couple of weeks prior to camping i can only imagine how bad it would have been without it  only up side is how easy it was to setup  my wife and i were able to open and have it setup within   minutes      
1006,1.0,                       took out the tent for the first time with the rain fly out to the oregon coast and with light rain  there was water droplets inside the tent  and with heavy rain  there was water seeping in from the seams   we had to use a large tarp over the entire tent to make it water resistant   i am going to see if i can return the tent      
1007,5.0,                       rain fly and tent are great at keeping out the rain   roomy enough for       folks fit comfortably in it   i usually camp by myself and it s great   i use a tarp under mine to save from floor wear   vent at top helps with reducing condensation inside   full zip up windows help hold in heat when it s cold   when  glamping  in the summer a portable ac unit works great in it   i love how easy it is to set up and take down by myself      
1008,5.0,                       one man setup approved   takes less than one minute to set up  with little practice  fits multiple cots and camping junk in a way that a liberal arts degree in feng shui isn t required to enter     person is a little weird   fits four cots with little room between to step over people   we fit one cot  a dog bed  a hammok  a chair and a cooler in there with no problems      
1009,1.0,                       if i could give this tent   stars i would  this tent began to leak right as the rain started  i had to move under a pavilion and still just the mist of rain coming in is still coming through  this is absolutely ridiculous seeing as this is a brand new out of the bag tent that is advertised as being waterproof  i will be sending this back and never buying your product again      
1010,1.0,                       i purchased this product and was surprised how easy and fast it was to set up   however it rained on our camping trip and we went back to our tent to find water leaking all over where every large seam was inside the tent   we actually had to pack up and drive home and cancel the rest of our trip   i returned this tent   i am very hesitant to buy another coleman tent  very disappointed with the way it was made      
1011,5.0,                       we bought this for our family s first camping trip with our four year old daughter  my husband is an experienced camper and could not believe how quick and easy assembly was  disassembling takes slightly more time  but still a breeze  looking forward to using it more in the future      
1012,1.0,                       this is the most inferior tent i ve procured   unfortunately i can t give zero stars   on the first use all the seams leaked in a very moderate rainfall   on the second use the door zipper broke and is of no use   the tent is literally going in the trash      
1013,5.0,                       we just got back from our first ever camping trip   i bought this tent a couple of months ago and we  practiced  inthe backyard a couple of times   set it up  sprayed it with a hose  took it down  etc i had read many reviews and quite a few said the tent leaks  so before we went i did spray it with waterproofer and sealed the seams just in case   it rained on and off for the   days we were camping with a very windy and powerful florida thunderstorm thrown in for good measure   it didn t leak a bit   i made sure the top vents were closed good as i saw where rain could probably blow in there  but it didn t at all   maybe we were just facing the right way we also had a fan going and i noticed that the   sides of the tent where the fan blew against stayed bone dry  while the side at the back of the fan that got no air did feel damp  although no water dripped through    so i m wondering if the leaks people are getting are really from condensation we used a queen and a twin air mattress and had room for a small walking space and   large plastic bins of stuff   there is a good amount of room for   adults and a child but i wouldn t want anymore than that in there   there s a loop to hang a lantern in the ceiling which we used  and   pockets   we only used the pocket that is right by the door  it was very handy for the flashlights  keys  and other stuff you might want to grab on your way in and out the windows are nice and big and roll down into themselves   they stayed put even with a good wind   they are at a height where you can leave them open  yet still have some privacy while you are sleeping setup and take down is a breeze   they aren t kidding when they say it only takes a minute   be careful you watch where you put your fingers so they don t get pinched   the bag it comes with is nice too  as it all fits back in there easily   i thought it was very sturdy  the poles were definately more substantial than our camping partners regular tent the only thing i don t like about the tent is the door   it is shaped like a  d  and the zipper doesn t go around the top right curve easily   and i m afraid if anything is going to break it will be this zipper   you need to use both hands to zip it  one to pull the fabric together and one to zip   you also have to be careful when opening the door when the outside of the tent is wet because the water will run inside if you don t hold it just right   we kept a small towel by the door to clean up when that happened we will be buying another  probably the next size up  so we can bring more people next time      
1014,5.0,                       tented while raining no leaks  literally takes    seconds to set up so nice  setting up a tent now is definitely a   person job no need for   people      
1015,4.0,                       pros  setup and portability  great ventilation cons  small and the door zipper does not go all the way around  the zippers meet at the bottom which is not suitable for hawaii s climate  bugs can get in       
1016,4.0,                       we haven t been camping yet but the set up and take down in the backyard was so quick and easy  to get it back in the bag  there is a tear strip which expands the bag  it s very spacious and we can stand inside  the reason i gave it   instead of   stars is the zipper on door gets caught on the flap so you have to zip slowly      
1017,5.0,                       this is the absolute best tent i have ever had  the set up was insanely easy  it just pops right together  it is durable and very nice  we only had two people and a small dog inside  but there was defiantly enough room for two more people  or one more person and your gear  it did not come with a rain cover  i do not know how rainproof it is  luckily we did not have to find out i have been camping my entire life and this is the best tent i have yet to encounter      
1018,3.0,                       i was very impressed with this tent when i bought the first one about   years ago  it was easy for me by myself to put up and take down  but very bulky  but i like to camp out of the back of my  x   in the most remote and secluded camping spots i can find  the front door zipper went out on the first tent  would not close properly  and colemen  sent me a brand new one free of charge  now i have used the new one for over a year and the front door zipper went out again  i tried crimping it down  but it still failed  then would not work at all on my recent camping trip  luckily i had a small spare tent to sleep in  i believe for regular use  this tent will do fine  i like its inside size  and room to stand  and the ability to close up all the windows  have used it through many strong thunderstorms and it did fine  just a lot of condensation on all the walls  as well as when i use my tent heater  its like a sauna in the tent when its below    degrees out  very comfortable  i also feel the poles are a bit fragile  they have not broken yet  but sometimes bend the wrong way when i am laying the tent out  and its a lot of work getting it back in the carrying bag  but it will fit tight after a lot of stuffing it in  i  hope not to discourage anyone from purchasing this tent  i think coleman is a very reputable company  and they even replaced a canopy i bought from them  when one of the plastic brackets cracked within the year warranty  i would purchase another tent from coleman  and will try to get a replacement zipper to try and fix the door so it closes properly      
1019,5.0,                       we took the tent out of the packaging  and from that point  it took    seconds to set up   this tent rocks   the rainfly i ordered hadn t arrived before we left for our trip  so when a wicked storm hit  and lasted for hours with buckets of rain blowing in every direction   i was afraid the tent was going to be a wet  leaky mess   not at all   when i opened the tent  about two tablespoons of water dripped in from the top vent   other than that  it was dry as a bone   this tent is easy to assemble  roomy  and keeps the rain out when properly zipped up   the large windows keep it breezy and comfortable when it s not raining      
1020,1.0,                       defeats the purpose of being a tent  leaks water from the seams during a light rain  even with added rain fly  woke up too a puddle in the tent  very disappointed as our   person tent has no issues      
1021,5.0,                       this coleman instant tent is so easy to assemble and disassemble   i can set it up in minutes   taking it down and rolling it up tightly enough to fit in the storage bag takes a few more minutes   i use three small bungee cords to roll it up nice and snug   the rainfly accessory that goes along with the tent needs to be purchased to keep the rain  dirt and sun off the top of the tent   that too is easy to assemble and i keep my tent stakes  and hammer in the zippered storage bag for the rainfly   there was plenty of space the   person tent is very roomy inside and i use a queen size air mattress and a milk crate turned upside down next to the mattress for a night stand   the mattress and the crate take up the width of the tent but the two make bedtime very convenient and comfortable   i m       and cannot stand up straight inside the tent  but i can stand with my head bent  which is much more comfortable than crawling around the inside of a low dome tent i ve taken this tent on about a dozen camping trips so far and haven t had any issues with it   i did replace the included tent stakes with heavy duty stakes which hold up well in the wind  not because i had an issue with the included stakes but because i had heavy duty stakes available this is a durable  easy to assemble tent  and for me it was well worth the investment      
1022,4.0,                       this is the best tent a camper could ask for  took me and a buddy less than    seconds to setup  super light weight and easy to put away  only downside is that it doesn t seem to be a   person tent  it fit comfortably   of us    would have been tight    person s must mean   kids  also noticed the front door zipper is a little tight and hard to close      
1023,5.0,                       such an easy set up for a tent   we set the clock and it truly sets up in    seconds   zippers all worked properly with no snags   fit our queen size air mattress with space on both sides for storage      
1024,5.0,                       super easy to put up   it also got back in the bag with out much fuss  i am able to stand up in the center  i an       i will be testing it out this weekend      
1025,2.0,                       one good thing about this tent  it goes up fast and easy and comes down fast and easy bad things  it leaks all over even with liberal amounts of rain repellent and an additional rainfly also has a lot of condensation inside  even with the little vents on top opened  outside temps around    degrees  and no one inside  there was condensation dripping off the walls  i ve never had a tent that leaked this bad  and the condensation problem was totally unexpected  bad design i m returning it and getting something else      
1026,5.0,                       no trouble   used   times now  including pouring rain and no water seeped through      
1027,5.0,                       i purchased this tent for a group camping trip to mammoth  and it poured down rain for about half the trip  the tent kept us dry for the most part  the zippers were a little tricky and that ended up getting some of the stuff wet  really easy to set up and take down  the bag even has little ties in it so that you can easily put the tent back in the bag after using it the first time      
1028,4.0,                       we took this tent camping for the weekend  i loved how easy it was to set up   we got to our spot late friday night and we set up the tent in the dark with ease   i rated   for water resistance because i didn t get to test it in the rain    one thing that was really nice is on the roof in the center inside the tent there is a nifty loop to hang a light on  would definitely recommend      
1029,5.0,                       this is easy to set up while the kids run off into the woods playing  has been weather proof in the wind and cold      
1030,1.0,                       the tent arrived on time and setup was easy  the first night i used it there was a thunderstorm and the tent leaked  water was pouring in through one of the zipper  the pic shows a pool of water inside the tent      
1031,1.0,                       thought this would be good for car camping  good thing we had the car because we needed it  this tent is in no way water resistant  or weatherproof for that matter  even in a mild drizzle there was water seeping through the tent material  the video you watch makes it seem like the tent itself does not need a rain fly  however it needs a lot more  do not buy this tent unless you want to get wet while camping in any rain      
1032,5.0,                       this tent was one of the best purchases during quarantine  literally took    seconds to set up  light weight  great price and great quality  my kids are so excited to  camp out  tonight and roast smores  highly recommend      
1033,3.0,                       spent a weekend in the keys  it s rained a lot and water came in through the seams  it was rough but easy set up      
1034,1.0,                       water gets in from dew alone   i would hate to see it after it rains    i watched a video from coleman about how their tents are waterproof tested and fail testing if more than a tablespoon of water gets in   i know that is bs     don t buy this      
1035,5.0,                       roomy enough for a tall queen sized air mattress  it goes up very quickly even from the first try right out of the box   when taking it down  though remember to keep the windows and vents partially unzipped  otherwise it s like deflating a large balloon      
1036,1.0,                       just opened and it has   big rips  holes in roof  stains and poles are scratched  it s outside return window  i m not happy  leave for   week camping trip in    days now have to buy a new tent  if i didn t know better i d say this was a used tent      
1037,5.0,                       just watch this tent get put up on u tube  it is a good item  my wife and i have it up in less than a min  but this is one tent you will have to spike   if you tent and don t cant spike a tent please keep this in mind   we have to put in a queen air mattress because of my back surgary   but if it is one person or just a double bed you may be able to avoid it but i really suggest getting a cheap hammer and keeping it in your camping gear  i fell you should have one already in your gear  but to each their own  plan on putting in tent pegs      
1038,4.0,                       survived   years at burning man so far  though there haven t been any ungodly wind storms these past years   it s cheap  all of the windows zip fully up  and the top vent can easily be blocked off  i probably should have gotten the   person version  because this one is a little small for   people plus all our gear      
1039,5.0,                       product is just as advertised  i am a single woman and i could set and breakdown tent all by myself  first time you struggle a bit until you figured it out  instructions sown to the storage bag are clear and easy to follow  interior  held   x large cots and small folding table   i brought the rain tarp also  i would definitely buy again      
1040,4.0,                       would have given it   stars if you didn t have to buy the rain fly separate      
1041,5.0,                       i m never going back to a traditional tent after this  the instant tent was so easy to set up a take down  its very spacious inside  we were able to fit our queen size air mattress and two smaller kids twin mattresses with no problem  get it  you won t be disappointed      
1042,5.0,                       this tent goes up like a breeze with a simple twisting motion   it s big enough  somewhat durable and well constructed   hope to be able to use this for many years      
1043,5.0,                       i loved this tent  definitely worth the money  easy set up  very spacious  for the   person one so of course it would be huge and i loved it      
1044,2.0,                       we went camping and the rain puddled on the top of the tent and ended up flooding the inside  it was very spacious though      
1045,4.0,                       first usage last night   great tent  but a little small   way too tight for   adults   i had two  y o kids and myself and it was just right  big screened windows and a roof vent kept it cool  my   y o son put the tent up without my help   i wish the guy lines were more visible   i added some bright yellow accents to keep from tripping      
1046,5.0,                       this is a huge comfortable family sized tent   it s heavey but really sets up in minutes   takes much longer to get back in it s bag   this is what you want if your camping right outside of your car      
1047,1.0,                       coleman quality control is the worst   the first coleman tent we ordered had the wrong tent in the right box     not sure how the factory managed the mess up  as the inner bag contained the right tent and directions  but the tent was totally different   the second tent ordered received was the coleman   person instant tent  used the tent this weekend and light rain resulted in totally wet experience   the seam at the top of the tent was not properly sewn and leaked  as well as one of the seams on the side of the tent where it connects to the poles   i only recommend this tent if you don t mind putting a blue plastic tarp over your tent in the rain  just as you would do to cover holes in the roof of your house      the only positive thing is that it sets up and packs up easy        
1048,2.0,                       i purchased this new tent for an upcoming camping trip because my    years old academy broadway finally started leaking   i was tempted by the easy set up and the claim that the material is water proof   i also ordered the rain fly   this should be included  not offered separately   i pitched the tent in my yard   the set up was as easy as advertised   in the afternoon we had a typical thunderstorm that was perfect to test the tent   i was not expecting the seams to be all perfect  and indeed several leaked   what is really disturbing is that water percolated in several places away from the seams  as if the material had pin holes in it   clearly  coleman cannot claim that the material is water proof   it is not   i will keep the tent  but will apply seam sealant throughout and scotchguard on the fabric  i am an experienced camper from desert to rain forest   i have no issues spending a few nights out with just my poncho  and i don t expect to be bone dry during a camping trip   however  i cannot recommend this product because either coleman misrepresents the water proofing  or has serious problems with quality control   this is not acceptable      
1049,2.0,                       we used this brand new tent and when it started to rain this thing started to leak from everywhere  i have used other tents and they don t leak like this  really disappointed     
1050,5.0,                       all around a good tent easy to set up and take down  fit in the carrying bag too with ease   hold up in the wind very well   mph for   day and didn t break  but i did have it tied down and a rainfy for it  in the rain wall got damp where  my air mattress was touching it but not bad  i might put nikwax tent canopy sealant on it to take care of that because in a heavy down poor i could see the tent leaking for sure     
1051,4.0,                       two problems      two sides of the tent don t have tiedowns so when the wind picks up the sides cave in  i had to use a couple rocks to weight them down      the material of the tent is so thin on top that when the sun is beating down  the suns rays and gets very hot  if you could put an extra dark material on top it would help prevent this      
1052,5.0,                       it was the easiest tent ever i had in my life to put up  and yes i had it almost up on my own  until my friend decided they wanted to help      
1053,4.0,                       easy to set up  nearly impossible to get back in the bag  did not hold heat well at all  but held in condensation that froze  in all pretty nice  the quick set up is very nice      
1054,2.0,                       beware this tent has no rainfly included and despite the marketing claims  water comes right with just light rain  shame on you coleman  how about including a rainfly for the money      
1055,2.0,                       all of the low star review topics would have been way higher if the tent was not defective upon arrival  this tent would have gotten all stars after our first time using it if it was not defective in a spot  we ordered our tent one week and used it that weekend camping  went to set it up  it set up easy and upon zipping it up  realized the bottom zipper was missing  the zipper line was there but the the metal piece to zip it closed  so needless to say  we couldnt zip the bottom part of our tent up that night to keep moisture and bugs out      
1056,5.0,                       excellent tent  one person can set it up in about    minutes  two people can set it up in about   minutes      
1057,5.0,                       best tent ever  easily put up by myself  huge and can stand in  durable   my favorite tent i ve ever owned      
1058,3.0,                       had small hole in window  easy set up   take down however hard to put back in case  love all the windows  going to be a tight fit with three people sleeping on air mattresses  medium dog   luggage  friend has same one   didn t work in rain  would love ideas how to mend window vs having to return since we need a tent sooner than when a new one would arrive      
1059,2.0,                       i haven t camped in quite a few years  i bought this because of the ease in setting the thing up  it was very easy to set up but that is it as far as this tent goes    person  i m a person  a      person  once i was in the tent  that was it as far as room was concerned    person  maybe    little persons at that  it leaked quite a bit  it wasn t the hardest of rains but the tent was full of water by the time i got back into it  very disappointed in this product      
1060,1.0,                       i could not believe that there was water dripping inside   i don t even have this type of problem with the cheaper off brand tents i ve purchased in the past and that my other family uses      
1061,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          first time i use the tent it rains i might as well of just slept outside i was drenched worst     bucks i spent   if you buy it water proof it before you actually sleep in it      
1062,3.0,                       very easy to set up  and comfortable spacing  does not come with a top cover for weatherproofing  took it out camping and it was sprinkling outside  the tent began to absorb the water and it started dripping through into the tent at night      
1063,5.0,                       it really is up in a minute and goes down in about the same amount of time  very spacious and i m looking forward to camping again in it      
1064,5.0,                       an excellent product for the price  this is very well made and extremely easy to assemble  the zippers are very strong and the screens are of a good quality  a great car camping tent for family use  buy this one with confidence      
1065,4.0,                       set up was nice an easy  made tent set up fun  had a massive burst of rain for    mins  held up good  damp inside following  but not soaked      star     
1066,5.0,                       love the tent  really easy to set up and take down  it s a little heavy  but that wasn t unexpected  tall enough for me to stand up in   i m       held up to the heat of     degree death valley and the wind that comes in the afternoon  loved that i can set it up by myself if needed      
1067,5.0,                       great tent  very easy to set up and take down  didn t get any moister inside  just wish i ordered the   man instead of the        
1068,1.0,                       the packed size is too big and heavy  almost twice the regular dome tent  impossible to carry when you fly and hard to fit in the trunk of the car with other camping stuff  eventually had to return it      
1069,5.0,                       this tent setup fast  has plenty of room  you can stand up inside to get dressed  zippers move nice and easy  loved having windows all the way around the tent  packed up easy and i also liked that the door is big shoes to get in and out of      
1070,5.0,                       easy to set up  it could be put up by one person  it has enough room and you can stand up in it  you have the ability to ventilate it as well      
1071,4.0,                       this tent was so easy to put up  i really did it in  almost  under a minute  it was a bit harder to take down  only because i couldn t remember which way the legs folded in and the directions only explain how to put it up      
1072,4.0,                       i put the tent up as fast as it advertise  it can fit   people if people were stacked like sardines and nobody have supplies  it was enough space for a twin blowup mattress  cooler  tote bags  and some random items      
1073,5.0,                       this tent is amazingreally easy pop up tent and set up takes less than   minutesvery durable and strong  it withstood winds over   mphthis tent can fit   queen size blow up mattress  so it s a giant tentmake sure oyu buy the rain tarp if you wanna ensure to be dry      
1074,3.0,                       it is easy to set up and put away as they announce but when they say   people they really should write   children  for a family of      parents and   children you fit but like sardines  so we are returning it and getting the   people tent      
1075,5.0,                       i wish i had known this tent was several inches taller than the     height stated in the description   i would have bought it a few years ago instead of the coleman instant   man tent because this one is perfect for a solo camper with three little dogs   knowing what a great tent the   man is  and how easy they are to set up  i purchased this because i wanted a smaller tent   this one is the perfect size for me and the crew      
1076,1.0,                       this tent has been has been put up before as there were holes in the floor at every post   i guess i can just put duct tape over the holes   also   the quality of the tent material really was disappointing   very thin and flimsy   i don t expect too much out of this tent   but we ll see   was easy to put up   a little harder to take down      
1077,5.0,                       we live in sd  n we been getting tons of rain  i set it up about   weeks ago   still dry inside      
1078,5.0,                       fastest tent set up i ve encountered  first  time used was an archery deer hunt  great quality  sturdy   nd night out was a thunderstorm and  torrential down poor with wind guests  get the fly and waterproof spray  and take a tarp for cover the windows      
1079,4.0,                       it was a nice size tent  we put it up very quickly but    there were   holes in it  we sent it back      
1080,5.0,                       just received it on friday and immediately took it to the lake for the weekend   it literally took me    seconds to put it up the first time   i did look at a couple of the videos on youtube first  but i would have done it just as fast without watching them it rained on and off all night  not a drop of moisture came inside   very sturdy taking it down was just as quick and easy   and it actually fit back in the bag without any problem we had one full and one twin air mattress inside and had lots of room to spare for gear this was my best purchase in a long  long time   i highly recommend it   i only wish my camp shower went up as quick and easy      
1081,3.0,                       i kinda like this tent  but still feel like it needs some improvement first  the  fit and finish   the tent material drapes very loosely  even when staked down  it has a cheap wrinkled appearance to it  unlike a tightly fitted internal frame tent that stretches the fabric so that the wrinkles come out and water doesn t get trapped in them  i suppose it doesn t make a huge difference in how rain repellent it is  but it looks cheaply made  we went camping with a half dozen other families for boy scouts  and our tent was by far the least attractive  it was cool for the first five minutes  we got the expected  oohs and aahs  from our friends after it set up so quickly  but no one  including myself was impressed after that  we purchased a rainfly for the tent and had it overnighted because the weather report showed heavy rain and thunderstorms  the rainfly was definitely useful  but i can t understand why they wouldn t have included it with the tent  you have to fork over another    bucks to coleman to get it  even though you can buy a    dollar tent at walmart that has one included  not cool that coleman would do that second  the bulkiness of the tent negates its overall usefulness  we have several tents  one of them a cabin style    person tent  and that tent bagged up is only slightly larger than this one in it s bag  if you have a small car or a lot of gear with not much trunk space  this one will be a hassle to pack up  obviously  the reason for the bulk is that the poles are thicker and the canvas  since it s attached  can t be folded and packed up tightly  and these are just the disadvantages of having an instant tent  gotta take the bad with the good lastly   x  does not sleep four adults comfortably  so if you re looking for a four person tent  go up in size  my          lb wife and i and our two boys    and   barely fit in this tent  and we didn t even have our gear stored in here  we used a coleman double high twin bed that turns into a king size when un stacked  and that fit perfectly in the tent  but i had elbows  knees and feet jammed all into my body both nights we were in camp  i can t imagine it would even be tolerable if four undersized adults slept in here together to sum it up  i think this tent is just okay  i like that there are no pieces to lose  and that it goes up quickly  which is a big advantage when setting up at night or in the rain  when i go fishing with my sons for the day  and just need something to store gear and rest in  this tent will be perfect  however  for overnight camping  i ll probably keep looking for something better  there are less expensive tents that take only a few minutes longer to set up that are more useful than this one      
1082,3.0,                       this tent was super easy to set up  it was not  however  watertight  we camped right on the ocean and this tent couldn t handle the constant moisture in the air on the coast  unfortunately  besides that drawback  this tent was actually amazing      
1083,1.0,                       set up fast and worked well on our first trip out   however  upon returning home we set it up to clean it prior to storage and found several holes in the fabric   it looks like fabric must have been pinched when we closed it up   there were no holes while we stayed in if over the week long camp trip  if it s not repairable we will request a refund      
1084,5.0,                       easiest setup ever  no more regular tent with poles to push through for us ever again hahaha  fits a queen size air mattress with room for your bags and other too much crap we all bring camping     over all a great tent so far      
1085,5.0,                       it s everything they say it is  i just wish it compacted a little smaller     
1086,1.0,                       terrible water resistant and weatherproofing  camped last weekend and it was raining more inside than outside       
1087,4.0,                       just got our tent today   i set it up in under a minute  by myself   then later  my husband set it up with me in about    seconds   but we learned fast to watch your fingers while folding it up   i got both hands crushed inside the poles and couldn t get free   it was so tight we actually thought one of my fingers broke   we won t be allowing our children to put the tent away   i rated this   stars because of this   we bought the rain fly   still waiting for it to arrive   i don t understand why that isn t included in the tent   but very spacious  and super easy   can t wait to take it out      
1088,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i purchased this tent because the description stated that no rainfly was needed and truth be told i was tired of dealing with rainflys  tents should be waterproof from the factory  this tent was not waterproof at all  the reviews that say things like  i sprayed it with a garden hose  and give it   stars before they even use it should not be allowed  the middle of the tent was soaked because even though the top vents have covers  that were closed  they allow enough moisture to get in that it collects on the screen and drips  the bottoms of the walls were also pooling with water from windows  also  when you open the door the water that collects above the door drains into the tent  if we had not had the tent on a platform i am sure the bottom of the our mattress would have been soaked  buy a tarp or rainfly for this tent  i am guilty of having many expensive electronics along with me on  rustic  camping trips and if you share my guilt do not make the same mistake i did  my laptop was in the fifth wheel camper or else it would have been destroyed  my clothes and battery chargers were damp but not harmed  i have purchased a tarp and seemsealer for the tent so hopefully i can waterproof it  i do feel this tent is designed well other than the problems with leaking  it sets up in less than    seconds and they give you a big bag to put the tent back into so that takes maybe a minute once you get all the air out  i would give this tent   stars if it came with a rainfly and did not make false claims      
1089,5.0,                       this is the easiest tent to put up  no poles  everything is already connected you just push it up  the   person tent was very roomy for   people with a queen sized air mattress  enough room to walk around the mattress  putting it down is also quick but it can be a little difficult to roll it up and get it back into the bag  all in all great tent  would recommend      
1090,2.0,                       got a rip first time i used it  easy setup though and otherwise worked fine needs better material as a base      
1091,2.0,                       the tent held up great in a       mph wind but failed miserably to keep us dry in a light rain   even with the rainfly on  water seeped in from the seams leaving large pools of water all around the tent and getting our items wet  definitely not a  weather tech  tent  bonus   the bottom zipper on the door broke the second night      
1092,5.0,                       the first time i set up this tent it took me less than five minutes and i only read the directions on the top of the tent   this thing is super easy to set up and taking it down is just as easy  on our first trip after i took down the tent a camper from a site across from us came by to ask about the tent  because he saw how easy it was to take down  i am not sure if it will be a good tent for the rain but i think it will do great with a rain tarp  i have had  many tents in my life  but this is the easiest to use by far  it seems durable  but time will tell      
1093,1.0,                       the bottom is so tin   it gets scratches and wholes at the slightest touch water comes through the seems and windows zippers front door is hard to open and closei had a columbia tent that lasted for    years without a scratch   i only bought this one because is easy to set up  you can put it up in   minutes  other than that is very poor quality     
1094,5.0,                       awesome tent  i have the same one in a   person   x    this   person tent has the same    d material and taped seams  first night we had a massive thunderstorm and not a drop of water      
1095,5.0,                       great product  works great  must have  they will last  remember  you get what you pay for   kyle     
1096,4.0,                       i bought a   man s instant tent  coleman  i was impressed the article arrived quickly  my husband set and collapsed it w out  help  i wouldn t be able to do it myself    there is a flap above the  tent just in case it rains  it fits   cots which were purchased   amazon as well  the gears and personnal luggage can be stored under the cot to give room for an aisle  the height is just right for changing his clothes   i am five feet and he is       it may accommodate   people if the occupants are   adults and    preschool kids  my husband likes it  the plan is   it will be used twice a year  looking forward to using it next month  september        suggestion  if you are looking for a   man s tent   get a   man s tent  this will  fit    sleepimg bags and enough room for their backpacks and personal belongings  the   man s tent description should be changed to a state two man s tent  not four  cres     
1097,4.0,                       i m a novice when it comes to camping  so needless to say  i don t want a tent that s hard to put up  this was super easy  well done coleman  i may move to the mountains and live outdoors forever  not      
1098,5.0,                       best tent ever         easy to use  comfortable  durable   we have used it many  many times now   when this one finally wears out we will definitely buy another one      
1099,5.0,                       omg  this is amazing       seconds to open the tent and bam  camping starts  easiest tent set up ever        
1100,3.0,                       retired and tent camping around usa for over   years   the previous model had   hubs on the roof making setup and tear down much easier than the new single hub roof   the previous model also came with a rain fly   now you must buy it separately   you must have a rain fly to stay dry   coleman must not compare old vs new when field testing   not a true  cabin  tent with the single hub in the center of the roof      
1101,1.0,                       i bought this tent for a canoe trip  i single handedly set it up in under   minutes  it breaks down just as easy as it goes up    people in this tent would be quite a squeeze it did not rain on my canoe trip  yet the walls of the tent in the morning were completely saturated and dripping into the tent just from the morning dew  thank god it didn t rain or i would have been swimming in the tent  even if you purchase the rainfly to go with this tent  it doesn t come with one for some strange reason  everything inside the tent is probably still going to be wet in the morning just from moisture in the air i wish i could have returned this tent but its too late now  don t make the same mistake i did and jump on this purchase i hate to give a review like this because coleman generally produces a great product  but i was so disappointed in this tent i had to warn other buyers      
1102,1.0,                       i sealed the edges with inside the tent even sprayed a waterproofing over top rain fly and tent  water  still found its way in and pooled up in the corners and dripped in from the sides  the rain fly is poorly designed for this tent to allow rain to drop right on front door   very poor design by coleman which is disappointing  i do not recommend unless you re  tenting  out in full sunny weather      
1103,5.0,                       this tent  looks like it will be my family s best friend in coming years  with its outstanding fabric and metal quality  weather tech stitches and weldings  spacious but compact dimensions and its lovely khaki color  it has already earned my heart  we will try this soonest possible and i recommend everyone consider buying its rainfly together too i recommend this   season tent to everyone  who do not need to use a tent in extreme winter      
1104,1.0,                       i bought a new tent  ordered it on a fast delivery  came in   days and it was used and filthy  absolutely impossible to get help from customer service  only bots who will not recognize the problem  still haven t found a way to contact customer service and i ve been trying for parts of   days  now if i understand when i cancel my new prime i ll get charged shipping on all products i ve ordered      
1105,2.0,                       not waterproof in areas not covered by rain fly  had great experience with tent until using it in rain  all the lower wall areas not covered by rain fly  separate purchase  leaked significantly  it does go up quick and is great for car camping but does not work in rain as designed even with the corresponding rain fly accessory from coleman      
1106,1.0,                       description says weatherproof  however the rain leaked through the tent pooling on the floor      
1107,5.0,                       so easy to set up      
1108,4.0,                       easy to put up  takes a few minutes to take down the bag has a strap you release to help open the bag wider which makes it much easier to put the tent away      
1109,4.0,                       this tent held up under really strong thunderstorms  even though amazon sent me the wrong size rainfly  so it didn t even have rain flyon   it was easy to put up and not rocket science to take down  it even fit back into the original bag  it s not light or small  but i liked it a lot      
1110,5.0,                       i bought the tent for my grandchildren and they absolutely loved it   description is accurate  it took    seconds to set up  which their parents are excited about   would diffidently recommend buying this tent      
1111,1.0,                       we put it up once in our front yard to check it out and we were very very excited   it was quick and easy and spacious   then  second time around we were putting it up again and a main piece just broke off   luckily  amazon has a lovely return policy and we got to return it   unfortunately  they charged me     or so for it      
1112,4.0,                       two nine year olds set this up in less than   minutes   a bit harder to take down and very difficult to stow back in its bed but much roomier than other   person tents     
1113,5.0,                       i love this tent and can really set it up in    seconds  we were timed at    seconds  had to look on line how to take it down  but that was easy too      
1114,5.0,                       i was very hesitant to buy this tent  because the hassle of putting it together  guess what  it is ready to go  it took me les than five minutes to have it all set up   i love it     
1115,1.0,                       bought this in february      and used it once in april      without problems   the real test came on the second camping yesterday with a   hour rain overnight which caused seepage of rain water through out all   sides of the tent   thank goodness the ceiling did not leak due to the rainfly on top   using   towels  we removed approximately   gallons of water from the floor of the tent   read that weathertec would keep the rain out   i should have used scotchguard or campdry before taking this tent out   at least it was a boys scout camping lesson learned for my boys and me      
1116,5.0,                       so easy to set up  one person can do it no problem  quality is great  only used a few times but it seems like it will last  get the rain fly  this should really come with it  survived a rain storm first time we used it no problem  would be nice if there was a least a slight overhang above the door  you can t open it without rain getting inside  but fortunately there is plenty of room inside  for two people anyway  that you have space to get in and leave your wet stuff away from your sleeping area   overall an awesome tent for the        
1117,5.0,                       purchased two tents for the kids  both have water at the front every time it rains  i first assumed the kids had not done it up properly but doing it myself it is still leaking like crazy on both tents     
1118,5.0,                       used it  set it up     x s with my kids on our      mile cross country road trip this fall   easy to set up  warm and fought the wind on the western plains   i have owned   tents and i was happiest with this one   however    person  is a real stretch     very comfortably with room to spare    ok    hmmmm    pushing it with no room for stuff       yeah right      
1119,2.0,                       my friend got the   man instant tent and was in a high wind and rain storm    dry  i bought the   man instant tent    night of rain  drenched       the sides and top were dripping   and as the rain ran down the walls it puddled all over the floor  i ended up with a kids sand bucket filled       full of water from the floor  the next morning  i could also see some pin holes in the seam around the top vent  the concept is great  now i will have to buy the rainfly         i could have gotten an l l  bean tent with a full warranty for the money i have to invest now  oh  there reply to my e mail to them   been   days today and no answer     
1120,5.0,                       this tent is awesome  with two people  it literally takes less than a minute to set up   it s also very easy to take down    it s more difficult with one  it s very spacious inside   one review i read mentioned not having ties inside for the window flaps  but i didn t have a problem with that  i just rolled the window flaps inward and they stayed tucked in nicely we woke to a downpour one morning and i was concerned about leaks  but there weren t any  so the rainflapless construction works well i love this tent      
1121,5.0,                       bragged to our friends about this tent being so easy to set up  under    seconds  blah blah  they called us on it   prove it  we re gonna time you      seconds  without even hustling  so easy  great construction  this   person tent is the perfect size to put a queen sized airbed or two single self inflaters in and still have room on the sides end to put bags and things  so really   person and a dog  you could squeeze into a smaller one  but this one has been just right for us      
1122,2.0,                       this tent is very easy to put up  however it leaks terribly  we only used it   times and the center poles snapped  very dissatisfied     
1123,5.0,                       i love this tent  super easy and functional  able to set it up all alone within litterally   min     
1124,5.0,                       purchased this tent and absolutely love how easy it was to put up   we went with a group of people and we popped it up in a minute  then we helped everyone else put up their tent   ours was by far the best of the   tents at our camp site   it was hot during the day  and cool at night   we did not get any condensation inside the tent   i was pleasantly surprised that it came with a bag to put it in  the description didn t mention that it came with it   my next purchase will be the rain fly   we had no rain  but it did look bare without the top cover      
1125,5.0,                       i bought this taking the advertising with a grain of salt fully expecting it to be more difficult to assemble than just popping it up  but it honestly took two of us maybe   minutes to figure out how it worked and to get it erect   and it was just as easy to take down and pack up    it toughed it out through   impressive storms and not a drop of water on the inside   and i had a queen size airbed in it and it touched all the corners   i don t know if i would put   people in this tent  and ended up buying a smaller airbed for future use  a queen leaves very little room for anything else      
1126,2.0,                       super easy to set up but unless you re   people are less than    on average and are super skinny then they re not all sleeping in there  we were ok with it seeing as there s only   of us but then after using it for   nights on of the straps holding the tent to the exterior bars broke  it had not been sewn in properly  wish me luck with customer service      
1127,5.0,                       i am very impressed on how easy this set up is i ve been using this tent on the last three trips and i love it it is nice and big and easy to set up and rap up very good investment still haven seen how it performs in rain but had winds blowing       mph and the tent was solid very happy with this tent     
1128,1.0,                       horrible fabric  rain gets into tent through walls  it is super easy to put up  but not worth it  completely useless   we ended up looking for a hotel at   am because the tent and everything inside of it was drenched      
1129,4.0,                       live in hawaii   went camping during a flash flood warning but in a relatively safe place   rained at a rate of   inches per hour   truly biblical   used the extra rainfly and a bottom tarp   tent did not leak even from the deluge or mini stream draining around the tent   the only few drips were condensation but with     percent humidity you expect that   thought we would need to bail out the tent due to the rain but that didn t happen tent with rainfly  survived deluge   tent is rlelatively easy to set up and take down for a middle aged couple   fits one queen sized air bed and room for gear   comfortably   one point off for plastic tarp floor but it did hold up      
1130,1.0,                       light rain all day  puddles all over my tent  i camp at least a dozen times a year  liked the easy set up but camping isn t any fun when you get wet      
1131,5.0,                       i think this tent is awesome  just what i needed  only thing it came with     tears  like someone dragged it before putting it in it s bag  but since i hate the hassle of returning stuff i will fix it myself  camp on my friends         
1132,1.0,                       this coleman tent is not waterproof as the product claimed so it s not weatherproof either  i was very disappointed waking up with water all around my air mattress and floor of tent  easy set up yes  lightweight yes  just don t get caught camping when it s raining  disappointing claim that it s waterproof and it did not say what it claimed  there was a small hole on one of the windows      
1133,4.0,                       love the instant tent idea   it literally took   minute to set up and one minute to take down   took another minute to put in the bag that comes with it  but it easily fit  the missing star is because it is suggested that this is a four person tent  no way  unless they are standing   albeit hunched over  the height is good for kids  but a little short for us older guys   i kept this one for the kids  and also purchased the   person tent instant tent    stars on  that one  keep in mind  these tents take up a lot of storage space in your vehicle  plan ahead      
1134,5.0,                       i recently took this tent camping with my son   we also have a large family tent but i wanted something smaller that would set up and take down quickly for weekend hunting camping trips with my son   the very first time i used the tent i had it up in less than    seconds   it s that easy  it is well sealed and retained nice interior warmth for the cool weather we were camping in   it took a bit longer to take the tent down  perhaps   minutes  but it easily fit back inside the bag   it s definitely small for   people  but perfectly roomy for two and three would be do able  this is what i expect when purchasing tents  so no surprise there    it s a bit on the heavy side  but if you re camping next to your vehicle this tent is ideal   the materials seem very durable and i expect that this tent will be great for many years to come      
1135,5.0,                       after storing it for a year  i was able to set it up in under a minute  alone  in the dark  super awesome tent  i would highly recommend  both for camping and for burning man      
1136,4.0,                       i bought the   and   person versions of this tent   i have taken them both camping one time   i have experienced severe rain in both of them   i had to send the   person tent back because of a malfunction in one of the poles  but it was easy to make it work for the   days i kept it out setup   very easy  my daughter was able to set hers up without any issues what so ever  took her a little more than a minute  but very little effort to get on of these set up and staked out   we did not use the guy lines  the tents were pretty stable through high winds and heavy rain takedown   as easy to take down as they are to setup  rolling them up is a little awkward with all the poles attached  but they both still fit nicely inside the bag they come in  even without have to expand the bottom rain resistance   i ordered the rain fly for both of these of tents   i knew rain was coming  so i put them on   i did not feel a single drop of water through the roof   the sides stayed dry on the inside as well   the bottom did not let any ground moisture through that i could feel   just be sure not to leave things pressed against the side of the tent or you are guaranteed to get water through the sides   and never ever buy a tent without a rainfly if you expect to stay dry comfort   it s a tent   how comfortable can it be   i like the size of the   person  it could hold three people with plenty of space to spare    very close    or   i can t imagine any room to move about  but it could definitely fit them   i m      and was able to stand in the   person   the four person fit my daughter just fine  and would be great for two people complaints   only complaint i have is the zipper on the door gets a little tough to pull at the corner area overall  pretty good tent   i feel like they will last a very long time if taken care of      
1137,5.0,                       i ordered the tent for a backyard camp out with my grandson   it is just the perfect size for two people with room to store other camping essentials   the next morning after our camp out it was raining so i left the tent up   it rained most of the day and when i checked inside the tent it was completely dry   i had purchased the rain fly and it was on the tent which i am sure helped tremendously   the tent was so easy to put up and take down if you are thinking about buying this tent for four people  think again   it would be a tight squeeze      
1138,5.0,                       if you need to camp out now and then and are not too graceful with assembling tents etc this may be just what you need   i am often a single traveler and got it to take to different music festivals where camping is almost required because of the remote location of the festival   i had my doubts but setup was quick and easy  i had it set up and on my way to the main stage area within    minutes   ok it wasn t the one minute setup they said was possible  but at the same time if you saw my last attempt with the flex rods on a dome tent you would be a believer as well   teardown is a little more cumbersome because you have to get all the air out of the tent  but leave your windows partially unzipped and it goes a lot faster because the air has more areas to escape      
1139,5.0,                       this tent is beyond amazing   when it says  instant tent  it means it    the whole set up takes     minutes including staking it down it s very spacious and well made my boyfriend and i took it to a music festival where there was very high winds and a dust storm  everyone else s tent got destroyed but this one stayed standing strong  i highly highly recommend        
1140,4.0,                       goes up and comes down fast and easily  my only complaint is that the rain fly is sold separately  as i would rate this product five stars if it were included rather than a separate purchase      
1141,5.0,                       my significant other and i are not campers  as in never been camping since the  th grade science camp   although we were invited by a friend to celebrate her birthday by camping  so i decided to research the best and easiest option for a tent  since we were not advent campers and both of us had continuous physical back and knee ache i wanted to make our experience the least taxing on our bodies we purchased this tent watched a video on youtube on how to pitch the tent   sure enough we had it up in a snap  we fit a queen size double stack blow up bed and there was still room walk around and stand up straight  even our    tall friends felt this tent was spacious the one negative is that this tent does not come with a rainfly  our last night camping it was really windy and rainy and water did seep through the seams of the windows  kinda annoying  so definitely purchase a rainfly for this  tent  outside of that we love love loved it      
1142,5.0,                       super cool  easy to setup  feels sturdy  great tent so far  having to buy the topper separate is dumb and if any part breaks i think your screwed but so far its perfect      
1143,4.0,                       i liked how quick and easy it was to set up and take down the tent  i also like that it has netted ventilation  it s also very spacious  unfortunately  it had a hole in it when i purchased it and i noticed it during the initial setup      
1144,5.0,                       i m a first time camper  single mom with a     year old  helping  and this tent took me     mins to get up in my backyard  this was with no staking   without reading any instructions  will update review after camp      
1145,5.0,                       been camping for over    years       best tent i have ever had  i have   of these in my family      
1146,2.0,                       the first night we used this water seeped all over into our tent and   of the stake loops broke   not well made      
1147,1.0,                       very easy to assemble  however  it is not waterproof   will need to purchase the rain fly and hopefully that helps  i live in washington and it does rain often here rain fly did not help  moisture inside the tent is bad  even with windows open as much as possible in the rain i do not recommend this tent  i am having to buy a different one this year   waste of money      
1148,5.0,                       works great  goes up and down really easy and fast  very satisfied with this tent      
1149,5.0,                       setup for the first time last night in the dark and it still took less than   minute to setup with me and my fiance  zippers feel great  i love the head space almost enough to stand up  i hope this lasts as long as our last tent      
1150,5.0,                       this tent is amazing  it literally sets up in    seconds with   people  i was able to fit a queen size blow up mattress with some room left over for   regular sized black crates  the windows are nice and large      
1151,5.0,                       best tent i have ever owned  it says    seconds but after a while it s more like    seconds      
1152,5.0,                       great tent  set up and take down are simple  streamlined and perfect for car camping with little kids  spacious for our   people and large doggo  awesome tent      
1153,5.0,                       even for someone as assembly challenged as me  it was incredibly easy to set up this tent  did not take me    seconds  with putting up a rain cover   took about    minutes     minutes to assemble my first ever tent   do get a rain cover    this tent is great for   people  will fit   if you do not need a lot of personal space      
1154,5.0,                       i opened the box  took the bag out  opened it and in less then   minutes i alone set it up  and i m a girl  the tent stakes suck  i set ths tent up in my backyard before a storm to see if it would leak or not  my tent was blown over by the winds  the poles stayed erect  so there was no failure on there part  after changing out the tent stakes  it stayed up fine  and didn t leak  it was a pretty light storm that went by  i will be trying it out again with some more intense storm just as soon as they come to me      
1155,3.0,                       i love that the tent was so easy to put up and take down  practice at least once in your yard before taking it out camping  i m a little miffed that there is a bit of a pinhole in one of the walls already  only used it twice  i wish the fabric was tougher  i have no idea if it was there before      
1156,5.0,                       looks like it will be a great tent  heavy material and feels sturdy   have not camped in it yet  just set up in front yard for inspection  sets up and tears down fast  can t wait to use it      
1157,5.0,                       it s perfect for a second bedroom when camping with friends in my travel trailer      
1158,1.0,                       can t use it at all  we set it up in the camp ground to realize that the tent had a hole in it  and doesn t have a rainfly  the weekend had rains in pennsylvania  and we had to share the accommodation with friends because it was all dripping inside  now i do not even see any option to return this bulky trash      
1159,5.0,                       instant setup is nice  no matching up poles to put together      
1160,3.0,                       i like this tent but have two major complaints about it      the square doors don t allow for easy zipping  and    the black color draws more heat inside the tent   aside from those two issues this is a decent tent   good size  stayed dry during a rainy day  and has good ventilation   i wish coleman would have left the  round  shaped doors as was on the older models   i also purchased the rain fly but didn t put it on the tent even during the rain   i may return the rain fly update   used this once and one of the top knuckles broke off the center pole  of course my warranty has expired      
1161,5.0,                       can t beat this tent for ease in set up  it truly sets up in an instant  without hassle  nearing darkness when we arrived at our camping site  we didn t have time to spare  this was our first use  other than trial run set up in our back yard   it performed splendidly  we had already sprayed the seams with weather guard  so we were prepared for the rather steady rain we encountered on the last night of our trip at our second stop  truly  no leakage occurred  although we kept a towel bunched up by the door as previous reviewers had said to do   the next morning after the rain  some moisture had accumulated on the inner walls because of condensation  but my hubby and i absolutely remained dry throughout the night  we were very thankful for this tent  i believe we will buy the   person so we ll have a tad more room for changing clothes and moving around  but to  make do   the   person was absolutely all we needed  it was cozy and allowed plenty of room for our air mattress and for sleeping  like the pockets for storing necessary items such as glasses and tissues  very thankful for this tent  we would have no hesitation recommending it      
1162,2.0,                       i was buying new and recieved something that was not  pictures can say what i cant  not sure if a potential refurbish but i returned for refund and will go with less expensive big tent for family camping that is not a pop up style      
1163,5.0,                       great tent  i don t think it will last as long as a traditional tent because of the moving parts  but it is fantastic to setup     
1164,5.0,                       just got it and set up was not a problem   now to get camping weather to use it      
1165,5.0,                       i have yet to sleep in this tent but  i thought i would try to put it up before i went camping  by myself it only took about   minutes to put up  that could be because i was looking at the directions and taking my time  i have no doubt the next time i put it up it will take less time      
1166,5.0,                       purchased this as top on christmas list for young grandson   desired easy up tent after hard work all last summer s camping season   really happy with his coleman          
1167,4.0,                       i purchased this tent to replace a kelsyus ogo   x   tent  which also has an integral frame and erects in a similar manner   stake the four corners  then raise and lock the center hub   this tent was very easy to set up and take down   working by myself  it only took    minutes to spread the ground cloth tarp  set up the tent  attach the rainfly  then take down and store the tent   it has enough room for two cots and a small table between them   i would rather have the door in the center instead of on the right hand side  but it is still usable   i like that the windows and doors will all close completely  thus making the tent easier to heat in the winter   this was a key factor in my decision to purchase this tent      
1168,5.0,                       holy cow this is so easy to put up that it is fun  if you are still stringing tent posts together  stop   it can be so much easier        
1169,3.0,                       floor and ceiling were okay  we used a tarp plus the additional rain cover  but water came straight the sides and we were soaked by morning  otherwise easy to set up and comfortable  but skip if you re looking for better weatherproofing      
1170,5.0,                       i couldn t believe how incredibly simple this tent was to put up   it literally takes less than   minutes from the bag to expanding in place   another      min to stake it   the inside is roomy and you can walk around in it without stooping over   it got wet during my first camping trip with it   i folded it up  put it in the car   once i got home i set it up  again in   min  to dry it out   it does take effort to fold it up and pack it in the bag   the only gripe i have with this and any other tent is the carrying case needs to be a little bit larger to make packing it away easier   overall  i am very happy with this tent      
1171,1.0,                       i set up the  we tent once in my yard before my trip and it was fine  then my first night camping   days drive from home the zipper on the door completely broke  so i  slept  with the door open all night and was a feast for bugs  while i worried that some critter would crawl in with me  very disappointed in coleman  sounds from the reviews like i m lucky it wasn t raining      
1172,5.0,                       a wonderful playhouse for my four grandkids   no worries when they spill stuff using their play kitchens or arts and crafts      
1173,4.0,                       other than only   windows the tent is great and easy to use  too hot in the tent for texas summers with limited airflow      
1174,5.0,                       delivered as promised   set up was quick and very easy inside the house as we gave the tent a test run   will use the tent this july on biking trip through iowa   easy to collapse and return to bag   instructions are conveniently attached to bag and cannot be misplaced unless entire bag is lost   seems to be an excellent tent for the money   will be able to offer a  field experience  evaluation at the end of july            
1175,4.0,                       very easy to set up  i bought it without the rain fly  went camping in heavy weather and it was without leaks for about an hour   after that it started leaking everywhere through the seams in the roof  i bought a rain fly the next day   we ll see what happens next time i camp in a downpour      
1176,1.0,                       don t buy this tent  we recieved it and right away one of the poles was defective  also it is full of small holes everywhere so the sunlight can get in it didn train but i m guessing water can too   screens were sewn poorly so bugs could get in  stitching on zipper was coming apart and seams were separating   they need to work on their quality control      
1177,5.0,                       easy set up but very difficult to get back into it s storage case  fits six people comfortabily i just wished it was easier to get back into it s package  i d recommend      
1178,4.0,                       have you ever noticed that no matter how good the product is we always want more  the tent can be put up and taken down in about   minutes which includes staking the corners down  it has enough room in it for a full size and a twin air mattress along with other gear  it has a nice lantern electric not gas  hook at the apex of the tent along with a small vapor vent that helps with the condensation  now for the want  i wish it had an awning the extends out over the door  we used the tent in the rain and when opening the door the water came inside  all in all the tent worked great  did not leak had plenty of room and was easy to set up and break camp and i would buy this again      
1179,1.0,                       i should believe all the one star reviews about waterproof   it is not waterproof or water resistant at all     
1180,1.0,                       this is a terrible tent  corner tent pole broken right out of the box on our campsite  in a   day span another pole was bent and that side caves completely in  zippers leaked  zipper didn t close smooth   i apologize for the negative post  i just don t want anyone else struggling and sleeping in their car an entire trip like we had to      
1181,5.0,                       love our new tent    person tent fits my husband and i  standing   queen size air bed  and suitcase duffle bag perfectly  i love having standing space to change easy assembly  easy clean up  you put it up and down like an umbrella      
1182,5.0,                       great tent lots of room for  using a queen size memory foam mattress up fast down fast     
1183,1.0,                       went up to camp in indiana  however i was skeptical at first because the steaks that came with the tent were already bent  i wasn t to mad about that maybe it was a return tent or whatever but it started raining outta no where in the middle of the night and got completely soaked     
1184,5.0,                       great tent for car camping     
1185,5.0,                       i love this tent its awesome and spacious you easily fit     air mattresses inside  its beautiful  sets up like a dream since its all in one piece and really keeps out the bugs  i also love the hook features for hanging lights inside  highly recommend      
1186,5.0,                       this is great  straight out of the box was an under   minute setup without the rain tarp ordered separately   it s more spacious than i thought  you could fit a queen mattress in there i think  my living room is huge and it filled a large portion of it     
1187,1.0,                       i will not buy a coleman product ever again we threw out the tent at the campground this was the  second time we camp in the tent and we spend        on waterproofing the tent after the first time and still leaked like a water fall  never again buy coleman tents    yr of  camping never a tent leaking like that sad for coleman was at one time good products not now          
1188,4.0,                       why is it so different from the photo  it s not brown  it s blue  and the design is different too  entrance and windows   i like it so far but after reading it leaks really bad when raining  i am getting worried    is this new design    still leaking         
1189,1.0,                       sets up in   seconds for sure and i can easily set it up by myself  but it leaked like a siv  we were soaked and all our luggage was soaked  we had to go home because it ruined the trip       
1190,5.0,                       great tent and setup is as advertised  i would highly recommend grabbing a rain fly to go with this  even though we were fine during a huge thunderstorm  there was some leakage without the rain fly  i was very impressed with the build quality  it is quite bulky to carry around however      
1191,4.0,                       it has plenty of room for our two cots and headroom  even though it says  weather tech  on it  you will need to apply waterproofing spray on it before you use it  we had rain and got showered on all night  and the night dew soaked through and dripped on us      
1192,5.0,                       if you put a queen blow up mattress in here there is no other room  great for   people max      
1193,3.0,                       easy quick set up  but it leaks terribly on one side  also leaks on another side and through the top  starting accumulating water after    minutes in a steady rain  very disappointing      
1194,2.0,                       well  i really liked the design for instant setup  only took us about   min to set it up for the first time which was impressive and the reason i gave it two stars  however  like many other users mentioned it is not waterproof at all  really disappointed as this should be the most basic function for a tent  rainwater drops from the top and the wall was completely wet from inside      
1195,5.0,                       love the quality  we have used it many times and even in the rain  we only now buy coleman products and tents      
1196,5.0,                       this tent is as easy to set up as advertised   we ve used it three times and have no complaints   it hasn t been put to the weather test yet  but we re trusting in coleman   to improve our chances of keeping dry in a storm  we are using seam sealer and silicone spray   the only feature we plan to add is something to attach to the zipper pulls that will glow in the dark      
1197,1.0,                       i took the tent camping but came home the same night because the tent leaked and that was the first day and night i used  do not waste your money on it      
1198,4.0,                       we have a family of two adults and two little kids  we thought that with a   person tent  we d have room to move about a little more  my husband and i set up a cot each for us  and the kids were on the floor with bags  and it was tight quarters  if   people were only in there with sleeping bags and no other gear or packs of any kind  they d all fit   however  if it rained and nobody wants to be next to the condensation on the walls  it ll be extremely tight   we should have gone with a bigger size tent other than that  it was super easy to assemble  very quick and convenient to put up and take down  rained all night last time we had it out  no leaks that we could see  good for the price      
1199,5.0,                       if you are looking for a tent to stand in rain and wind  this is it    i did tie it down extra on each side for extra support but it probably would ve done great without it  the tent cover is a must and is the best tent cover ever  was good and dry with   severe thunderstorms that flooded the roads and the campsites at the lake  happy to find a good tent      
1200,5.0,                       incredible   i took it this past labor day weekend  camping  nowhere crazy  and it didn t rain  my entire family was flabbergasted   breakdown and stowing was just as simple   youtube helps with the decision making process in this regard i can t comment on the rain issues  but in light of the other comments i would come prepared with a rainfly   in my particular case  morning dew beaded nicely all over the tent  and did not seep in through the corners or bottom of the tent      
1201,1.0,                       rain drops came right through spent night felling drops come right through  this tent is hot garbage  light to steady rain   only positive it is easy to set up      
1202,5.0,                       awesome tent  this is my goto family tent  my wife and baby all slept comfortably with a queen size air matress  i am       and i had enough room to almost stand inside the tent  setting up this tent took  min and   seconds  putting it away was about  mins  how convenient is that  i d rather have this style of tent  cabin  than a  dome  style  buy this tent  you won t be disappointed  good job coleman      
1203,5.0,                       this huge tent makes car camping so much more convenient  it is really easy to setup and higher than typical tents      
1204,5.0,                       omg love this tent   my five year old and i set it up within   minutes  we set it up in our living room and the kids love it  sleeping in the tent is their new thing  getting them ready for camping in the backyard this summer       
1205,4.0,                       i did a little research online prior to buying  almost bought it used on craigslist   then saw it for sale at a competitor online   then randomly checked amazon   it was a crazy sale and free shipping with prime   i couldn t pass on it   it came a day later than expected but that s not a big deal   i set it up as instructed with the video with exceptional ease   i did have a little trouble folding it back up but figured it out   let s be honest   all tents are nuts to butts regarding how many they claim to sleep   comfortably this tent sleeps two   it claims   but it s worth the setup time as nobody wants to deal with mosquito s   i wish the door would be bigger as you have to inflate a mattress inside it and can t slide it through the door   for the weekend warrior it s hands down a great buy      
1206,4.0,                       i recently purchased this   person instant cabin as a package with a rainfly i really like the tent  it is really fast to set up  takes a bit more time to wrap up back to it s case the rainfly that comes in the package is for a   person tent  significantly too small  and does not fit on top of this tent  it was easy to exchange it to the correct rainfly  but for some strange reason amazon continues to offer the same package    person tent with a rainfly for a   person tent      
1207,1.0,                       plenty of room to stand up  i m      and assemble  but doesn t prevent water leaking after sealed up in a gentle rain  had to return      
1208,5.0,                       this tent is the easiest tent to set up i have ever seen  you literally pull it out of the bag  move the joints into place  stake it down  and you re done  it s also great quality for the money  and it looks very durable      
1209,5.0,                       i bought this tent after seeing how quickly it goes up and comes down   this is the tent i take on all my camp outs   the only gripe i have is that i had to purchase the rain fly separately   i feel they should adjust the price accordingly and include it with the tent   however  the last two camp outs didn t call for rain and it wasn t needed  but it is nice to have      
1210,5.0,                       this tent is great  so easy to put even for one person  no pomes to attach or slide their  fits     people comfortably  there are pockets inside under windows  also you can hook a lantern inside center  fits   twin air mattresses or   queen to have walking foot space  definitely good tent to have      
1211,4.0,                       it is so easy to put up  taking it down and rolling it up to fit back into the bag nicely is not so easy  overall  i am happy with it  will update once it is actually used      
1212,5.0,                       large easy to put up and take down  lots of room  needs the rain fly to open the top of the windows in the rain      
1213,5.0,                       haven t used it just yet but we set it up i  the backyard to see if the setup is quick and it definitely is super quick and easy to put up and take down  the space on the inside is great and it has a lot of zipper windows for good airflow  can t wait to take this out     
1214,5.0,                       love the east setup and large windows  be sure and get a rain fly for it      
1215,5.0,                       went camping with this tent   days after receiving it   it took me about   min  the first time that i set it up  takes more time stretching the corners out once poped up than it does to pop the the tent up  this tent is easy to set up and break down   on a scale of   to    i would give the level of effort to pack the tent inot the carry case is a      it comes with basic metal tent stakes about       long    stakes   pop up system is sturdy  tent material and zippers are study      
1216,5.0,                       our kids love this tent  they are avid campers and love the easy set up      
1217,5.0,                       we recently received this tent and used it for the first time this weekend   i m nothing short of amazed   after first removing it from the box  it took my    year old son and i no more than   minutes to get it popped up and mostly assembled  short of staking it to the ground    the tent is very roomy and our family of   has oodles of space inside   also  i m      tall and was able to fully stand up inside easily this is going to change the way that our family camps   definitely give this a shot      
1218,1.0,                       it was easy to set up but that s the only good thing for me  the tent was not weatherproof or even water resistance  the rain fly that you have to buy separate didn t help either  the door zipper was very hard to zip   was separated in places  very disappointed especially from a coleman product      
1219,5.0,                       this is a awesome tent   goes up so easy and quick   my tent has been through several rainstorms  and with the rain fly  has stayed completly dry   if buying a tent  do youself a favor  buy a coleman      
1220,5.0,                       very good and super easy to set up and put away  literally takes a minute or two to put up with plenty of head room to fully stand up for the average size person  great buy  and price      
1221,5.0,                       my wife and i car camp very frequently  probably     days each month   we live in utah and travel all over the west and usually camp on blm lands or random forest service lands this tent is the best  hands down   we have the four person and it is awesome   actually takes about   minute to setup or take down we have camped in the pouring rain in yellowstone in this tent and no water inside at all   we have camped in   mph winds outside zion in this tent and no troubles even while my friends expensive tent got bent out of shape the tent has many clever features that help make it even better including pouches on the walls  large windows  roof vent  sturdy materials  and wind tie downs for big storms  pair this thing with a nice inflatable mattress and you are camping like a king only negative is that it is somewhat heavy due to the design but this doesn t matter at all for car camping so don t even consider that best car camping tent ever      
1222,5.0,                       fantastic tent    super easy setup    great value for car campers       
1223,5.0,                       been camping    years  ca ga  bought  p instant tent  wife i  corgs use king blow up   easiest setup and breakdown ever  even with only   person  i use a   x   tent over my sleeping tent so not sure about rain proof but i love the ease of use        
1224,5.0,                       easy tent set up  it was my first time camping so i didn t want to go through the hassle of putting one up  the bag is long maybe about   feet long  if i ever need a new tent in the future i ll by one where you put up yourself since the same size is half the price     
1225,5.0,                       super easy to set up and take down  i did use   cans of silicone to add additional waterproofing  just in case  based on other recommendations      
1226,2.0,                       we liked how easy it was to assemble and set up  but one of the joints broke while we took it down on the first time we used it  we followed the instructions exactly  pretty upset we spent good money just to use it one time        
1227,5.0,                       i got these for my kids  we camp   or   times a year and these are well worth the money my son and daughter can have these setup  staked down and loaded with beds and whatever stuff they bring along in less time than i can unload the coolers from the truck a camp cot takes up about     of the tent a twin size air mattress is about     plenty of room for gear and an area to stand up and change     
1228,2.0,                       tent sets up in    seconds  just like coleman says  this tent  in the lightest of rain  will leak  mine leaked through the walls and stitching between the wall and floor  i did seal the stitching but it did not help at all  if you are      certain it will not rain at all when you are camping this tent might work for you  otherwise don t buy      
1229,5.0,                       tent held up amazingly in   mph sustained winds on the beach  we were suppose to get      mph winds  weatherman missed that forecast shocker right  and ended up with       mph winds and gusts over     it was rocking all night but held up amazingly      
1230,5.0,                       i wouldnt have believed that i could really set and take down this tent alone in less than   minutes  but its true   i am an older inexperienced camper who was using a tent for the first time  amazing     
1231,5.0,                       so easy to set up and withstood a crazy wind storm on its  st outing     adults and   child sleep comfortably on   twin air mattresses     
1232,5.0,                       welp this tent arrived sunday      a day ahead of schedule  allowing me the opportunity to enjoy it on the holiday weekend  very simple setup  i d say it seats   ppl comfortably    ppl and a pop up table could fit for a good card game   star comfortability     
1233,2.0,                       it set up like a breeze  great design  but our first night in  we all get wet as the rain dripped in excessively  the rain fly purchase is a must  even in a moderate amount of rain      
1234,1.0,                       this tent was very very unreliable  we purchased this tent for a camping trip that we took this weekend and it rained while we were there and we came back to basically a flooded tent  there was leaking through the roof area and through the windows  and yes they were zipped closed   i am highly unsatisfied with the tent that i received      
1235,1.0,                       in theory  the tent leg design makes for easy set up and take down   unfortunately the plastic connections in the tent leg joints are very fragile and broke easily   very disappointing      
1236,5.0,                       this tent sets up very quickly and easily  it has an attached floor which was important      
1237,5.0,                    magn fica inversi n si eres amante del camping  f cil de armar y muy rapido        
1238,4.0,                       it s a good standing quality made tent  lots of space inside and the windows are huge for a great breeze  we were able to sleep a queen size air mattress  ourselves  our   yr old son with our   yr old daughter and   medium sized dogs with   decent size duffle bags in it  and we were still able to move around just find only downside to this tent is that it doesn t come with a cover  while easily remedy with using a tarp  it really should have come with one  you can purchase a cover to go with it but highly advise you don t order off amazon as people have them marked for     when you can get it for     from coleman s website  over i would definitely recommend this tent as it took less than   minutes to set up  my wife and   year old son did before i had a chance and didn t have a single issue      
1239,3.0,                       easy to set up but a little harder to pack up due to the air it holds   i camped in the winter    degrees and it was colder in the tent than it was outside   fits a queen size matress and   adults with  ft of extra space  the height of the tent creates a more comfortable experience   creates a lot of condensation   the zippers work great      
1240,3.0,                       first tent came with several pin sized holes in the bottom so i ended up sending it back and picking up the   person model in it s place  the   person has standing headroom which was worth the cost difference for me  as with most tents the number of people they are rated for assumes you don t mind sleeping right on top of each other and i would say the   person model would be better suited for        
1241,5.0,                       by far the easiest tent i ve ever put up  less than a minute  used it in florida over christmas for   weeks  it rained every day and the tent stayed completely dry on the inside      
1242,5.0,                       so easy to setup  so far held the test of time amd worth it just for how fast and easy setup is      
1243,5.0,                       awesome tent  i just wish it came with a rain fly instead of having to buy it separate        
1244,2.0,                       the zipper broke after only using it twice   super disappointed      
1245,1.0,                       this tent completely fails in its role of providing shelter from the elements   on the good side  it is very easy to set up and quite spacious   there are no frills  but that is not necessary in a tent   the zippers are acceptable  though not robust   that is about it for the good sides when the windows are zipped  there is no circulation at all and it becomes a sweat box   that would almost be fine if it meant that the tent was robustly waterproof   it is not   on my family s very first time using the tent  it rained   it was admittedly a steady  long lasting rain  but it was not torrential by any stretch   the tent was not waterproof   not even a little   despite using the sold separately  but matching  rainfly and having the windows zipped up tight  after an hour or so of rain  nearly every surface of the inside of the tent was wet   that was not even the worst part  in the middle of the night  i woke up  very wet  and trained a flashlight on each of the four corners of the tent  and each was a waterfall with rain pouring through the seams in each of the corners of the tent and creating rivers of water on the tent floor it is a hundred dollar tent  i didn t expect it to be perfect  but it didn t even sort of keep the rain off and that seems to be the bare minimum to actually call something a tent   in addition  it looks like amazon might not let me return it   so  yeah  i would skip this one      
1246,5.0,                       if you are tired of getting to a camping site and taking the next    minutes to set up in the dark then this is the perfect tent  it really does take one person about   minutes to set up  it keeps the rain out and the tent is not full of dew in the morning      
1247,4.0,                       i really like this tent because the floor is made out of a tarp like material so it is pretty durable   it rained a lot when i used it and yet no rain leaked through   we also bought the rainfly but it is nothing special and doesn t cover the windows so you may want to put a tarp overhead anyway  minus a star because the rainfly could be better  sold seperatly   also  it is more like a spacious   person tent but could fit more tightly      
1248,5.0,                       set up is a breeze  really it is  i think the first time we set it up it only took about   minutes  everything is so easy  i don t think i ll be able to go back to another form of tent ever again  the space on this one is good  i don t know how comfortable it would be to put   people in here but i suppose it could be done if you didn t have to place any gear inside as well  for me and my wife on a blow up mattress with our bags and a dog it was perfect  lots of head room too which is nice      
1249,1.0,                       not waterproof  spent weekend floating on water  everything wet  don t buy this tent      
1250,5.0,                       love this tent  its so easy to set up and lasted in the weather       
1251,5.0,                       this has got to be a magical tent of some sort  i was in a rush when ordering and did not read the full description  my bad  but was pleasently surprised when it arrived  i was expecting to put it together but no    it was alrwedy together  i have never seen a quick set tent  this thing is amazing    it rained while we used it and no water got in  pleanty of room  must buy this       
1252,5.0,                       haven t tried in rain but very quick and spacious for two while camping in desert  excellent ventilation     
1253,5.0,                       only used once so far  it is quite easy to set up  fairly spacious  we fit two twin size air mattresses in easily  i wish i d bought it in a brighter color  but in terms of use  this is great      
1254,3.0,                       axingly easy tent to set up we just tried this tent out last weekend in oregon  and we got soaked from the leaks in the seams super disappointed  we loved the tent and it won t let us return via amazon since we bought too long ago  would love to have returned and tried another of the same thing      
1255,5.0,                       if you go camping occasionally or just want a nice tent on the beach  i would highly recommend this tent  literally takes less than a minute to setup  you just take it out  unfold the arms  and the tent pops up into shape  it s very roomy for two people  but fitting    will start to get cramped  this is true for most   person tents though   it s a little hard to stuff it back into its bag  and once in  the bag is larger and heavier than similar sized tents from rei  that s the tradeoff i guess      
1256,5.0,                       great tent easy to set less than a minute  not really large enough for   people with gear more like   fit me the wife and son well plenty tall good ventilation  overall great tent needs to be sprayed with waterproofing spray its not water proof at all first camp out in rain it dripped and we were in a puddle in the morning      
1257,4.0,                       i recently went on a     mile bicycling tour and we had to pitch our tent every night after biking    plus miles  needless to say  i didn t want a tent that was a struggle to put up when i was tired  this was the easiest tent to pitch and it took me only a couple of minutes  one night it rained all night and i kept dry my only reservation in not giving a   star review  is that i had trouble folding it small enough to fit back in the bag    i bought the   man tent and in reality  it would suit   people at best in conclusion  i think the people at coleman are genius      
1258,2.0,                       it s great the first time  however  upon second use  noticed the stitching came loose and created holes in the tent  of course  the return period has already passed so we re now stuck with a holy tent  was hoping it would be reliable as coleman would usually be  would reconsider      
1259,5.0,                       this tent is easy to set up and is a great tent  you must by the rain fly separately  i am also getting the    by    coleman screen house      
1260,5.0,                       this tent is amazingly easy to put up   i can put it up by myself in less than two minutes   before i used the tent  i applied water repellent to the outside and seam sealer to all the seams   i have used it on one camping trip so far  and did not experience any rain   if i have a problem with water leaking i will revise my review   a recommended product      
1261,1.0,                       went camping a couple weekends ago  got completely soaked  did not keep out water at all  how i wish i could return it  one of the worst thing i ever bought      
1262,5.0,                       really does go up pretty instantly  like     minutes  lame that it doesn t come with a rain fly  so buy that as well  love it     
1263,5.0,                       haven t had an issue with it yet  first time i used it  it rained pretty good and i stayed dry  the only thing i noticed was the inside of the tent lining was moist and that could have just been condensation idk  but in not going to leave a bad review or take a star down for that  i was still dry and happy  this tent makes camping that much more fun  while everyone is taking their tents out of the bags  yours is already up and your enjoying yourself        
1264,2.0,                       we went camping last weekend and have tried this new tent  feeling disappointed  cause we have an old one but same brand  it s much heavier but almost the same space  about weatherproof  the weather was not too cold at night but we still felt not warm inside tent  it s definitely worse than what i have before      
1265,5.0,                       beautifully made and easy to set up      
1266,5.0,                       bought this tent last year  camped with many times  the set up and takedown is extremely easy  one person can do no problem  but i m really happy about is this year we caught in heavy rain and wind and tent stayed up and we stayed dry inside  very pleased      
1267,5.0,                       i tend to go camping on my own  because i find most of my friends lack  interest in camping   i like a roomy tent i can stand in  but most tents that can be set up by one person on their own are neither roomy nor tall enough even for me to stand up in  i m only        this one works on all three levels   it really can be set up quickly by one person on their own  although a minute may be a slight underestimate of the time it takes   for one or two people it s quite roomy  though more than three adults would be cramped   i have no trouble standing in it  though a six  footer would have to crouch a bit   the only flaws i found is that it would be nice if it came with a rain fly even if it doesn t really need one  and it s not as easy to refold into its case as i might like   this last is pretty much true of every tent i ve ever seen  though   this one is probably better than most because it wraps around its poles   all in all  i have no trouble recommending this tent   i m looking forward to being able to take more road trip vacations and spending  more of them camping instead of having to find motels      
1268,5.0,                       i bought it for a camping trip with my son and my family has since used it twice and it a joy to use  the other campers with us commented on how easy to was to set up the tent  we lent it to family and we weren t there to set it up for them  and they were able to do it without any help  a great buy for sure  i will be looking into the larger   person tent for my family as i was to replace my other instant tent from another company that isn t up to the same quality of the colman tent      
1269,5.0,                       i opted for this tent because the overall consensus was how very easy it is to put up  yes  it really is very  very easy to erect  we are a family of scientific engineering types  so not the very least likely to succeed with putting up a tent  but we are also not very advanced campers  with some experience  less than one camping trip per year  but not a lot  we found this tent to be super easy to put up  even with   and   year old children distracting us in the process we used it a couple of times in the backyard first  no real problems there  except a nervous preschooler who decided to  go back home  inside before  pm   when we were planning a class camping trip with other families  i warned my husband   the reviews say this tent is great  except in the rain  so we planned to just pack up early and leave if the weather turned bad well  living in new england    we got a pretty intense thunderstorm during our three night camping trip  the shelter over the picnic tables was leaking  one  out of five  families just packed it in and left at dusk when their tent started to flood  the weather reports the next day actually stated flash floods occurred in the area where we camped    but we slept pretty darn dry in the coleman   person instant tent  i would say there were two very tiny spots of water infiltration from above  we definitely had one child who rolled to the side and got a damp sleeping bag due to sleeping in contact with the side of the tent  however  even without the rainfly and with no tarp covering us  all in all  we had a dry tent  this far exceeded my expectation for how well this inexpensive  easy up tent would handle serious rainfall   it poured in the evening  then rained softly to moderately throughout most of the night  we did luck out  by arriving last in our group  in having the highest placed campsite at our new hampshire state park  the coziest seeming sites were definitely downhill from ours when the weather turned bad  the site did seem pretty flat upon initial visual inspection  though  the soil was sandy  so the rain water was able to sink it fairly quickly  thank goodness aside from weather resistance  our family of four found the interior space of this tent comfortable  we use the self inflating  backpacker style  camping pads by therm a rest       thermarest luxury map air mattress  blue                        in the    inch wide xl size for the adults and much smaller     length pads for the kids   so we aren t crowding the tent as much as household sized thick air mattresses would  it was snug but comfortable with our beds deployed and a few duffle bags with clothing  we had room to move between our beds  but we only use the tent to sleep and get dressed having read all the reviews  i brought a few wooden clothes pins to use to keep the window flaps from flapping  and i had zero issue with any noise or inconvenience with the windows  i am very easily disturbed by things like fluttering flaps as others have written  it sure would be nice to have extra loops or pockets in the tent for storage  but  again  i knew what to expect and just kept a little tote next to my bed with my led lamp  eyeglasses  etc  at this price point  i found the tent completely satisfactory as far as features were concerned i wish there were a footprint sized precisely for this tent  i worried about water infiltration all night during our heavy rains  i was able to fold a standard tarp to fit neatly underneath the coleman   person instant tent  but i would have paid a few extra dollars to have a tarp that fit perfectly like a proper footprint does i am pretty likely to buy the new rainfly accessory for this tent now that it is available  as i said  our experience was very positive in a pretty significant rainfall  but i did sleep poorly worrying that water was going to come in during the night  i have also strongly considered some kind of easy up shelter just tossed up over the entire tent to stop the worst of a deluge getting to us   in a nutshell  i am very satisfied with the coleman   person instant tent  it met my highest priority  which was a set up so easy that tent anxiety wouldn t keep us from heading out for a camping trip  the five star review is because for the price  this tent wildly exceeded my expectations  i would be using much more stringent requirements  pockets  conveniences  if the price point were more than just barely into the three digit range  like the paha que  mountain hardware  etc  tents that i covet but could not justify for our infrequent current usage  this is a great place to start if you are a family considering camping but not ready for big cash commitments  in that scenario  imho  spend less on your first tent and a little more to ensure you have good sleeping pads  cushioning  to avoid physical pain misery  warm enough sleeping bags  and good basic cooking equipment so everyone can enjoy themselves      
1270,5.0,                       fastest tent setup ever  good for camping spring  summer and fall  don t recommend it in winter  do make sure to buy the rain fly or you will hate life  water can be bad for this tent  buy you a couple of cans of waterproof and do the whole tent  this will fix everything else  still do like this tent if you need to setup fast and the weather is not bad      
1271,3.0,                       liked   tent easy to set up in seconds but only draw back tent arrived with hole on bottom of tent and on the side when saw holes was out of warranty      
1272,5.0,                       legs are in the tent so no need to thread them through anything   easily pops into place      
1273,5.0,                       looked long and hard for a tent  got this one and so glad i did   it has rained every single time i used it  and not just a sprinkle  i stayed dry every time      
1274,5.0,                       this is a great tent   it literally sets up in maybe   minutes   yes  it will accommodate a queen air mattress  but if it is one of the fancy    inch ones  it will touch the tent walls    you will have about a foot on one side for your other gear   best yet we own      
1275,5.0,                       we love it by the time everyone is getting the poles for their tent ours is up and we re unpacking deffinatly worth it      
1276,4.0,                       i have owned the    person and the   person versions of this tent  this   person is just right for me  i sure wish tent makers could figure out a way to go in and out the door without bugs coming in  the door zippers always have to stick somewhere  oh well it s camping      
1277,5.0,                       easy and quick pop up tent  sturdy and comfortable  we slept a family of four     
1278,4.0,                       just used this tent in glacier park for a week  and it performed as expected   no rain to evaluate it with  but it was way easy to set up and take down   love the height it has   seems to be well made   it also blends in well to a campground situation   not an eyesore like some   overall am happy with it and glad we purchased it      
1279,3.0,                       setup and tear down are very very easy and only take a minute   definitely get a good rainfly   saw reviews saying it doesnt leak    well it does   sprayed with waterproofing and still had a nice pond inside the tent after a moderate rain      
1280,1.0,                       finally got to use this tent and we got some rain and the thing started leaking from just about every seam   i would like to let coleman know that we got a defective product and would like one that does not leak   this is very disappointing      
1281,5.0,                       extremely easy to set up and light weight  really can t recommend enough      
1282,5.0,                       excellent      quick and easy to assembly   robust design     
1283,3.0,                       it was very easy to set it up  it rained the night we slept in it and we still got a little wet from it dripping in the middle of the tent  we love the size of the tent and how easy it was to set it up but were disappointed due to the leaking of water      
1284,4.0,                       just bought this tent for a weekend camping trip   tent is so simple to put up   take down   less than   minutes   to be honest its a great tent for this price   only reason i did not give it   starts is because the bag for the tent ripped as i was putting it away   you have to be really careful how you grab the bag when you pull the tent   i just got off the phone with coleman because i really love this tent   did not want to send it back   they are sending me a new bag    no questions asked   very nice customer service     
1285,5.0,                       awesome          went up in seconds  my first tent   it survived burning man   nice screen windows   can be zipped up to keep dust out   awesome purchase          
1286,4.0,                       this is a roomy    season tent  but i would not share it with   people  i did share it with   dogs and a cat  with crate and litter box  and that was plenty of company  lots of big windows that zip open  the better to catch breezes and views from all   sides  there are two  tiny  eye like screened vents on the roof that also help ventilate  the sides flare outward from the top so if it rains  you must completely zip up all those windows  and don t forget the door  not a good situation if it s also hot and humid  or you have company and it rains for more than an hour  coleman calls its two  tiny  roof vents a rain fly  in no way do they count as such  so i would strongly suggest getting yourself a     x    tarp  at least  and some clamps to throw over the top  i used a   x   roll of clear plastic and fixed up a covered entry area  this also helps muffle the sound of being inside a popcorn popper when it rains  that s only fun for about   minutes i folded a    x    tarp in    ths as a ground cloth  and ended up buying some foam tent floor mats for the dogs this thing does go up very quickly and easily by one person  leaving plenty of time to be amused by nearby campers wrestling with     long fiberglass poles and sleeves on flimsy  lightweight tents this is a car camping tent  way too heavy and large to pack in anywhere more than maybe     yards from the vehicle  by the same token  it s not going to fly away easily  either  feels substantial it doesn t pack down quite as quickly as it went up  but i was staying for a week or two at each campsite  so it wasn t too much trouble took me about     hours to completely break camp  including walking the dogs i found this tent a very satisfactory investment  had lots of fellow campers inquiries and vows to purchase  just be sure to fashion a rain fly  the ones for sale do not look useful and are way too expensive  anyway happy camping      
1287,5.0,                       it was the easiest tent i have ever set up  i did find some pinholes in the seams but no leaks in the rain      
1288,4.0,                       easy set up and with the rain fly we stayed perfectly dry as it rained for   straight days   folding it up  not easy   no instructions  so after a while figured it out   to make it pack away easier  leave a window open otherwise the trapped air makes it difficult stuffing it all back into the carry bag      
1289,5.0,                       this is a great tent  easily sets up in less than five minutes and the same to take down  a true lifesaver when setting up in high winds or the dark  very sturdy  made it through a huge thunderstorm in the south  i have the same model in a larger size also for longer camping trips  i couldn t recommend this tent more      
1290,5.0,                       i honestly have not opened it yet   i reeeeeally hope there are no defects or i ll be out of luck since it s been over a month   i ll give it   based on opinions of others i know with the same tent liz     
1291,5.0,                       fantastic tent   took this tent on a cross country camping trip with three grandchildren husband and a dog   we all fit slept great every night  this tent was so easy to put up and take down it was almost unbelievable   made it through a couple of nasty rain storms without getting wet  m     
1292,2.0,                       i ve use the tent three times now  twice we had nice weather once it rained all night  we woke up the next morning after the night of rain and water seeped in from somewhere   could not find where it leaked  i did use the fly  if it was not for the leak  i would give it   stars   easy to setup and take down  too late to return       
1293,1.0,                       it leaks in the rain all along the seams  i returned it     
1294,2.0,                    hola  recien recibi mi tienda de campa a con un hoyo en el suelo  vivo en una isla fuera de usa como puedo cambiar el suelo o recibir un producto en excelente estado saludos        
1295,5.0,                       i m a    year old grandmother and set this up in a matter of minutes  this is a great tent for me      
1296,4.0,                       this tent is massive     it is super easy to set up  take down can be a little hard alone  you ll need two people   i have not used it in water yet      
1297,5.0,                       set up in    seconds with a sore neck  love this tent     
1298,4.0,                       love this tent   it had a bad smell after putting it up which unfortunately never went away   hoping the more we use it the more the smell will dissipate      
1299,5.0,                       on the   man instant tent by coleman  one of the reviewers said that these were not instant tents   i don t have the   man but this   man tent was definitely instant  and if you don t think so  then you probably have a hard time making easy mac  because this tent is ridiculously easy in my small living room  read  barely fit the tent   i set it up by myself for the first time in exactly   minutes  and that includes taking it out of the bag and even removing some of the initial packaging i can t comment on it s use as a tent  but it seems solid   it does only have   pockets  but if you know that going into it and are fine with it  then this is definitely an awesome tent   like most tents  the person count is a bit generous  but i don t know of any tent i researched that had reviewers say you could fit the amount of people it said you could  and still have room for stuff   that s part of buying a tent seriously  if you need or want an instant tent  buy this   we have a fussy needy baby  and so i knew it may just be me putting up the tent  or maybe      minutes with my wife and i  and so we needed a tent that wouldn t take forever with   person or limited time with   i cannot wait to go camping in a month      
1300,1.0,                       i set this tent up in conditions that ranged from misty to steady rain that lasted    hours  as soon as i set it up  i noticed that the rain was coming directly through the walls  i assume the factory missed the waterproofing step make sure you test the tent before you  use it      
1301,1.0,                       at first this tent seemed great when we started camping and set it up  it was really easy and only took a couple minutes  then both zippers on the door broke as we unzipped them  and they could not be repaired  i had to rush to a sporting goods store to purchase another tent      
1302,4.0,                       this tent  while not quite  instant   was easy to put up  it was spacious inside  i liked the nearly upright walls which make for stand up height almost anywhere inside  it rained on my trip and i found that  with the windows closed  the tent was pretty water tight  i believe you can buy a rain fly  it doesn t come with one  that would make the tent more useful in inclement weather  the major flaw in this tent is that it folds up to a pretty large size when taken down  can take up a lot of packing space in your car or truck  i would recommend checking it out in person before ordering      
1303,5.0,                       we ve had this tent for four years now  and i still get joy out of how easy it is to set up  compared to the old style tents that are a pain in the ass   this has held up really well and i recommend it to anyone looking for a quality  inexpensive  no fuss tent      
1304,5.0,                       easiest tent i ve ever set up  took me about   minutes by myself and it was pitched and ready to go  perfectly fits my coleman twin air mattress cot with room for my stuff and to move around  super comfortable  nice large windows on both sides plus   on the doors  fantastic tent  would totally buy again if i needed to      
1305,5.0,                       we ll camp in it next week  but my    year old son and i just put it up in about       minutes   it s huge and airy   we have an older version of this easy up coleman    person tent and this one seems like a huge improvement especially with all the windows   it s a bit tough to stuff back in the carry bag  but it can be done without much trouble      
1306,5.0,                       this tent is awesome for car camping where you don t have to trek your stuff in   you can put it up by yourself in minutes and you re good to go you aren t supposed to need a rain fly  but i felt some condensation when i used it but even glass has that problem   anyway  highly recommended for a quick and easy fortress that will fit   comfortably or   sleeping bags      
1307,4.0,                       this product is extremely well  made  tent material is tough  poles are heavy duty  set up in seconds  and the tent actually goes back into the bag  will update review after field use      
1308,5.0,                       i very easy tent to set up and take down   i have taken it down myself and did it in under   minutes spacious inside and we are looking forward to using it often      
1309,5.0,                       this is the first tent i ve purchased   haven t used one since i was younger and remember the nightmare of tent poles and putting it together  this tent is so easy to put up and take down   i did it by myself in less than   minutes   can t wait to go camping in a few weeks       
1310,5.0,                       have had many of these over the years  they are heavy  so it is not an option for backpacking   tent is up in one minute and down in two  i had one blow away in borrego but even a      tent from rei will do that  i highly recommend      
1311,1.0,                       not good   i read reviews and being a coleman guy i discounted the negative ones because i have always been happy with coleman   they missed the mark on this tent big time   setting up was easy enough  but was not worth the trade off of poor wind design   while setting up this tent for the very first time i noticed concerns   the rain fly does not attach well to the tent poles   the guy lines from the tent poles to the ground push up on the rain fly   there are no anchor points on the sides  neither the bottom to keep wind from going under the tent or at the top to reinforce the sides against wind pushing the sides in   so  first night up     mothersday weekend       we are on the lake      am     mph winds pick up and the left side of the tent buckles in   fighting the wind to push the tent back to open the door i get out side  in the dark trying to push the poles back into place    unable to see what was going on and fighting the wind i gave up and moved my wife and i into the    year old   person coleman with the kids   the next morning i was able to rotate the legs back out from the center point on the top of the tent   the next night the wind picked up again  this time the tent didn t buckle in but the fabric flapping  and the anticipation of the tent collapsing keep us awake until the wind finally died down   i will attempt to return this tent   i m going back to the old design until they workout the kinks with the instant set up    and might still avoid it        
1312,5.0,                       i have taken this to many music festivals and it s the envy of all of my festi friends   i can set it up in a few minutes and need no assistance   it survived wakarusa      during the multiple thunderstorms and   mph winds   while everyone else s tents were in shambles mine stayed upright and dry   i recommend this tent to everyone who is looking for a reliable sturdy tent   plenty of room for me and my gear   don t forget to buy the rainfly  and you ll be golden      
1313,5.0,                    muy  til        
1314,1.0,                       easy to set up  not reliable when it rains  the rain came thru the walls of the tent  very disappointed in coleman  would not recommend this tent      
1315,5.0,                    muy grande y f cil de armar  no resiste bien las lluvias fuertes        
1316,5.0,                       easy to set up   lots of room for my three grandsons and their dad     
1317,4.0,                       great tent  no joke less than   minutes from getting it out of the bag to fully stood up  no stakes in the ground or groundcover rainfly installed   once you understand what it takes to open this tent up you can do it in a snap this tent is big enough for   twin air mattresses and  some stuff   i had   small backpacks inside with an auto battery jumper box to charge my cell phone   you can t really stand up in it but its a space for sleeping  not much else i bought the rainfly  there is no excuse for not having one when it rains   it should be part of the package on this  water seeps through any tent material when anything comes in contact with the outside walls   that is the nature of these kinds of materials and has been for years   a rainfly prevents the water from ever settling on your tent in the first place i highly recommend buying groundcover that fits  it doesn t have to be fancy just something to keep the bottom clean and from coming in to contact with water flowing across the ground   keeping the tent clean  dry and free of organic debris when stored is critical   leaves organics break down and weaken the tent material while they rot if it is put up dirty   the key to long lasting tents is to store them in a clean  low humidity place inside your home and put them up completely  clean and dry inside and out   doing so will keep any tent from mildewing and or from being ruined by organic material rotting against them all and all i am happy with this purchase for a   person camp out as an alternative to our family sized monster tent with    poles that have to be assembled when its put up      
1318,5.0,                       it s a great tent for the price  fairly light but not backpack light  it folds out and folds up as easy as any i ve seen  it does seem to look though  very airy with windows open during a nice night  we bought the     rainfly and it helps  but i don t think any tent in this price range is made well for oklahoma blowing rain  it has good room  one queen size mattress  a dog bed  and some gear room  you can hang a light led lantern from the top too      
1319,5.0,                       this thing assembled and disassembled as quickly and easily as they said   i pinched my fingers in the centerpiece when taking it down the first time  so watch where you have your hands   i used this for three days on a rainy weekend and stayed      dry   i had purchased the optional rain cover  but never needed or used it   tent was larger than i needed though   for one guy  could have probably done as well with the   person version      
1320,1.0,                       what i disliked about this tent is that it leaked water at the seams  a brand new tent  i couldnt believe it  spend money on a coleman tent you would expect it not to leak in the first rain storm  p o s      
1321,5.0,                       amazing tent for the price  withstood     mph winds and burning man  and so easy to set up  it took about   minuets to set up by myself      
1322,5.0,                       i am recently into the idea of camping and going out to enjoy nature all the time  earlier  i had a cheapish tent which we went out on a beach camp once and it was a disaster  after taking   hour to set it up  agreed it was first time  it was extremely suffocating inside after deciding to take a quality tent  i was about to take another coleman regular tent for   person when one of my experienced friends recommended this instant tent  i was a bit apprehensive initially to believe that instant tents really work but  went ahead by having faith in his words and now  i truly thank him for that wisdom  as i said  i am not a experienced camper but  i was really able to set this tent in   minutes up and ready  i couldn t believe myself of how easy it was though it is said to be for   people  it is the best tent for a couple  you can have enough space to keep all your gear and still sleep peacefully  i got a queenbed as well to fit in this  but haven t tried it yet so far  the experience was superb  i haven t seen how it fares in rain yet  so  will update about it later      
1323,2.0,                       used it twice zipper already broken       
1324,5.0,                       really nice tent  sets up super quick  doesn t come with rain fly so just make sure to purchase one separate if needed      
1325,1.0,                       i bought this tent new but it definitely was not new this item was definitely used before and was defective because of rain leaking from the top of the tent  someone who  repaired the tent only repaired it with scotch tape on the inside of the tent on top and called it a repair and put it back on the shelf for purchase as new  lazy customer  service     
1326,1.0,                       i really wanted to like this tent  so many reviews with high ratings  buyer beware    this tent leaks     take time to check all the reviews before you buy and you will see the comments about the tent leaking over and over   i am sorry i wasted by money          
1327,4.0,                       just finished a trip to the redwoods and the set up was quite easy for one person   the inner space was spacious for   queen air mattresses side by side with room  about    inches  at the feet for gear   really a great choice for car camping with a family of four   i would have given it   stars if it wasn t such a tight fit and fight while getting it back into its storage bag     
1328,3.0,                       it leaked the first week i set it up  easy to setup and take down     
1329,5.0,                       tent was fantastic but one one of our poles broke  these poles cannot be replaced unless under warranty  now a       tent is in the trash because structurally it wont hold up or even fold up unless i gorilla taped it every time      
1330,5.0,                       great tent no leaks and holds up good in the wind     
1331,5.0,                       everyone in the campground ooo s and awe s at this tent  it s big enough for a queen sized mattress and all our gear  it sets up soooooo fast and easy  and gets taken down just as easy  i am already enjoying a beverage while neighboring camps are trying to figure out where the poles to their tent goes      
1332,5.0,                       this tent wasn t a hard sell  i read a lot of reviews on this tent  both good and bad  as far as the leakage problems i read about  it all comes down to being prepared for rain  colman  weather tech  is good on its own  but you need to give it a little help to stay completely dry  the rain fly is the first step  i know  i know  it should come with the tent  well this irritates me as well  but i paid the extra twenty five  because i live in a rainy climate and i hate damp bedding  i took this tent out of the box and had it set up in under two minutes  i bought some good water base seam sealer  and a large can of camp dry  i went over the entire tent  every seam  with the sealer  i let that dry in the sun for an hour  i then sprayed the tent with the camp dry  with the sealer  be sure you do all the tie down straps along both sides next to the tent  brush the sealer under the edge of the seam  and on top of the stitches  the seam has to look wet to be sealed  do along the bottom seam and the corners last using up the last of the sealer  i gave these  three coats  the rain fly cover has already been seam sealed and water proofed so you can use it right out of the box  let the tent set up for at least two hours to dry  the odor will go away as well  note  do not spray this camp dry inside your tent without a respirator  i see no need to do that anyway  i ran the hose over the tent for five minutes strait  spraying water in all directions  not one drop of water got in   i will put a blue tarp over the tent when i go camping as another line of defense  i say let it rain  you always have blue skies when you have a big blue tarp      
1333,5.0,                       we needed a new tent so when i saw this i thought how hard could it be  we watched the video at coleman on the set up  they say you can erect this tent in   minute  it took us about    seconds  we purchased the   man tent for the   of us and a small dog  i ordered a queen size mattress  fits good with room to spare  there s plenty of windows in the tent for ventilation and opens on top for air  coleman now sells a rain fly for the instant tent after complaints of not having one  we find ours to be well manufactured  no flaws  perfect for us  we haven t had rain yet so i can t comment on leaks  we had no problem taking it down and folding it back up to fit in the carrying case  my husband used to jump with parachutes so he s good at folding camping items to fit their cases  i m very impressed with this instant tent and would recommend it      
1334,1.0,                       it wasn t easy to setup  it wasn t clear that there is   clicks on each pale  in addition after everything was setup it seems that the tent is not stable at all  even after i connected the pegs it seems to be weak      
1335,1.0,                       it s not for   people  when i read the descriptions of what was for a song of perdinas and how many air mattresses could fit inside and it is not the space they mentioned     
1336,5.0,                       tent popped open and setup like a champ in under   minutes  it was large  roomy  comfy and held up pretty well during a hail storm  excellent purchase      
1337,4.0,                       love this tent  i have not used it in the rain yet so i can t attest to its water resistance  but it is super easy to take down and put up  i usually have to do this alone so having something simple is such a relief  there was a small whole in one of the seams but it was easy to fix      
1338,5.0,                       our first camping trip and our first tent  the experienced campers around us were asking where did we purchase this from  very spacious  very easy to install  it didn t rain so couldn t test it s water resistance  should work though      
1339,3.0,                       the   person model is a descent size for   people  the quick and easy setup is a great selling point  but they fail to mention that it will take you   times the amount of time and effort to break down and pack up  i sold it and switched to car camping or a frame tent      
1340,5.0,                       this is an amazing tent    i would totally buy it again  set up is like    seconds or under      
1341,1.0,                       got the tent set it up and legs will not stay locked when extended  collapse s when legs are touched or a breeze comes will be sending it back  not worth the price      
1342,3.0,                       had problems with main zipper  will return and hope next one is better      
1343,5.0,                       great tent this is my second one you have to lube the zipper or you ll have a problem   easy to set up and take down     
1344,5.0,                       nice job  super easy to install  a lot of space inside and im like   feet tall can walk inside still have space above my head     
1345,5.0,                       it is well know name that s why i ordered it     
1346,5.0,                       ridiculously easy to set up and not too bad to break down either  used in temps down into the    s with heavy moisture  held up well with the rain topper on it  if you touched it  moisture came through like most tents in this category   so far i have zero complaints      
1347,1.0,                       this tent leaks   the first time i used it  a gentle mist started and the water went right through the walls  the weather proofing tape came off as soon as it got wet  the video showing how waterproof it is  is a big lie  i tried to get my money back and they would not give me a refund  do not buy this tent      
1348,5.0,                       after watching some set up videos on youtube my husband tried this in our back yard and was able to set it up in less than   minute without any trouble great headroom and nice straight walls mean this tent has a lot more usable space than most tents and is perfect for using with a portable crib for infants or toddlers good quality material and good construction  much nicer than i expected      
1349,4.0,                       this tent is for car camping  not back backing   easy to set up  quality materials  faired very well in an intense rain storm   ability to fully stand up inside is the heat  too old to stoop all weekend long    the dog loves it and recommends      
1350,5.0,                       amazing  i bought this tent for my daughter and i to camp with friends and her girl scout troop  we camp proberly     times a year and was looking for a little bigger tent then what we had  i see this tent and how easy it was to put up  i watched every youtube video and sure enough  it was that easy  the first day we got it my daughter and i put it up in   minute and    seconds   defiantly recommend this tent for anyone    so easy        
1351,2.0,                       so this is a great fair weather tent but any wind and your screwed because the guy lines are attached to the fly not the tent  it did hold up to the rain though     
1352,1.0,                       broken pole end cap right out of the box  can t find replacement cap  so the whole thing is going back      
1353,5.0,                       fantastic tent  it goes up very fast  takes a few more minutes to put on the rain fly  no biggie  tie and steak down  we own the   person also  took camping and had a very heavy rain at night with high winds  this tent took it like a champ  one small puddle in one of the corners was all      
1354,2.0,                       this tent does set up in a minute   but it takes    minutes to put back in the bag because the bag is so small   that kind of defeats the whole idea od easy set up and take down  i contacted coleman two weeks ago and haven t heard back      
1355,1.0,                       first night using it with the rain coming in  leaking from the top the tent and not good  this tent sucks      
1356,1.0,                       first time we used it the tent fell in on top of us  it was set up properly and a bit of wind caved it in   definitely not high winds  we are disappointed as this was our second coleman easy up tent and our first one was great  not sure if we just received a defective one  but very disappointed      
1357,5.0,                       easy to set up and take down  very roomy for two people      
1358,5.0,                       we absolutely love how easy this is to set up and take down  where it used to take us a half hour to set up camp  now only takes us about    minutes  super easy  we also love the blackout inside  sleeping in is no problem now that the sun isn t right in our faces      
1359,5.0,                       wasn t too sure about it at first but its awesome  love it easy to put up and take down  first time we set it up got nailed by a storm and we stayed super dry      
1360,5.0,                       best tent i ve owned easy set up and to put away  couldn t feel the air although i could see the tent moving slightly i would recommend it          
1361,2.0,                       we just set it up for the first time this past weekend and it had two holes in floor and at least     tears in sides of fabric   but we we are the campsite and had to use otherwise i d be sending it back   so disappointed     
1362,5.0,                       it s as easy as the description says to put this tent up   my husband didn t believe it would be so easy  but we had the tent up and ready to go in     minutes   putting it away took about     minutes  but now that we know how to collapse it and pack it away  it ll probably only take     minutes next time   if you and your partner tend to fight when putting things together  this tent is well worth the money   it was so easy  i don t know why anyone would buy a tent where you have to feed the poles through the tent  etc we fit   queen airbed and   twin airbed perfectly  with about    feet walking room between the beds and plenty of room in front of the beds for your bags luggage   perfect size for my husband  myself and our   year old   can probably fit two queen airbeds  but may be a little cramped  but still enough room at the end for everyone s bags  shoes  etc   love that you can stand up in it  too we were in a foggy area  so the outside of the tent was wet in the morning  so we re going to buy a rain cover       for our next trip  although it didn t leak or drip at all   the material is really sturdy and with a brand like coleman  you can trust it s going to hold up for many future camping trips      
1363,5.0,                       really nice looking  tent  and well made      
1364,5.0,                       easy to set up   huge  easy to take down   absolutely amazing and a great price    built in poles  no need for another rain fly      
1365,5.0,                       very nice tent  ignore the weathertech logo on the tent  water will leak through  will need some sort of tarp over the tent if it rains      
1366,4.0,                       awesome for easy access sites  too heavy  bulky for pack in camping  st tent had zipper flaw but was quickly replaced great size  fits queen air mattress     
1367,5.0,                       i didn t think they were serious  but you really can assemble it in    seconds  good product  but a few scratches through the bottom after   use      
1368,1.0,                       we have had this tent for   years  last year we used this tent which was the first real rain we had  we got soaked  everything soaked  blankets  clothes  pillows  the floor of the tent was a puddle  we treated it like we were supposed to and still      
1369,5.0,                       seriously the it feels wrong when setting this tent up because seriously it s that fast and easy  tent rainfly and all i can have set up in five minutes including staking them down  and that s with zero help  got the tent with with the stake kit and rainfly  will be the last tent i own      
1370,5.0,                       the makers of this tent knew what they were doing   it really does go up in a snap   takedown is just as easy   windows and doors  screened  are right where you want them   it has interior pouches for flashlights and a center loop for hanging a battery lantern   fabric is strong  but doesn t make a crinkling sound like some more cheaply made tents   i would buy this again in a heartbeat      
1371,2.0,                       the tent is easy to set up and pack out  but as others have mentioned  it is certainly not waterproof  which we found out the hard way      
1372,4.0,                       the tent leaked with first use but there was     inches rain in just a couple of hours so i wasn t surprised  i have treated it with the spray to keep it dry  the only problem with the tent was folding it back up  i tried for   hours and no way would it fit in the tent bag  i finally just gave up and found a box that fit it and now i m very happy with it      
1373,1.0,                       i have reached out to coleman on their support link on their page   no response weathertec   give me a break   i ll post video of the moat that surrounded my bed in my weatherlesstec no response   good grief coleman has fallen from grace      
1374,3.0,                       i love  everything about this tent besides the  water resistant  claim   tent leaks water even with morning dew       
1375,5.0,                       love this tent   easy to put up and take down first one that i received one of the window vent zipper was off track and returned it and amazon replaced it   haven t got to use the new one yet camping in   weeks        
1376,5.0,                       if you re looking for a family tent this may not be it  perfect for what i was looking for  over night camp  fits   folding cots with room to move between them  take it out of bag  shake it a little  extend legs and ready to camp in few minutes  very nice little tent      
1377,1.0,                    no lo es usado por que beniarota mal producto no recomiendo al vendedor para nada        
1378,1.0,                       black plastic on the inside  for people that want more than shade  it would be great to set up as a temporary video production studio  but it is too heavy for weekend camper      
1379,4.0,                       it does go up in short time  and it is well built the instructions reveal that it is designed to be put up with   people   that would be good to know before i purchased it for single use it has no rain fly  and the pr makes several statements about not needing one  but it does   if you use this tent for any serious camping then take a tarp to cover the tent with and plan to make a rainfly  for it will be needed   when it rains  i cannot open the windows or door or the the water will run in and on a hot day it can get stifling coleman makes equipment that looks good  but i wonder if anyone takes this gear out to use it before it goes to production   this tent has much good to its design  but it has no interior hooks  for instance  and they are really useful i find this tent very awkward to roll up and put away  altho it collapses well this is an excellent product if you are willing to work on making it functional james the obscure     
1380,4.0,                       pray it does not rain  easy setup for large tent though        
1381,2.0,                       it s lightweight and easy to install  but it leaks water through seams since they have lots of holes in them  i would recommend a better water resistant waterproof product instead of this one      
1382,5.0,                       put this up and took it down by myself  was very simple   didn t take long to pop up and down  haven t had to use it in rain so i can t comment on that  really appreciate how much i didn t have to hassle with assembly  glad i paid the extra money to not hassle  will update as i use it more        
1383,5.0,                       super fast to put up and tear down  good in a light rain  haven t been in a heavy rain yet  i got the rain cover and would recommend it      
1384,4.0,                       haven t used it yet but it looks great     
1385,3.0,                       tent was very easy and very fast to set up   unfortunately did not come with a rain fly so had to purchase that separately which kinda sucked   the tent was a bit small   i would recommend the   person just for extra space   otherwise over all was good      
1386,3.0,                       i haven t used it yet during actual camping  i tried setting it up in my backyard to test because i was very sceptical how easy it was to setup  the setup out of the box was very very easy  putting it away and back in that small carrying case is impossible      
1387,5.0,                       it is very easy to put up  and take down  a no hassle experience      
1388,5.0,                       received this tent after a   day delivery with prime   unit was well packed and shipped   watch a youtube video before opening at home   always like to test before using items away from home tent was easy to get set up and take down   did both easily in    mins while i took my time   will use this memorial day weekend at the lake but if all works there like it did in the backyard  i will be very happy always been able to trust coleman products      
1389,5.0,                       this tent is awesome  i m     and i can put this tent up or take it down in just a few minutes  something you should know though  is that if you want to put   people in there  you won t be able to move  we put in queen and twin size air mattresses with our back packs and it was comfortable   we had about a foot between the mattresses for a  walkway      
1390,5.0,                       this tent easily accommodated two adults and   children with room to spare  the setup and takedown could not be easier  it was less than   minutes to setup and takedown from car to campsite and back  lot s of headroom  windows  screens  and high quality zippers  fortunately we did not encounter rain during our camping trip  so i can t comment on the effectiveness of its supposed built in water proofing  however  you can purchase a separate rainfly specifically for this if needed      
1391,5.0,                       we weather proofed the tent as soon as we bought it  true to the advertisement it s the easiest tent i ve ever had the pleasure of setting up  on our very first trip out we survived one hell of a storm and stayed high and dry  so i think weather proofing must be the key to having a good experience with this particular product      
1392,1.0,                       went camping in the eastern sierra weekend before the  th of july   tent couldn t handle    mile per hour winds and most of the poles bent  there were cheaper tents at the campground that held up great this one was on the ground when i came back from fishing  worst camping purchase ever      
1393,5.0,                       easy set up and packing  no leaking in heavy rain     
1394,5.0,                       nice tent not lightweight but still lighter than some      
1395,5.0,                       super easy to set up and stayed dry in downpour  did buy rain guard extra to fit  roomy and comfy  easy to take down too      
1396,1.0,                       i never used it   it was way to heavy  had to help getting it to the car from post office       
1397,5.0,                       very easy to set up roomy for one cot     very nice tent for the price best thing is you can set it up in a minute      
1398,5.0,                       so easy to put up  takes more a little more effort to put away  we use it for bicycles and lawn chairs when rv camping  keeps everything dry and out of site      
1399,5.0,                       very easy to set up and break down   used twice in a rainstorm and everything inside stayed dry      
1400,5.0,                       worked great on the beach  definitely recommend this tent  easy to set up even in the wind  we had a queen sized mattress   our gear  not really a   person tent though     
1401,5.0,                       my go to tent  easy  roomy  great all around tent  it could use a bigger bag to store it in and doesn t come with a rain fly which is weird i store mine in an old army duffel bag      
1402,5.0,                       we love this tent  plenty of room      
1403,5.0,                       i would recommend this tent for anybody   it s so cool setting it up because it takes around    minutes max   this leaves your camp mates jealous  as you will be enjoying cold beverages whilst watching them still setting up their tent   literally though    after laying down a tarp on the footprint  the tent does not come with one  the tent pops up in about   minutes  securing the poles and staking it down takes another   if you hurry   by the time you get it set up just right and you move onto another project you will spend around    minutes setting up your temporary home the only con is the take down and bagging the tent back up   it s a bit of a pain in the a   to get the poles just right to fit in the bag  but the bag is rugged and you can really force it in   it isn t bad enough to doc a star however  and with this being the only downfall of the tent  i would still recommend      
1404,4.0,                       it went up very easy about   minutes alone first timei didn t receive any tent stakesand there is no way   queen air mattress would fit one barley fitsi tried both ways     
1405,5.0,                       great product   fast and easy setup      
1406,5.0,                       finally  a tent that was made for me  no poles and up in less than a minute  i always tarp underneath my tents and when available    above it  had some rain and nothing got in    even without the fly   spacious enough for   queen size air mattress and   twin size air mattress  love it      
1407,1.0,                       don t buy this crap    it is      water leaking with at least three times test  i don t understand why amazon choose this product as amazon choice  it should be removed from shopping list asap        
1408,4.0,                       i bought the mid size option b c i like to have my space to stretch out and whatnot  it is an awesome tent and a great idea  but i think the smaller one would have been better for me since it can be hard to set up and take down alone  i also bought the optional rainfly  just in case  i haven t had any problems with leaks  but i have had a flooded tent  in other tents  too many times to not have an added precaution      
1409,1.0,                       when it rained we got wet  even after buying the rain piece for the top of it      
1410,3.0,                       decent sized tent but setup and packing takes a while  cabin unstable in you just want the setup without rainfly and guylines  door zippers are hard to move because they get stuck on excessive fabric  once you unpack dont expect to get it back into the return box easily      
1411,1.0,                       i purchased a new tent  however  i received a used item   it was covered in sand and smelled like smoke   yuck        
1412,5.0,                       no hype  it really is very quick to assemble   if you take your time it takes about   minutes    but you can assemble in less than a minute   taking down is also easy     a couple of minutes more because you want to squeeze out all the air   no complaints here   good quality for the price   lots of ventilation   a hook inside in the middle to hang a lantern      
1413,1.0,                       this was not waterproof  i was wet in the middle of the night on my camping trip  water was dripping from the center where you would usually hang a light  plus there was condensation on the sides of the tent as well  do not buy this  it s not waterproof      
1414,5.0,                       sets up quick   sturdy nice tent     
1415,5.0,                       used last year hunting   sets up fast   still getting used to tear down but not too bad   recommend     
1416,4.0,                       good tent  great value  probably could have come with the rain fly and is much larger and heavier when transporting than i would have guessed  but not a deal breaker      
1417,5.0,                       so impressed  with my sister s new tent that we had to order the exact same one      love it      
1418,5.0,                       hard as hell to put back up into travel bag but it s a nice tent and easy set up  a bit small inside and you cant stand up unless your  ft tall  our queen bed fits just enough  will be looking for a bigger tent      
1419,5.0,                       the perfect tent for car camping  goes up fast  zip windows on all sides  tough bottom fabric  bulky to pack  but that s ok for car camping      
1420,4.0,                       somewhat big to carry around to campsites but super  super easy to set up and take down  it takes all the hassle out of setting up and breaking down camp  it s very handy as long as you have plenty of room to carry it around  it s pretty big when folded compares to other   man tents     
1421,1.0,                       i ordered this tent very excited to take my family camping  when i attempted the  easy  setup  i was unsuccessful  one of the extension poles were already bent making it impossible to set up or take down  unfortunately  i had to purchase another tent for my family to sleep in  this was a let down considering the substantial price      
1422,5.0,                       i love my new tent  used it at nehalem bay state park in oregon two weeks ago  i am a    year old woman  i easily set it up myself in just a few minutes  it rained all night but the tent stayed dry  it is roomy and has lots of windows and headroom  i also bought the   person fly as added security against rain  it works  i hope to have many more car camping trips with this tent      
1423,5.0,                       this tent is awesome  it went up very easy  we did have a little problem taking it back down  it is very roomy      
1424,5.0,                       spend the extra money and get this tent  sets up within a minute  hasn t leaked in the rain  comes with stakes but it s so sturdy you don t even need to use them  so spacious     
1425,4.0,                       absolute game changer  set up is less than   min   good tent     
1426,5.0,                       to start with the built and material quality is good and i think it would last pretty good   the set up is a breeze and even   person can do it  but two is ideal if you re really in a hurry   the price is just about it s range though if you re looking for the alternative buy look for ozark which is good also   the thing i don t like is how expensive it s rainfly since not included and you need to buy it separate if you want to      
1427,5.0,                       stays in my jeep for emergency      
1428,5.0,                       i had an instant tent that the zipper was failing when i bought this one  i go out to fire camps to work in the summer and i need something that goes up easy without a lot of parts   i left  days before this tent arrived so i got by but can hardly wait to go out again and use this one     
1429,5.0,                       i have not used this one yet but have had   other of the same camped in them from the texas cost to above       feet in the rockies down to    at nite in hail and snow i love my others     
1430,5.0,                       we were able to set this tent up in less than    minutes   our fellow campers were impressed as we were ready to go while they were still putting together their rods to shape their tent      
1431,5.0,                       these tents are great  easy and quick to set up  even for the novice camper we just bought this second tent so our sons could move out of ours       
1432,5.0,                       great tent   super fast popup     
1433,5.0,                       nice and big and easy setup thanks     
1434,5.0,                       best tent ever  i was able to put it up in about    sec  by myself  and taking it down was just as easy  i hate camping  but will go again in his one  fit my cot perfectly      
1435,4.0,                       smaller then expected  definitely can not fit more then   people     
1436,2.0,                       this tent does not fit four people  my   year old and i fit and that s it      
1437,5.0,                       bought this tent for a camping trip      got there and it rained the entire first day   the tent held up great    everything stayed dry   the tent was roomier than i anticipated   easily fit a queen size air mattress with room at the foot of the mattress  and could ve gotten another queen size mattress next to it   instead  we used it to store our clothes and food   plenty of room   very easy to put up and take down   what a great deal      
1438,1.0,                       complete waste of moneyfirst off way smaller  maybe   kidsdoesn t handle even light rainno air flow  so ton of condensate insideruined my trip     
1439,4.0,                       this is a great tent  it took me about   minutes to set up  once set it s very sturdy and durable  lots of room inside for my queen size air mattress for less than      i am very happy just   major down sides    no rain fly  i missed that when i bought the tent  any camper knows a rain fly is a must    not water replant  if you buy this tent make sure you seal it well before you use it other then that i am pleased     
1440,5.0,                       very nice tent  plenty of room it has to be one of the easiest tents to put up i have every had or seen well made time will tell      
1441,5.0,                       this is easy for me set up alone in around    minutes   the blackout sides are great to let us sleep past sunrise at      am in the summer  i have not used it in rain yet but have had good luck with coleman tents of similar price in the past      
1442,2.0,                       pro  very easy set upcon  door window did not come with zipper to close i expected more from coleman rain fly is sold separately  i feel this should have been included coleman says it is a   person tent and it barely fit a queen size air mattress and   over night bags for   adults      
1443,2.0,                       i am so disappoint in this tent it leaks badly  in only ligth rain even with rainfly on and now the bottom door zipper is broken have not even used it once  i guess you get what you pay for  cheap workmanship  i have thought better of coleman l guess not  don t buy this product      
1444,2.0,                       everything about this tent was perfect   almost too good to be true  first night  first rain   realized it was too good to be true  leaked in multiple areas along the seams including the sides and top  most areas of the walls felt dry except some were noticeably wet from the inside  not waterproof as described      
1445,5.0,                       this tent is awesome  it really is super easy to set up   took me less than   minutes and i have never set up a tent in my life   which is why i wanted an instant tent   and i was able to fit it back in its carrying case   no problem
