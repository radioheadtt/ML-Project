0,5.0,                       absolutely love     
1,5.0,                       the amazon ordering was flawless  as always  the surface pro   is an upgrade from a surface   i purchased four years ago  this is used daily by a school teacher for virtual learning and handles all tasks well  the surface   was getting a little slow with the number of resource intensive applications used and it was time for newer hardware  another fine product from microsoft      
2,5.0,                       this is the first time i bought microsoft a kind of a small tablet but this is really good i was a hp  customer but now i like this it s because it s easy to handle and it worth for money very handy stylish and very fast i do not have any hesitation to recommend this to anyone     
3,5.0,                       this is my wife s second surface pro  her workplace issues them to teachers and she liked it from the start  her personal surface pro is definitely her favorite computer   she is also an extensive use of iphones and ipads      
4,5.0,                       great machine        
5,1.0,                       fresh out of the box this surface pro   crashes frequently enough to consider it too unreliable to be my sole computer   i wanted to love this  but now regret buying it        
6,5.0,                       not as light as i expected    even contacted microsoft to be sure  they were not accurate     but in general is the best option for a small light touchpad laptop computer something everyone wants to know         kg   grs       lb with original keyboard     
7,5.0,                       great product   much better than ipad        
8,5.0,                       i use the surface pro mor my more mobile users  powerful and portable these things rock  my only complaint is that they have   usb port  other than that  love them      
9,4.0,                       while battery life is a little short  it s still an above average notebook      
10,5.0,                       the surface pro   has made taking notes easier and has generally improved learning during the pandemic for me  it can handle gaming although use of an external fan is a must for modern titles excellent choice for students       would recommend      
11,4.0,                       always liked microsoft products  surface pro   is awesome to use and comes with great features  bought it for my   years old kid and he is enjoying using it  he is pro using mac book and other windows laptop  and without any issue he started using surface pro  great product  the packaging was great    my son enjoyed unboxing this new surface pro  happy using ao far     
12,3.0,                       good computer  but realize that if you have problems with it your local computer shop won t be able to help   the only option is to send it back to microsoft and that option starts at       they couldn t tell me why the extra          
13,4.0,                       first a big thumbs up to proprime and fedex who shipped my surface pro   to the other side of the globe within   days of ordering   very impressed as for the pro    so far very happy  build quality is good and i havee been able to use my hp pen on it without issue  negating the need to spend more money on something i already have the onscreen keyboard is not great though   during the setup there were a couple of times where i could not type in details and had to push all around the screen to try and get the keyboard to appear  even after updating to the latest version of windows  this did not improve talking of setup  this was very easy and after logging in with my microsoft details  i was up and running within an hour very handy tool when meeting with clients      
14,5.0,                       bought this for my daughter in october  who is a senior in high school  she loves it and no problems with it so far      
15,5.0,                       very versatile  light weight      
16,5.0,                       even our it director was impressed with this product when he added my internet access  we liked it so much that we ordered a second one within a week      
17,5.0,                    muy buena opci n        
18,1.0,                       bought bundled but keyboard connection was inconsistent   sp   had to be restarted all the time to use the keyboard and disconnects after a a few minutes  sp  was later determined defective not the keyboard   additionally  matte black finish was easily scratched on the edges especially in the bottom of the folding stand   also noticed imperfection in the paint job with a small clump of paint near the logo   terrible quality control   returned to a microsoft store during my travel in california and replaced with a new sp  but i had to purchase extended warranty for the store to replace with a new unit   the new replacement sp  paint job is noticeably better coating since it s holding well after a week use     star for microsoft poor production quality control but   stars for the customer service provided by microsoft westfield topanga canyon store for offering the replacement      
19,3.0,                       this is really a nice product  i love the ease of use  the design  the speed  seriously  i can t say enough good or anything bad except for the price  when all was said and done for the surface pro and keyboard with sales tax   total was just over        i honestly think that it seems well overpriced based on all the shopping i did when i needed to replace my computer  i reluctantly returned this   buyers remorse   and purchased an open boxed  excellent condition surface go with mouse  keyboard and pen for a little over half the price of pro   which i am finding is a suitable alternative  i wish i could have justified the cost because i like a bigger screen normally the go is only     compared to the pro which is          
20,5.0,                       i had the surface pro   for years prior to this  i decided to upgrade and i m glad i did  some of the improvements i like are    writing is so much smoother plus in one note it is very sensitive to how much pressure i put down with pen and the angle when using pencils   faster for sure and it runs many things at once with no issues  i also installed a lot and got it all done within a hour   the hello face recognition is easy to set up and makes signing in a breeze   battery life at least for now is great  this is biggest reason i updated  i used for   hours yesterday and still had       picture is a lot more crisp with better colors and sound had definetly improvedoverall  i highly recommend  the fact you can change from a solid laptop to a solid tablet within seconds is incredible  i have had good luck with microsoft products and so far this is the same      
21,4.0,                       very happy with device  although first device was programmed for hebrew punctuation and could not be resolved  had to resort to a second device which so far has been a pleasure      
22,5.0,                       replacing my laptopgreat size   can use as a tablet too        
23,1.0,                       the memory ram didn t work as it had to do work  therefore  i was in struggle      
24,4.0,                    el equipo incluye teclado  sin embargo  el que recib  presenta un peque o inconveniente con el cargador ya que el mismo no se sostiene en su lugar y hay que estar vigilando que no se desconecte para que alcance las carga necesaria  por lo dem s no tengo ninguna queja hasta el momento         
25,5.0,                       a few months ago  i had contractors working in my home and during the process someone stole my lenovo yoga laptop   an iphone   after going through the   stages of grief i did my research and settled on an hp laptop   i was happy with it for the    days i had it until the cooling fan failed and the device started producing errors and shutting down   hp support assured me they would take care of it but during that period i ended up buying a surface go which was too slow for my preferences and then ultimately settled on this   this tablet is awesome     i love it s portability  performance    price   it really is a great value at this price point and even if i sit it on a blanket all day it will not overheat like my other laptops do under heavy load since there are no vents to block on the surface   don t hesitate  buy it   hp returned my laptop after   business days  go hp     but i still prefer and use this     of the time and it s the only computer i travel with now because of it s portability      
26,5.0,                       given as a birthday present  the surface pro was in use immediately after opening and has been in use every day since      
27,1.0,                       i purchased two of these at the same time at christmas for my sons   the first one would boot loop  meaning it would never boot up  right out of the box  so we returned it   now four months later  the second one is doing the exact same thing out of the blue   these things are trash  and now we re stuck with an almost      piece of unreliable junk   avoid and do not buy      
28,5.0,                       very good product  amazing pc      
29,1.0,                       i purchased this computer and was very excited to use it  i m a student and don t use it for anything special  just simple basic use now listen  after just four months the computer started to get stuck every few hours  sometimes it just doesn t move and should really be turned off by long pressing the shutdown button and sometimes it wakes up after a few seconds of being stuck  this is an unbearable situation  i do not recommend this surface pro   at all  by the way  i realized that it happened to many more people who bought this computer in addition  microsoft s service is inaccessible and i was unable to contact them to fulfill the warranty      
30,1.0,                    dentro de la p gina descriptiva del equipo se indica que el equipo viene con teclado  no obstante en mi equipo cuando lo compr  no vino con teclado        
31,5.0,                       this is a great buy         
32,5.0,                       this surface pro is awesome      
33,5.0,                       using business and for personal use  music and photos  traveling information     
34,1.0,                       this is a horrible product i purchased this computer and i was so excited to use it  however it kept restarting out o the blue  i gave it a couple of days because i thought that it was doing it since it was a new computer but no       it just kept  restarting and restarting  eventually i got fed up and returned it  then the company had the audacity to not give me full refund for a defective computer       i will never purchase from this company because they ll give you a horrible product and not give you a full refund      
35,5.0,                       i love that the product is light  the sharpness of the graphics and the quality of the touch screen      
36,5.0,                       no     
37,5.0,                       awesome     
38,2.0,                       total buyer remorse  i ve only had it   months  of course my return window closed on july   th  so i m stuck with it      
39,1.0,                       our first surface pro stopped functioning   we had asurion  which was great   we replaced the machine assuming the one we had gotten was a lemon  and less than a year later i am on the phone trying to talking to microsoft to get the second one fixed   do not buy one of these unless you like spending time with tech support      
40,1.0,                       this brand new surface pro  is it  it acts like it was someone s problem that i inherited      
41,3.0,                       had to get   surface pro to get one that worked  seams good  can t get my office     transfered to this device  microsoft refuses to help  they sure are quick to take my money  disappointing      
42,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          great      
43,1.0,                       worst computer i have ever owned  i would suggest to avoid buying this   months after standard warranty expired and it doesnt allow me to access windows anymore technical support is awful  no way to contact them  only option is to send for service and get a replacement which cost    usd      
44,1.0,                       don t ever get this computer    i would say to find a better one   used it for less than one semester and something with the hardware got fried   garbage        
45,1.0,                       do not buy this as a replacement for a laptop or even as a tablet  i am a windows guy and was always fascinated with the surface but this thing is just an overpriced scam  sure is runs windows which many people find useful but thats about all it can do  its tablet functionalities and features are far inferior than than of its competitors  not to mention the cheap cameras they  include  none of this justifies the  over       price for the high end i  model  go with the newest ipad pro instead  it offers similar power with a better camera and more features than this garbage  also its significantly cheaper at      for their top of the line model and up to about      if you get the maxed out   terabyte version   on the other hand the surface pro   when maxed out can go up to      dollars for less of the quality      
46,5.0,                       looking to my new job     
47,3.0,                       battery life never more than   to   hours  beautiful display and quick smooth interaction from apps to streaming wifi always spotty  purchased the   g  ram     g mem      
48,5.0,                       first experience with the surface  i decided on the surface pro    g ram i  processor  an outstanding device  very good response and fluency in the programs  recommended      
49,5.0,                       much faster than the one it is replacing     
50,4.0,                       it needs more blogs        
51,3.0,                       i bought this surface pro in sept  the battery still is a problem  the computer gets hot too quickly  it will not run microsoft s ultimate word games anymore despite my efforts to correct the problem using suggestions from other frustrated users  you would think microsoft could make their own games  it will not run the kindle app and will not provide their version so i can access my books  i know these are small issues but really         
52,2.0,                       at first glance this device seems high quality  however  i noticed the right side of the screen flexes much more then the left side  worse  it makes a sticking sound when tapped which is super annoying      
53,5.0,                       love it so far      
54,5.0,                       being  used on ambulance for records and chatting      
55,5.0,                       great  rarely does it feel like i m using anything less than a windows computer  some times it lags but this is rare  runs everything well except games and i imagine some hardcore editing stuff  amazing build quality and great support for it  buy the pen it s a lot of fun      
56,5.0,                       very happy with my surface pro   i enjoyed the first one so much i ordered my second and am using it now      
57,5.0,                       i love everything about my surface except for the battery life  i feel like it dies down pretty quickly but overall  great tablet pc     
58,1.0,                       i wanted a lap top that i could take outside and then download to my printer  i have had this foe a month  spent   hours with a microsoft tech   and still doesn t print  i want to return this to amazon with money refunded to my credit card       
59,5.0,                       item met all intentions and needs     
60,5.0,                       i am a senior and not so tech saavy so my daughter convinced me to order this as it would fulfill all that i need  both for desk top and tablet  i love it  setup was easy and i m good to go      
61,4.0,                       it s been pretty good so far  my only issue is that if i m streaming video from netflix or hulu for an extended period it will overheat and the screen goes out until i shut it off and leave it for a few minutes  other processor intensive tasks such as recording music work well      
62,4.0,                       before purchasing this i was going to buy the dell xps         model because of the ultra portable design  but it was           more  so i decided to buy the sp  and i really enjoy it  i am a cs student and needed a fast  portable  and long lasting pc  the keyboard is really nice and the layout of the keys are perfect  also the keyboard is backlit which is really nice thing to have  two things  like others have mentioned  yes it s      and the screen bezel should be thinner and be pushed more to the edge but eh  the screen ain t that bad not to purchase it  second thing  battery is terrible  this may drive people away from buying it  with my screen settings on low  i squeezed out   hours out of the battery with only doing homework online  other than bezel and battery  i still recommend this to anybody      
63,3.0,                       while a generally ok laptop the pricetag is much too high  and the advertised battery life is inaccurate  i used this laptop exclusively for classwork and general web browsing and it s battery life was at best   hours  the brightness all the way down and battery mode in eco       
64,5.0,                       absolutely love this computer      
65,2.0,                       this product is defective and stopped turning in after about    uses  there is nobody to get in contact with on the matter      
66,5.0,                       product arrived on time and was exactly as described   so far very happy with our surface and looking forwarding to using it to help manage our business     
67,5.0,                       one of my favourite device  it took several weeks to arrive but the seller was excellent and promised me to get refund  finally i got it  new with excellent keyboard but without pen  i really like it      
68,1.0,                       i rated everything   star since my new surface pro   will not boot up  therefore  i can not see the screen  can not judge battery life and can not determine the value for money other than to say it appears to be a bad deal      
69,3.0,                       i bought my device in january after doing alot of reviews  i used to be an apple user  everything was great with the device until   months later  it has randomly blue screened at times  and also when going to turn on my tablet it also will error and show the windows logo and then start glitching and not turn on  im technology savy and i m absolutely shocked that this tablet is already having issues within the first     months of purchase     especially after spending  k for it  mind you i use my tablet for school and very minimal things such as zoom  social media accounts  podcasting  and editing photos  i ve never in my life had a computer tablet start to malfunction after a short amount of time  i can t figure out who to communicate with either to get this problem corrected if i go through amazon  or microsoft  although amazon is a verified seller so i d assume it would be through amazon  but searching their site i cannot find any resources to help me resolve this issue or even replace it for another device and i turn it back in  i m also very nervous as i currently just started school and have no other backup device is this completely goes down  amazon  i hope you see this review and can help me resolve this issue  and i hope this helped others with deciding on whether or not to buy  otherwise the device has great screen resolution  light and compact  and very easy to use      
70,3.0,                       purchased this for the office since we are transitioning the team to the ms surface  but was very disappointed to find upon receipt that windows    home is installed when the product description clearly states windows    pro   now i have to decide whether to return it and start over  or go through the hassle of upgrading to the correct os      
71,5.0,                       three weeks in with a trip in there and it has been perfect i wasn t sure i would like the size because my last laptop was a     toshiba and i really liked it but the size is not an issue at all and i truly appreciate the lighter weight of it i got the hub and pointer and a disk drive and they all work perfectly and such a smart design as a ps  player i am almost tempted to get an xbox which would have been blasphemy a mere   weeks ago    update   there is no power cord to plug into the wall so in order to purchase it  here is the link https   www amazon com gp product b  mtpppvm ref ppx od dt b asin title s   ie utf  psc  how microsoft gets away with nickel and diming us to death is beyond me hope this helps anyone getting the docking station  took me over a half hour to find it   it wasn t in the suggested buy settings   stupid oversight by amazon      
72,5.0,                       i ve had my surface pro   for about a month now   i bought an after market mouse  aftermarket pen  a flexible matte screen protector  and a padded carrying case for it to live in when i m not using it so far i ve used it for mostly work  though i have logged into runescape  dating myself with that i m sure   and it worked just fine  no lag   one of these days i ll get around to installing my other games on it  i just haven t had the time   the os is just like all other windows     so there wasn t a learning curve there for me it didn t want to start one night after it had been sitting in a cold car for a couple hours  i went and had dinner drinks after work   which freaked me out  but a hard restart and a charge fixed it up major improvement over my old hp  that is running windows    and definitely way better than my old dell  which still runs xp  i ll update this review as things come up      
73,5.0,                       love it     
74,4.0,                       when i first got the surface i was worried that it would be a dud based on other customer reviews especially considering how cheap it was  and initially  i did run into some issues on the first day because it froze randomly and shut down just as others have said  however  after downloading a firmware update on microsoft s website it seems like this issue has gone and everything is working perfectly  if anyone plans on buying this laptop make sure you download the correct updated drivers and it may resolve any issues that you run into  the last surface pro i had was from      and it still runs pretty smoothly so i m hoping this one lasts just as long  if not longer      
75,5.0,                    genial  totalmente contento con la compra  y la prontitud en el env o        
76,1.0,                       this listing is very misleading and i would not recommend ordering this product from this seller the listing clearly says new and says it includes a type cover   i did not receive a type cover and the unit looks refurbished  not new  i was expecting to receive it in the manufacturer s box and shrink wrapped  instead it came in an unmarked brown cardboard box  the surface pro in a flimsy sleeve without even a plastic film on the screen look elsewhere      
77,5.0,                       nice tablet laptop  fast and easy to use     
78,4.0,                       good product     
79,5.0,                       it is decently powerful  i wouldn t try to go full bore on  k video editing  or rendering  d models  but for light photo editing and little work projects day to day productivity  it is great  the screen is easy to read  crisp and bright  the battery life is marginally decent  it s not overly annoying to me but i am not away from a plug for extended periods of time i was also pleasantly surprised with the cover keyboard and touch pad   they are both actually really good and  heavy duty  overall the ergo on this device is great imo it fits me very well  and it isn t so large to be obscene but it s so small that is hard to use  it has very little graphics capabilities  i was hoping it would be just powerful enough to play fortnite or some light games while on the road but alas it can only play some rts and rpg  they are billions and diablo   are great  type games  shooters are pretty much unplayable especially in a online competitive nature   but this wasn t meant for games  id suggest a asus g   if you want a compact game capable machine  and i might have purchased that had it been out already especially since i pretty much always use this with the keyboard in a laptop layout  i prefer my ipad pro      for a media consumption device personally but from a productivity standpoint i really enjoy it a lot and look forward to getting a lot of use out of it   if the g   comes out and i feel like selling this and blowing some extra cash i might jump up   idk but so far im enjoying this wonderful little device      
80,1.0,                       keyboard cover doesn t work after   weeks  returning this     
81,5.0,                       i have been working on ms windows since it was born   the ms surface is the best computer to use with ms windows hands down in my opinion   of  course both are made by microsoft so you would generally expect it to be the most compatible   i would never write a positive thing about windows itself  but if like everyone else you are pretty much forced to use it  get a surface pro tablet  you will be much happier   the durability is awesome   get a good case protector   i use the uag and it rocks  and get the microsoft keyboard and a screen protector      
82,4.0,                       great for everyday use  love this product  yes there s better   in ones out there  but this one will do just fine for all your basic needs      
83,2.0,                       i was just casually using photoshop in a dry environment on     battery and suddenly the screen goes black and never turns back on  charging it did nothing  it s completely dead  very disappointing for it s price fun to use  but would not recommend      
84,5.0,                       great     
85,1.0,                       after   months using this sf pro   core i   gb  this device have some problems   overheating  battery life so bad  pro   far better  screen have   bright pixels    bad quality     
86,5.0,                       i had an older model  i struggled with how lost it was all the time   this time  i saved up and got the largest memory available   it has made all the difference in the world       
87,4.0,                       i bought this as a secondary windows portable  primarily for use in routine tasks when i did not want to be tied to my desk   i use it like a laptop  so there may have been less expensive  more traditional options that would have done the job  but i have been curious about windows tablets  so when this came up for sale with the cover included  i jumped on it   the utility of this machine  as with any computer  is going to depend on the tasks you want to perform with it   since i mostly use it for document editing  i can t imagine using it in tablet mode would be a very good experience   the type cover is always attached it actually doesn t work so well sitting on a lap   on my short legged  overweight frame  the stand is not sufficient to keep the tablet from falling off   i have not used it in tablet mode  but i notice that it gets rather warm  leaving the cover on and folding it to the back should provide enough insulation   feeling the keys press as you hold it is a little disconcerting  but the system knows to ignore that when the keyboard is at the back as with any compact keyboard  the type cover makes some compromises to save space   i would have happily given up some real estate on the spacebar  cursor keys  and left ctrl key to get at least another ctrl key on the right   as a visually impaired user  i also wish there was another way to tell whether the function keys are going to be function keys or perform their alternate functions when pressed besides a light under the fn key   it seems the function toggles even when the fn key is being used in conjunction with other keys   for example  when editing  one can use the fn pluss arrow keys to access home  end  pgup and pgdn keys  this is handy  but also seems to toggle the function key row performance is good  at least for daily tasks   i have not done anything to tax the machine  but i do not notice a significant difference between the surface and my more powerful desktop pc with routine activities   the facial recognition feature for login works great  even with my inability to look at the camera   i don t know what that means regarding the system s ability to be fooled  but that doesn t concern me at the moment i ve had the surface just a few weeks  but it is serving it s purpose well  even though i do have to use it on a tv tray   a traditional laptop might have served me better  but i am not unhappy with my purchase   it s compact  looks neat  and performs well   if you live in a windows world and want a tablet  this is a good choice  in my view  the type cover inclusion is a must      
88,5.0,                       fast delivery  nice camera     
89,5.0,                       this is perfect for what i need   i meet with clients daily and i need signatures so the touch screen with the pen  sold separately  and the fold back keyboard gives me the convenience of a tablet but the functionality of a laptop   it s fast enough and easily tethers with my phone  you wont be disappointed if your thinking about getting a new system      
90,1.0,                       i skipped the  th and  th iterations of the surface and waited for the    i was truly excited about the new   nm i  processor  ram  better wifi    unfortunately  the truth is that the new surface model is a big  expensive  outdated disappointment  not only the screen is exactly the same as on the previous model  it still doesn t support hdr  or hdr   or  k quality apps  really  for        in      microsoft gives us the cutting edge tech from       thanks  furthermore  the built in ssd is dreadfully slow  the new lpddr x ram is no faster than lpddr  and the new usb c port doesn t charge the device  seriously  even the most powerful  fastest chargers i have dint charge it  including the one that came with the tablet  oh  and since the dp port is no longer there a usb c to hdmi adapter is a must in order to connect an external monitor  which is an additional expense  the only seemingly positive change was intel s new wifi  chipset but it s not nearly enough to justify the price premium over the surface    besides  it freezes a lot and drains the battery quickly  there are  however  a few issues that are even more significant    horrible  unacceptable battery life  even at low brightness  with everything but wi fi tuned off i can t squeeze out more than   hours of work out of it  after the firmware update    both cameras suck in well lit environments  in low light situations they re simply unusable    fan noise is simply unbearable    and it s also on all the time because the tablet gets extremely hot very quickly  the processor throttles the speed and the tablet becomes dreadfully slow    while using ms word  if you use photoshop or any other application that is power hungry then the processor will overheat even with the fan on and there is nothing you can do about it honestly  i m extremely disappointed    this isn t an upgrade because an upgrade implies is an improvement over the previous model and the surface pro   is anything but an improvement  and i m not saying that microsoft has an evil agenda but  one might even say that they intentionally ruined this surface pro in order to sell more of the next the one that will probably have actual improvements and will be usable for more than an hour      
91,5.0,                       ideal   in   for work   home  travel      
92,1.0,                       i liked this product while it lasted  it had reasonable storage  it was not slow and it was pretty efficient  the major problem i had with this product was that it was super hard to get it to take a charge  the last year i had it  i would crash on me all the time  i had to restart the entire program and delete all my apps to get it to come back  overall  it was a handy little computer      
93,5.0,                       i migrated all my files smoothly with my microsoft account  i like the faster downloading speed  that was my goal  having i  in surface pro   is quite a hoot  this device is quite a boost to my morale  i was surprised at how slim the device is  it does seem lighter than my sp   i get all my electronics from amazon now  it is so easy to fine tune just what i want this way      
94,5.0,                       best overall device for my need      
95,1.0,                       i received this from my workplace after having been on a mac for most of the past     years   aside from the learning curve of switching back to windows  there are a bunch of things that a poorly done about the surface     windows management   i have multiple monitors set up and i m constantly trying to rearrange the windows to fit on just one screen   all of my notifications show up in the corner between the three screens making them unreadable   this alone makes this product a fail     tablet mode is useless   i ve only used tablet mode for a few minutes  but you have to select that you are in tablet mode and it doesn t really appear to be designed to be a tablet     removable keyboard is cool   gives me more room for my old school paper notebook on my desktop   i d love to use the key board as a wireless keyboard  but evidently microsofts industrial designers and software engineers did not go the extra mile to make that possible   that would have been cool  but was a fail     the kickstand is a neat idea  but when i want to use this laptop  on my lap  i have a kickstand sticking in my legs and the removable keyboard doesn t have any structure to it   so it sort of fails as a laptop in addition to failing as tablet the idea is great  but the industrial design and software engineering are woefully lacking   microsoft delivered the minimum      
96,4.0,                       i purchased this tablet with the intention of using it primarily for drawing and illustration  unfortunately  i encountered a few issues that came along with that  mainly the diagonal line wobble that occurred  i m still not sure if it was the device itself or the pen i purchased with the device but either way it was a deal breaker for me      
97,4.0,                       as title     
98,2.0,                       i ve only had this for a few months  but i have to do a hard restart almost every day now because the computer goes to sleep and won t go on   the screen goes black for no reason   i get the blue screen of death weekly   so disappointing   would not buy again      
99,5.0,                       i liked that the product was exactly as advertised  microsoft surface pro   with   gb of memory and an intel i  processor  setup was flawless out of the box with no issues  and on top of that  there was not a lot of sample software pre loaded for your review   nine  very happy with the purchase and set up  deliver was also   days ahead of the promised delivery date      
100,5.0,                       screen quality excellent  battery life depends on what the user is doing  for live streaming   hours it holds its own  so much better then why chromebook even when google products  so many cool features  wish it had a full keyboard and more usb ports     
101,5.0,                       great  my boyfriend love it      
102,5.0,                       thanks seller   finely packed   in love with my surface      
103,5.0,                       love the touch screen and ease to use      
104,2.0,                       have had issues with it since purchasing  front facing camera would work to take pictures  would not with any apps  contacted seller they say call microsoft  after many hours and a full reboot it was fixed  wifi constantly disconnects and can t find a network  periodically boots up very slowly      
105,1.0,                       i ve been using my surface pro laptop for months and now it no longer will turn on i need a refund and i bought two of them     
106,5.0,                       i use this laptop to browse the internet  i especially like the keyboard touch and the way it lights up in a dimly lit room      
107,5.0,                       all was fine until one day it kept flickering on the start up logo  it would not start up or shut off  i like the product otherwise  i ll try another  hopefully i ll get a good one      
108,1.0,                       i just got the surface and finished basic installation of windows  i have not installed anything yet  it has been just one hour and more than seven times this blue screen happened   thinking of returning it back      
109,5.0,                       much better than i expected  i bought i  model with   ram  i use it as second computer  visual studio  sql management works very fast on it  i love it  just the price is expensive        
110,1.0,                       the first unit i received from amazon had a white spot in the screen   amazon wanted me to contact microsoft regarding an exchange   microsoft wanted me to contact amazon regarding an exchange   finally microsoft provided a replacement which which is unreliable   constantly restarting and is slower then my surface pro        
111,3.0,                       the facial login is awesome  sped of light  but just like my surface   is periodically goes off into the weeds  browse too long and oops screen and keyboard freeze while the intel i  goes to      utilization for    seconds or so  having ot rip the keyboard off and reconnect it to make it respond  very annoying on such a high priced device      
112,3.0,                       i bought it twice  every time it s came with hardware issue so i bought lenovo yoga c         
113,5.0,                       i m not a computer whiz so this tablet is just what i need to get through my searches on the internet made so simple   i can have multiple windows open with no lagging happening   i can leave my games open in a different window if i forget to close one it is there when i log back in   i just love it      
114,2.0,                       i was hoping this surface would replace my ipad with one major feature being listening to podcasts  on the ipad  i listened at double speed or more  on the surface  the echo is so bad that i can t even listen at single speed without dealing with an echo the touch screen isn t as sensitive as my ipad s touch was and gestures don t seem to work  either  this isn t as important to me  but it was a disappointment on the other hand  the keyboard case is nice      
115,2.0,                       i have bought new surface pro but having issue in browsing or opening any application significant slowness and internet speed always show slow while in other device with same network it works fine also i got blue screen     times in   days  don t know issue with this device or other feel same      
116,5.0,                       very light and flexible      
117,5.0,                       love it  it s our only laptop and still easy to undock and use as tablet only     
118,3.0,                       i was a user of a surface pro   i     gb  gbram and really loved it  i used it for more than   years  i decided to reinvest in a new surface pro   i     gb   gbram  first thing i noticed  it is slower than the previous one  which is ok since the processor runs slower normally to save battery life and boosts when needed  there comes the problem  it becomes hot  normal hot  but noticeable  and super noisy  a noisy cooler is started almost everytime you are using the computer for office  navigation  etclast but not least  after two months of normal use  the microsoft keyboard case stopped working with my pro    i switched back to the pro   and it worked perfectly  i then contacted microsoft and they said that it is a known issue and they will replace my laptop  but i live abroad  so i will have to wait for   months till i travel to us  good customer service though  but the product quality is way below the surface pro   series      
119,5.0,                       amazing pc  just bear in mind that the i  will get hot  a little bit uncomfortable   specially on summer days  otherwise  this fan less i  is incredibly fast  and win    shows how much it s actually built for devices like this  although i had to fiddle around quite some time to get the desired size of all my apps       
120,5.0,                       i love everything about this device  i    dont hesitate to buy    its great  specially for note taking  netflix  media  etc  i also use it for photoshop  lightroom and even  k video editing but i try to keep all that pretty basic  i only use it for that when im not near my main computers      
121,4.0,                       the battery life is too short     
122,2.0,                       very very very bad battery life for a last generation portable  dont expect more than   hours  tried all types of configurations  searched online  hardware problem       cant recommend     
123,2.0,                       just received it  everything else seems to be fine except for the intense heat  it burns my hand when it is being charged and also when i am performing not so intensive tasks such as installing ms office  even my   year old thinkpad laptop with dual os is not that hot when it is working                                                 update about   weeks later  i started to get the random shutdown issue  the screen simply went completely dark when i was reading a pdf document  and all running programs were terminated after rebooting  tried getting help from amazon product support and was told to reset the device to its factory settings  after the reset  the random shutdown seems to have gone away  will post another update if it comes back later                                                 update the random shut down problem persisted despite all efforts  arranged for a return after a   hour talk with amazon customer service and microsoft  they have been understanding and helpful  but overall it is still a distressing experience  be prepared for this issue if you are interested in the surface pro series  since according to the microsoft community  similar issues have happend to surface pro         and        
124,5.0,                       i did a lot of research and decided on the surface pro based on the professional reviews i had read   it has exceeded my expectations in terms of user friendliness   tightness   and overall performance      
125,5.0,                       what can i say   its the tablet described  shipped fast  what i expected is what i got      
126,5.0,                       love the microsoft surface  battery life could be a little better but overall i love this tablet      
127,5.0,                       love this device  super easy to port around with the ability to work on this      capacity  battery last more than   hours without charging       hours longer than my laptop  screen is wonderful      
128,2.0,                       love the surface itself but this does not come with the typecover which was a big deal since i chose the surface for the laptop to tablet capabilities  otherwise i would have just bought a tablet      
129,1.0,                       i purchased the microsoft surface pro   i began receiving error messages almost immediately while working in word documents and emails   the tablet shuts down in the middle of a project   i am unable to retrieve and resume where i left off before the error message and shut down   i have been working with microsoft technical support for over a month   each time i have been told this action would correct the problem   none of the actions have resolve the problem   i requested a replacement with a new surface pro    since the tablet is less than two months old   i am now told the tablet had to be requested within    days   i am penalized for trusting the technical support advice and continually working  in good faith  with technical support   buyers be ware      
130,1.0,                       i purchased a surface last august  eight months later the computer wasn t working  it became sluggish opening pages and there was a significant lag whenever i typed  both on email and in word docs  i switched out the keypad  checked batteries  and followed the troubleshooting guidelines from microsoft  nothing worked  but because the computer was still under warranty  i was able to send it back for a new one  the new machine arrived  and once again the same problems persist  on a brand new machine  something is wrong with this model  i have never had trouble like this before  online articles suggest that many people are running into this problem with surface computers  my advice  stick to dell or apple or some other known quantity  microsoft made a lemon  buyer beware      
131,1.0,                       this thing is trash   battery life is beyond terrible  i ve had it less than a week and it has crashed every time i use it  i ve had to hard reset   times  cameras suck and forget about the face recognition  going back to an ipad      
132,2.0,                       i want to address the cpu  it has great potential  but all the potential in the world is useless when in practice  it isn t realized that s exactly the case of this surface pro    on paper  it s great  but in practice  it falls on its face  cancelling any benefits of its newer hardware its i      g  throttles at      in over two decades of working with computers  i have never had a cpu throttle in my life before this surface pro    never   do you know what that throttling at     means  it means that you don t get to use all the processor s power  you have lower headroom my toshiba satellite p    s puny i      m from       even with a dirty fan and the old thermal paste that has never been replaced since then  can effortlessly run the same project in fl studio    that chokes the surface pro    never going past      and being able to reach      when necessary on the other hand  while this new surface pro   has a way faster  way newer    years  i      g   it can t run that project my older  slower laptop can  it overloads earlier with twice the core count and the higher ipc  that is pathetic the i  on my s     is  not exaggerating  an antique in technology years  a total relic  yet runs windows    perfectly and performs better than the surface pro   on fl studio    with stock plugins  which are cpu efficient why would i further test it  when it falls on its face with a light load the i      g  is a good cpu   if it s cooled properly  the thin  fanless design of this surface pro   hinders all its great potential  it s a good looking design  but it s a compromise on the performance such compromise makes this computer totally useless for any power use   you know   for using the cpu s capability in all its entirety  as it was designed to be used  it s microsoft s fault  not intel s  they decided to release a gelded product even though the design hasn t changed for years  it s laziness there is no getting around the fact that the passive cooling of the surface pro   will never let the cpu fully stretch its wings i will probably return it  it s just a paper weight if it s employed for anything other than light use i bought it to replace my old toshiba  well  that ain t happening tweaking the power options yields even worse performance  meaning  this design is running on the edge  it s as good as it can get  and that s not good edit  i ended up returning it  i used the refund money to order an amd ryzen       x on amazon  along with other parts to build a new computer  not portable  but it s a total beast of a system for  k video editing in davinci resolve  god bless      
133,1.0,                       no where near as good as the surface pro    and that s an understatement  since i ve this model i ve had to reinstall windows    six times so far  once it completely lost the battery information in the taskbar  just yesterday it ran the july      update and killed my outlook    uninstalled and reinstalled office    finally had to wipe windows and start over to get outlook back  windows         update is not even available for this model yet   i ve had my surface pro   and   upgraded for two months now   microsoft messed up big time on this pos  the pens aren t compatible  at least the power supplies are compatible  the only good thing is this has usb c    too bad the rest of it is undependable        
134,1.0,                       glitchy  full of bugs  could not even perform basic functions without freezing      
135,5.0,                       the battery life is longer than my original surface but i expected more  otherwise  it is exactly what i wanted     
136,2.0,                       i bought the surface pro   because i needed a small  portable computer for dedicated use in data acquisition  aside from software and driver updates  this computer never sees the internet  it is tricked out as much as possible in speed  ram and storage the first problem i encountered is that when the machine starts getting hot  the first thing it does is throttle back the usb  a camera that i use runs at     frames per second when the computer starts up but after getting warm the usb can barely manage    fps  sometimes less  the usb  connection was one of the main reasons why i chose the computer  i have found that keeping ice packs behind the computer keeps the usb running at full speed  but that puts a bit of a crimp on the portability of the device  many measurements are made in the field so i have to freeze packs and carry them along with the rest of the gear i have persistent usb connectivity issues and the single usb port the computer provides allows the connector to wiggle a good bit  it doesn t give you the feeling of a solid connection the next problem that i encountered was the disappearing cursor  the surface is a tablet and it thinks that you want to touch the screen for control  so sometimes it gets very confused about whether or not to display a mouse cursor  but some of my programs don t accept touch screen input so i have a keyboard connected  always  for input  still  the surface will hide the cursor at random times  this is a well known problem but microsoft s only answer is to reboot the computer   not a great idea in the middle of a data acquisition run at times  i try to log on and the password type in box is not visible  there simply is no way to log on to the computer  rebooting doesn t help  this is also a known issue  the solution requires hard booting the computer  with the power switch  three times consecutively to activate a recovery screen as you can see  aside from what i consider a low quality usb connector  i have been able to find workarounds for the challenges presented by the computer  but i was expecting better reliability for a machine that set me back a couple grand  and if i lose a data run because i can t control the computer  that data set  along with the time involved  is lost for good  it is extremely frustrating at times      
137,3.0,                       dislikes  little laggy  microsoft need to improve the software so it can compeit with other tables  dead pixel  the screen quality not good and windows tests size not fit for this type of screen sizes likes  light weight and small size  easy during transportation  affordable price      
138,2.0,                       had this thing for a month  already having display issues and having to send it in for repair  wish i went with something else   i sent this dialing unit back with all accessories  like microsoft instructed  and then received a replacement device   without a power cable or keyboard or box manual  etc    so i ve had this replacement for days and still have no idea if it works because i can t turn the damn thing on   nice      
139,2.0,                       i had the surface pro   before this one and still worked great  decided to upgrade to   since i was starting med school  the first day i used it gave me a blue screen  i ignored it and blamed it on the hdmi adapter but every now and then i still get them it heats up a lot  if i have my online class it will heat up tremendously and start getting very slow to the point i can t even work with it the touch screen is nice  the surface pencil works great and i haven t had any problems with it while drawing on onenote battery life is awful  every     hours while studying i have to charge it in conclusion  my surface pro   works better  except for the surface pen   touch screen      
140,4.0,                       so far i am really liking this surface  i got exactly what was ordered  new and sealed in the box  it was easy to set up and so far seems pretty snappy  the screen is great and i love the type cover  battery life seems good  maybe not exactly as long as they claim  if i had to complain about one thing  it s  the useless face recognition which has not worked even one time  i hope to figure out how to disable it because it really does not work at all  overall  i am really happy with the tablet      
141,1.0,                       this tablet is being returned due to the dismal battery life        as a    year it professional i loaded this tablet up with my professional software and other typical programs  the battery time is totally unacceptable getting only around   to      hours of usage out of it max  the battery time that microsoft advertises is      hours but there is no way to even get close to that number for the average professional user  it is a shame that microsoft has a very nice product but their battery is a complete failure  myself and a colleague wasted several days trying every option to get better battery performance even contacting microsoft  they offered nothing but lip service knowing what they offered was worthless and their advertised battery time was a complete lie  turning off all background apps and other utilities is not a solution microsoft to get a few more minutes  beware before you waste you time only to realize the battery is going to be an issue  thankfully i was able to return it thru amazon or i would have been stuck with a substandard product      
142,2.0,                       i m returning the surface pro   to amazon due to randomly freezing issue with my unit and ask for a refund  done the troubleshooting with microsoft tech support  unfortunately issue still occurs even after resetting the unit  a bit disappointed with my experience considering this is my first surface device and had to deal with this issue considering that i paid to    dollars to ship this device from u s to qatar  hope this doesn t happen to other customers update i gave the surface pro   a chance  i didnt return the unit to amazon  was hoping a software update will fix the issue  i still experience from time to time the random freezing of the touchpad  just want to clarify only touchpad freezes  keyboard is working and system is responding i have   years warranty from microsoft website on the machine if on the  st year freezing still occurs ill send it for repairupdate  for the past   months of using it  my sp  is free from the trackpad issue  not sure which update or firmware version i installed that fixed it  i just installed all updates from microsoft   will continue to update if i experience the issue again     
143,4.0,                       it gets too hot when it gets down      battery life   i never got the cover for the keyboard     
144,4.0,                       there are a few annoyances with this product those being lack of thunderbolt    limited screen real estate coupled with big bezels and the biggest gripe of all being poor battery life compared to the competition  hp  dell and lenovo  now if you use the sp  indoors with the brightness set to around     then you can get at least       hours of battery which is average but not great  but if you use this outdoors or in a brightly lit area then you re forced to up the brightness which will kill the battery in around       hours  i found myself reaching for the charger     times in the day other than that the product is great  so far   if you re a student or a person who frequently views pdfs and word documents then the form factor is perfect  the sp  is also part of intel project athena making it quick and easy to log in and get work started for the day overall it s a good product but if you re someone who s not going to benefit from using this as a tablet regularly  you re better off getting another laptop i will update this review if i find any other issues ps  if you re an artist or some kind of digital illustrator  get an ipad pro over this product  there are several reviews online that complain about the line inaccuracy of the surface pen      
145,5.0,                       best laptop ever honestly the device arrived as described  intact and fully functional the form factor  the screen and the writting experience on this device is unique  it feels like witting on an actual paper and with the keyboard you get a kickass laptop i got the i  model  and i feel like it gets hot fast      
146,5.0,                       love it   this is my  rd surface     
147,5.0,                       generally  surface pro   make my life easy   light weight   fast   good battery  my usage   browsing   multimedia    office apps     
148,1.0,                       sent us the wrong color   ordered platinum and received the      cheaper black   certain keys on keyboard did not work   making customers pay for return shipping      
149,3.0,                       can t say i ve been blown away by the experience  it s a beautiful device but a bit overpriced if you ask me  details below     preface  if you love fiddling with your device constantly   this is the one for you  if you prefer something a bit more pick up and go   try the surface laptop  or laptops in general   so  take my criticism with a grain of salt as i m openly admitting to preferring laptops or any device that is all one piece  note  i purchased the    gb version with an alcantara poppy red type cover   pen battery life  it wasn t great but that s a non issue for me since they ve introduced usbc  i have usbc chargers everywhere   what did bother me was the fact that i was constantly managing the performance vs  battery saver mode and feel that microsoft should optimize the os to smartly take care of this without my intervention  you ll notice the system quickly becomes jankier once the power source is removed  even after messing with these settings  performance  it s great while plugged in or not while using energy saver settings  it could even handle some light gaming using emulators that i d installed  there were a few weird bugs where the tablet would go black for a few seconds after working on an external display  but i think that was a fluke  the device does get very  very hot so keep that in mind  i m not sure if leaving fans out of the i  model was a good idea  i will say there s something magical about plopping such a thin tablet down on your desk and having it connect to all your monitors with ease  especially if you use the surface dock but that s another          if i were microsoft  i d copy the nintendo switch and make a less expensive surface dock     that allows the tablet to be set into it   giving you a no fuss desktop workstation instantly screen  it s bright and beautiful  but extremely reflective  this seems like a silly issue but after day to day use it becomes frustrating  i greatly missed the anti glare coating that s present on my other devices  it also gets hot against my palm while taking notes storage  expandable storage is nice and allows for microsd cards   something that s lacking on the surface laptop  seriously  why is this only present on surface pros    this feature makes getting the smaller ssd not such a bad idea since my    gb card only cost me     and doubled my storage accessories  i love the surface pen and how superior it is to the apple pencil  it may not be quite as accurate but my handwriting is significantly better given the way they ve manufactured the tip  the apple pencil on the other hand feels like i m scraping a plastic toothpick against glass     horrible  also love the eraser  surface type cover is fantastic and adds much needed functionality to the device  the keys are an absolute joy to type on and the material is soft and deliciously luxurious  you can use your older type covers or buy a new one like i did  my only complaint is that i found myself fiddling with the folding unfolding of this cover and the kickstand constantly and i think this just might be my inclination towards laptops   and not a problem with the device itself  lastly  the trackpad was a bit too small vertically apps software  it s      ok  this area is easily my biggest gripe with the device  i was able to find most of what i use on a day to day basis but there s quite a few missing from the microsoft store  luckily the surface pro   offers a desktop class experience so you can install   exe programs like bluestacks to gain access to android apps and the like  keep in mind your battery life will tank running heavy programs like this  i m a bit peeved that an office subscription doesn t come with this considering its premium microsoft hardware  if you do get a subscription to office      then they need to make it more obvious because i could not figure out how to redeem it  it s also strange that they have default windows apps like mail which cannibalizes outlook  choices are nice  but wouldn t it be smarter to give your surface users the superior software which may in turn garner more subscribers  tablet mode is lacking polish which is the status quo for windows  the icons are poorly optimized    tiny and hard to hit with your fingers  menus seem to pop out at random due to bad palm rejection  i found myself tapping on something     times just to get it to open or activate  not sure if the screen is defective or if the os is just too laggy to register my touch  yes  there are touch gestures such as swiping from the left to show all apps or swiping down to close    but these aren t fully fleshed out and the system would constantly freeze stutter if i used them  i m a bit surprised that microsoft has not perfected this given the length of time their surface line   which is primarily a tablet   has been on the market  i want to say that even windows   tablet mode was smoother but maybe that s my imagination     just keep in mind you re purchasing a pc with the option of being a crappy tablet  side note  the bluetooth and wifi chips on this device are miles ahead of anything apple is offering in conclusion  i decided the surface pro   just wasn t for me and may end up going with a surface laptop  this is due to the fact that the price        for all required accessories that i d need  didn t match the overall package  software is still very unrefined in tablet mode  apps are lacking  performance is just okay  and i think the annoyance of so many moving parts   software drama  folding unfolding kickstand   flappy type cover   pen that would fall off at times   poor palm rejection or general software bugs  just contributed to the frustration of the device   i just want something that is wholly solid and can be used without much fuss   thus why i prefer to sacrifice any hopes of sticking with this crappy tablet experience and move on      
150,5.0,                       upgraded from a surface    stylus and touch screen work great for making notes on pdfs  everything runs nice and smooth  i m happy with the surface       
151,5.0,                       love how convenient it is and easy to use but as soon as the screen locks it sometimes disconnect from the wifi i have to restart it a lot to get it back connected      
152,5.0,                       very pleased  mine came with the keyboard  shipped and arrived a week ahead of schedule very happy      
153,5.0,                       i purchased this product for my son for college and he loves it  i would recommend to all      
154,3.0,                       pictures does not fill whole screen and effective screen is much smallercamera quality is very poor and resolution only      and pictures quality inferior  night vision pictures no qualityi have surface   it is not much different and may be inferior may be it s that  i do not use exotic features that it has as i am not technically savvy     
155,5.0,                       excelente computer     
156,5.0,                       bought this as a christmas gift  it was a big hit and a great product      
157,1.0,                       the windows    home that comes installed on the device is not actually installed  so that is a full lie be prepared to pay      plus to get to use your surface even though the add says it come with windows         
158,3.0,                       not sure where  but i think that somewhere between the charging driver and the port there is an issue that prevents the device from charging   possibly after some time spent charging   not sure about that part   i am on my  nd device with the same issue   cord seats and lights  device doesn t recognize it or charge seeing other reports of similar issues on other sites hope there is a fix  it is a beautiful  easy to use device   although on occasion i found the touch screen a tab too sensitive   i d launch something with what felt like a hover not a tap to me  i wanted to love it   sketchbook is fantastic in my opinion and the display is gorgeous   streaming movies or whatever   makes me sad  c mon bill      
159,5.0,                       i was a little concerned about liking this   haven t worked on a      inch screen and need enough power to have mulltiple microsoft and some adobe applications open at same time   i was delighted to see this is a small  lightweight  powerhouse    sharp looking  great ergonomics and keyboard and stunning display   the i  version with   gb ram is ample and it is highly responsive and fast   even in comparison to my heavy duty i  laptop   a bit pricey   but in this case you get what you pay for   i am very pleased     
160,1.0,                       upon receiving the tablet and booting it up i noticed a strange flicker on the top   inches of the screen it was cold outside when they delivered  so i thought maybe it just needed to warm up after an hour of use the flicker got worse i contacted amazon support about the issue and they said they would send a replacement unit right away   says later and still waiting for them to approve the replacement      
161,5.0,                       this was my best gift for the holidays   roars from the nay sayers  and this silences them      
162,4.0,                       touch screen isn t good as ipad  keyboard and touchpad are worst  battery isn t long as advertise  only last     hours on zoom meeting  the only good on this device is the windows    os  if not for it  it s totally trash      
163,2.0,                       overall very fast and sleek tablet  sometimes it will get hot when running multiple applications  ex autocad and adobe photoshop  was very disappointed when i saw the black bezel had small  distinctive scratches on the bottom  i think they came from the shipping process since the box was slightly damaged when received      
164,5.0,                       best portable all in one device  all around      
165,1.0,                       i own surface book   and sp  and bought this one for the   th gen cpu boost and the usb c  however there are two main issues    the battery life is quite bad     hours real work on     brightness    there really isn t any speed boost because the sp  i  version throttles like crazy  especially to save battery at      battery level  it throttle up to around    ghz and all the way to    mhz      
166,2.0,                       i bought a new surface pro    actually from best buy  not amazon  and ended up taking it back and exchanging it because the screen brightness kept changing randomly  the next one had the same issue  it turns out it is because of an intel graphics setting you can t actually change because the microsoft version of the driver doesn t allow you to use intel s control panel  i spent hours figuring out how to fix that  but there are so many other bugs i m going to return it anyway  i ll provide a list of the other issues i ve had so far    wifi won t use  ghz unless i go into setting and disable    ghz    the on screen keyboard occasionally decides not to enter any text  hitting buttons does nothing  have to restart for it to work again    the surface dock display output goes blank for     seconds every   minutes or so    it won t detect my external monitors via usb c at all    it won t detect and connect to my hotspot without me changing the password on the hotspot  forgetting the connection in the surface  and manually reconnecting  not sure if it s the surface s fault if my iphone  but no other device i ve used the hotspot with has had that problem    faceid  or windows hello or whatever it s called  has entirely given up  says it can t turn the camera on every time now    i can t adjust screen brightness anymore  only shows two levels and neither actually do anything i think i m going to get a lenovo x  tablet instead  i wanted to love the surface  but it is so glitchy i can t stand using it      
167,5.0,                    excelente producto  la mejor tablet laptop que he comprado         
168,1.0,                       there was no type cover as advertised and the seller wouldn t resolve this when i contacted them  the tablet itself seems okay so far but i had to buy my own type cover and the seller only refunded me fifteen dollars      
169,1.0,                       amazon is the seller of all products not the manufacturer   otherwise its bs business  bought a surface pro   for            days later the screen doesn t work and amazon doesn t honer a return  claiming its longer than    days   microsoft then determines it s a manufactured defect which entitles me to a used test pro   that they had laying around  and not a new pro     don t buy amazon computer products  just send a check to china or buy from someone else   and never buy microsoft      
170,5.0,                       pro  is basically the best laptop and tablet combined  the picture quality is absolutely amazing  the keyboard has a great feel to it and it sounds amazing the battery life is good  not sure what people complain about  on a big screen   d sound and powering a fast  k device i totally like this thing      
171,1.0,                       i have owned this surface for just under    days   it sat  on an end table in my living room and what can be described as light use   its now totally dead and all of the holding down of the power button for    seconds or    seconds does nothing   this is my third surface model and they all seem to die in a year      
172,5.0,                       i wanted something that i could reliably use adobe premiere and lightroom on  but also casually use tablet style wow  what a marvelous machine in either laptop or tablet form  it s been a few weeks and i m still head over heels as a new surface user will update should all the glitters not be gold     
173,2.0,                       my it department warned me not to buy a surface despite its appealing features because they are unreliable   nonsense  i thought  thousands of people are using them  so they must work  right   wrong   my surface crashes constantly in zoom when using the pen  especially since the windows    version      update   just draw a bunch of lines on the whiteboard and erase them and watch it crash   i ve already replaced the device and spent hours with ms tech support and my own it department and nothing helps   usually just the display resets  but other times the whole machine freezes and requires a hard reboot   either way it s completely unreliable   maybe someday an update will fix the problem  but who knows   it s a shame because it would otherwise be a great upgrade to my surface pro    which works fine update   the kb        update says  we fixed an issue that causes a device to stop responding after you have been using a pen for several hours    i ran into the problem a lot faster than that but now it may be fixed   zoom       fixed the display resetting with hardware acceleration  although the pen resolution is worse    so a year after it was released  this device may now be usable   the hardware is actually quite nice when it works      
174,5.0,                       surface pro   i    gig memory     storage  loving it so far      
175,5.0,                       i bought the surface pro   for work and i am very happy with the ease of use  additionally  i got a great package and it arrived early  win win      
176,5.0,                       nice ms surface   with high protection to the shipment      
177,5.0,                       outstanding performance and feature rich   i don t need such a capable device but i m happy to have it    gb ram     gb ssd core i       
178,5.0,                       love the surface pro    i finally decided to switch to microsoft from apple and i don t regret it once  it s so convenient to being with me everywhere plus it works great as a tablet and a laptop  so far i really love my purchase      
179,1.0,                       absolute garbage  cursor will randomly stop moving  updates without permission  randomly shuts down apps while im using them and dosent save progress  i use this for art and writing  and i cant tell you the amount of times i have wanted to throw this stupid thing at the wall

183,5.0,                       great computer  functions as a laptop with a     bluetooth mouse  g or ram is more than enough for my basic needs  very fast i had and ipad pro   but without a mouse  trackpad  or usb port  i needed an actual laptop in addition      
184,3.0,                       bought it last september  it s now february and the charger has stopped working  i sent a message to the sellers so let s see how that plays out  other than that it s an amazing tool definitely recommend  especially if you re looking for a sleek easy to travel laptop  my daughter is in university and it s the perfect fit      
185,2.0,                       unit had a memory problem that kept causing a stop code crash and reboot  could not find a solution and suspect defective memory  the problem may be specific to this unit and not necessarily to the product line      
186,5.0,                       love the touch screen and the set up aid was easy to follow      
187,1.0,                       i bought this product and it broke as soon as i charged it the first time  i was expecting to be refunded within a few days but it s been nearly two weeks without refund  can someone help me      
188,5.0,                       good     
189,5.0,                       i love this laptop  i have never owned a surface pro before and now i am hooked  i love the ease of sitting on the couch with it or moving it to the table or bed  the touch screen is accurate when i draw and the battery is decent  this is my favorite laptop i have owned  i opted for the payment plan and that is going well  too  thanks      
190,5.0,                       i am so glad i bought this  easy to use  lightweight  and the screen is very clear and easy to work with   i love having a touch screen  too    perfect for home and work     
191,1.0,                       i wanted to like it  but unfortunately the network issues are making this computer very unreliable  suddenly the network card stops responding  and it makes the mobility part of the table laptop almost useless  because i have to watch out and see if when i disconnect the power cord or something else  to take it from my office to downstairs  the network is still there or whether i have to start troubleshooting it  often rebooting it and closing all my open apps  anything can trigger it  from disconnecting the power cord  taking keyboard off  monitor cable  etc  playing with the power saving mode settings of the network card sometimes work  and to my understanding that is the issue  starts working again about as random as it stopped i recently purchased a wifi usb dongle  to see if i can get around it  but that means i will have this usb port occupied    when i could ve used it for an external mouse  i hope microsoft and intel can make this work  but until then my   star review will stay      
192,2.0,                       expect to restart your device every time you want to use headphones      
193,5.0,                       microsoft surface pro gets even better    the only disadvantage is    you need extra bucks for the apps    otherwise good to have it    portability is out of the question     
194,1.0,                       item came with a cracked screen returned it now being charged a restocking fee     
195,2.0,                       had to return mine   tried to use it with an audio interface and the current drivers don t support hat very well   lots of drop outs and latency      
196,5.0,                       very nice screen      
197,2.0,                       from the first look i didn t like it  yetthis is not a complete review because it came without the advertised keyboard  so  i called and returned it immediately it was already hot in the short time i used it i will not buy it again p sdidn t test the battery  but i wasn t able to submit the review without rating it      
198,2.0,                       why would you buy this machine  it looks cool  it is small and light weight  it seems to be well put together   cool is important  but        with case  pen and taxes  is a lot  my only  real  complaint is that the screen will suddenly go out of focus  microsoft techs said   uh  uh  uh   there are many machines at      to      that will do more  i have a surface    i would not buy it again  save      and look elsewhere      
199,1.0,                       the product itself is decent  it s not perfect  but i m not going to pretend the hardware itself is deserving of a   star rating  my concern is microsoft s inability or unwillingness to provide support  which absolutely obliterated my view of their brand i bought this product as part of bundle at a warehouse store  and within   months  i experienced two failures  first  my surface pen stopped working  the microsoft official one  not a  rd party device   after   hours     chatting with their service team  they finally decided to ship me a new one  but only after i sent back  and they received  the non working one  i have no problem returning the old unit  but most companies at least ship the replacement immediately so you re not stuck waiting longer  so that irritated me a bit  but no big deal in my mind less than a week after the surface pen quit working  the whole device stopped booting up  i believe it was a faulty windows security update that did it  the hardware s likely fine  but i needed to contact support to get the thing working again  however  contacting support has been an absolute disaster  i have now attempted over a dozen times in   days to reach someone   anyone   who can help me resolve this issue  and i ve gotten nowhere  the surface support team has been completely unresponsive  providing nothing but an automated message stating they re not open despite my calling exclusively during the hours they state they re offering service  i also tried windows support  and while i finally did get a rep to attempt to help me reinstall windows  the chat cut off in the middle of the process and now every time i attempt to connect to support at all  it just says i m connected but doesn t give me any representative to speak to on several other occasions i got to their first level support agents  whose role is to direct inquiries to the correct department  and they ve also been completely unable to connect me with anyone who can help  at this point  i am completely unable to contact anyone at any level  and microsoft has done absolutely nothing to resolve this issue  my device is well within the warranty period  and since this is most likely a software issue  fixing it shouldn t even cost them anything  so i don t understand what the issue is i have also made it clear to ms support that this is my primary work computer  and i have now been completely unable to use it for   days and counting  i am a very  very patient customer and rarely complain  but i am so thoroughly dissatisfied with my experience that i felt the need to share it with other potential customers because of microsoft s evident disregard for their customers  i will be returning my device to the store and replacing it with a product from a more responsive company  i have also filed a formal complaint with the better business bureau in the hope that this experience will be heard and addressed by microsoft for future customers      
200,1.0,                       it s a nice design and initially loved it  but after a short time it became nothing but trouble wifi constant disconnects  and then out of nowhere after some  updates  it was bricked in the horrible  preparing automatic repair  loop microsoft support is not helpful at all  will never buy another one      
201,5.0,                       great product  i look forward to loading my sheet music as pdf files and using the screen while i play the piano      
202,5.0,                       just about what i expected  very good quality  boots up very quickly  excellent video quality  thin and sleek so far i have used it for zoom meetings      
203,5.0,                       love the surface pro  i used a   for work  so we decided on this one after reading lots of tech reviews  product order came new  we did have to purchase microsoft office  but at least got a    day trial to begin  minimal bloatware and easy to setup      
204,1.0,                       fraud        
205,1.0,                       awful  slow  my      macbook is faster  don t get this computer      
206,5.0,                       our  nd surface pro   heavily used in our household   everything from school work to shopping to games   versatile and stable      
207,5.0,                       loved every minute on this surface  the mobility of it makes it a godsend      
208,4.0,                       great product by microsoft    but battery is a fail     how i wish it really reach   hrs     
209,5.0,                       suits my needs perfectly   needs to travel light  have a keyboard for doing real work  a tablet without a keyboard is nearly pointless    as for some of the most common criticisms i read before buying  bezel too large   no  the bezel is perfect   you need a bezel of decent size to actually use a tablet like a tablet  otherwise you will accidentally activate the touchscreen   this love affair with screens going to the edge is like the popular open floor plan in houses   looks great on a tour  but in real life is mostly terrible when you suddenly hear pots  pans  and dishes clanging in the kitchen echoing through the entire level of the house   you need a bezel for a tablet  period  without one  or having one that is too small  you cannot use a tablet properly  battery life    how long do you really need a battery to last   i can use the tablet on and off throughout the day without worrying about a charge   charge it once a day  overnight  unless you plan to use it all day for streaming video conferences   you can t expect to not have to charge a device for     days the touchscreen works tremendously well  the keyboard attachment is just perfect  backlit buttons are an essential item to have on any keyboard on a notebook  only complaint is that i wish the power cord had a slightly stronger magnet  it seems a little bit too easy to accidentally knock out if your needs are similar to mine  this will be a great device for you  if they are not  it may not be as good of a fit for you  but it is hard to fault the design of the product      
210,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          been anything but happy with this laptop  first of all battery life is horrendously low and can barely manage to finish up homework without having to charge it  secondly  i have a terrible glitching screen at startup  it s been replaced by microsoft twice but for        this laptop is not a decent product  i even attached a video to show what my new surface does  it s incredible that microsoft has me do all this trouble shooting then ultimately knows there s nothing possible to fix this        
211,5.0,                       purchased for my wife and she loves it  everything she expected and more      
212,5.0,                       i updated my surface pro    and it s an improvement in speed  specially in face recognition  windows hello   great recomendation at this point  the power brick should be removed  it may not be too big  but unconfortable to carry      
213,5.0,                       best purchase i made si far     
214,5.0,                       i cannot stress how amazing the surface pro is for creativity  i used to have an ipad pro but when the battery died i decided to try this out  this versiin comes with a keyboard but you will have to get a stylus separately and trust me the surface pro stylus is the one you want  the knock off brands won t stay magnetized to the side and will get lost within two days i ve had laptops and i ve had tablets  having the functionality of both is amazing  it comes with microsoft white board and microsoft to   do  i use the white board to make bubble graphs to get organized then typing it up into a to do which has an app i can download on my phone so i always know my schedulebattery as you re using it lasts around   hours  but standby doesn t drain nearly at all i originally got this for on the go editing  and for smaller scenes it works great  but owing   gb ram can t handle bigger stuff  not a deal breaker at all tbh  it handles     p footage just fine using sony vegasyou can also use this for song recording  i use presonus and i can t tell you how nice it is to be able to record and look at google docs for lyrics on the same device  one gripe about programs that monopolize the surface pro s audio device  you may have to disable the speaker temporarily to get the audio to come through headphones  bluetooth or otherwise i haven t tried gaming on this  but tbh i probably will actively avoid that because i love having this as a creative work station the keypad is surprisingly comfortable to write on on just about any angle  which i ve never been able to say about any laptop i ve had  being able to flip the keyboard back to aid in being a kickstand and not worrying about keyboard presses is nice as wellso yeah  stylus is amazing for creativity  being able to record  write  and edit all on the same device that fits on a music stand   priceless
