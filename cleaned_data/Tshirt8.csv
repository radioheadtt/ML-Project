0,5.0,                       needed a few free quickly  fit was pretty good  no problems      
1,5.0,                       i ordered two t shirts  different colors  they re beefy  not the thin fabric  the grey one was slightly large  i wear xl  tall  which is perfect  the chocolate colored one was identical but just fit  it s actually a little tight  but  they re      cotton  an undersight on my part  i should have gone with  xl to allow for shrinkage      
2,1.0,                       this shirt came with a pocket and does not work for the screen printing as intended  the photographed item did not have a pocket  will have to rush order from another company      
3,5.0,                       perfect softness  comfortable  nice fit      
4,2.0,                       initially i liked this shirt right out of the packaging  one wash later  it shrank a lot and looked really worn  i wanted as a simple outter t shirt  if you decide to take a chance on it as an undershirt  make sure you get one size up      
5,5.0,                       i bought these as a gift for an adult grandson  he s    thin but muscular with a small waist  he s very long waisted and i m always worried any shirt i buy will be too short  these are form fitting but not tight and long enough to go below the navel  he loves them so i m get him a few more soon      
6,5.0,                       great t shirt  great color and great fit  this t shirt is the  beefy  type and is a little heavier      
7,5.0,                       i ordered these in      for christmas gifts for my husband  he loves them   my recent order is for a friend who needed t shirts and he loves them  so what can i say       guarantee just an fyi  my sizing is based on a looser fit t shirt since both my husband and friend like theirs a bit loose      
8,1.0,                       i ve bought several hanes  beefy  t shirts in the past but this one is definitely fishy   the tag an logos are all different  much more simple  and not printed on the shirt   it came with two actual old style tags   the stitching is definitely different from the pictures and not as reinforced as the real thing   the material is close to the same thickness but this is not what i expected   see the attached pic      
9,2.0,                       color on this product is nowhere near the smoke gray color that you receive from hanes or other vendors   this appears to be some sort of second product  the fit is decent but if you re expecting the dark smoke gray  you ll be disappointed  this one is more of a steel gray  i would avoid and look for this product from other sellers      
10,5.0,                       bought this to match our christmas pj s  fits as expected  thick and durable      
11,5.0,                       this shirt fits exact size and the length is just below the belt line  not too short  not too long      
12,3.0,                       i love me some beefy ts so when i saw them on here i decided to pick up a couple in smoke gray color size l   after a single wash i feel like they lost about  inches in length   not sure what s up with the sizing as i always wear a size l    as others have suggested on here i d advise going  size up from your normal size   i m going to order an xl and see if i can get more length that way   btw i m not super tall   about      and the l was short      
13,1.0,                       bought two shirts and same exact problem with both  first wear and there was already a hold in one of the armpits  i sew so i was able to correct the issue but after it was washed again the other armpit seem split  the shirt was worn both times for less than an hour  the quality is shotty at best and seem to be shirts that didn t pass hanes inspection and should have been pitched into the trash  disappointed would be an understatement      
14,1.0,                       looks like quality control problems with the country of origin   the smoke grey is coming from ethiopia so be forewarned   i also bought the deep forest color recently and there s no comparison   substantially thicker and from a different country      
15,3.0,                       this is a fitted shirt  i m       slim with broad shoulders  the shirt is a bit tight across the shoulders  it is slightly tapered at the waist  and cut long  if you like to tuck in your t shirt it s good for that  as long as yer not much taller than me construction and material is very good quality  in hot humid  sweaty  weather  the cut s a bit too clingy  even for a slimster like me      
16,1.0,                       first day i wore one the stitching on the left sleeve unravelled and the hem came undone  i order a lot of these and this is the first time this has happened  yuk      
17,3.0,                       after i washed this shirt  it shrank about one size  nice shirt  butit should not shrink     
18,5.0,                       wear to work shirt  thicker so helps absorb sweat      
19,4.0,                       i ve been on the hunt for a good comfy fitting tall shirt  i am only      and    lbs   ordered the  xlt and the length is perfect  i love the extra length in a tall shirt but the  xl part is just not beefy enough for me and feels some what tight  i wear  xlt in other brands so it seems these are made for tall slender cut folks and not for us with a little bit of a gut   the search continues     
20,4.0,                       the fabric is soft  relatively thick  and very comfortable  there is none of the itchiness or stiffness that often characterizes heavily dyed material  the composition is      cotton but feels stretchy as if it contained spandex  the shirt size is a large but feels a little tight  i am        chest size      and weigh about     lbs  the collar  in particular  is a tad small  but this is still an excellent shirt for the price  glad there are no seams along the sides      
21,5.0,                       these are a good lower priced  mid weight t  softer than the last gildans g     i purchased  which were supposed to be soft  but weren t      
22,4.0,                       not a bad shirt  it s hard to find a man size shirt now a days with all the body fit cloths out there i m           lbs and do not like form fitting cloths especially when you can t bend down without your entire backside showing  i bought a  xl tall and it s not bad  it is cotton so i hang dry it to resist shrinking only downside is with any tall fitting shirt is the sleeves are too long  oh well  ya got to give   take  at least my backside isn t getting aired out for all to see        
23,2.0,                       if you normally wear a large  order an extra large  if you wear a medium  order a large  other than that  for the price  i guess it will do  probably won t order from this seller in the future though       
24,5.0,                       i am      tall and weigh     pounds shirt fits perfectly  they would be perfect for hot days to work outside   a little to heavy to wear as a undershirt    i wear them under my work uniform and it gets a little to hot      
25,1.0,                       these are either junk fakes or the ones i received are from really old stock   they have big labels hanging down your back   i have been ordering hanes beefy ts for several years and they all have the labels printed on the fabric and not tags almost as large as a dollar bill  look elsewhere for the real hanes beefy ts      
26,5.0,                       shipped quickly  and just what expected from this product     
27,1.0,                       cheap light weight  product  unlike the  old  style and quality of hanes   what a let down        
28,5.0,                       these shirts are well made  they are heavy weight  and   oz      
29,5.0,                       wasn t sure if i snagged em on sale but i managed to get a   pack of these shirts in black  xl for just    bucks  ordered about two sizes over as i wanted to use these as work shirts and the extra length was needed     
30,1.0,                       i bought this shirt to be a gift for a friend fully intending to embellish it requiring hand stitching  given it s      cotton i thought best to wash and dry it first to get initial shrinkage out of the way  after doing so in a small cold water load with other dark tees  the hanes shirt came out of the dryer with a portion of the hem undone  in requesting to get it exchanged i was told it may take two days to get a reply  when no reply came i called the number on the third party invoice  their outgoing message said leave a message and we ll reply within three days  sheesh  i then saw the fine print that said it s not returnable if washed  so i guess i m repairing the hem by hand      
31,5.0,                       had to buy red shirts because i have an iguana that is triggered by colors and red is the only color that he won t attack me in  i was able to get the shirt quickly and it s part of my daily attire while working from home  it s a perfect fit   if you typically wear large shirts  then order the large  even after washing  it fits just as described      
32,3.0,                       a little snug for sz chart but a decent quality shirt ider   sz up     
33,5.0,                       so i bought this shirt because i absolutely love the color  some of you might know it as dark olive  but for me this is a  nurgle deathguard green  shirt  it is perfect for my war hammer game days   i absolutely hate wearing logos or anything to gimmicky but this shit is nice and plain   yet high quality   hank hill would be proud   probably will be getting a few more   highly recommend      
34,5.0,                       i got this for my fiance for father s day in hopes he d get rid of another orange t shirt he s worn to death   this hanes shirt is one size up from the old one  which makes it roomier   more comfy  he loves it  now it s time for the other one to  accidentally  get lost  lol      
35,5.0,                       i have zero complaints and i m a complainer  its not made of that cheap soft girl cotton  no rayon blend thankfully  lots of color options  thick material and it doesnt shrink much  great fit      
36,2.0,                       hanes shirts are well made  with good quality cotton fabric  but like all hanes shirts  they are made for skinny people  if you are even slightly overweight  hanes shirts are pretty tight   even though i ordered an extra large  the shirt was still too tight   i am five foot  seven and two hundred twenty pounds           
37,5.0,                       this shirt worked perfect for a gift craft project for father s day  fit just as expected and great quality fabric  did not bleed when washed  would highly recommend for the price      
38,5.0,                       omg   i was so worried about placing this order because of bad experiences i ve had ordering directly thru hanes recently  but these two tee shirts are perfect   i am a huge fan of the beefy t tee shirt and always order mens xl because i prefer to wear and long  loose fitting t shirt with skinny jeans  but hate tags   the pink and blue t shirts i just received today are exactly what i ve come to expect from hanes in the past   the fast shipping was so unexpected  i m so happy right now and can t wait to wear these new t shirts      
39,5.0,                       a heavier version of the standard t    the neck doesn t get baggy     
40,1.0,                       these shirts aren t good at all  after a few washes they started to lose their color and now appear faded and dingy  they also look like the material isn t holding up at all      
41,4.0,                             bought a medium  and it s way too small  bought a large  and it fits the way a medium should  some of these  beefy tees  are tagless  but some aren t  luck of the draw  finally  they re not really beefy anymore  they re normal  if you buy a regular t shirt these days  it s probably going to be very thin and flimsy  so you have to get one of these just to get decent material  if you re looking for something extra thick though  beefy   you ll have to keep looking  overall  a decent plain t shirt for around   or   bucks      
42,5.0,                       liked the product quite well but felt the shipping charges international were a bit exorbitant   the price for the shirt was fair and had i had my purchases shipped within the us they would have qualified for free shipping with all being shipped overseas  i got hit over the head   had shipping been more reasonable i would have bought     dozen or more      
43,4.0,                       i was trying to find a loose fitting comfortable t shirt  too tight on my hips which i should have expected as a woman  i also feel this shrank just enough to make it too tight      
44,5.0,                       cute shirts  bought for      matching pjshaven t washed yet      
45,1.0,                       this shirt is very small   and does not stretch  bought and xl and usually fits loose  this was tight      
46,5.0,                       i love the feel and the quality of the shirt  now i need to find more colors      
47,3.0,                       wow  a men s small would probably fit a    year old child      
48,5.0,                       bought   of these and husband is happy  will be a repeat buyer for sure      
49,5.0,                       really well made   thicker fabric   does not fade or shrink purchase was for  x big and tall person and it fit greally well considering a  x waist   this fit below the waist and wasn t tight but has a little room to spare  i ve bought about   of them  was really pleased after i got the first shirts i ordered for my husband and have bought alit more since   at the time of purchase was a great buy and well worth the money   these are good well made shirts and should last a long time      
50,1.0,                       i ordered a t shirt in size m  which should be       inches across the chest  when i opened it  it looked much larger and i measured it  it turned out that it corresponds to the size l        inches   i m very displeased  she also has a very bad and unpleasant smell  how does amazon allow such things to be sold  i do not recommend this product         
51,1.0,                       these t shirts with the black satin label are not the true hanes beefy t s    and there is no way to tell until you receive them   they are a much trimmer fit and i find them uncomfortable   the is truly deception at it s worst   i wish i could tell you what to do    maybe only buy them from hanes directly   they are about the same price   but you will pay shipping      
52,3.0,                       i got a white tee in xl size and it turned out to be too big  however  the fabric felt heavy and better than those super thin t shirts that everybody else offers  so i ordered one in l size but in a different color  well  this time the tee is a little too small  also  the fabric is nowhere as heavy as the tee i received earlier i suspect that hanes has good intentions to offer a slightly better product but these are still mass produced in low wage factories  there seems to be inconsistency in quality and sizing  you may get lucky or you may not lastly  i recommend sticking to whites and lighter shades as the quality of dye in darker tees seems rather poor and will fade rapidly      
53,5.0,                       i wear a lady size    but wear much bigger for comfort  this tee fits the way i like  color and substantial fabric remain true after several washings  i only damp dry in the dryer  then hang to finish  love the peachy color      
54,5.0,                       these t shirts are very nice  albeit on the thick heavy side as far as material goes  they are probably best for cooler weather because of the heavy material  with that said  they are definitely a great quality and recommended  purchased for my s o  who likes them ps  they will shrink a bit after washing and drying  so be aware when choosing a size      
55,5.0,                       i am very happy with the purchase  the sleeve length is perfect as well as the overall fit and fabric quality  will buy more later in           
56,5.0,                       great looking t shirts that fit well  colorfast at a great price      
57,5.0,                       pros   nice weight  good selection of colors  great fit  low price cons   certain colors tend to shrink a half inch or so  weird and random that s it  generally happy with these shirts      
58,5.0,                       for a hanes beefy t  this was a good value for the money  since this t shirt was less expensive than the other colors   not a bad color at all if you like a nice darker green color   went back in and bought four more   that s how much i liked it      
59,5.0,                       it fits just as expected just wish it was a little shorter in length but i could tell it was going to fit long before i purchased it  i would  still buy it again     
60,5.0,                       i still have hanes beefy t shirts that are      years old and  other than being a little faded  are in good shape  these shirts are worn almost weekly and are used for yard work  hiking  etc  and hold up very well the colors and workmanship on these are excellent and the price can t be beat for such high quality      
61,5.0,                       the size ordered was medium which is a little small for me need to lose about   or    more lbs  i will make it fit  just right  with in a couple months  quality of material and stitching was great  not all  mediums  are the same size  one year and   months ago i was a  xl      
62,4.0,                       well constructed with a lightweight cotton fabric   color as pictured in amazon ad with little loss from initial washing   minimal shrinkage when washed in cold water and tumble dried on low setting   just remember to remove from the dryer while cycle is still on to avoid a wrinkly mess   excellent price   very quick delivery      
63,5.0,                       these tees are great   my hubby is a flatbed driver and gets diesel grease all over his clothes   these are durable  comfy  look great  and wash well  and you just can t beat the price i buy them over and over as they wear out      
64,5.0,                       quality fabric and that is what i bought it for  the fabric  i cut   of these shirts apart and used the fabric to make a womens cowl neck shirt      the price of buying the same fabric at the fabric store  the shirt i made from the fabric washes well with no shrinkage or fading      
65,2.0,                       material is very poor and low quality  i always wear medium but this is too small for me   most likely a small size with the m tag  definitely they are not beefy  i do not recommend these shirts at all  but amazon act quickly and refunded my money even without returning my the product upon realized i didn t like the item  thank you amazon       
66,5.0,                       great tee   comfortable and of good quality     
67,5.0,                       i wear t shirts almost daily   you can pay an awful lot for one  or buy really cheap ones that are pretty thin  lose their shape and don t last long  or you can buy these   they are good quality  great price for what you get and hold shape and color for quite a while   different colors too  which i like   highly recommended      
68,5.0,                       hane s men s short sleeve beefy t  deep red   i bought this in large for my husband who is a toothpick and thought it a bit smaller through the middle than other large  so keep this in mind  it seems to be a very nice material and not as thick and heavy as some other brands  it is not so thin that you can see through it in light either  so it is a nice shirt for the money in every way  he liked it      
69,5.0,                       the quality seems good   i ordered xxl  however i probably could ve gone with xl  due to height            lbs  i usually go with the xxl for shirts  i ordered a few different shirts at the same time  all in xxl  by same company  this shirt was much longer and wider than the other ones      
70,5.0,                       we have purchased hanes t shirts for a long time they last as long as ll beans  we tested a couple   started wearing and washing at the same time these are heavy enough  if you get completely wet with perspiration or water  there is thickness to the fabric   not so clingy lots of colors  just about all we buy in tees   hanes  we love  em      
71,1.0,                       i order a lot of tees on amazon  this one was bad  i don t know if they spilled perfume on it or if someone purposely sprayed it but wow  the shirt smelled of strong perfume  very disappointed  i needed this shirt for this weekend      
72,4.0,                       great product  well made  holds its structure well      
73,3.0,                       i got these for my mom and stepdad to make them christmas shirts and they said we re too small  i checked them versus other shirts and only a little bigger  they both said were too small     
74,5.0,                       quality made  the way all t  shirt should be made you can almost see thru material on the cheap ones    they start falling apart no long after beefy t s the only ones to buy     
75,1.0,                       i re ordered this after purchasing several in late       those were excellent heavy      cotton t shirts the ones i received when purchasing them again in late      were a far inferior thinner flimsier fabric that felt nothing like      cotton   no comparison to the  identical   beefy t shirts sold in           
76,5.0,                       t shirts with baggy flimsy necklines are a drag  this one has a thicker  sturdy  neckline  if you re older with a an  older  physique  and borderline medium or large  stick with large  if you re really fit  and don t mind accenting your physique  try the medium  i speak from my own    yrs old  experience and my bit of a  lumpy  physique      
77,1.0,                       illustration for this shirt shows no tag  shirts i received unlike previous had black tags   fit small  shirts returned      
78,4.0,                       one of the shirts was a little tight and smaller than the other      
79,3.0,                       i intentionally wanted to get a loose fitting shirt to lounge around in but this was more form fitting than what i was looking for  i m      and     lbs  i probably would have liked it better if it was a size or   bigger  the material was also thicker than expected      
80,4.0,                       i was surprised at the fit  and believe once washed it may fit my wife but definitely not me  getting out of it was difficult no other complaints and the other medium t shirts from hanes i purchased  not on the same order  were not a problem i will buy higher priced items in the future as the collar construction on my other shirts  including hanes  is superior withno exposed stitching  these t shirts will be my work shirts      
81,3.0,                       not tagless as described or as shown in photo   the tags are uncomfortable and scratchy   can be removed easily enough but still annoying   the shirt itself is decent   good weight to it      
82,5.0,                       fits as expected  thick high quality shirt     
83,5.0,                       these t shirts fit great  and are heavy material cotton  i like them  great     
84,4.0,                       seems well made  but a little full cut in the lower part for my taste  i understand that not everyone it built the same  and i m probably in the minority at   ft  and     lbs    so i understand why they make these as full as they do      
85,2.0,                       sorry to have to write a negative review  but these are billed as      cotton   when i received my order of   of them  charcoal heather  they are labeled     cotton       polyester   i really don t like anything but      cotton so they are being returned   i seem to see that frequently shirts in the gray colors are cotton poly blend and avoid those but there was no indication in the description or reviews that this was the case with these   the shipping was quick and product arrived in fine condition  too bad they aren t really full cotton   my search continues        
86,1.0,                       where d the quality go  stitching in the underarms started to become undone with one use   bought them for my roommate as a gift  definitely not the hanes beefy t shirt quality we re used too  also  as far as comfort  these have tags which most shirts now a days don t have  my main issue is it shouldn t fall apart after wearing it once  i bought   and both did it  was hoping they d work out as far as comfort and size then i was gonna buy more  but screw that      
87,5.0,                       in my personal opinion  probably the best t shirt ever made for general use   nice heavy duty  durable fabric
