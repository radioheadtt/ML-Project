0,4.0,                       great brush for helping to style curls  i make sure to use a wet brush first to detangle  i would not recommend this brush for detangling  only for styling      
1,1.0,                       these are fakes  bristles broke within   months      
2,5.0,                       i first bought the small   row brush which is all black but it seemed to be for a child s hand so i had to return it   i recently bought this brush and it is perfect and perfect size for my hand     rows are all i need   great definition   get yours      
3,5.0,                       i wanted to love it but alas the brush made no difference for my  b c hair and that despite studying many youtube videos     
4,5.0,                       my biracial granddaughter requested it and after she used it she said it was amazing before it was hard to get a brush through her hair but this one glides so easily      
5,5.0,                       i ve had this brush for over   years and it has transformed my hair care process  i am african american with very thick and long natural hair  detangling my hair was a nightmare before this brush  this really gets the job done and it has held up beautifully over the years  i am purchasing another one after someone else used mine and caused one row of bristles to retract  i could probably fix it but i figure it s time for a new brush after   years  it still looks and works great after all that time  it fully set angles my hair with no pain or snags    i always use it on wet slippery hair and i don t recommend detangling dry hair      
6,5.0,                       great help defining my curls  i do not really detangle much with it  i do love this brush      is pricey but i love it and it s working for my curls      
7,5.0,                       great brush use bi weekly as a detangle brush and i have little to no hair loss     
8,5.0,                       love this brush for even distribution of styling products in my curly hair  i use a different brush to derange after showering and this one after applying my curly hair products into very small sections of hair at a time  this was a great purchase that i wish i had made years ago      
9,1.0,                       used for my hair after the shower  before blowdrying  untangled my hair pulling away from my scalp to create volume created too much frizz  even with anti frizz products  curls would lose their shape my hair has different sections of curls   a in the front   c on the sides near my ears  and  b everywhere else finger detangling works better for me because i know where my curl patterns are would not buy again      
10,5.0,                       ignore the other comments  this is the real deal   i just ordered this in        amazon must have updated their source of where they buy it from  this product was directly from denman and it is durable and perfect and exactly the product that is shown with excellent quality and packaging  manes by mell sent me here  love it      
11,4.0,                       this is a good brush for creating a nice curl pattern after strangling  this did not work well to detangle my hair  i had to use a wide tooth comb before using this  i heard others say they removed some rows of teeth for better detangling  i have not figured out how to do this      
12,5.0,                       i modified my brush and my hair loss is minimum   i have  c hair and until now had huge problems detangling   i tried with   rows which i loved for product spreading   with   rows it still spreads my products great  now i have perfect tension      
13,5.0,                       i use this to do the loc method leaving conditioner  oil and cream from my hair   i love the brush because it didn t fall apart in my hand like other demi  brushes      
14,5.0,                       brings curls to a great definition     
15,3.0,                       the brush does what is supposed to do but you should expect to buy another one in about     months  if you use it daily      
16,5.0,                       packaging was good  brush is great      
17,5.0,                       easy to modify bristles  i removed   and it was perfect for my fine curly hair     
18,5.0,                       love using this to help define my curls      
19,2.0,                       great brush for thick hair and curls but once your ready to give it a good clean and pull it apart it won t go back after the second  third time taking it apart  it happened to my old old and now is happening to my new one  the only way to get a really good clean is to take it apart since it holds a lot product and hair  yuck  see the dilemma  like who wants product build up on their shiny locks  not i   honestly it s not the best option and you ll do better to get yourself something that can cleaned easily because after while it gets harder and harder until it s nearly impossible to put it back together      
20,5.0,                       i had researched the deman for months before purchasing  deman brush has cut my styling time in half  would definitely recommend  great brush to use once product is applied for even distribution and to enhance curly pattern i would not recommend to use as a detangler brush detangle hair prior  apply products  split hair in sections  then use deman brush  scrunch hair when done and dry your hair using method of choice      
21,5.0,                       i have used a denman for    years   just got a new one because the old veteran buddy s rubber base finally started crumbling   a finer brush cannot be found   hail denman   a finer value cannot be found      
22,5.0,                    pienso que es original  trajo buena presentaci n y el cepillo se ve de calidad  tengo que verlo desarmado y ver como se limpia y dem s  pero por el momento creo que es una excelente compra  estaba ansiosa por problarlo en mis rizos i think it s original  brought good presentation and the brush looks quality  i have to see him unarmed and watch it clean and so on  but at the moment i think it s an excellent purchase  i was eager to test it on my curls       
23,5.0,                       it gives you an option to choose rows and detangles my hair very well      
24,5.0,                       i have been buying denman brushes and swissco combs  see my other reviews  for years  at first i could only find them in beauty stores  so nice to be able to order them online  the brushes themselves are solid and the bristles are soft      
25,5.0,                       love it but wish the handle had more of a non slip quality  if that makes sense  great construction and works for my super curly locks      
26,5.0,                       first time using this type of brush  love it     
27,2.0,                       i bought this brush thinking it would in hance my daughter s waves  it s just an expensive detangling brush      
28,2.0,                       i thought that this was a different denman brush   the brush that i wanted to purchase is the one that the bristles were fix to the handle of the brush   this brush is not good for my very thick and very curly hair  the bristles slide up and potentially out of the brush  not a fan        
29,5.0,                       i can t believe i went my entire life without using this  i have  b hair that responds well to having the product brushed into it  smoother  less wet dry frizz   but which then needs a little help clumping back up afterwards  scrunching   i tried using this brush a few different ways  and have had fantastic results    i ve  modified  my denman by removing every other row  you can do this by pushing the portion holding the bristles up from the top  and then pulling the teeth out   you ll see two bumps marked by d on the top  this is the section that pulls out and unrolls to release the teeth     i detangle my hair with a wet brush first  which i think is common for hair in the     range  if i try to detangle my hair with this  it doesn t work very well  although i ve heard it does work in this capacity for   type hair    if i have more time  i go section by section  brushing away from my head  twisting  and scrunching as i go  lots of great videos on this  standard  usage online   this always gives me the best results   if i m short on time  i tilt my head so that the section i m brushing isn t flat against my head  and brush through my hair  twisting at the end  and giving a slight shake before scrunching  this is super fast  think a minute or two  but gives me hair that s about     as good  i need to fluff a bit more for volume  i put product into my hair before using this  raking and praying hands   and add a tiny bit of watered down gel to scrunch up after brushing  making sure i hear squishing       
30,2.0,                       the brush is just very not well built for the price     
31,5.0,                       i ll never use any other type of hairbrush again it gets through my coarse   kinky hair without tearing it up      
32,5.0,                       i have no issues with the brush but maybe should ve gotten   row to make it easier to hold on to  idk but it s an awesome detangling brush though  i m impressed  will highly recommend           
33,5.0,                       i love this brush     
34,5.0,                       feels great while holding   bristles are harder than regular brushes but seems to stimulate scalp while detangling and leaves hair silky soft    if you quickly flip brush at ends   it helps to form a wave   sort of like when you run a ribbon over a scissors while making a bow    i love it       
35,5.0,                       excellent for defining curls  highly recommend      
36,5.0,                       love it     
37,5.0,                       this brush is the real deal  it is sturdy and heavy and i m in love with it      
38,3.0,                       another curly hair gimmick  i get the same curl by scrunching  waste      
39,5.0,                       i bought this because it s been raved about everywhere  i have transitioning hair from relaxed to natural about a year in and i don t use it to detangle first  it s a little to rough for my hair right now but i m hopeful that it ll get more use once i m fully natural  i do use it but i usually detangle first with my wet brush and then after most of the tangles are out use this one as like a second detangle and smoother before i do my twists  trying to detangle with only this rips my hair out  just for reference i m a year into a hopefully     year transition from relaxed hair  i have about     inches of natural hair grown in that looks like it may be  b but i won t know for sure until i m fully natural  i ve been relaxed since i was a little girl so i don t know what my true natural texture is  for a full natural it will probably be great but right now it s too harsh especially where my two textures meet to use for detangling  i do have a natural friend though who it works great for      
40,5.0,                       i bought this for my very curly hair  great brush for shaping your curls      
41,5.0,                       my hair dresser suggested this for when wearing my hair curly and it was as described   i would not recommend it for detangling curly or thick hair and cannot imagine it would be good for blow drying  but it works great for giving curls better definition      
42,5.0,                       very sturdy brush  great for detangling   i bought it to try and clump waves curls like i have seen on youtube and it doesn t work for that on my fine   c   a hair   but still a nice brush      
43,5.0,                       i use this to wet style clump my curls  best decision ever for someone who is transitioning and also has different curl types throughout my hair  not for detangling  do not use it for that it doesn t work lol      
44,1.0,                       if i could give this brush   stars i would  this is not an authentic denman brush  i ve never owned one but i can tell by the craftsmanship this brush is a fake   the brush looked like a   year old glued it together  do not buy          
45,5.0,                       best used when hair is still freshly wet  after detangling hair with a wide comb  using hair products before or after is to your preference  i find that brushing before my usual products helped me out more with definition    tip  when brushing  do it in individual sections and most importantly do it in a curling motion  as if you re curling your hair with a heat wand   gave my curls more definition  there are ways to modify to your liking by removing the bristles  i recommend youtube for help with that  there are lots of videos on it  the best advice i can give is to try different things with it to see what works out better for you      
46,5.0,                       i have tried many brushes  that claim to be durable  but break while trying to brush out my hair   this brush is the best i have ever used in my long  curly and thick hair      
47,5.0,                         row  heavy brush  for wet conditioned   c b hair     it s somewhat delicate   but i usual brush in the shower  start from tips for your a a too roots            
48,1.0,                       from the very first time i amd my daughter used this brush  the rubber part would slide out  literally  as soon as you try to oull this brush through your hair  the rubber part os sliding out and so are the rows  highly disappointed  i ll be throwing this out and ordering directly from the denman website      
49,5.0,                       i purchased three of these brushes five years ago for myself  my daughter and my granddaughter  someone stole my daughter s so this was a replacement brush because we cannot live without them  i have very curly hair  my daughter has fine hair  my grandaughter has thick  curly hair  this brush works on all three types and we hardly ever have split ends      
50,5.0,                       it s a brush  so  there s not much to review  this is the preferred brush of barbers  etc  so i guess that s something to consider     
51,5.0,                       i m a young mixed race woman and its hard to find good brushes for thick hair like mine  my mom has used this style of brush for years and has used it on my hair  i moved away recently and needed a new brush for myself  you don t really find this brand of brush at regular stores except for at places like sally beauty  i ordered it on here at amazon and loved the quick delivery and the brush works great for my thick hair  love it  i recommend it to all black and mixed race people or just anyone with really thick hair and don t wanna snatch out your hair with an ordinary brush      
52,5.0,                       curls are popping this brush is amazing     
53,5.0,                       after years of dealing with long  prone to frizz  c hair  this brush provided me with the curl definition i ve been looking for  definitely worth the money        only con is the handle can get a bit slippery      
54,3.0,                       i just don t get this thing  y all  i ve tried it several times with different techniques and i just haven t achieved the kind of curls other women have described  it is a lot of work  my curls naturally clump so maybe this is unnecessary and i m just creating more work for myself  i don t know  there are definitely areas that i ve noticed curling better when i use this exactly right  like the bottom layer of my hair  but for the most part  it makes the bottom         of my hair curl more uniformly but it flattens the top  i m just really not sure it s worth the extra steps  i ll keep trying and i ll update my review if i have better success tips  make sure your hair is fully detangled before you use this thing or you will pull your hair out  the brush also gets very slippery with all the water and product on it  so i d keep a towel or t shirt nearby to wipe it and your hands on periodically      
55,5.0,                       perfect brush my my natural hair  good for thick course hair      
56,1.0,                       this product came to me damaged  it s not at all what i expected  i would not buy it      
57,4.0,                       i can have really defined curls and detangling is easy  i don t know why i waited so long to purchase this brush     
58,5.0,                       great brush  replacing one that i have owned for years      
59,5.0,                       recomendable and durable     
60,5.0,                       i absolutely love this brush    i have natural  b  c hair and use it on my wet hair  when starting from end and working to the root  it does wonders at detangling  the best part is how it brings out my curls  i have soft  fluffy hair  but when i brush it with this  i can actually see defined curls  i pair it with a curl cream or moisturizer spray and it s just the best thing ever  i don t travel without it and have recommended it to all of my natural friends      
61,5.0,                       i was having issues with my curls being stringy  i couldn t get them to clump  i saw in instagram this brush helps with that so i purchased one  i have used it twice and my hair finally clumped  i noticed more clumps the second time so i think with practice it ll do what i need  added bonus it helped with frizziness as well  i read if your hair is frizzy while wet it ll style that way and i noticed this controls frizz while clumping the curl      
62,5.0,                       wish i had found this sooner  it definitely defines my hair  the brush was gentle on my hair when i detangled  it  highly recommend      
63,5.0,                       excellent at creating curl      
64,5.0,                       my   year old has  b type curls  and i m always looking for stuff to bring out her curls and this brush did just that  her curls are absolutely perfect after using this  not that they weren t before but these really help define her natural curls      
65,5.0,                       this brush feels wonderful going through wet curly hair  it disperses condition and or mousse really evenly  would recommend to friends curly or not      
66,5.0,                       this is one of the best curl clumping brushes i ve ever had  i have  c   c hair in different spots on my head  some parts of my hair are a bit straighter than other parts  this brush brings out my curls like i have not seen since i was a child in elementary school  i will always have this brush when doing curly styles like twist outs  it is truly awesome      
67,5.0,                       i m glad i tried this brush vs a more expensive option i ve seen  my   month old has very tight corkscrew curls and up until i got this brush  hair time was always a chore for us both  and always resulted in tears  i ve used several different types of brushes and combs before trying this one  once i wet his hair with a detangling spray  the denman brush glides through his hair easily without snagging or causing pain  hair time goes much smoother now  and his curls look fabulous      
68,1.0,                       only used   ripped my  c hair out  the people on youtube makes it look so easy  i went back to finger detangling      
69,1.0,                       not the best for extremely curly  kinky hair types  i do not recommend      
70,3.0,                       i haven t had this brush for that long  and my hair is actually naturally very soft and yet it hasn t been able to withstand time  i don t use it that often because i find that finger detangling keeps my curls in their natural pattern rather than separating them so forcefully  i think this brush is best for women with very little curl pattern or wavy hair because this is clearly not a curly girl tool  especially given my hair isn t afro textured is especially alarming because i m sure their consumers are largely made of people with that texture so i can only imagine how little use they must get out of this product  i think it helps create curls if you don t have any  but ladies and gents if you do have actual curls then why would you want to separate them    finger detangle people  always gives me better results      
71,5.0,                       love love love  however  it does fall apart sometimes so you ll have to put it back together and that s annoying     
72,5.0,                       i love my denman brush i already recommend to all my girls  i have super thick curly hair  enough hair on my head for   people  i ve always had a tough time getting the right brush to de tangle my hair without pulling out a lot of hair  the denman brush runs smoothly through my hair while comfortably de tangling  i also love how it defines my curls during styling  and to top it off i m able to brush through my   year olds long curly hair without her having a fit  like i said i m in love with this brush  i ll probably be ordering extra  if you re looking for a sign here it is order your brush today     
73,5.0,                       ive tried using this brush in different ways  some in the shower and some out of the shower and then doing my curly hair routine  using different products with it too  its definitely a learning curve but i am noticing that my curls are coming out better  especially on second and third day hair  you ll need to suffer thru a few bad hair days til you find your routine  if you have a routine that you love already  this brush isnt needed  but if your looking to improve or get a different look  give this a try      
74,5.0,                       i bought this because i had never owned a brush before and i d been using the same comb since i could remember using a comb  it works well with styling my thick hair      
75,5.0,                       i use this after i detangle with my felicia leatherwood brush     
76,5.0,                       i don t know how this brush does it but it brings out the best in my curls   ringlets are much more defined   i have been recommending it to all my curly haired friends and i don t know why i have not heard of this brush till        it would have saved me from a lot of bad curl days      
77,1.0,                       this brush is lightweight   it s no heavier than the average brush   the handle feels light and hollow and the rubber doesn t feel or smell like real rubber   i am extremely disappointed because i have a   row denman that is truly a heavyweight brush and i love it   i purchased another for this to be my daughter because we had to share one brush but it seems i just wasted      the brush i received is dollar store quality      
78,3.0,                       this is different from my other denman brush  low quality  amazon  you should do better job checking the authenticity of brand products      
79,5.0,                       the best brush for natural hair period  if your having a hard time just modify the brush and trust me you ll be fine      
80,5.0,                       great brush that detangles  is comfortable and also can b taken apart to clean      
81,2.0,                       i never realized how important it is for hairbrushes to have grips on them until i received this brush     and it has no grip  therefore is your in the shower or have product on your hands this brush will just slip right out your hands  i don t really see a difference with my curls using this brush  i have super curly hair so i was hoping this would make them look amazing  lastly    this brush pulls out alot of my hair  i ve never had a problem with shedding so it was really weird when i started using this brush and saw soo much hair coming out      
82,1.0,                       do not buy this brush  this isn t a denman brush  it is definitely a knock off  i payed for this brush just for it to fall all to pieces when i barely even brushed my hair  i wish i would have read the reviews before i purchased it  don t waste your money too      
83,5.0,                       didn t know we would find replacements for our  rotting rubber  ones from the    s     
84,5.0,                       i like that it define my mix toddler girl s curls      
85,2.0,                       bought this and first time i used it  the back separated from the bristles  i was okay with that  but then it happened again   x while detanlgimg my hair which is annoying  i m going back to sally s beauty supply store and getting the real one for o     that one actually works well  i have thick curly hair so i thought i d try the biggest bristles   a mistake and will e returning immediately this brush feels like a regular ol       one at the store  basic      
86,5.0,                       this brush is amazing  my daughter has super soft but kinky curly hair that knots up really easy  she cried every time i touched it for months  now we just spray with some wet conditioner and brush it out  we can do all kinds of styles  if you have a tender head curly toddler  mine is  w b  mixed and this brush will be our forever brush       
87,5.0,                       love how it helps de tangle and define my curls  i have thin hair and very prone to tangle  this brush is sturdy enough and with wide enough bristles to help me detangle without losing half my hair in the process  it s better than other brushes i purchased  definitely worth the investment      
88,5.0,                       found this brush to be a lot easier on my hair  doesn t pull as much hair as other brushes      
89,1.0,                       ok so i bought this brush a little bit ago to replace my previous denman  bought from sally s  and they were not the same   this brush is definitely a knock off     i figured i would give the brush a chance and just use it   unfortunately it does not work the same as the denman i bought from sally s   should have just driven to sally s and not been lazy        
90,5.0,                       this brush is of quality  easy to clean      
91,5.0,                       great tool but for naturally curly hair you have to be cert careful  it doesn t have any protection on the end of the bristles  so with that being said i feel it can cause the hair to be broken  my advice i would be dont use very often      
92,3.0,                       brush has scuffs on the back like it was dropped  box was smashed upon arrival      
93,1.0,                       horribly messed up my hair  pulled it out and broke stands  trash for sure     
94,2.0,                       this is no match for my short natural  b c hair even after i detangled with a wide took comb  the bristles are all bent out of shape after using it for a couple of months  when i had a twa it did help with definition      
95,5.0,                       this is necessary for anyone with curly hair   my normally frizzy curls were turned into true curls that didn t frizz  uncurl  or tangle    i have waited years for something to work and this does   i did use my curl cream and brushed it in with this brush  but it is worth every penny   finally i am happy with wearing my hair down and keeping it natural      
96,5.0,                       the best  this is the only brush that really detangles my curly hair without damaging it love it     
97,5.0,                       it s a miracle use it  but pricey a little bit     
98,5.0,                       i bought this brush after reading about it on pinterest   i was skeptical b c i was always told  don t brush curly hair   this specifically said to use it on wet hair   i ve used it in the a m  on my wet hair the last   days  it detangled well  there was no tugging at knots  and i had less hair breakage showing in the brush compared to using my wide toothed comb   i used my hair gel product as usual  bounce curl light creme gel    my hair has looked so good the past   days   imo anyway    i could see a difference in the curls and the volume   i ve even considered cancelling my devacut appt b c  my hair has looked so good   but then i thought  the cut plus this brush should make it even better   only other different thing i did besides using this brush is a new hairdryer with a fabulous diffuser   best diffuser i ve ever used   a nice big  bowl  to hold and dry your hair   these   items make a great team for my curly hair   hairdryer bought from amazon too  nition negative ions ceramic hairdryer in champagne gold       
99,5.0,                       cvalue for the price      
100,1.0,                       i bought this brush after watching a youtube video that recommended this brush for styling men s hair  the handle broke after first use  i have thin wavy hair  i would not recommend or buy this brush again      
101,5.0,                       i ve been using a  denman brush for    years  easy to clean and easy to use  i got this brush in red and white and it s so pretty      
102,5.0,                       i ve had this style brand of brush before and i love how it goes through my hair  i m african american and puerto rican so my hair is super curly and really really thick  if i don t brush or comb it out after washing it i end up with a afro  the denman brush keeps the fro at bay but my first brush started to wear down  i ve had it for about four years so it held up pretty well  when i received the new brush it came with the brush cleaner which was a surprise to me  i was going to order the brush cleaner since i found out that denman makes them but now i have one so i don t have to spend the extra money  thank you for the new brush and brush cleaner  i m very happy with my purchase and the high quality of the denman brand          
103,5.0,                       definitely worth your money  used it only once in the shower to brush out my hair and already noticed a difference in my curl pattern  in the most positive way   you won t be disappointed      
104,5.0,                       i really liked this product it was easy to comb through my curly hair      
105,5.0,                       great brush great quality real denman brush  i literally only use this brush on my hair snd have been for the past five years no combs it was time for another and as always denman did not disappoint     
106,3.0,                       the brush is so nice  i have yet to use it but the brush arrived in good condition  the plastic part of the brush was coming off a bit  but hopefully it will still brush my hair fine      
107,5.0,                       i tried this brush because the hair community highly recommended this product  its a good brush but not for me  i feel my hair is too thick and curly for this brush  i have to part my hair in  very small sections  to detangle with this brush   nevertheless  its a good brush and i will make use of it but i have purchased an over the counter wide detangle brush at walmart that works just as good and i can part my hair in much large sections for detangling      
108,5.0,                       there is not much i can say that i do not like about this brush it was a recommendation for natural hair care i saw on youtube i have very thick hair and it detangles and smooths     
109,5.0,                       works great to manage curls  but not great for detangling      
110,5.0,                       i cannot recommend this brush enough  it is great for curly  tangled hair or even styling your hair  i usually use this brush after my shower and it works wonders  i also use it after applying dry shampoo  it helps spreading the dry shampoo all over my hair great for both wet and dry hair  easy to wash and dry      
111,5.0,                       i love this brush for styling my  c  a wavy curly hair  product distributes evenly  and i get good  clumping  for defined texture  when there is no time for finger curling  this is the way to get similar results fast      
112,1.0,                       ladies  don t be fooled by the good reviews on this product  this brush is cheaply made out of tough rubber  nothing like the real deal  trust me  if you order this you will definitely return it      
113,5.0,                       great detangling brush for my daughter s curly hair      
114,5.0,                       i m in love with my new brush  it helped so much with my curly hair  my curls are fuller and more defined      
115,5.0,                       met my expectations     
116,5.0,                       untangling and drying  love it      
117,5.0,                       i love this denman heavy brush  for an afro jam cub woman with mixed hair  this was great  it smoothed out my hair almost straight  according to my texture of hair  i ve had other denman brushes but this heavy type works so well  i m buying another one  in case they stop making it for some reason  it has a good weight to it      
118,5.0,                       this is my fourth denman classic styling brush  i wore the others out  it s the only brush i ll use      
119,4.0,                       hard to use as a normal brush on thicker curlier hair when trying to do a ponytail  good when doing sections of hair      
120,5.0,                       really nice  i don t find that it adds any more definition for my hair type but it s still a nice detangle brush     
121,2.0,                       got this on a recommendation  tried brushing my hair out soaking wet to see if it did a good job defining my curls  if you have fine   a  curly hair this may not be the product for you but i know it works well for others      
122,5.0,                       this brush is amazing   it looks a bit filmy but it works really well   say goodbye to frizzy curls   i use this brush on my   year old as well and she let s me untangle her hair and style it with no problems   it is easy to maneuver and style her hair as i want   i highly recommend this brush   you won t regret it     
123,5.0,                       well made  sturdy bristles  i was tired of th brushes with balls at the end which eventually came off      
124,5.0,                       i was a bit skeptical as my hair is very curly and course and a lot of it  however this brush detangled my hair so easily  i love it     
125,3.0,                       have purchased the  denman  brush a few times in the last    years  however  this particular brush does not seem to be the same   it does not detangle as well  not as pliable  and the grip is different  i was a little disappointed because i m not sure if the quality of the materials have changed since my last purchase or if it s actually a different brush     
126,5.0,                       hallelujah  if this product was a    buck i would still pay it   my  yr old daughter has a  c type of hair and this untie knots like not brush ever while leaving her curls looking amazing and tangle free   excellent product     
127,5.0,                       it arrived on time and it does exactly what i need it to do  detangle my hair  my boyfriend loves it as well because he can t seem to not use my brush when ever he has to brush out  detangle  his own hair so it s a win win      
128,3.0,                       everyone loves the denman brush but mine always fall apart after a few months and i don t even use them that often  the teeth started disappearing so i opened it and took out every other row mostly because i was tired of this thing ripping out my hair  and the teeth still slid out  i won t be buying these for a while     
129,5.0,                       i m so happy with this awesome brush  it has been recommended by a friend for   years i finally purchased and i am so glad i did  all other brushes don t have my hair looking this good      
130,1.0,                       this is so cheap and bummy  i don t know if this is the brush everyone talks about and posted all over youtube or if this is a knockoff but it came with pieces of the brush popping off and looks like it was hot glued together  i can t add images on mobile but i ll update      
131,5.0,                       bought this to de tangle a wig  came from uk but shipping was fast  within a week      
132,5.0,                       i read about this brush in a magazine   a dermatologist was saying that she used this on her hair every night   when i received it  i was stunned at its weight   that handle is solid metal   the bristles are very stiff but  i have never had a brush make my scalp feel the way this one does   i am someone who likes the feel of pressure on my scalp and after running this brush all over it  over the sides  underneath  over the top  my scalp has never felt so good  if your scalp is tender  this may not be the brush for you  if you like scalp massages  etc  this is the brush for you  you also can t beat the price   i might even be giving this to all my friends for christmas   i don t think i would use this to style my hair as i m blow drying  but it works beautifully when i m brushing hair oil through as an overnight conditioner  totally worth it      
133,5.0,                       works great just as it s designed  would recommend i ve had this for about   months no issues     
134,5.0,                       i don t know why people keep calling this a fake  this brush will come in an amazon package but inside will be held in the denman original package container  and the address even says denman so its as real as it gets and there is no difference between the version they sell now and the previous version  this brush is amazing and still a great quality brush  but i do have to admit     is a lot for a brush but this brush has lasted me for years  i only had to purchase a new one because of my own mistake when i accidentally ripped out the bristle when trying to clean the brush      
135,5.0,                       the best detangling brush     
136,5.0,                       great durable brush      
137,5.0,                       i love brushes with hard comb like bristles   my old favorite brush this    year old thing that was absolutely falling apart  i saw my hairdresser using this brush on me and i asked her what it was   it was a denman like this  although a very classic original one with a bit different logo  wasn t sure if this would be quite the same thing  but it is   i loved it instantly  haven t had a brush i really liked in years  and for my tastes  it s perfect      
138,5.0,                       these are the best brushes on earth the prior one laseted twenty years with my kinky  curly hair thicker that anything ever i personally like the ones with the heavy handles so you have a firmer grip    i think you have to order those directly from denman as the ones up here have the plastic handles still  great product      
139,5.0,                       definitely notice a difference in my hair since using this product  curls seem tighter      
140,1.0,                       wasted my money  not fit for an adult hand      
141,5.0,                       i ve always used a denman brush since high school   love this brush   i ve owned many denman brushes over the years      
142,5.0,                       i had a denman brush for years  after many years the rubber that holds the brisels fell apart  i had to replace  and i couldn t find the brush and brand  thanks to amazon  perfect     
143,5.0,                       i have  a  c hair  even just brushing my hair after putting in my curling cream and gel  i can see the difference  it really helps my hair clump together and i find i have more  a curls  i couldn t recommend the brush enough      
144,4.0,                       i m still finding new ways to use this very simplistic brush  that does soo much   i really dig it      
145,5.0,                       this brush is great for styling wet hair  i have thick  curly hair  after i wash and condition my hair  i will put in curl cream and then brush out my hair with my denman brush  my curls look defined and beautiful when they dry  great brush      
146,5.0,                       great     
147,5.0,                       bought this to help define my curls  have no idea why it works   but it does        
148,5.0,                       i really like this brush my manager recommended to me  i was really hoping this  brush was different from the ones i have bought at the store myself  and this brush did everything i wanted it to do  i do not have relaxed hair and when i use this brush it really made my hair very manageable  very satisfied      
149,5.0,                       i love this brush  it s a perfect size for the amount of hair i brush at a time  it is a great detangler  i usually use a wide tooth comb or my fingers first  don t use this brush for major tangles    please clear major tangles first and then use this brush for a final check or        
150,4.0,                       i m still getting used to using this brush on my curly hair and need to practice more but so far it has helped me get the better hair days since i let my curls out  the bristles are not super stiff  but firm  use product to get good slip not just water      
151,2.0,                       i didn t read the reviews before purchasing and should have  the brush is really harsh on my  b  c hair  i feel like it break my hair  i stopped using it immediately  i ll stick to using my wife teeth comb  however  this brush will not go to waste   it s my new wig brush  my hope were high for this product and i m really disappointed      
152,5.0,                       this is a great hairbrush for styling  super sturdy and easy to clean      
153,5.0,                       i have owned this brand for    years now and was afraid they had stopped making the heavy duty version as all i could find was a much cheaper one in the stores  was i ever glad to see it here and yes it is the same one i have had for    years  it is my  th one and the only problems i ve ever had is that the handle broke on   of my first ones  which fit perfectly in my purse without the handle so not that big a problem  and that my husband likes to take it  use it and put it away in his drawer  had to get him one of his own  they last for about    years before the rubber starts to break down  absolutly love this brush  very easy to keep clean  ordered   so i will never have to worry about finding it again  hopefully      more years of use to go      
154,4.0,                       doing the curly girl method and you saw this being used  i have super thick curly hair and will tell you a wide tooth pik works      better     
155,5.0,                       this brush doesn t break off by hair   i was using natural bristle brushes all my life  and never realized they were breaking my hair  this brush solves the problem  my hair never looked better      
156,5.0,                       this brush stays nice and lasts  good quality      
157,1.0,                       i m not sure if this item is authentic  with the first use it ripped my hair out and one of the teeth snapped in half  my hair type is    b and naturally curly  i m always gentle with my hair therefore i believe the issues i experienced with this brush was due to its lack of quality  neither the merchant or amazon was helpful in the return and refund of this item so it was a complete loss for me  of course i immediately stopped using this brush and i reccomend using caution before making a purchase from this merchant      
158,5.0,                       so far so good  broke the plastic  bristles    whatever they are called as i was pulling one of them out  so be careful while removing rows  but it s not a fault to the product for my rushedness  i need to watch more videos on how to style with it tho      
159,5.0,                       even my mom noticed the change in the texture and shape of my curls   definitely recommend     
160,5.0,                       i was curious about the fuss of a denman brush   so i researced it  to my surprise amazon have all my needs   when my denman came i was in the middle of doing my thich curly hair  when i first brushed though my hair i almost didnt want to finish it because this is by far the best brush that i have ever ever had in my    years of living   a must have for all natural  choose your style     
161,4.0,                       not very easy to hold  especially when working with wet hair  i wish that the paddle came with some kind of grip  it took me a little longer to detangle my hair   b  natural   but i do believe i lost less hair with this comb than with my wide tooth comb      
162,5.0,                       i ve noticed that my curls come out more defined when i use this brush instead of a normal paddle brush      
163,2.0,                       i have a true denman brush and this isn t it  it does its job for the most part on weave    i refuse to use this on my natural hair ever again      
164,5.0,                       my wife uses it everyday she loves it and highly recommends it      
165,2.0,                       i was so excited for this brush  i took it out of the package and it looks like it has been ripped up and glued back on  paying this much  i expect better  i would be happy with the purchase if these weird rips and cuts weren t here      
166,5.0,                       daughter christmas wish list item  she loves it     
167,5.0,                       i have had a brush like this for    years  and it just now started to fall apart  it is so comfortable to use and the only brush my daughter will let me use to comb her hair  and that is saying something  i was so relieved when i found this exact brush at a decent price on amazon      
168,5.0,                       purchased for my husband with  mostly  curly  c hair   he has spots where it s  b to kinky  a  he d never heard of it but tried it and was amazed at the lack of hair fall and pain there was when he detangled in the shower  compared to his old paddlebrush    described it as an experience where he didn t think it was doing anything but when he got out of the shower  he could run his hand through his hair  i have straight hair  type    and it definitely works for me too  highly recommended      
169,5.0,                       i love it because is strong     
170,5.0,                       love how it detangles my hair      
171,5.0,                       i use this as a styling brush for my long curly hair and highly recommend it as such  it s sturdy and easy to clean and use  i have no complaints or problems with it      
172,5.0,                       i love this brush  really helped with making my curls look more defined and unfrizzy  even though i m still going through the transition to get my curls back healthy  this brush helps me cheat a little without using any heat to define the curls      
173,1.0,                       not real   also ordered   rows and received   rows     
174,2.0,                       i might be one of only a handful that do not like this brush  but alas  i fear i do not  i have very fine  curly hair that admittedly tangles easily  and this brush snags on my hair something awful when styling  no matter how much product i use  i have breakage  i had at least twice as much fall while styling with the denman as when i was detangling my hair with a different brush  this is also after taking out   rows of tines after it happened the first time i used it another thing  my curls seemed to clump better using the brush  however  my hair is very curly   b  c  and my ends basically curled around themselves  resulting in increased shrinkage and a look far more  precious  than i d like  i may give it another go  see if a different technique might help  but after a couple uses  i m not yet a fan      
175,1.0,                       this is not a genuine denman  total scam  don t waste your money      
176,5.0,                       seriously  if you are a person with curly hair then you need this product asap  i have type  b hair and it cries out for moisture  i usually do a three step method of leave in  cream and light gel  this brush helps the products i apply deeply enter my hair follicles  it defines my curls training them to be a perfect pattern between curls and coils  i absolutely love it  my hair loves it      
177,5.0,                       i ve broken god knows how many brushes in the past  i ve had every kind of brush imaginable  but none of them compare to this one  my husband picked it out for me and it s probably the best hair related gift i ve received so far  the bristles are soft and don t tug harshly on my hair  so detangling has become less of a nightmare and  more of an enjoyable self care activity  i could not recommend purchasing this brush more      
178,5.0,                       honestly this is the best brush ever   it makes my curls amazing   it doesn t pull harshly on my hair   it s just amazing   i know some people say it s fake but even if it is it works great       
179,5.0,                       so far so good  this brush feels like a quality product  the head and bristles are very well made and heavy so they really get into your hair  the only issue i have is the proportionately skinny handle part  compared to the brush head the handle is very light and narrow making it feel top heavy and some have even posted about the handle snapping  for my hair  it won t be a problem  but for someone with thicker denser hair  they might snap the handle  i m very happy with the brush and look forward to using it for years      
180,5.0,                       granddaughters have a lot of long hair and so a lot of tangles  have used other brushes but this one works best      
181,5.0,                       got this to follow cgm to distribute product better and its awesome  i have it every other row  love it     
182,5.0,                       this is the  rd time i ve bought this brush  the first   lasted a total of     years  i especially like the way the  bristles  penetrate thick hair   all the way to the scalp  and that it doesn t cause split ends even when the hair is wet  easy cleaning is a definite plus      
183,5.0,                       works great as expected for this type of brush  long lasting    years    so far and no problems with base material or handle cracking   best not to drop them on hard floor  since they are all prone to cracking over time with multiple drops      
184,5.0,                       i had a denman brush for about    years before i had to replace it  so  longevity is one thing and the other is  it s easy to use  i probably should have gotten the longer handled one  but this one is good too      
185,1.0,                       i bought this brush to use it for clumping my curls for definition  i detangle with a different comb first then intended to use this to spread product easily  it fell apart before i hit the ends of my hair  it was easy to fix but fell apart with each stroke      
186,5.0,                       i ve never had a brush for curly hair  this brush is amazing  gave my wet hair soft ringlets that lasted over a week  it evenly dish product and was easy to clean  i love this brush and got one for my sister s birthday      
187,5.0,                       great for styling     
188,4.0,                       great for detangling  but when my hair is dry it makes my hair very static and frizzy  little disappointed because that was the main reason i got it  but otherwise works great     
189,3.0,                       this brush is much smaller than i expected      
190,1.0,                       i received my package this week and the box it came in was just perfectly fine   i was excited to get this brush that everyone loves for their curly hair   i open it  eeeewww there is hair already on my brush  just make me wonder where else this brush has been  sending it back and i will just go buy a brush in person somewhere else  might have to pay more but at least it will only have my hair in it      
191,5.0,                       my mom and i love this brush  but i love it the most  i have thick  medium length  b c hair  this brush has weight and it is strong  i have used it every day since i received it earlier this week  i brush each quarter section of my hair with it   x  there is very little breakage and the brush itself is holding up fabulously  this is the first detangling brush that i have ever used that hasn t broken in my hair  even the bristles are still in perfect condition  i used it on my mom s hair too and she wants one  i am also buying a few to make care packages for my aunts  i tried looking for this same brush at my local beauty store tonight  and they had nothing by denman  not even the local target  walmart  rite aid  cvs  or walgreens had it either  i love this brush and it is worth the price to have it  just for the heck of it  i am getting an extra one for my use back to the use  not only does the denman heavy duty    row styling brush successfully detangle my hair  but i have seen less breakage and hair loss using it these last few days than any comb or brush i have used before  the massage it gives my scalp is invigorating and delightful   i continue to feel the tingling sensations for       minutes after  the design evenly distributes oil to every strand of hair  and the strong non scratchy  bristles uplift any dandruff from the scalp  relieving itching  after using  my hair is so much easier to manage  i m between hair styles right now  so i am just safety braiding my hair in quarters at night after scalp treating  hair conditioning  and brushing if brushing my hair and braiding it every night will make it grow longer  i will do it as long as this brush continues to be manufactured  my goal is to grow my hair past my shoulder blades  right now  it reaches a little more than half way down the back of my neck   thanks to my current hair products  fantasia naturals tea tree oil line  and an essential oil mixture  tea tree oil  peppermint oil  aloe vera oil  with a fractionated coconut oil base  and this brush  i have found myself needing to wash my hair less and less  i used to have to wash it once or twice a week due to excessive dandruff and itching  drying the hair strands and my scalp excessively   now i have been able to reduce it to once a month and my hair stays clean  my hair has never been healthier and i am seeing less split ends  thanks to this brush  i don t need combs for anything other than making parts  i am so glad i will never see a    hair ball again      
192,5.0,                       it takes some practice  but this brush delivers beautiful curls      
193,5.0,                       i don t use this for detangling or drying     i use this for separating my curls and it works great      
194,5.0,                       old school brush that won t disappoint  a little pricey but supply and demand  right      
195,5.0,                       i have the heavy weight   row brush  it is heavy  but i wouldn t say it makes brushing or blowdrying my hair more difficult  in fact  i think it encourages softer brushing since you can sort of let gravity take control instead of ripping the brush through your hair  for blowdrying  the brush provides plenty of tension for blowdrying  and does a good job of reaching the scalp  overall this is a really great brush and i look forward to years of use      
196,3.0,                       i bought this brush after seeing several curly girls use it to help clump curls while styling wet  but it wasn t effective for me  i was very disappointed  i have mix of  c  a curls and this brush ended up separating my curls and making them stringy looking  i have more success with  praying hands  than using this brush the brush itself is sturdy and of good quality and although i ve only had it a few weeks  it seems like it will last a while      
197,3.0,                       the brush works fine but i ve only had it for about six months and i noticed today that it s starting to come apart  i don t use it with a hairdryer  so there s no heat on it to soften any glue  it s just really surprising to me that it s already coming apart  i expected more      
198,5.0,                       solid construction  teeth are well spaced and really grab the hair nicely for efficient drying  i m very pleased and will buy a second one to keep with my travel kit      
199,5.0,                       i ve used these brushes for years and i love them   they re very good at detangling my wet hair after washing   they are also very long lasting until the rubber that holds the tines starts to split   but it takes years i lost a small one that fit in my purse and have yet to find anything as good to replace it      
200,5.0,                       this brush is amazing and makes brushing your hair a breeze  it definitely does what it says it can do      
201,2.0,                    bueno no es original al      ya q sus cerdas son muy finas y la goma que aguanta sus celdas es muy debil no recomiendo que desenrenden su cabello ya que este ariticulo es para crear rizos  y como yo lo quiero para definir rizos esta perfecto  well it is not original      since its bristles are very thin and the gum that holds its cells is very weak i do not recommend that they unravel your hair since this ariticulo is to create curls  and as i want it to define curls is perfect        
202,1.0,                       this was not the item i was promised  though the body of the brush is a denman  the bristle and its mold appeared to have been swapped for a knock off  upon noticing this  i returned this brush within a couple of days of delivery and have received my refund right away  which was greatly appreciated  my review is not for those who are interested in the ability and versatility of this brush because i did not use it  long story short  if i am going to purchase a denman brush at a denman price  at least it was the same price at the time of purchase  on a non denman site  that the whole brush  including the bristle  be a denman  honesty gets you further  and this brush was not an honest exchange  thankfully  the refund was      
203,1.0,                       this is not an authentic denman brush  terrible cheap quality  a real denman brush is has a nice heavy weight to it  more gentle bristles  and also comes with papers basically authenticating that you did indeed purchase a real denman brush  will definitely be sending this horrible knock off back  shame on amazon for continuing to sell fake products   seriously getting out of hand     
204,5.0,                       this is just as described and what i expected  great brush      
205,3.0,                       didn t expect it to be tiny  dimensions are not listed anywhere  nor the fact that s it a miniature  i thought it was just going to be slimmer with fewer bristles  detangles easily and defines very nicely  however it s very difficult to hold because it s made of smooth plastic  which is super slippery  especially with product or water on my hands  and being so tiny  it s hard to get a good grip on the handle  i have to hold it strangely and uncomfortably to use it      
206,5.0,                       i loved the way my short natural hair did not get tangled up  nor did the brush pull on my hair  the brush detangled my hair just as i expected  i was not disappointed      
207,5.0,                       this is my go to brush for detangling with conditioner  with damp hair before blowdrying  and during the blowdry process  i also use it  to brush my hair at the end of the day to get tangles out  tried and true favorite      
208,2.0,                       i have curly long hair  i tried using this brush a few times and it would pull my hair out  it was also poorly made  falling apart and you can see glue      
209,5.0,                       it helped curl my natural hair  i purchased another brush that was like this one but not the same brand and it didn t help my hair nearly  as well as this one      
210,5.0,                       i have been looking everywhere for this brush  every sally s store in my city was sold out  i can t wait to detangle my  a  b natural hair      
211,5.0,                       yess good brush  dont listen to all the youtubers seeing them and brushes are bad for your hair you know what s good for your hair its individual to everyone      
212,5.0,                       i like the brush ver much  very good handle and sturdy for tough tangles  i did notice the difference in my curls after the second use and i love it  my curls look better than ever  thank you denman for creating such a wonderful brush for curly beautiful hair      
213,4.0,                       i recently purchased the denman brush because i wanted more defined curls  i have a  c curl pattern and i have a difficult time fighting frizz  i am still learning to use this brush and i highly recommend looking up youtube videos for a more in depth styling process  overall  i am highly satisfied as a customer        
214,5.0,                       love the brush for product distribution   the quality of the rubber pad that holds bristles is tearing all the way around the grove   this should not happen one year after purchase   i have never removed the bristle pad from brush      
215,1.0,                       i think i would really like this brush  it feels good to use and leaves my hair feeling soft when paired with my davines products  but i ve only used it twice  after detangling with a good wide toothed comb   and the bristles and their backing already appear to be separating from the brush handle  maybe mine just wasn t glued well  but after reading multiple articles on the best brushes for curly hair  and this being highly rated on each one  i expected better  i ll be super dissapointed if the bristles and backing fully come away from the handle like your every day cheap hair brush  as this was an issue i was hoping to avoid when i chose this over just buying another wet brush or some such thing      
216,5.0,                       i bought the brush for my granddaughter and she loved it      
217,5.0,                       one of the best finds of      for me  i purchased at the urgency a few a natural hair influencers  i have type   hair and it makes detangling super easy  i love that the bristles are continuous and my hair doesn t snag like it did when i used other bristle brushes  also it so easy to clean  like i said  one of the best beauty finds      
218,1.0,                       i m not sure if this is real one but i m pretty sure it s not  the brush completely ripped  this is horrible quality do not buy      
219,5.0,                       this was recommended and i ve tried it  i use this after applying my styling products and conditioners for even distribution      
220,3.0,                       seem like a  normal  brush  nothing special about this product    so i would say a little pricy      
221,1.0,                       i don t think this is a genuine denman brush  it s very sloppy looking and doesn t look very well made  very disappointed considering it says amazons choice  i don t know why it has almost   star considering there are a lot of reviews that say theirs looks to be a fake  too  sad that sally s beauty is selling this      
222,4.0,                       i love this brush for defining my  b natural curls  the only thing i didn t like was that the gold  denman  text on the brush rubbed off pretty much immediately during the first use  like i could gently rub it with my finger and it would come off which i thought was really strange  i don t know what s in the ink so i don t exactly want it on my hands hair or wherever it s gone  but it doesn t impact the functionality of the brush so it s not a big deal      
223,5.0,                       i had seen this brush on social media and decided to give it a try  it is like magic makes curls more defined less frizzy  i love and have not used anything else since i purchased it      
224,4.0,                       i love using this brush in the shower on my  c  a hair  it is stiff enough to reach my scalp through my thick and dense hair  i don t think it does a ton to define my curls but it is a great brush regardless      
225,4.0,                       i like that this brush doesn t have little balls at the end of the bristles  but sometimes my hair gets caught between the red base and the bristles which pull my hair out     
226,5.0,                       detangles easily     
227,5.0,                       met my expectations     
228,5.0,                       i have long  curly  a hair and have long struggled with finding the right routine  i recently heard about these brushes and decided to give it a try  i tried it as is for a couple weeks  but it gave me zero clumps and my hair didn t look good  i then removed a few rows  which was easy and took less than   minutes   and that has helped a lot  i get better clumps now and it detangles quickly and easily without hassle  since i brush in the shower while conditioner is on my hair  the brush was constantly flying out of my hand  nothing helped the grip  so i bought some of the cohesive bandage stuff they wrap you with at the doctor s office after they take blood  it s also called vet tape sometimes  i wrapped a bit of this around the handle super tightly  went around about   times and then gave it a good squish  this has completely solved the grip problem for me  and it has held up well so far for several weeks of being soaking wet and conditioner coated in the shower without issue  i m sure eventually i ll need to wrap it with fresh stuff  but the tape is cheap and comes in big rolls  so it s worth it  i m very happy with my brush      
229,5.0,                       i have  c hair and my little one has  a  works great for both of our hear types  it really gets the ganges out  thought i go through our hair with my fingers first  this is a great brush to use to ensure the one strand knots are out  this is also the only brush has manipulates both of our curls without needed additional product  i use a leave in to help detangle  fingers  then this brush  the curls are transformed before i finish with oil       
230,5.0,                       the brush works incredibly well  doesn t hurt my scalp when i brush and is the best brush i ve ever used as far as detangling goes  after brushing  my hair feels silky smooth and ice found myself brushing more often just to get my hair smooth again  i would absolutely recommend this to anyone who was looking for a good brush to use      
231,1.0,                       product is not a genuine denman brush  charged same price for a knockoff product  at least offer a discount for a counterfeit product   shame      
232,4.0,                       i have thick  c hair   it s about a foot long stretched   the bristles have a lot of  give  making for a much gentler detangling process   i think the handle on this brush needs grip or texture   i use slippery products in my hair to detangle it   the smooth finish on this brush makes it difficult to hold when my hands are slick   overall  i like how it glides through my hair once detangled      
233,5.0,                       i have a weird combo of curly wavy hair and have been looking for a shower brush to help detangle and distribute hair products  this brush fits all my needs  it does a much better job than a wide tooth comb and doesn t snag at my hair nearly as much      
234,5.0,                       it shrinks my curls but it defines my curls sowell      
235,5.0,                       the brush to end all brushes  now my gold standard  i have long  very thick caucasian hair with some wave  i have been through my share of brushes in my life and this beats them all by far   its sturdy  not too heavy  penetrates my hair in one easy pass  helps my hair dry faster  redistributes oil  detangles in a flash wet or dry  and so gentle i don t have to hold my hair as i brush  i can t live without it  will never go without again  i need to buy a few more  thanks brits      
236,5.0,                       durable quality     
237,5.0,                       works well for my hair      
238,5.0,                       absolutely the best hair brush i ve ever owned   i have never  and i am a senior citizen  ever had a brush glide through my thick hair   my arthritis is not an issue using this brush   so thankful      
239,5.0,                       very good     
240,3.0,                       how can a brush with these many positive reviews has such a terrible handle   it s small and slippery which is awful to brush curly hair         
241,1.0,                    anteriormente le hab a dado   estrellas a este producto sin embargo volv  a comprarlo y me topo con que la goma es muy gruesa y no embona con el cuerpo del cepillo  he intentado todo y no ensambla  es inutilizable   i had previously given   stars to this product however i bought it again and i find that the rubber is very thick and does not stick with the body of the brush  i tried everything and didn t assemble  it is unusable         
242,1.0,                       worked good for the first time even when was very slippery on the handle  i tried to use a tape to create a strong hold  my hand was in pain  i couldn t almost carry it  but definetly not for my curls  i have an afro  in the second use  broke  waste of money      
243,2.0,                       i loved my   and   row denman brush and figured the   would be just as good  no  unfortunately  the brissles slide out every single time i use it  it s beyond annoying  would not recommend anything bigger than the        edit to add  after reading other reviews  i m sure the   row denman brush i received was a fake  it s very cheap      
244,5.0,                       this brush works great and detangles quickly   i have very curly wavy hair that gets pretty knotty by wash day  especially in the back   i used to use a wide toothed comb  but this detangles much better and quicker with less pulling of hair      
245,2.0,                       i love this brush and use it every wash day on wet hair  but the brush does not stay intact which is super annoying  there are two parts   the handle and the bristle brush  the brush comes apart from the handle and i m not sure it is supposed to      
246,5.0,                       can not compliment this product enough  lost mine about a month after getting it due to living in south africa and even virgin active isn t always secure  but  for the time i had it  it was a delight  straightens hair very well  tends not to remove product and sticks to hair just enough to style properly without pulling      
247,5.0,                       i ve only used it one time  but can notice a difference in curl definition  can t wait to play around with it more  definitely not a brush to detangle your hair  it s strictly a styling brush  if your looking for a brush to help you get more definition in your curls  look no further      
248,4.0,                       great for  c hair     
249,4.0,                       works like it should  no pulling  i have only used  x  but like it already      
250,5.0,                       i was skeptical because i have thick  c hair but this is hands down the best detangling brush i ve used  as much hair as i have i was able to detangle my whole head w in   mins which is a record for me  does seem to make natural curl pattern pop a bit with the right products     
251,5.0,                       i lovw this brush  i have  b  c hair and use this as a detangler      
252,3.0,                       happy with purchase  but it s not the same quality as older     yrs ago  version   bristles significantly thinner and pointier it s fine but those who are replacing an older brush are forewarned     
253,5.0,                       i have curly  b texture hair which is long  i ve always had a difficult time managing and detangling my hair  i ve tried wide tooth combs  the wet brush and nothing ever seems to work  until i found this brush  i bought this brush to do vintage style roller sets and it works really really well to brush out roller sets  but the best part is  is that it also works amazing for detangling and brushing my hair  this is literally the best brush i ve ever had  so worth the money      
254,4.0,                       i have  c hair   my daughter s hair is  b    c combination  i works on my daughter s hair much better      
255,5.0,                       i had one like this for probably    years  i couldn t find a replacement so i bought several others as mine was wearing out  i didn t like any of them as much as this  then  i found this on amazon and bought it immediately and will die a happy man  i have the same kind of brush i loved for so long and it may outlast me      
256,5.0,                       i knew this brush was gonna be good but not this good  i have always had wavy hair and my curls haven t really been the most defined but with this brush and using the  curly girl method  i can say i m gonna keep using this brush until i can t anymore lol  i seriously recommend this to anyone who wants to define their curls more its amazing     
257,5.0,                       love this brush  im transitioning and this is helping define my curls  i watched a lot of video on yt on how to use it and they were really helpful  also saw lots of reviews saying that it was a fake but this is the real thing u just got to be careful and pay attention to the seller      
258,4.0,                       idk why there are some girls that talk so down on this brush  i absolutely love it     
259,5.0,                       easy to use     
260,5.0,                       i love this product  i m so glad i purchased this  great brush     
261,5.0,                       i bought   of these for my girls   one has super curly hair the other has wavy hair  they love these brushes      
262,5.0,                       this brush truly helped my curl pattern  i am happy with this purchase and recommend it to anyone who has curly hair and needs a styling tool that will help enhance their curly hair      
263,5.0,                       i love this brush  it work wonders on my hair  especially when i use with my conditioner and detangle small sections  also i use for my curly wig and its great i purchased one from sallys just like it that wasn t denman and my brush broke within   uses and they cost the same  shipping was prompt as well  i want to try the other one with a different amount of rows by denman as well      
264,5.0,                       i loved it for detangling and making my curls pop   i can t say much for drying my hair   i have thick hair so it was a challenge but this brush definitely helped out   i kept hearing it would help but just wasn t sure it was worth it or the arm power   i even recommended it to a friend who now loves the brush just as much as i do      
265,5.0,                       i love this brush to define my curls     
266,4.0,                       it s a good brush      
267,5.0,                       great for thick or curly hair  works great in the shower  with some conditioner  great for kids and adults     
268,5.0,                       after reading many cgm blogs about this  i treated myself  it works  brush thru wet hair starting from bottom and working up  gently  i have no idea why it works  but it does  curls are more defined and curlier  if that s a thing  also lessens the frizz  it s a mystery  why this brush does what it does    but it does  lol      
269,5.0,                       just love how it combs through my hair  i ve not been able to find a good brush like this one in years      
270,5.0,                       how did i avoid purchasing one of these for sooo long  it sat in my cart for probably a year  i couldn t imagine this expensiv not a brush would actually benefit me  i just have  c curls and i can t believe the difference   it s incredible at helping your curls clump together  even on day   and   stil  marinette hose curls stay clumped together      
271,4.0,                       overall it is a nice brush  i like that there s not little ball ends on the bristles that will fall off over time    that was my problem in the past    it seems that i will hold up pretty well too  which i m really happy about  i have pretty thick  long hair to mid back and it goes through just fine with it s dry  but a little harder when it s wet  maybe i don t have enough conditioner in my hair for it to go through smoothly idk  i would recommend this brush if you want a quality brush      
272,5.0,                       my hair has never felt so stimulated  the way these prongs run across your scalp is enough to write a book rivaling    shades of grey  this little guy will blow your mind and leave you sex and satisfied      
273,1.0,                       fake  should be removed from amazon  false advertising      
274,5.0,                       i have  a  b  c textured hair that i wear in its natural state  it suddenly developed fairy knots  i kept clipping the ends and keeping them moisturized  however  they wouldn t go away i saw many with my hair texture on you tube using this brush  so i ordered this along with the goody mosaic xl detangling rake comb    no more fairy knots i dampen my hair  use the rake comb  then use this brush  with a little of whatever daily moisturizer is in my reach  eco  shea butter  design essentials   the end result is nice smooth  healthy looking curls with no fairy knots love these tools      
275,1.0,                       for    of shipping i expected it to come not crushed  i am disappointed  hopefully it works ok      
276,5.0,                       this brush is perfect for detangling as well as styling my  b  c curly hair  i love it  would definitely recommend this product      
277,5.0,                       i have no complaints    best de tangler  gives me perfect curls      
278,3.0,                       its fine  i have thick long curly hair and this isn t the greatest brush for my hair type but after seeing all the videos raving i had to try  would not buy again     
279,4.0,                       definitely gives curl definition      
280,5.0,                       my old brush was between    and    years old and i have been looking to replace for several years   i was really happy to finally find what appeared to be the exact same brush  although i could not be      sure as the name on the old brush could no longer be read   when i got this new brush   it really appears to be exactly the same  except i got the   row brush   not the   row    my original blue is not available but the black is fine   otherwise  the construction appears to be exactly the same   based on how well my  original brush lasted  i am sure i will never need another brush      
281,5.0,                       i had a denman brush for almost    years  it survived daily blow drying  hairspray  dry shampoo  gels  wet hair  dry hair  soaking to remove hair products and lots of traveling  i love this brush  it fits comfortably in your hand and works well in thick or thin  curly or straight  or young or old hair  finally  after much abuse  i decided to replace my brush and ordered the exact same one  i love it      
282,5.0,                       black hair     
283,5.0,                       great brush from the good old days     glad there are new color updates  fun      
284,5.0,                       great detangler for curly hair  multiple uses to dry hair  style or detangle  bristles are firm enough but not too hard that it will hurt while brushing      
285,5.0,                       love the feel  not too heavy  lite enough to use comfortably  this brush is perfect for styling and detangling natural hair      
286,5.0,                       love it  could have a longer handle  great at detangling      
287,5.0,                       wish i would ve known about these sooner great product      
288,5.0,                       great product and feels so good massaging my scalp      
289,4.0,                       idk if it s a real demen alot of people saying it s not so i kind of do feel played because it s demen brush price but i used it my curls are popping so i guess its alright      
290,2.0,                       in my opinion  it doesn t work for  c  c hair  i was disappointed  i even removed some bristle rows to help  however  it pulled out more hair      
291,5.0,                       i don t know what it is about the purple and pink colors but i love it   an absolute need for my fellow curly headed queens and kings      
292,5.0,                       i absolutely love this brush  i can t believe i ever lived without it  i m an african american woman with  c natural hair  i use this to detangle after applying leave in  oil  and cream and finger detangling  the brush helps detangle the kinks i missed and clump my curls  the bristles are fairly flexible and have a lot of give   it s great      
293,5.0,                       i like it     
294,5.0,                       i have long curly hair that i have to brush out very carefully while wet and covered in great big gobs of leave in conditioner   i used to use a comb and pulled out so much hair that it was quite frightening   enter the denman brush    upon recommendation of teri laflesh and her book curly like me   the brush is every bit as awesome as she describes it   it is sturdy and made of great quality hard plastic  the bristles are smooth and are embedded into a cushiony rubber base  but the very best part is that you can easily slide the rubber cushion from the handle  pop all the rows of bristles out and clean the brush in a jiffy i am so happy with my denman brush it is a cinch to wash and to keep clean  it doesn t pull my hair out by the handful and even though my fine hair knots easily  this size brush works absolutely perfectly and is easy to stash in a carry on   i expected it to cost around     but it was extremely affordably priced you cannot go wrong with a denman      
295,5.0,                       i love this brush   it has completely transformed my hair regimen  and i can t believe i ve gone without something like this for so long   it s gets tangles out without being too abrasive and is great for blow drying hair   i have  c hair  and have noticed little to no breakage while using this brush  definitely recommend      
296,5.0,                       i love this brush  great for my mixed curls  i use after applying gel  oils on wet hair    helps me preserve a well manicured curl  this reminds me of my childhood     
297,5.0,                       i am working on the  curly girl method  and this is the only brush they say to use w a special technique to define the curls  it worked      
298,5.0,                       i don t know what drying power means but i gave this product as many five stars as i could  this brush change my hair game forever  i went from being a to   b  c to being a  c  a    this thing gave me some ringlets    buy it        
299,5.0,                       this brush has allowed me to totally change my entire hair routine  i used to have to make my hair a crunch mess with mousses and hair spray  i am now able to achieve beautiful soft curls  i ve gotten so many compliments on my hair since using this brush  it s not a scam  buy this product  you won t regret it      
300,5.0,                       can t live without it     
301,5.0,                       i have had a denman brush for many  many years  at least ten  the rubber holding the bristles eventually wore out and finally wouldn t stay in the handle  i couldn t find a denman and bought another brand  so dissatisfied   the bristles were hard and uncomfortable and the brush wore out quickly   then i found and ordered this one  so happy i did  the price is worth it  long lasting quality and superior function      
302,4.0,                       i want to give this brush   stars but for my thick  curly hair i think i need the   row  i learned your hair type   thickness will depend on the best brush for you  this brush is smaller than i anticipated   would get stuck in my hair  i didn t remove any combs   watched a youtube video to learn to put it back in because it flew out of the brush  i m not giving up on it  but for me   my hair i m going to try the   row instead      
303,5.0,                       i was impressed when i started using this brush  it glides nicely through my hair and i ve noticed a more beautiful and defined curl to my hair  i would recommend this product curly hair      
304,1.0,                       this brush broke while trying to detangle my hair  the white rows came right out  i purchased one straight from the website and the rows are not even removable  do not purchase from them      
305,5.0,                       great hair brush for curly hair but you detangler without pulling your hair out  easy to use easy to hold      
306,5.0,                       can t say enough about this brush  has changed wash and style day for myself and my daughter   i ll buy over and over again     
307,5.0,                       great brush for all types of hair  it s like a massage form your scalp and hair  i am very pleased with those bruah because it doesn t break my hair and gives my curls great definition      
308,5.0,                       this brush snags in my hair because it s thick so its sorta tough to detangle  one of my ties came out  but that was after   year      
309,4.0,                       love this brush  the only issue i have recently been encountered while using the brush is the inside of the brush will just slide out which is aggravating when brushing your hair  i read your supposed to brush your hair from underneath your hair with the brush to help with your curls and that seams to help  the brush is easy to hold and good for detangling the hair      
310,5.0,                       my daughter has very curly hair and every time in the shower she needs a good brush to use to detangle it   this works perfectly      
311,5.0,                       the denman brush has completely changed the way i style my curly hair  nothing distributes product as well as a denman brush  i get comparable definition when i use the denman as when i would when i finger curl  instead of finger curling or just scrunching  i brush and twirl with the denman  which saves time and reduces frizz  it is very easy and quick to do  i like how you can customize the brush by popping out rows of bristles  and that you can take the brush apart for cleaning  i read that the bristles are vinyl  which is why they are so smoothing to the hair       worth the money      
312,5.0,                       love this brush it makes my hair so curly and bouncy it really works  it s small but easier to store and carry around     
313,3.0,                       at first the brush was good  after continued use the brush would slide out from the plastic holder while im brushing my hair  it was quite annoying  also the bristles would bend and it was hard to use the brush with my thick hair  after a few months i threw this brush away and bought something else that works better      
314,2.0,                       this doesn t work on my hair at all  wish i didn t purchase it  i had to comb out my hair fully for the brush to work and that to me is me detangling my hair with a comb  then i was not able to use it to do any styling   no curls were formed or anything     
315,5.0,                       i have thin hair that s prone to static and that stays wavy curly if i finger curl twist it while it s wet  this is the first brush that hasn t destroyed those fragile waves into a static mess once my hair is dry   i ve gone from avoiding brushing my hair  leading to tangles and lack of shine  to being able to brush whenever i want   i took out every other row of the brush and that seemed to work better than the full rows for me      
316,4.0,                       i guess it detangles a but easier than most brushes  its good for defining your curls when you use the brush the right way  look on youtube if you dont know  i like the way my curls look when using with leave in conditioner         
317,5.0,                       this is a good quality brush for a great price  definitely recommend     
318,5.0,                       i have curly hair   other brushes always felt like they were ripping my hair out   but this brush detangles my hair quicker   smoother   and little to no hair left on brush after being done   i recommend     
319,5.0,                       definitely does all it says it does  detangles  minimizes frizz  forms curls  i couldn t be happier with the brush      
320,1.0,                       i bought this after watching tons of youtube videos where it was recommended  after i took the red part out to take out some rows of bristles  i couldn t put it back in  nothing worked  i ve heard that can happen when you ve received a knockoff  which i sadly believe this is  i definitely would not want a replacement  if i decide to get another denman brush  i will be buying straight from the manufacturer      
321,5.0,                       with having thick curly hair this brush works perfect for detangling my hair      
322,4.0,                       as far as detangling goes  this is probably the best and most pleasant brush i ve used  it doesn t snag or pull very hard at all and still manages to leave your curls intact  my only gripe is that the construction seems a bit questionable  and i don t have much confidence this will last in the long run  i can pull at the bristles and have part of the rubber base separate and stuff like that      
323,4.0,                       only problem was the comb comes apart at the top from the brush handle  guess comb to much hair at once  instead of combing in smaller sections of hair  but it gets the job done even if i often have to put the comb part back in the handle as i am detangling hair      
324,5.0,                       love this  i use it in the shower in my wet hair and i love the way it brushes through my hair  i have thin tangled hair and it works great on my wet hair  fyi i don t brush my hair when it s dry so i can t say it works in dry hair     
325,1.0,                       do not buy this brush  it s fake  i have included pictures to give you an idea of what i m talking about      
326,5.0,                       i use this brush on my clients who has coarse hair and it s amazingggyou can definitely get down to the roots when blow dryingwill help you get a sleek finish     
327,1.0,                       painful to use  brush has zero give to it  i purchased to use to help blowdry my shorter hair  very rugged  might be good for longer hair but wasn t what i interpreted from the descriptions on here     
328,1.0,                       i think this was a knock off or defective   some of the bristles were bent on arrival and i tried to slide it out to check and it wouldn t budge   looked like it was breaking on the red part near the bottom   i returned it  i ll wait until the stores open and try again      
329,3.0,                       the brush detangles well  you kinda have to take your hair in short sections  however this has to be the most poorly made brush i ve ever seen  it looks like a   year old took some elmers glue and slapped a plastic handle with some points sticking out and rubbed them together and said  tada  and gave it to his mom for christmas  i can literally see the silicon injection sites  almost like they didn t even care about the craftsmanship  really poorly made and kinda disappointed      
330,5.0,                       my hair is very thick  i m familar with the denman brush because i have used my mom s before  i finally bought my own  i love the sturdy construction of this brush  it s a must have for my hair care to really help with detangling my mixed girl curls lol i highly recommend this for anyone who wants a well constructed detangling brush if i could get some rubber on the handle of this puppy to grip better when wet with hair products and water  i would be ecstatic  but it s still worth   stars      
331,3.0,                       the first time using this brush i loved it but then my  nd time using it  it broke  it s easy to put back together but every time i brush a section  i have to push the backing back down  very frustrating because i did like the number of rows i have type  b hair and am back on the search for better brush     
332,1.0,                       hate it gave it a try because of the great  reviews  i have shoulder length curly hair it took forever to detangle in the shower i m sticking with my wide tooth comb that works wonders for my hair not this brush  don t waste your money      
333,5.0,                       this is a great brush  i have mostly straight hair  i bought one years ago and used it all the time  i lost that brush recently so i just ordered a new one  it leaves my hair tangle free  soft and shiny      
334,1.0,                       this was not like the one i ve had for years  i purchased it to replace my old one which started falling apart  nothing about it was right  from the handle to the way the bristles  my old one was a denman too but i guess they really don t make them like they used to  i purchased another one because my daughter said it was good but i really don t like it as well as my old one either      
335,5.0,                       this has got to be my favorite and best brush i ve ever used to detangle wet curly kinky hair  also fast and easy to detangle and dry hair with a blow dryer  the bristles also feel great on your scalp not too hard or iritating  love the beautiful color i chose as well      
336,5.0,                       after years of straightening my hair  i ve gone back to my curly wavy hair  i m getting so confused on products to use  the curly girl method  etc  i didn t think it was a good idea to brush your curly wavy hair  but this is a miracle brush for me  after watching youtube videos  i found the correct way to use the denman brush and my hair is curlier than ever and keeps a curl  love this brush  well worth the price  love my curls now      
337,5.0,                       i had purchased another denman brush prior to this one and i was extremely disappointed  the bristles kept falling out one by one and i was upset because i paid quite a bit for it  this one though  it works extremely well with pulling through my hair and untangling without any hassle and in fact gives my hair a great curl pattern     
338,5.0,                       a worthwhile investment  detangles my hair like no other brush without pain  it also detangles much more thoroughly than my fingers ever could  also  i love how you can remove bristles to make the comb wider  for reference  i have  a  b hair and i use this for wash and gos      
339,5.0,                       it is the best brush money can buy   made in england   it lasts forever   i ve had mine well over a decade and bought another one for my wife   my old one is perfect after all these years      
340,5.0,                       after many  many years  my old d  brush pad finally separated from the handle   i am glad to see this is still made in uk  and very happy that it hasn t changed  or  improved    still the best       
341,5.0,                       just used this brush for the first time yesterday  i am a black woman with  c  a hair super thick and mid length to long  distributes the product evenly  detangles and smooths and clumps my curls together  i didn t think my hair could be frizz free and not poofy  an afro is cool  but now i have better control of how my hair behaves  awesome try it      
342,5.0,                       i loooove denman brushes  great at detangling my daughters  a curly hair i do end up buying a new one yearly just because i m hard on the bristles      
343,5.0,                       i am in love with my denman brush  this brush works wonders on my children s  ages   and    hair  it leaves their hair detangled and their curls defined  it s a great brush for those with natural hair      
344,3.0,                       the box was pretty banged up and the brush wasn t even in it  the brush was in the amazon envelope  i had a denman when i was younger and the quality is no longer the same  it s very top heavy      
345,1.0,                       it is not oryginal denman brush      
346,5.0,                       i think i saw this brush on lisafreemontstreet  beauty vlog on youtube  and it reminded me of my grandmothers beauty drawer when i was a kid   i ordered the brush on amazon and i m      in love  i have short  fine straight hair so brushes aren t a huge battle  personally  but   my daughter has fine curly hair and it s  a nightmare to comb out  this brush has cut her post bath routine in half  mostly by eliminating her screaming and crying  thank you denman      
347,1.0,                       the brush looks like it s a knockoff  i just got it in the mail and i went to use it and right when i looked at it  it was falling apart  i was looking forward to using this brush  i was going to put on the return   damaged product  but i m pretty sure this is a knock off and my only option was to get a replacement item or have amazon put the money on an amazon gift card   i don t want any of those options so im just returning it as an item i don t need anymore  i ll just go to sally s beauty and buy one      
348,5.0,                       this is amazing  i use this after i put products in my hair and it defined my curls        
349,5.0,                       this brush is awesome for adding definition to curls and making sure product is evenly distributed  the   row is perfect for me  i use it to detangle too but my hair doesn t get very tangled since cutting the dead ends off  might not work as well if you needed serious detangling power  i would definitely recommend      
350,5.0,                       this is a great brush   it is good for natural hair  detangles and aligns the curl pattern  and is a good solid brush   the weight feels good and the bristles don t come out   i am happy with this purchase      
351,2.0,                       i like that the teeth of the brush are long enough to detangle my hair effectively however the amount of time i had to spend on the process was aggravating because the brush part kept slipping out of the purple handle  why is this made that it can detached  for this price  i should be able to use it in any direction i like without it falling apart      
352,1.0,                       after using it only one day the brush completely fell apart and i had to throw it away    cheaply made and not worth the money     
353,5.0,                       denman brush proved amazing  i love that it s a heavyweight brush  you know it s good quality  and it clumps my curls so well after i style it  would recommend      
354,4.0,                       great product and it makes a difference when detangling my hair  however  i started to notice that the part where the bristle is located tends to slide out of place   not sure why that happens but it has occurred with my product   i m still able to use it by sliding it back in place but it is kind of annoying to have to do that  will buy again once i m unable to use the product any further      
355,5.0,                       works great on my  b  c hair      
356,5.0,                       works on every type of hair      
357,4.0,                       this has really helped me detangle my curls and style them correctly  the only complaint i have is that i noticed the rubber part with the bristles wasn t placed into the handle very well  it works fine  it just makes it look kind of cheap  looks aside  this is a great product for anyone with textured hair      
358,5.0,                       i love my denman brush  good sturdy quality  i only use it when my hair is wet and it detangles the hair with ease mixed with the right product in your hair  my hair is  a texture and i didn t see the need to remove any rows yet      
359,5.0,                       i finally found a brush that works just right  the previous ones i ve used would all destroy my waves  this one feels so much better while brushing  and i love the colors on it      
360,1.0,                       i really dislike this brush  the bristles are hard and close together so honestly i don t understand why people recommend this for curly afro hair  it pulled my hair out with every brush starting from end to root      
361,5.0,                       good product     
362,4.0,                       detangles and clumps curly hair well  though i don t think it helps with volume      
363,5.0,                       i originally purchased this brush in january and liked it so much that i ordered a second brush that arrived today  all  brushes are not the same  this brush is the perfect size  lightweight and truly allows air to infuse your hair  i have a drawer full of brushes  i think most of us do   that i will be getting rid of  the  nd brush is for my purse cosmetic bag  don t waste your time with cheaper brushes   just get one good brush  this is the one      
364,3.0,                       a lot smaller than i realized   great for teenagers or younger     
365,5.0,                       a perfect brush for your vehicle and shaving kit   so i ordered   more      
366,5.0,                       but you do not need it to accomplish what it does  difficult to hold  i would like a non slip handle  i think a shorter brush would be ideal      
367,5.0,                       when hair is wet  it brushes the hair into a nice smooth curl pattern  didn t think it would make a difference from other brushes  but it really stood out in the end     
368,5.0,                       bought it for my wife  she loves it     
369,2.0,                       look like a cheap manufactured brush for          
370,3.0,                       i love  denman brushes  this one is a travel size or child s brush  my mistake   i should ve paid better attention when i ordered it      
371,5.0,                       this is a styling brush for curls    that is its purpose it s not for detangling  its so great at making every single curl of mine look like a perfect ringlet as if i finger coiled it myself  everyone compliments my hair more than before   with the styling products i use to help hold the curl  i rly recommend     
372,5.0,                       this is a great brush and definitely defines my curls  i have what i think is  b  c wavey ish hair  it s thick and long  i m still figuring out the best way to use the brush but everytime i use it i get ringlets in my hair      
373,1.0,                       this is a counterfeit   imitation product in an old  reused box      
374,5.0,                       i don t know much about brushes but can say this is the best one i ve used and it doesn t break the bank     
375,2.0,                       it wasn t any better than the competitors     
376,5.0,                       i grew weary of my no name brush that i bought on clearance for    cents that routinely separates the handle from the brush  need i say more i finally asked my stylist which brush she was using for all stages of styling and ordered one  i m really enjoying this brush so much so that i ll likely brush my hair a lot more  i have fairly long  medium curly hair  no chemicals i may get a second one to keep in my truck for those days  you know  those  days when i m running late and only think i ve finished my hair     you definitely get what you pay for      
377,5.0,                       makes detangling my daughters hair so much easier and take less  it s less painful  makes beautiful curls      
378,1.0,                       received this and was excited until i opened it and immediately noticed the bottom and top was lifting  seemed almost dirty  so disappointed  wasn t even going to give it a try  returning immediately      
379,5.0,                       great brush for detangling my thick coily hair      
380,5.0,                       ever since my big chop this has been my go to brush  my curls are sooooo beautiful       
381,5.0,                       switched to this for my curly hair and i m obsessed     
382,3.0,                       ehh i have yet to see what all the hype is about  maybe it isn t ment for my  or my daughters hair types because i feel like it makes both of our hair more frizzy  i dont find it to be better at detangling  we purchased   different brushes and i am not at all impressed      
383,5.0,                       these are excellent quality brushes that will last you for years if you take care of them properly  i had my last one for almost    years  my absolute favorite brush of all time  works well in my  c  a hair      
384,4.0,                       handle grip not good very slippery especially when wet  good for detangling though      
385,5.0,                       detangles and leaves you with a lot less frizz then a regular brush  also a lot easier to clean  love this brush so much      
386,5.0,                       this brush is great for spreading product through my hair  thanks to manes by mell via youtube i have bought and fallen in love with the denman brush      
387,5.0,                       my hair is very fine and this brush is perfect for detangling      
388,5.0,                       i use this brush when my hair is wet and i put product in it  it styles my curls perfectly and it gets rid of a lot frizz that i would get when i used a normal brush  detangles great too     
389,5.0,                       do not use a denman for detangling curly hair   it creates really nice definition in curls   but make sure to detangle your hair first   i love that you can remove rows   if your hair snags easily i would recommend trying   rows first   very easy to clean      
390,5.0,                       love it  depending on how tight your curls are you might need to do smaller sections  also keep in mind that the number of rows should also be selected based on your curl type     
391,5.0,                       i love this brush makes my curls soft much more defined  detangles my knots without ripping all my hair out     
392,2.0,                       i bought this for my husband  he doesn t like it  saying the bristles are too rough  and it s way smaller than i thought  my bad      
393,1.0,                       fake   cheap quality to even keep  returned  buy directly from the denman website that s what i m going to do     
394,4.0,                       i saw so many curly girls raving about this brush  of course it was a must have for me  although  it is a very durable and well made brush i don t see how it really differs much from any other brush   i used to brush my curls out in the shower while conditioning with a wide tooth comb and feel like i had the same results as i do with this brush  nothing too spectacular really about it  but it is made to hold up keeping it on the shower so that s a plus   i gave it   stars  only because i don t see how it really is any different from any other same type of bristled brush  good quality and shipped super fast  even though i may use it every now and then i still use my wide tooth comb more often      
395,5.0,                       started leaning and implementing the curly girl method a couple of months ago   this brush was a game changer for getting product evenly distributed in my hair and creating the desired  slip    i was skeptical before buying   now i m sold on using this in my routine      
396,1.0,                       due to many reviews that stated the brush was damaged upon receipt or damaged shortly after receiving i was hesitant about purchasing this item  and i am glad for free returns because it did come in with part of the brush starting to split and another part coming out of the handle  i was excited to try it but will now try to find an alternate brush for my wavy curly hair      
397,5.0,                       i bought this brush for my  b c curly head little one and my husband uses this brush to brush his shoulder length hair as well  sturdy brush that works on all hair types      
398,5.0,                       this brush is the best thing i ve ever bought in my life  with one brush per hair section  my curls have never looked better  i have  b curls and this brush make them look beautiful     
399,5.0,                       live my denman brush i ve had it for   months and my curls are nice and in a nice pattern       
400,1.0,                       i was recommended this brush  and i have never used one before  but using it the first time the whole brush came out of the handle and came apart  not something i m going to continue to use  also really hard to hold if your hair is wet      
401,5.0,                       the bristles aren t as strong as i would like  i have thick  c natural hair  so i have to section really small parts in order to use this brush properly  other than that  it glides through without ripping my hair out  which is what i was looking for      
402,1.0,                       do not buy this  i ignored the other reviews saying this was fake  don t make the same mistake i did      
403,5.0,                       i love this brush  i have very fine hair and it makes it so easy to brush  without making my hair frizzy or static y  i also was surprised at the heft of it  it s heavy and definitely feels like it will last a very long time  great quality      
404,3.0,                       i prefer the krest teal tangle tamer because it is easier to get through my thick wavy hair all the way to my scalp      
405,4.0,                       this denman brush seems authentic  i believe that the supply chain has been worked out to ensure that counterfeits are not being sold now  i was wearing after looking at reviews  but as of      the counterfeit problems seem to be worked out      
406,5.0,                       the brush is definitely worth the hype  over all super easy to use  i thought this would work as a detangling brush as well but i found it better to use my normal one and this one just for styling      
407,5.0,                       best brush ever  smooths and doesn t hurt  love it      
408,5.0,                       definitely watch youtube videos to get full effect of the brush  otherwise it is just a brush      
409,5.0,                       love this brush  it detangles very easily  can t live without this brush  love it      
410,4.0,                       great brush  but you have to be careful because it can rip your hair out  i have  c hair   it does help the curls pop when used in small sections      
411,1.0,                       should have listen to the reviews  the box arrived messed up and the rubber part is already  unglued  if i could give this   stars i would  this is definitely a knock off  will be returning and ordering from this brands website      
412,5.0,                       works great with curly hair      
413,5.0,                       great product and easy to clean   i don t have to fight the brush to remove tangled hair      
414,4.0,                    mi calificaci n es de   estrellas  porque orden    cepillos y   de ellos me llegaron con las cerdas dobladas en general el cepillo me ha funcionado muy bien  en especial para el m todo curly girl  me encant  como me desenreda el cabello y lo bien que me ha funcionado para estilizar  my rating is   stars  because i ordered   brushes and   of them came to me with the bristles bent in general  the brush worked very well for me  especially for the curly girl method  i loved how it detangles my hair and how well it worked for me to stylize        
415,5.0,                       it works perfect for my son s curly hair       
416,5.0,                       as a black mother  this brush has been a lifesaver  it was reccomended to me from a friend who tried it on my   year s old hair  not only is his hair non porous  but his curls are extremely thick and tight  it was a nightmare to detangle and moisturize it  my hand arm would be tired or a comb would have broken  i no longer have any of those woes and his hair feels silky soft  i m in love         
417,5.0,                       hope it lasts as my last one     
418,5.0,                       i m a curly girl with  b curl type  i use the denman brush after i have detangled my wet curls and applied cream or mousse and gel  i stretch out the curl with the brush and scrunch it  the curls dry bouncy and shorter after using the brush and the curls look really defined  i was recommended this brush by another curly girl and it was so much fun to try this method of turning the brush under the curl  stretching it out and then letting go and shaking the curl to recoil  this is one of two brushes that i use  the other being a gentle wet brush   i would not use any brush to detangle curls  i use my hands only as per the recommendation of the curly girl method  i am very careful to not damage my hair  would recommend this brush and method      
419,5.0,                       i bought this brush to replace one exactly like it that i bough years ago  the rubber pad at the base of the bristles finally gave out  but boy did that brush do a good job for all the years that i had it  wow    it witnessed so many bad haircuts      
420,5.0,                       great for my kinky hair      
421,5.0,                       i have been trying to learn to love my naturally wavy hair and needed a brush that wasn t going to make my hair frizzy  this by far the best brush i have ever used  i love the way it de tangles my fine hair and defines my waves when i use it in the shower with conditioner  would totally buy again      
422,5.0,                       love the brush it give me the natural curly look i wanted for the summer  it is gard to hold when you have gel or conditioner on your hands      
423,5.0,                       after years of avoiding putting any brushes to my hair  a curly hair stylist recommended the denman  i tried using it after hairwashes  at a    degree angle like she said  and wow  my curls dry with so much more bounce and definition      
424,5.0,                       so far love it   don t use it for detangling   it does help define my curls     
425,5.0,                       works fantastic on my daughter s  b curly hair  i just have waves and it s too much pull so i dont like the outcome for myself i purchased it for my daughter  makes a huge difference on her curl pattern they come out consistent and evenly distributes hair product  one of the best hair tools i have for her hair      
426,3.0,                       too small for my hair  would be good for shorter hair  hard to hold when wet      
427,5.0,                       the denman brand is high quality      
428,5.0,                       i love the brush itself once i untangle my hair with an untangle brush i use this for my curly hair me i ve seen it makes my hair defined meaning once i let my hair air dry it looks as if my curls look more voluminous     
429,5.0,                       ok i finally caved in and bought this and this brush is a must  keep in mind that this is the  heavyweight  version of the denman brush and i can attest to it being sturdier and better when gripping in your hand than the other versions      
430,5.0,                       to use the brush for detangle  use it vertical   for smoothing  use horizontal  this brush makes your curls clump together  i really recommend      
431,4.0,                       sturdy and easy to hold     
432,5.0,                       i have used these denman brushes for about    years  got my first one in england many years ago  glad to know they still make them like they used to  other brushes in stores look similar but the denmans i think are just better feeling  nicely balanced in the hand  the correct spacing on the rows  just perfect  they are a little hard to find in stores in california these days so great that they can be had on amazon  i bought two and still have my    year old one  the rubber gets a little stiffer after that long but i still like it  i would have one suggestion  i drill a large hole in the end of the plastic handle so i can hang it on a hook on the wall  it would be nice if it came with a hole already      
433,5.0,                       perfect for curly hair  easy to use      
434,2.0,                       i had high hopes for this brush after reading the reviews but i m not sure what the fuss is about  it s decent for detangling but i comb my hair before i wash it  i didn t notice any difference in drying time or with styling i went back to my six dollar brush and i m using this on my dog      
435,5.0,                       this item was on my daughter s christmas wish list  we received all items several days before christmas       she was happy to receive all the items and   days later  she came by to celebrate her bother s birthday and her hair looked fantastic   bouncy curls  even her patients commented        
436,5.0,                       i use this every single day on my curly thick hair  it does a good job at separating the curls so they don t coil up together as much and it s great at detangling  highly recommend      
437,5.0,                       this brush is awesome  makes your curls look so good  going to purchase the   roll next         
438,4.0,                       i d gotten a knock off brand a few years ago but i lost it  decided i might as well buy the real thing  it works great on my hair i have about  c texture and my niece is about a    c it work great on her hair too  my only problem is the handle is kinda slippery so its a ting difficult to comb my hair in the shower      
439,5.0,                       love it  perfect size for the medium  great feel in hand and on hair  soft bristles that still cut thru tangles and leave hair soft without a lot of pulling or pain  the medium is perfect for travel and bags  not too big  not too small  would buy again as a gift and i m recommending to friends  thank you      
440,5.0,                       best thing for muy curls  i use it daily      
441,5.0,                       i m glad my sister introduced me this this brand it works best for my hair type      
442,3.0,                       had a round denman with the plastic spokes which they don t make anymore  the flat handle on this one i bought is nowhere near as comfortable to work with since it doesn t glide around in your hand while drying to blow dry hair  won t purchase this type again      
443,1.0,                       really not sure what all the hype was about   didn t work good on my curly thick hair  too hard to get through all the bristles are hard and close together  it just pulled my hair out and make it a nightmare to comb      
444,5.0,                       this brush brought out so much definition in my curls       i don t know how a brush can do that  but i can t go without it now      
445,5.0,                    si tienes el cabello rizado  ste cepillo es ideal para t  ayuda bastante con los nudos muy  til para desenredar si te cuesta mucho definirte con  ste cepillo ser  demasiado f cil hacerlo nota  puede que el cabello se te encoja m s de lo regular if you have curly hair this brush is ideal for you  it helps quite a bit with knots  very useful for detangling  if you have a hard time defining yourself with this brush  it will be too easy to do  note  your hair may shrink more than usual       
446,5.0,                       i have type   kinky coily hair and have always heard of the denman brush to detangle  it works great and also helps to smooth the hair and define your curls  would buy again      
447,1.0,                       i m pretty sure this isn t a true denman  everytime i would brush my hair the entire rubber part would slip out  ended up buying another from a different company and it s wildly better       don t recommend     
448,1.0,                       this is fake  i ordered denman brushes from the same seller a while ago and i have   of them  i just left them in alabama but i moved to ny  i don t know what this mess is and it s in different packaging       
449,5.0,                       does what it says  that s why it s used by the professionals  thank you brad mondo      
450,5.0,                       it s good for detangling curly hair  i use it with leave in conditioner  sometimes  it slides from my hand while brushing      
451,5.0,                       i always by another one if i lose it  it s the only detangling brush i love and use for dry hair  it s good for wet hair too but because i have a lot of hair i prefer to just use my shower brush from walmart when my hair is wet      
452,4.0,                       i ve had this brush for months  i gave it   vs   because after awhile the rubber piece kept slipping out of the brush  i clean it  place it back in tight  and it still slips out      
453,3.0,                       this product i have to say was just okay  after hearing all the excellent reviews about it i wanted to see for myself  i heard that this brush was perfect for better curls on curly hairstyles  however when using this brush  it completely wiped out my curls  i feel like you have to have a certain hair texture in order to get your curl to pop  and maybe mines wasn t the right type  i am a african american female with natural kinky hair  after detangling my hair and adding product i used this brush and my curl pattern was completely gone  this brush was also super heavy weight which i was not a fan of  you have to be super gentle with this  overall this product gets   stars as it did not work for me        
454,5.0,                       did not know all of the possibilities of the denman brush until i watch a video   it is the best for detangling and curling      
455,5.0,                       bought this as a gift  other brands just don t hold up over time  she loves it  thanks for offering this product      
456,5.0,                       love this brush  helps keep curls from getting frizzy     
457,1.0,                       product arrived defective  rubber padding was split     
458,5.0,                       great brush for curly hair  really gives my curls definition     
459,5.0,                       have used since my professional cutter told me about them    years ago  have bought for whole family      
460,1.0,                       very disappointing  like the other reviews said this brush is very poorly made do not order it just buy it from the original website or in stores but not here      
461,4.0,                       this brush is not good for de tangling   i purchased this brush for curly hair  it s easy to hold and works well on my hair after de tangling with a wet brush and using leave in products it helped section my curls nicely  this brush didn t disappoint      
462,5.0,                       excited to use this product  haven t used yet but i ve seen great video reviews for natural curly and coily hair update  love this product although it seems to pull out alot of hair compared to detangling with my comb      
463,5.0,                       works great on my curly long hair      
464,5.0,                       loved this brush  works great for styling  not a detangler  unfortunately it got stolen out of my car after a trip  great to travel with  worth the money  can t afford to rebuy it at the moment but will replace it eventually      
465,1.0,                       this is a fake brush and these people seriously should be sued      
466,5.0,                       this is my second brush after losing my first one in a move  this brush feels different  the color of the red rubber part seems different  idk  doesn t seem like the original product to me  edit  its held up really well and seems great after  a couple years of use      
467,4.0,                       i m a mixed chick with extremely tight curls and this brush is fantastic  it s doesn t disrupt my curl pattern and it gets knots out easily  definitely worth the money      
468,1.0,                       this is not a denman brush  i was very disappointed by the low quality of this product  returned it immediately      
469,1.0,                       i ve been using denman brushes for at least    years  i had purchased this exact item and thought the price was too good to be true but thought i d give it a shot  this is definitely a fake  the bristles were not smooth   they scratched my scalp and tore some of my hair out and the rubber started to come apart with the first few uses  buyer beware  paying for an actual denman brush through the denman store here on amazon is worth the expense  i know my next brush will last another    years      
470,5.0,                       i use this to help define and clump my curls  it works great      
471,4.0,                       i saw a video and the girl accredited this brush for her curls  i immediately bought it  it did not produce the beautiful curls i was expecting  to be fair my hair is wavy  but my daughter has ringlets  she tried it as well  she was not impressed either      
472,5.0,                       does the curls well  without getting stuck in the hair      
473,5.0,                       this brush was really good on your scalp  and it just lights through so nice      
474,5.0,                       love this brush   use on wigs and natural hair  one of my fav hair accessories       
475,4.0,                       i m impressed with this brush and i did not expect it to my hair is a current bob with the curls being on side and it absolutely defines my curls  i have not suffered through any shed and it does not irritates my scalp although once my hair grows it might be an issue because it is small in size  but no complaints since it is great for curly hair      
476,5.0,                       i didn t know this brush existed until a few months ago when i was watching a yt video for natural curly hair and i m so glad we found this brush  this brush is amazing    my daughter and i have natural curly hair and this brush works wonders on defining the curls      
477,4.0,                       i have medium to fine hair and it s wavy  a  b so it tangles easily  this brush not only helps to undo the knots that my hair makes but also helps me style the natural curls  although it fits in a purse it is not so practical to carry when you have cables and other stuff un your purse  denman should make a purse friendly brush  maybe smaller and with a cover for the bristles       
478,5.0,                       love this brush  it s great for detangling your hair      
479,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          my hair had never felt better     
480,2.0,                       i ordered this brush due to the fact that i see most of my favorite curly girl influencers using it on a day to day basis  i have been wanting to try it for some time now and finally ordered it  only to find that  unfortunately  this was not a quality denman brush  the brush was breaking in two different spots   looked like it would break at any given moment just from brushing my hair   getting snagged on a tangle  i will be returning  i recommended buying a real denman brush off the actual denman website      
481,5.0,                       fun color and functional     
482,2.0,                       this type denman is not for  b hair types  it probably works well for   curl types  but it made my  b curls way too small and frizzy  if you are a  b or  c  you need a denman with fewer rows tines like the d    lesson learned        
483,1.0,                       i was replacing a denman   row brush that i ve had for several years  this one is poorly made  the red part with the bristles keeps sliding off the black handle  the bristles are very hard and have no give  unlike my previous brush  i want to return the brush but it is not eligible for return      
484,5.0,                       i loved this brush so much i got   of them  one fore   one for my daughter  we both have very curly hair  my hair is more of tight curls   hers is a little more looser than mine  she also doesn t fight me when i brush it with this brush compared to other brushes     
485,5.0,                       i purchased this brush because i was in need of a brush that would hold up and not break like my other brushes has in the past when brushing course thick hair  i used this brush when installing my marley braiding hair and for those of you who has ever came across this type of hair knows how difficult this hair can be when combing or brushing  this brush has lived up to the test and held up very well  so if you are looking for a brush that can handle thick hair  look no more  i now carry this brush with me everywhere i go  i even had my sister ask me where i got this brush from  as she is a natural and loved this brush      
486,1.0,                       the rubber part with the bristles arrived falling apart  this may not be the real deal so i am returning it      
487,5.0,                       i got thos to help define my curls  so far i love it  best hair days i have had in awhile      
488,5.0,                       this brush is amazing  as a woman with thick  long  curly hair i typically avoided using a brush on my wet hair  and definitely never dry  however  after watching a several videos on youtube of people trying out the brush i figured i would give it a try  it s so cheap  it s worth the investment  i have a   row brush  the denman brush is now a permanent part of my hair washing routine  i use it during my shower  and after to brush my hair styling products throughout my hair  this brush works so well to ensure i fully detangle my hair before it dries  after brushing  i get big beautiful curls  and don t have to worry about any knots  or kinks ruining my hair style      
489,5.0,                       highly recommend to anybody that has curls  waves  kinks  coils of any kind  whether you are natural  transitioning  want more definition  distribute products evenly  then yall need to stop sleeping on this      
490,5.0,                       i ve used only denman brushes for over    years and still love them   this particular model is the one i like best   it fluffs the hair without pulling it   it works well on wet and on dry hair and reduces static   i now order them for my whole family and they love these brushes too the brush can be taken apart for thorough cleaning and seems to last forever      
491,5.0,                       the denman brush is well made   small size fits nicely into a purse  it has strong bristles great for thick hair  my last one lasted over seven years  this brush is made in the  united kingdom  and comes in a nice box that would be a great gift  as well      
492,3.0,                       i wanted to make curls that would stay   it takes time and experiene      
493,5.0,                       the packaging was crushed and trashed  that was my only issue since the brush is kinda spendy  otherwise really great brush to detangle and define hair  i highly recommend for all curly girls       
494,5.0,                       my wife loves it     
495,2.0,                       brush came completely apart as i tried to detangle in the shower  each pass through my hair has the rubber sliding  being natural  thats a headache to have to keep stopping to put the brush back together  i purchased because i ve had no luck with the smaller versions with less teeth  guess my hair is too thick for the denman brushes      
496,3.0,                       i don t know if i miss read the description or something but this brush was way too small for me  i have super long thick hair and even in my small hands the brush was a hassle to use      
497,5.0,                       this brush is great to use for natural hair  it helps detangle easy to hold and light weight  personally i hate the price has jumped on this brush  now that you have more people going natural this price of the brush everywhere has increased  however  it worth it      
498,3.0,                       i had to try it on my  b curls  did a good job of distributing product but epic fail at clumping  maybe shorter hair would have better results  idk but this technique resulted in way to much frizz for me      
499,5.0,                       my daughter uses it to style her curly hair   definitely a lot more definition of her curls   uses it every time she styles her hair   loves it so far      
500,5.0,                       sturdy  detangles great with wet hair     
501,1.0,                       not a real denman brush  very bad quality      
502,5.0,                       i love my regular size denman hair brush and was excited to see one in a smaller size   this size fits into my travel bag perfectly   i use my regular size brush for both myself and my daughter when we travel to brush our wet natural hair  i look forward to our next out of town trip so that we won t have to pack the big denman  great buy        
503,2.0,                       the brush is way too expensive for what it isdon t waste your money      
504,5.0,                       this brush has helped my otherwise wavy hair turn back into the beautiful curls i once had  as long as i have a product with slip  this brush glides through my hair and leaves it perfectly styled      
505,5.0,                       same good quality as years ago     
506,5.0,                       i can t rate this item  it was a present     
507,1.0,                       this thing comes apart ever time i brush my hair  a cheap piece of junk      
508,5.0,                       this brush was hyped by a male model as something that made a huge difference in his hair styling  it is clearly a sturdy brush that will probably last forever   just don t lose it and this is the last hair brush you will ever need   very high quality but as far as being better for styling than any other similar brushes     no magic hair styling here      
509,5.0,                       i like everything about this brush it came on time and was as described will buy again     
510,3.0,                       like others have said  it s poorly made  possibly a dupe     
511,5.0,                       helps with curly hair     
512,5.0,                       hands down the best hand held detangling brush for  c hair      wet your hair and watch how this brush guides through your strands while igniting your natural curls   coils  pure bliss     
513,1.0,                       i haven t used the brush i just received it today so i can t say exactly how it works but i feel like i ve been ripped off my money because this brush looks like it s been used and given to me  the piece around the brush that s used to secure it is ripped and there are marks on the brush      
514,4.0,                       it s okay  i wish i got a bigger one  kind of hard to brush when using in the shower  other than that it s a good product if you don t have a ton of hair     
515,5.0,                       needed this brush for natural hair and wigs slides of the handle a few times but easy to replace in all  i like it     
516,5.0,                       love     
517,5.0,                       this brush is a dream come true   the bristles do not fall out as do the cheaper versions   my hair is thin  fine and tangles very easily   wet or dry  this brush just glides through my hair addressing the knots painlessly and effortlessly   the expensive boar bristle brushes never felt like nor were they going through my fine  limp hair as well as being too short to touch my scalp   i purchased one to use on my doodle and poodle and it does a fantastic job and the dogs are so much happier with it than the wire brush   i do not tend to write reviews unless a product is excellent  terrible or can be used in a way that can become a choking hazzard for pets and or infants and toddlers   for me to write this brush is excellent is  really saying a lot        
518,5.0,                       i have used this style denman brush for many years and will forever  i have never had one wear out or break  i did lose mine so i ordered a new one  it is great for wet and dry hair  for styling and detangling  it s great       
519,5.0,                       i have curly hair and have been having my hair blown out for almost    years weekly  i finally decided to let my curls live  i am now nurturing back my curls and this brush is amazing  every curlyhead should  own one  the best      
520,5.0,                       best brush i ve bought in a while  easy to clean and use  easy to detangle my curly hair      
521,1.0,                       not what i expected  its a cheap brush  i would return but is not worth my time returning  you get what you pay for  too small  cannot handle my long  thick  curly hair  so disappointing      
522,5.0,                       i absolutely loovvveee this brush    it defines curl clumps incredibly  as you can see from my pics above  it makes a huge difference  the first pic is just using my regular wet brush which gives nice curls but they are frizzy and less voluminous  the  nd pic is with the denman brush and the curls are way more defined  shiny  and virtually no frizz  the only difference in my hair routine for both pics is just slightly more gel in the  nd pic for more hold  so the brush definitely is the reason for the major improvement  the brush is also really cool cause you can remove the bristle pad from the brush and take out some of the teeth to experiment with the size of the curl clumps but i love the result as is  if you need suggestions for styling naturally curly hair with a denman brush  i highly recommend  manesbymel or  jaymejo on youtube  hope this helps      
523,3.0,                       the bristles get too soft after a few minutes on high with a blow dryer      
524,5.0,                       these are great brushes   i have had a few of them but seems every break up i have had the brush went with them   just because they are low in cost doesn t mean they are lacking in quality   it shouldn t be a problem to have these brushes last a few years as long as nobody takes it   also  the black i feel is a little more discreet then the red   if same price i say go black      
525,5.0,                       works well for my relaxed hair while wet or dry      
526,3.0,                       this brush lives to it s weight description  it feels well built and feels comfortable in your hands  the  smooth  round edged pins  are not so gentle on my scalp  i can t comb my hair using the handle as that puts too much pressure on the pins which press into my scalp  instead i have to hold the brush by the head and use it that way so that i can adjust the pressure while combing  the pins are really stiff if you re looking for a stiff brush   overall  i will continue to use this brush  but i think it s just okay      
527,5.0,                       got wavy hair and this is awesome  my daughters curly hair it was not working for tho     
528,3.0,                       curly gal here  this was like any normal brush for me  i didn t notice any difference  i tried all the techniques on all of my brushes and my hair turned out the same with each experiment      
529,5.0,                       this brush has made my lufe so easy  i have  c really kinky coiled hair and all i have to do is put some conditioner  i used the shea moisture shea butter detangler as a live in  and hold my end brush is and done  i could not believe that detangling my hair used to take me hours and now i can do it in    minutes and some times    before leaving the house all because of this brush  best brush ever      
530,1.0,                       not a real denman brush the photos i will post will show the brush bought on here  the black brush with red rubber  and the brush i bought directly from denmans website  which is red with white rubber the quality of this brush is sad  it ripped my hair out and ruined my curl pattern      
531,5.0,                       i would never have thought that i would spend almost    bucks for a hairbrush  but after seeing so many curly girls swear by the darned thing for wet brushing leave ins and curl shaping  i had to try it and i m really glad that i did  i feel that this was a great investment  as it is sturdy  i was on my  rd brush of my former favorite brand  after having dropped them and the plastic handles broke off   this brush has only hit the floors couple of times because my hand was slick from the leave in conditioner  how you run it through your hair determines the volume of your curls  i have a flat spot on the crown of my head  and wet brushing it straight up and then shaking it out  i have volume i hadn t achieved before i ve been using this brush religiously since early april and don t have anything bad to say about it  if you are getting into embracing the beauty of your natural curls  i recommend this brush highly  it is built for the long haul      
532,5.0,                       first picture was before i had the brush  used curling methods from youtuber  manes by mell   next picture was with the brush  and wow  so much more defined  she recommends this brush for natural curls and i m more than happy with it            
533,5.0,                       i m a guy with long thick curly hair and i love this brush but my hair type i can only brush fresh out the shower with conditioner this has been the best brush i ve used in my life and i m        
534,5.0,                       i ve been natural all my life and i m    i ve never had a better brush that helps get out the kinks and make beautiful curls at the same time most of my brush with start breaking at this point but this is made for thick hair     
535,1.0,                       it doesn t work like it shows in the video  it does like every other brush and just makes my curls turn to a frizzy mess  not happy      
536,5.0,                       i ve been using denman brushes for many years and always considered them to be the best this particular one  which is full size model d     i actually bought by accident thinking it was its smaller travel size cousin  the d   both have   rows and are difficult to distinguish from the pictures although the   row models  as opposed to the   and   row ones  aregenerally recommended for short hair  rather than return it for the d   i offered it to my daughter in law who has long  straight  thick hair and she loved it saying it was better than what she was using so much for the short hair theory as it seems this will work well for all lengths you can t go wrong with the versatility and durability of a denman      
537,5.0,                       love this hairbrush  i have really curly hair and it works amazingly      
538,5.0,                       nicer than expected  i ordered the pink purple version and it came with the brand logo on the handle like it should  and is very nice quality  it s also a lot easier than i thought to remove some of the bristles for my curls  highly recommend and would buy again      
539,5.0,                       i have had thick  curly hair my entire life and have never been able to achieve the fullness and curl definition that i can with this brush  super easy to use and it takes five minutes to create the perfectly separated curls that every curly girl wants  i watched youtube videos to learn how to properly use this brush and i m so glad i did  this brush works on wavy hair too   love it      
540,3.0,                       brush detangles well but it feels like the bristle piece is gonna fall out  doesn t feel secure  waste of money      
541,5.0,                       i like it   its a brush   not too hard   not too soft   not too dense   just right   i have not cleaned it yet but it can be disassembled and cleaned   that s an important feature   so far so good   will recommend it     
542,4.0,                       this is a great brush for detangling and styling natural hair  but denman  it s      and time for an upgrade to the handle  it s hard to hold because it s too small and slippery when your hands have product on them  time for an ergonomic handle that is slip resistant      
543,5.0,                       yes do it  i even recommended to my sister for my   yr old niece who has super long mid tight girls and they both love it  total game changer  knots i don t stop for her    it s worth a try and it s a company that has a good reputation      
544,5.0,                       the bristles on this brush are soft  great for my thin fine hair and when i add my gel to freshly washed hair along with my leave in conditioner  my curls pop  very good brush  glad i purchased it     
545,3.0,                       the bristles are not as strong as it used to be  the brush rubber isn t as sturdy as once was  it will detangle but not as easily  as my past brushes  i hope to find a denman brush as strong and sturdy as those sold in               
546,5.0,                       i have used this product for many years   each brush will last   years if taken care of properly  we used these brushes in our beauty salons for many years also   i was having a hard time finding this brush at the professional beauty supply houses   so glad to find them on amazon  good price      
547,5.0,                       it works perfectly for curling my hair as well as straightening      
548,5.0,                       i have  c to  a type curls and i ve been told to use a wide toothed comb but this helps more  it clusters my curls together better and makes them look uniformed  my curls are less confused  love   love  love  definitely recommend      
549,5.0,                       i have wavy hair and maybe i m just not using it right  it seems to stretch the wave out in my hair     
550,5.0,                       that s a great brush     
551,5.0,                       best brush that i ve ever used  it does a great job  is easy to clean  and is well made so should last for many years      
552,4.0,                       it kind of works but i feel like i got the same results with my other brush and hands      
553,5.0,                       i love my   denman brushes and don t see how i ever styled my curly hair wigs without one  it is like the holy grail of hairbrushes  i basically had a huge collection of similar brushes but they did not detangle or define like my denman  i was so over protective of my brush so i ordered one for my teen daughter so that she would not use and misplace my brush   i love my denman brush      
554,5.0,                       this brush is amazing for your curls  it really defines your curls and they last for days  do not forget to section your hair      
555,5.0,                    bueno para peinar good for styling       
556,1.0,                       buyer beware  i struggle to even call this a genuine denman brush  as i grew up using them all my life  i purchased this   row and after i pulled the rubber out to modify it  it will not go back into place  i ve done absolutely everything i could  even had my husband do it in case i was just losing my mind over nothing  nope  according to the denman website  we were doing everything right  i looked at youtube tutorials  and read every instruction i could  not a single thing on this issue  everyone seems to be able to slide the rubber back into the plastic brush handle except for us  we wet the rubber in hopes that it would slide easier  it got halfway in with a full body weight of pressure  we tried so hard to push it in the rubber bowed and flew out of the freaking thing  all our hard work  undone  i was so upset  but as stubborn as i am  i didn t give up  my last resort was to apply coconut oil to both the rubber and plastic ledges  after more carefully applied body weight pressure  and    minutes of it might i add  it is now almost all the way in  forget the last inch  this literally got one use and is complete garbage now bc the exposed inner plastic of the brush handle will catch on my hair and break my hair if i try to use it the way it is  i d give this   stars if i could  and possibly the middle finger      
557,1.0,                       this product fell apart before i even had a chance to use it  i washed it before using it and it fell apart  i m not sure if i received a defective one but i will not repurchase  one    too many      
558,5.0,                       to start off  i d like to say that this brush is amazing  it has changed my hair completely and i use it in curly hair routine almost every single day  i have very thick  course hair that i have find trouble finding good products for  so i am happy that i found out about the denman brush  the purpose of the denman brush is to   define curls  detangle  and smooth the hair   and i can confirm that the description is accurate  and this brush successfully does what it s supposed to do  this is gentle alternative of detangling curly hair than a regular paddle brush  which is a big no for curly girls because paddle brushes can cause damage and breakage to already naturally dry curly hair  the denman brush has made it easy for me to get big knots out of my hair without causing split ends  it also causes my hair to clump together and i love how defined my curls come out because of this brush  there are seven rows on the rubber pad and these rows can be removed to create bigger or smaller curl clumps depending on how many rows are kept in  i love that this brush creates such beautiful curls instead of stringy looking hair  i used to have trouble with my hair never clumping together and it would basically look like  ramen noodle  hair  but this brush solved this issue  the denman brush also smoothens my hair and create a uniform sleek curl and prevents my hair to frizz up  the description also says that this brush is   ideal for creating tight curls  root lift or for shorter hair   and i m happy to agree with this statement as well  my curls do look tighter and have more of a coil when i use this brush in a certain way  i ve noticed that a lot of people don t know how to use a denman brush to create coils and will quickly give it a bad review  but there is a specific way to use it  to achieve coily curls  i brush my hair from underneath and start turning the brush to make a spiral  in other words  i coil my hair around the brush  it s basically the same process as curling your hair with a flat iron  it also does cause my roots to be more voluminous and prevents my hair from becoming flat and sad  i highly recommend the denman brush to every curly headed girl out there because i strongly believe that i will become your best friend and make your curly hair routine way easier      
559,3.0,                       not what i was expecting  not  good quality      
560,4.0,                       great brush for curls just not the best for detangling  broke twice but easy to reassemble     
561,5.0,                       i bought this brush   years ago and she is still good as new  it works wet and dry and doesn t pull out my hair      
562,4.0,                       i saw someone use this brush to curl their wet hair and since my hair is curly wavy i thought it d be great to add more curls  unfortunately it hasn t worked for me  i don t understand how she did that  but for blow drying my hair it works great so that s the up side      
563,2.0,                       brush came dirty and looked used      
564,4.0,                       i heard so many of the natural hair girls on the internets talk about this brush when i first went natural  but didn t think it would be effective for my hair type  since purchasing i have used it to detangle a few times and it gets through my kinky  c hair pretty well  it doesn t rip my hair out  which i chalk up to both the brush and patience when detangling kinky hair  i wish there was a better grip on the handle though  i have sent it flying across the room a couple times when the amount of product on my hands made holding it comically difficult      
565,5.0,                       all time favorite brush  my daughter has thick curly hair   it works wonders  the brush teeth are not super hard but they get the job done with ease      
566,5.0,                       this brush cut my drying time so short   love this brush  i have curly hair and this brush made combing out my hair so easy to blow dry  my hair was so straight once i flat ironed it   i definitely seen an improvement  even my curls looked better      
567,5.0,                       i really like my brush  great for detangling      
568,3.0,                       this isn t the quality i expected for a twenty dollar brush  the edges of the rubber are ragged  and the rubber itself is so soft that i m afraid to try to slide it out of the handle like you are supposed to be able to do  the handle itself feels sturdy  but i don t think the rubber part of this brush will last very long before the top tears away from the sides that hold it in the handle  i ll be returning this      
569,5.0,                       good     
570,5.0,                       it detangles and defines curls well and is very easy to clean      
571,5.0,                       brushing hair when blow drying      
572,2.0,                       love the type of brush great to clean and adjust but it s not sturdy at all this brush constantly slips apart while brushing  spend the money get the real deal the headache is not worth it     
573,5.0,                       love  clumps my waves together to reduce frizz and to define my hair update  i use this brush every single time i wash my hair  it makes my hair look so much more defined  i cannot imagine not having this brush      
574,5.0,                       i love my denman brush at work  i wouldn t have had to buy one but mine grew legs at work otherwise they last forever     
575,5.0,                       i have wavy  heavily bleached   color treated caucasian hair  usually use boar   plastic mix brushes  like mason pearson type  those are great but tend to get buildup of hair   product debris quickly  i honestly don t even remember buying this brush  amazon   late nights   surprises   but i m really glad i did the brush does its job perfectly  and doesn t cause any harm or unneeded breakage to my fragile hair  it s easy to keep clean  too  and the bristles are gentle  and feel really good on my scalp if you re looking for a synthetic hairbrush  this is a great option  give it a try and be    surprised        
576,5.0,                       this brush is great  i almost didn t buy it because some reviews are claiming the crush is fake  to me  the brush seemed legit  it came in packaging that looked identical to the normal packaging and the brush is high quality  i only bought this brush because of few videos i ve watched have highly recommended it and i was skeptical but willing to try anything after using devacurl which was slowly ruining my fine curly hair  i am so glad i bought this brush  my curls are gorgeous and it s thanks to this brush        
577,5.0,                       i used to work in a salon   this has got to be the best brush for curly hair  really helps define curls      
578,5.0,                       works great with my curly girl methods and love it      
579,1.0,                       horrible   so heavy and rough   do not purchase     
580,4.0,                       i appreciate how it combs through my curls but  i still haven t exactly figured out how to properly use it  for not i just use it to comb through and keep hair intact before twisting  my curls look satisfactory      
581,5.0,                       i don t think it should be grade for detangling because it s not made for that but this works perfect and gives me and my son the best curls his hair is very kinky  c  vs mine is more  c and it shrinks his hair a lot but it looks nice and we always get compliments on our curls       
582,5.0,                       a staple in my hair routine     
583,5.0,                       heard of this brush through youtuber manesbymel  i m absolutely happy with this brush  right away i got compliments on my curls looking more defined      
584,5.0,                       bought this on stylist s advice to help with loosening buildup on my scalp   feels good to brush with it if like scratching your scalp  nice brush   not really seeing a difference in the buildup but can t blame the brush for that so not taking any stars away      
585,1.0,                       my denman brush box was already open  the quality of the brush was really bad  brush bristles were very hard  the brush padding looked like its coming off  looks like a fake or replica of the original  do not buy from them  it s not worth      sending the brush back today      
586,5.0,                       this product helps wonderfully to detangle and style wet curly hair  it s the only brush i ll use on my hair while wet  my first one lasted years  this is my second one  the purple pink color combo is fun  and it feels very sturdy  as expected      
587,1.0,                       sadly this doesn t seem to be the real thing  very poor quality for any type of brush      
588,5.0,                       if you have the right expectations  this brush was worth it to me   i have curly hair and wanted help defining my curls after washing   once detangling and watching some you tube videos on how to correctly use it  it does exactly as i had hoped      
589,5.0,                       i had no idea how useful this product would be  i ve been on a mission to find tools and products for my newfound naturalness  it is quite the chore if you don t have the right stuff  this brush was the last missing piece  it detangles my hair easily and gets those curls poppin  this is a definite must have in your arsenal      
590,5.0,                       i have not used to blow dry so cannot comment in that  i am basically using on dry hair and is easy to use and goes easily through any tangles i would recommend      
591,5.0,                       i am so glad i purchased this brush  i ve read several reviews on this brush  out of sheer curiosity i purchased the brush  to see if it lived up to the hype  well  i must say it has surpassed my expectations  the first thing i noticed was its weight compared to the cheaper versions i ve used  it s very sturdy and best of all  it doesn t bend while i m brushing through my thick curls  i can t count how many times i ve had cheaper versions of this brush snap into two while in use     another plus is how well it detangles my curls  wet or dry with minimal hair loss  it s also easy to clean  this brush is now a permanent part of my hair care arsenal      
592,5.0,                       this brush is a game changer   i have thick kinky  c hair and it has cut my detangling time in half      
593,5.0,                       if you know how to use a denman brush  it works amazing  definitely has unforgiving bristles so i derange my hair first with a wet brush and then use this for styling my curls  it is definitely amazing at curl clumping  definition and frizz free styles  i avoided purchasing because i thought it was a dumb trend but i wish i didn t hesitate  it is a game changer for anyone who thinks they can t control their curls  tip  if your hair looks frizzy wet  it s going to be frizzy dry      
594,4.0,                       good for natural african hair texture   blow drying and wrapping with minimal shedding  however the original denman with white bristles and pink back is preferred works better      
595,5.0,                       i saw a blogger on u tube  her name is angela  fit curls  her curls always came out perfect  and she used the denman   row brush for volume and to form curls  i bought the brush hoping her method of styling her curls would be helpful for my curls   and it worked  i love this brush

600,4.0,                       it s good for styling but i can t use it for detangling  even when my hair s wet  my hair is too thick and it ll slide the bristles out of the brush if i m not careful       
601,5.0,                       love it  i ve been hearing good things about the denman for years and never bought in  but i finally did when i had a little extra cash  best detangling and styling experience ever  i have tried just about every detangling brush out there but this brush tops them all        would recommend    a  b  thick  coarse hair      
602,4.0,                       nice     
603,5.0,                       this denman brush is sturdy and glides easily through my thick kinky curly hair when it is wet or dry without pain  it does not pull or get tangled in my hair when i am brushing  this is a great brush for natural or transitioning hair      
604,4.0,                       also when you re brushing consistently holding the brush one way the bristles lean to that direction  but they go back eventually  very easy to clean out      
605,5.0,                       i heard about this brush from my hair stylist   a professional friend of hers uses this as his go to brush   as i have thick  wavy hair  it was a must to try   this brush work great to style   it grips the hair without tugging and does a nice job straightening hair   i also enjoy that the brush is not huge in size   for the price  you can t go wrong      
606,5.0,                       i was reluctant about purchasing this brush because of the cost  however  i love this brush  very much worth it     i have type  a curly hair  i ve also blow dried my hair with the brush  i achieved wonder results with wet and dry hair  i would definitely recommend this brush

609,5.0,                       this brush is awesome  i ve bought so many different brushes over the years and they all fall short of the glory of getting through my hair  i had heard of the denman brush before but didn t really think of it as being different from any of the other brushes i d bought  wrong  i can t tell you what specifically makes a difference   the material  the removable bristles  i don t know  but what i can tell you is that i wish i had bought this years ago  it goes through my hair with such ease  i even take it with me to the salon now because it s that awesome  it s super gentle on my hair and detangles with ease  my brush is modified   my hair is on the coarser side  if you re into hair types i range from a  a  b   get this brush  no substitutions      
610,5.0,                        nd purchase  works well on tight coils  excellent for use with deep conditioning treatment     
611,3.0,                       can t remove rows to alter  as in some models  i frankly noticed no difference  but ti may be worth it for longer hair     
612,5.0,                       it s a great brush to use after washing your hair  it makes the curls more defined and individual and springy  just need to learn how to brush it with techniques you can find on the internet  made my daughter s hair more impressive  worth it      
613,3.0,                       too small to actually have any real impact      
614,5.0,                       i have permed my hair for years  but now i am on a hair journey to grow it out natural   i did not know all these years that my hair was never really detangled   the first time i used this brush  while my hair was wet  i was amazed at the results   i only comb or brush my hiar when it is wet  which i have discovered is best   i threw away my other brushes and now only have this brush and a denman detangling comb      
615,5.0,                       there simply isn t a better brush on the market  it s tried and true   it stimulates hair growth  decreases static and frizz in the hair because of the red rubber material  great for the toughest of tangles  the very best features are it s construction  it s ingenious  my mother has had the same denman for over ten years  it s basically indestructible  unless you torch it lol  every single piece in this brush is removable for sterilization   i d mourn greatly if denman ever stopped making this brush  i use the heavy duty one as my hair is very thick  that one is black and white but this is perfect for medium thick to fine hair  get a denman  every house should have one  especially mixed race children  parents you ll bless the day you purchased it      
616,1.0,                       this brush is definitely fake  the packaging was open  the quality is poor  returning

624,5.0,                       i really like how this brush works to detangle my daughter s hair   it also does a great job to help hold the curl      
625,1.0,                       i have been using denman  this feels like a cheap knock off when i compared it to my old one  its is harder not as heavy and has cheap material  definitely gonna return  do not buy  at least not from deals for all       
626,5.0,                       it s a great brush   i ve only been using a simple comb for my curls but this brush is superior      
627,5.0,                       sturdy  i only use it to detangle  i don t like styling with this      
628,1.0,                       i can not believe i paid    dollars for this  terrible quality im convinced this is not the original product  its so wobbly  the red part is about to fall off  i want my money back      
629,5.0,                       great for separating curls     
630,3.0,                       does what it should  but you could buy one similar that does the exact same thing for a lot less      
631,5.0,                       love this brush on my thick curly hair       
632,5.0,                       yes   one word is all you need i m sure this brush is great for all hair types  but for wavy  kinky  or curly hair like mine   it separates and defines curls beautifully  clumps them all together with no knots  gnarls  or tangles whatsoever   i got this brush as well as a   row  as my hair is very thick and medium length      
633,5.0,                       it s a great professional brush but hard to clean  love the quality of the brush and well worth the money      
634,1.0,                       i obviously received someone s old return    need to quality check before shipping these out  really bummed i was excited for this purchase      
635,5.0,                       it s all about the brush  i can t stop brushing my hair   i just got this brush after reviewing all of the positive reviews on amazon  and i just love love love this brush   it massages my scalp  detangles my hair  no snags  no snarled   i had another brush i had for about    years with nylon bristles but there is no comparison to the denman brush   on a scale ofb  to    i give it a         
636,5.0,                       i ve been using this brush for years to wash my  b hair and it s the only one that consistently gets all the tangles out with the least amount of damage  if you brush while wet with conditioner      
637,5.0,                       i have fine  thin wavy curly hair and use this brush when my hair is wet and conditioned to distribute product  it moves well through my wet hair  i also use this brush on my sectioned dry hair before i shampoo to gently brush the tangles out      
638,5.0,                       my daughter   i love this brush  it s so cute  i do suggest using an actual detangling brush for detangling because these bristles are too stiff to run smoothly through the hair  i use it for styling my waves   her curls  i love that you can pull it apart to clean it  i wish all brushes had this feature       
639,3.0,                       heavier than expected  with lots of conditioner i m able to sweep through  i have noticed  difference in my curl pattern     
640,5.0,                       its great to style curly hair with  this is not a detangle brush  only styling  i highly recommend it      
641,2.0,                       the old version of this was much better  i m not sure if the quality changed or if this is made by someone else  but the bristles are thinner and it s showing wear after about   months  my previous one lasted    years      
642,5.0,                       bought this to help even out products in my curls and to brush out wet sections to leave my curls defined  works very well      
643,5.0,                       excellent  i ve used the denman brush for over     years and i m just now purchasing my second brush as the rubber that holds the bristles in the brush is getting worn      
644,5.0,                       this thing is magical  i can style my hair with literally zero frizz  it s wild  i love it     
645,1.0,                       i received my brush today and when i opened the box to the brush i had lint all on the brush and also the pad of the brush is lifted on both ends  it looks like i received a used brush when i paid for a new brush  i am not happy with this item and i want the brand new brush that i paid for not this used one i received      
646,5.0,                       okay  i have been hearing about this brush for over years on youtube and other places  i kept thinking  what the hell is so special about a brush    ladies  don t walk  run to place this order  i received it weeks ago and i used it after washing my  c hair  i ran this brush through my hair and omg     it was magic     i am hooked and impressed  i will be ordering another one soon  also  it arrived early        
647,5.0,                       it s nice to keep my natural curls more in line  detangling is perfect with this brush  please buy if you have natural curls   i wish i found this earlier in life     
648,5.0,                       love this for my wavy curly hair still learning and getting used to it but so far great      
649,3.0,                       this brush was good for detangling my  b hair  i hate washing my hair because it is such a pain to detangle it afterwards  tried this after reading some curly girl articles  i agree with many of the reviews that this may not be authentic  seems very plastic and poorly made for a real denman  the   row is still too small  and my hand hurt before i was done combing through my wet hair  this is too expensive for the quality  you can get a knockoff denman at walmart for a couple bucks   i may try ordering one from the denman website      
650,2.0,                       i have long  fine  curly hair and this brush was a nightmare  i purchased it to help with curl separation and this caused more tangles and ripped out my hair  not recommended      
651,5.0,                       great brush for detangling and curl shaping   handle a bit short but doe not take away the efficacy if the brush      
652,5.0,                       been following curly girl method for about a month now  without the brush  was using a wide tooth comb instead    used brush today and curls stayed intact all day   amazing product and worth paying a bit more for name brand      
653,5.0,                       still learning how to use this brush for my curls  so far it s giving me a lot of volume      
654,5.0,                       i love this for defining my curls  would not recommend for detangling  but i have a different brush for that  i like that it s easy to clean and you can choose to remove any rows of bristles    though i personally leave them all in      
655,5.0,                       this brush is no janky  flimsy tangle teaser  it is sturdy and has just enough bristles to detangle and smooth my thick  b curly hair  but not so many that it looks like an overhyped average brush  i noticed a difference in my curl pattern and overall texture when i used this brush before applying stylers  i feel that my hair is significantly less frizzy after using the denman brush  buy it right now     
656,5.0,                       i ve been using denman brushes for many years and always considered them to be the best  this   row travel size one is no exception i bought it to replace a similar one i ve been using for years that has been subject to much abuse that other brands would not have stood up to it works particularly well at volumizing shorter hair but is not at all restricted to that  it detangles well and even works well for longer hair  the size is just perfect for travel or handbag you can t beat the versatility and durability of a denman      
657,5.0,                       this denman works on my wavy hair   prompt delivery   recommend for wavy or curly girls      
658,5.0,                       nice     
659,5.0,                       i love my denman brush  some reviews were saying it didn t look authentic but mine looks like the real deal      
660,5.0,                       where has this been all my life   this makes my curl  cuurll  beautifully      
661,5.0,                       my wife bought one of these when we married    years ago  she just replaced it  nice to know that quality can still be hadd      
662,5.0,                       the results of using this brush   incredible  it is hard to imagine that a style or make of brush that has been around for so long is still the most effective in the market  i have naturally curly hair   b  c if you subscribe to that school of thinking  and it can become very entangled  since i have been using this brush  my hair is alot more manageable to detangle  less discomfort and less breakage or hair loss   the teeth of the brush also stimulate my scalp which is quite soothing      
663,5.0,                       i have  c hair which is the most thick and sensitive  so this works perfectly without breaking my dry hair  i wash  hold a section of my hair and brush the ends and work my way up  i love this brush so much and i only use it after a complete wash  it s amazing  great price too     
664,5.0,                       let me start with this is the best detangling brush i ve used  my hairstylist has been using this brush for years  she detangles and even uses blower with it  i recently did a balayage and when i would wash my hair at home and try to detangle with my other brush it would be hell  then i decided to buy this brush and since then it s been so much easier to detangle   saved me an extra hour in the shower      
665,2.0,                       i was super excited to use the brush but i didn t realize it was the mini  i should have been more careful and read lol but the brush is super nice i do see that my curls are now defined and bouncy      
666,4.0,                       i have had this brush for less than a week and i love it  i have  c  a hair type and it detangles my hair with ease  the rubber pad though slides out once it gets enough conditioner on it  i m not quite sure if it is supposed to be removable or not  shipping was fast and overall  i would purchase another denman brush most definitely      
667,1.0,                       out of all the products i ve ever received off of amazon this one is by far the worst  when it was received the packaging was just fine however the actual brush wasn t  the silicon beneath the bristles split apart and two of the bristles broke off when i was brushing a   year olds straight  wet  hair  when i used it to the find my own curlsi found that s all it did was separate them even more  i don t know what went wrong but i will not be purchasing again  these people are lucky that there is not a zero star option  do not buy      
668,5.0,                       i have used a roll style brush for a good while  i have slightly curly  wavy thick hair  the roller brush required a lot of work to get my hair to straighten out and take shape  this brush has cut done my time to   minutes start to finish  the amount of control it gives is unreal  the brush is a little top heavy which lends to help with the control and is very easy to clean  the grip is simple and comfortable  i would reccomend this to either male or female and any hair type      
669,5.0,                       i love this brush  it is worth the money  i have never untangled my hair this easily  really great for my hair  i don t see much hair on the brush when using it on my wet hair which is great  i haven t tried drying my hair with it as i am trying to stay away from heat and grow my hair out after cutting it into a bob  i bought it to help with my curly hair and i m so happy i did      
670,5.0,                       de frizzes my hair whether its curly or straightened      
671,5.0,                       i love it   it distributes my product evenly through out my curly hair       
672,1.0,                       haven t used it yet but my package came open  opened the amazon packagw and the brush fell out cause the deal was broker  rubber looks cheaply glued together with makes me question the authenticity  may return     
673,5.0,                       this was perfect for helping define my daughters curls    she gets so many compliments now     
674,5.0,                       i first heard of this brush from manes by mell on youtube  i m in the beginning stages of transitioning my hair and finger coiling is way too time consuming for me  so i took the dive to get this brush and omg this brush is amazing i first used it on my hair with only leave in conditioner then diffused it  the picture of me in white   i had a dust cut hair appt that day so i couldn t put product in it  when i got home i wet it  then added product and diffused again  the picture of me in black  this is probably the best curly hair day i ve had in months  and i really believe it s because of this brush  i will def continue to use it and love every moment too       
675,5.0,                       so much definition and curl with this brush  game changer      
676,5.0,                       i really love this brush it removes away all my tangles  i have very long curly hair  and it makes the work faster don t take long time brushing      
677,1.0,                       once i received this  i immediately noticed it was a knockoff   this is not the real denman brush  the red bristle section is loose and lifted  i returned it  i then ordered from the actual denman website and yes  it was the real deal       
678,4.0,                       overall its a good product  i needed it mostly for detangling  it does detangle without pulling out my hair too much      
679,5.0,                       absolutely love love this brush it s a game changer for curls      defines curl patterns like never before       
680,4.0,                       feels great on the scalp  however it brushes any hair product right off my hair     
681,5.0,                       i ve been trying to get my waves curls to clump together better and this did the trick  getting bigger curls with ringlets too  definitely recommend      
682,5.0,                       so if you have a curly lions mane you need this brush    i get the definition  the volume and bounce i want without frizz  it distributes your product like a champ but it is not to be used as a detangler whatsoever    it will pull chunks out like an angry high school girl fighting over some feels  i did remove two of the rows of bristles to allow an easier brushing experience  the handle is a little slick and hard to hold  just make sure you have all the product off of your hands before brushing  and for technique support check out youtube  hair goal life changer      
683,5.0,                       i purchased this awesome lil thing for my granddaughter who has thin coils  it works perfectly for my daughter and granddaughter  it cut combing time down     the time   which cuts down on fussing and crying and get a ways         
684,5.0,                       what  a great brush  i experience no breakage  he s my hair silky no puffiness  i love it definitely recommend it would buy it again     
685,5.0,                       not sure how i have been managing without this in my life  highly recommend  i try not to put direct heat on my hair since i am  c low porosity natural so i m not sure on how it is with drying      
686,2.0,                       for detangling is fine but the handle is to small my daughter has long but very skinny hand and still have trouble holding for who has thicker hand or long is a no no brush how can a brush has short handle           
687,5.0,                       this is my second brush like this my last one lasted me    years  it is an excellent quality brush you can t find anything better for short hair or long hair     
688,4.0,                       never did i think i woulduse a brush on my curly hair  it s pretty cool and easy to usei believe it is real because it s make in uk and that is an indicator     
689,1.0,                       i bought this brush for my daughter who has very thick and curly hair  on the  nd use of the brush  all of the rows of bristles fell out of the brush  it is very cheaply made  the only reason i resorted to amazon for ordering a denman brush was because sally s beauty supply was sold out  at sally s their denman brushes are the same price i paid for this one  please visit your local beauty supply store and try purchasing a denman brush from them first before resorting to this particular one  i only put   star for ratings because there was not an option to leave zero stars      
690,2.0,                       perhaps this isn t the best brush for fine hair because it actually hurt when i styled my hair  giving it to my daughter who has much thicker hair      
691,5.0,                       this is a great brush for controlling hair in the drying process  love love love it and have use this brush for years  needing a new one  was delighted to find this english import on amazon      
692,5.0,                       i have thick  shoulder length  curly  hair that i initially detangle in the shower with the tangle teezer   after i get out of the shower  i apply detangler styling product and then distribute that though my hair and continue to detangle using the denman brush    rows    this brush works really well for these purposes   after watching several youtube videos  i ve learned how to use the brush to form more defined curls and am quite pleased with the results   the brush itself is very sturdy and well made and seems like it would hold up well over time   i d recommend the denman brush for a gentle and effective post shower detangling and styling  especially for curly hair      
693,5.0,                       i have fine permed hair  i use this brush on my sopping wet curls and it was always just  meh   it was a fine brush  but i never felt like it did what everyone swore it did   but then i watched a tutorial of a curly girl using this brush the  correct  way and i am changed  my curls have never looked better  look up the youtube and instagram videos to see what i mean   it s a game changer      
694,5.0,                       we ve been extremely happy with this brush  it s great for getting out tangles without breaking hair

696,3.0,                       saw this brush raved about on youtube and had to see what it was about  this worked great in helping my hair get more defined curls in combination with a curl cream  problem was the red inner part completely came off the handle the first week in getting it  maybe i was too rough with the brush   anyway  works well just wish it didn t break so easily      
697,3.0,                       i would give   stars to the original red rubber d  but this all black one only gets    the pins are harder  sharper feeling and less flexible  i might be keeping it because it s for professional use and not personal  but i m thinking i might have some unhappy clients      
698,5.0,                       this brush has been amazing for distributing product evenly and adding definition to my curls  i like that you can take it apart easily for cleaning and customizing  a worthy investment in my opinion      
699,4.0,                       great for detangling but i m a little upset at the quality  i paid almost     for the brush but the branding peeled after the first use  not a big deal but it is upsetting as i m sure if i ordered from the original website that wouldn t have happened      
700,5.0,                       seems legit  shout out to the other amazon customer who recommended getting the purple one in her review   she said it was the legit one      
701,5.0,                       this brush had been a staple in my family for detangling for as long as i remember  i recently found a new way to use it  shaping my curls  i love it      
702,4.0,                       very firm bristles  cant wait to actually try it out

704,5.0,                       got this to help define my curls more   this thing was my best friend until my sister came in town and took it with her back nc  so i had to buy another locally from sally s  it s a must have if you have curly hair and     
705,5.0,                       i have curly  b  shoulder length hair and i use this as my everyday morning brush  i was looking for a brush that was not going to lose bristles or the tips and that would be easy to keep clean from lint the distance between the bristles is really great  the brush hasn t gotten a mildew y smell  the only catch is that it is on the small side and it took me a few weeks getting used to it  so far i m fine with the size but i would probably buy the larger size for comfort and keep this in my car or purse    it s about the size of a big phone      
706,4.0,                       great  my daughter is biracial and has curly kinky  hair and she is now able to comb out her knots in the shower instead of me doing it when she gets out  love this brush  it has helped prevent many tears   love love love this brush        
707,1.0,                       this brush came highly recommended by youtube by afro curly hair   product influencers to comb long curly afro hair  this brush is not worth         the brush is very cheaply made  very light weight  in a flimsy way   and the handle is too small for my hand  which i m embarrassed to point out  isn t very big for a man  when the brush arrived and i took it out of the package  i quickly put it back to return it  i can easily find a brush like this of similar quality at the dollar store      
708,5.0,                       this is a must buy if you have long curly hair that tangles or wear hair weave  it defines curls and detangles hair beautifully  i cannot imagine dealing with my hair without it  i purchased   for myself and   more for my mother and sister

711,5.0,                       as an african american female that usually goes to the hair salon on a routine basis and know find myself doing my own hair  this and any denman brush is a life saver      
712,5.0,                       this brush is amazing  although i dont use it to detangle in the shower   i find that it doesnt do to well on my hair for that i use the tangle teezer instead  but this brush works great for styling after i wash and condition  it makes my  c  curls look amazing  i used to just use a a big tooth comb but now i use the denman      
713,5.0,                       i got lazy and i don t comb my hair anymore and i prefer the messy look  but it s the best comb i ve ever used  it has different widths to help style your hair or roll it to add some volume or curls     
714,5.0,                       great brush   i just purchased and got the   row this time   my last brush   a   row   worked great too and it lasted many years   when you first start using this brush  gently brush your until you get used to the feel   it works very well to massage and clean your scalp      
715,5.0,                       these are the best brush    row is great for men     for blow drying women   i have hair salon and it s what i use   they last forever       
716,5.0,                       love this brush  as a hairstylist   this brush detangles and helps stretch out the hair for an easy blow  i love it especially for  a  c hair textures      
717,5.0,                       i use this to apply my product to make sure every single hair is coated  works wonders for my curls      
718,4.0,                       brush is well made  i purchased it for curling my  c hair and it works too well  it definitely curls my hair beautifully but i then get massive shrinkage  overall  very good product      
719,4.0,                       i do love this brush  it helps with static and is a dream when brushing through wet hair  bc of the rubber base  esp when i m doing some kind of treatment and don t want residue in my brush  however  i have  b hair so this brush isn t really necessary for my type of hair  i m considering getting the   row to see if i like that better since the only problem is really the width of the brush  fine haired girls will know what i mean when i say it kind of goes right through my hair to my scalp so i don t get the best resistance when brushing  not that i want much  like i said  i have the   row so i may just try the   bc i do like this brush a lot      
720,5.0,                       i ll be honest  i wasn t too sure about this brush just going by the picture when i ordered it  and i still wasn t sure when i looked at it in the package when it was delivered  but when i actually got it in my hands  my mind was put at ease  the brush is solid and substantial  the rubber is thick and feels very sturdy and long lasting  the bristles are not flimsy  i have extremely thick hair  and i usually keep it pretty long  and this brush goes right through it  my   year old also has thick hair that tangles badly if you look at it wrong  and it gets her stubborn tangles out easily  i am very pleased with this brush and will be buying the smaller version for my purse      
721,5.0,                       i looooove this brush  i have  c hair and i use it for styling only  it is not that great for detangling  i ve tried it once on vacation after forgetting my other brush   since it defines the curls so well it does cause some shrinkage  but with the right leave in and gel those curls can hold for daaaayysss  this is by far the best purchase i ve made for my hair  i do let my hair air dry too  i m not a huge fan of the diffuser for myself but many youtubers use a diffuser and their curls are poppin too     
722,5.0,                       awesome brush  i own a few of these  good design  easy to clean  good quality  well made  sturdy  will last a long time  glides through curls and straight hair  will continue to use this brand  great price      
723,5.0,                       makes all the difference for curl definition  in your natural hair journey  bought others not denman  but claiming to do with denman does  they don t  the handle  the bristles  quality  spend the money  cause it s not a lot  and its worth it      
724,5.0,                       i love this denman brush   i am mixed  black   mexican   dominican    been using denman s brushes on my curly hair for years  they last a very long time   are easy to clean the hair out of the brush and are such a great value because once you use it your hair will just glide through it when wet and conditioned and you get so man uses out of it for styling   i usually only buy it at sally s beauty supply but i didn t feel like going to the store and hunting one down so instead i came to amazon and ordered it here  i was a little nervous because i wanted it to be the exact same product and not a dupe   i m happy to say it is the exact same product    the only negative thing i have to say about the brush was that when it came in the mail the packaging the brush came in was all messed up but i could care less haha all i wanted was the brush       
725,5.0,                       forget these bad reviews   only good brush i could find without the ball on the end of each bristle   does not pull  tangle   a dream in the shower when conditioning hair   i have long hair  works great   i have   of them     
726,5.0,                       this brush is the holy grail if you have curly or wavy hair  wished i would have known about this brush sooner    saw an online tutorial on how to use this to get curly hair and i am amazed at how beautifully defined my curls are after using this brush  highly recommend but you need to learn how to use if first      
727,5.0,                       i absolutely loved everything about this product  absolutely changed my hair game  everyday is a good hair day when i use this brush  even after straightening my hair  which i do rarely to keep my curls healthy  but the curls just bounce back and look so healthy and hydrated   i m obsessed        
728,5.0,                       i love denman heavyweight   row brush d    with long thick hair it is a real necessity for managing style and care   i will continue to reorder from time to time   nothing compares to this product      
729,5.0,                       excellent brush and great quality  i was struggling to find a good detangling brush and everyone was talking about the denman and how good it was  the price initially deterred me but everyone was saying it was worth it  i ordered the   row and my hair is  c  a and it did wonders      
730,5.0,                       this brush is perfect for  declumping  curls  it does just what it says it will do  as far as drying power i can t tell a difference in the length of time      
731,5.0,                       if you have curly hair you absolutely need this brush  it has been a godsend  i have very thick curly hair and i stumbled on this brush when searching for products to help with curly hair and i am so glad i did  it brushes through easily but helps retain all the beautiful curls while getting rid of the frizz  my hair hasn t looked this good in forever      
732,3.0,                       brush broke my first use  the rubber peaked off from the base   very upsetting  i ve heard great things about this brush but with my luck i haven t gotten to do my hair with the brush      
733,5.0,                       my mother has been using her same hair brush that her beautician sold her in the     s  it had an acrylic wood grain handle with this same red rubber spine backing  and   rows of pliable black teeth  the kind without the balls on the end   well  after decades of use  the rubber finally cracked and split enough that she has been looking for a replacement  guess who s in charge of finding it   well  mom  they don t make those anymore  so you ll have to try one of these   she tries them  although indignantly  and settles on two  she has medium short  thick  wavy hair  but i really don t think that part matters as much as the fact that she s never had to try anything different for    years  after receiving this one and another product from amazon  you ll probably find a similar review there   she s decided that this one is now her everyday brush  it has the weight and feel of her old one  but i doubt it is made to last another    years  i know my mom isn t   for all   of you who are still using their     s hairbrush  and are nervous as to where to find a close replica  she recommends this denman brand  i recommend living a little      
734,2.0,                       ok so this item is definitely a fake     the quality is too shotty to be a real denman    i decided to try it anyway and it actually helped define my curls a lot  i still think i may return and get the real denman but i would venture to say it probably works the same     only you can buy  fake denmans  for only     dollars      very expensive for a fake     i would buy direct from denman     notice the  denman store  has no phone number     i like the results but i m pissed about the price and it being fake i feel ripped off and now have to go out of my way to return it to kohl s     i think i d rather just keep it     hoping it doesn t break on me         
735,3.0,                       watched all the videos and then twirl brushed my hair in the shower following shampoo and conditioner   pulled the upper layer up and went around my head twirling the lower layer   then did the upper   i applied leave in after by gently smoothing it over and then squished   it does make your hair curlier   my hair came out quite curly when it dried  more so than usual   the first   times i missed spots though and that was a problem as the rest of the head was curlier   there really is not a way to fix that   on the third try i got the whole head curly   i wash every   days   i kept randomly twirl brushing it all over after going around once to make sure it was all involved   my issue is that it did not overnight well   my hair is short and i sleep with it in a buff  which preserves the curls   but this kind of styling was not well preserved all over   again i ended up with one side still curly and the other not   therefore i will only use it for a special occasion on the day of   it looks great the first day if you need it for that evening  but it s too much trouble for every day  and it does not last in short fine wavy hair      
736,5.0,                       love it  why did it take me forever to find a brush like this  i used to dread brushing my hair now i do it with ease     
737,5.0,                       first i would like to say  the product arrived slightly damaged  rubber is lifting   see pic  it is not so bad to return  hope it doesn t get worst considering the cost  arrived on time      
738,3.0,                       i had less pricey combs that did better than these  if you have curly hair don t waste your money  just use the good old wide tooth comb     
739,5.0,                       it s easy to hold  i love how it doesn t pull my hair and it s feels very sturdy  i love the color combination  it s great at detangling my hair when my hair is thick corse with some curls      
740,5.0,                       use it in the shower when detangling my curly my hair      
741,5.0,                       love love love   this brush has been a lifesaver  i have very curly hair that gets extremely knotty  the brush is so gentle and gets all my knots out with ease  i use it in the shower with conditioner in my hair  i ll never use another brush again      
742,5.0,                       when i wear my hair natural and do a wash and go after i put the products in and brush my hair it defines my natural coils even the more      
743,5.0,                       it s probably the best brush you can buy i ve been using these brushes since i have been a kid easy to hold durable deranged without pain i promise u won t regret it     
744,5.0,                       this prouduct changed my life  less time working on my hair  quick  easy  tight curls highly recommended with wet hair  this is definitely a must have item  beats combing through your hair with your fingers the rubber   bristles are easy to remove  clean and attach back to the brush      
745,5.0,                       the brush was out the box when i received but there wasn t anything wrong with it   this brush is amazing for all of my natural beauties  great purchase for detangling     make sure your hair is wet though ofcourse      
746,4.0,                       this is a really excellent brush   i had bought this because so many curly haired people were singing it s praises  and it s true   this is a great dry detangling brush   i use it prior to every time i wash my hair   it s both gentle and effective  i lose far less hair than i did with my drugstore paddle brush   however  i wouldn t advise brushing your hair when wet   i did that once when i misplaced my detangling comb  and it was a little too rough on my scalp and hair follicles   also  although denman advertises this as a brush you can take apart for cleaning  the brush arrives with no instructions on how to do that  so i ll have to youtube it or something when i want to deep clean it   on the other hand  this is such an affordable brush i don t think it really matters note for other women with curls  i am caucasian with corkscrew curls  think of shirley temple  and hair that reaches my shoulder blades      
747,4.0,                       my hair is naturally curly but i think this brush works better than scrunching my hair myself  it is very easy to use  my hairdresser recommended it      
748,3.0,                       although this is a very innovative brush with the option of pairing down the rows from seven rows to any number of rows in between  it just wasn t the brush for me   i tried seven rows but wasn t able to detangle easily  so reduced the rows to four   it still didn t provide the results of ease in detangling   it was too rigid for me and the handle was too short    there is an option for additional   s to purchase a long handle version    it came down to personal preference   i prefer a much less rigid brush      
749,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i love the quality of the brush and how well it detangle a my natural  curly hair when wet    i did not lose any hair strands with detangling   it s also easy and effective when used while styling wet or dry hair  i recommend for anyone with curly  wavy or natural hair      
750,5.0,                       i swear by the brush  it s one of my favorites   detangles your hair and leaves your curls nice and soft       
751,5.0,                       i really loved this brush  it lasted for about   years before the handle broke   it detangles my natural afro kinky hair very well  the bristles themselves are intact  i bought a new one with a lighter pink bed but i do not like it as much   the structure of the bristles was not built as well as this one      
752,5.0,                       this brush is so versatile and effective   i can t say enough about it   it looks like an ordinary brush with plastic teeth  but it s different somehow   it really does coat every hair with whatever you are using   conditioner  mask  gel  or even hair color   i use it in the shower and out   when doing the final run through after applying gel  i brush my hair in small sections out and away from the scalp  and my hair is very fluffy  curly  and bouncy   this is one of the best hair tools ever      
753,5.0,                       i use it for curly hair styling when hair is wet of course and it works      
754,5.0,                       i have used this brush for years   it is a good brush fir short and long hair   i have had a bob and now my hair is shoulder length and this brush handles all lengths well      
755,5.0,                       this brush exceeded my expectations  overall  my curls are more defined and my hair has more volume  the first photo is my damp hair after using the brush   product  the second picture is after it had fully dried the next morning      
756,5.0,                       i don t know why i ve held off on buying this brush  i ve waisted more money on knock offs that didn t get the job done  my daughter has  c extremely thick hair  the denman brush is the first one i ve used  and i ve tried several  that got through her hair for a blowout  this helped cut down on drying time  i highly recommend this brush      
757,4.0,                       i got this denman   row classic brush a couple of months ago and i wanted to try it for some time before writing a review about it i really like this brush  specially because i  have  thin fine short curly hair  having said that  if you have very thick long hair the bigger one will be a better suit for you this one is very small  it almost look like for a toy doll but because of the type of hair i have is fine for me it s very good quality and i believe i ll have this brush for a long time      denman   row classic pocket styling brush                         no one paid  me for this review  i bought this product with my own money      
758,5.0,                       i have been wanting to try this brush for a while but never got around to purchasing it until just recently  wow  i was so shocked at how well it defines my curls  the brush was well made and easy to hold  it s for styling  not detangling  so don t use it to detangle your hair or you ll end up ripping your hair out  i liked it so much  that i bought one for my mom  my sister and my niece s  if you have curly hair  get this brush  i am so pleased with my results      
759,5.0,                       i never knew i had  a curls until i used this brush  it s evenly spreads product throughout the hair and clumps up your curls  it s just an amazing brush       
760,5.0,                       i don t thinks words can express how much i love this brush  i will never buy regular bristles brushes again  never  it s doesnt pull your hair out and the bristles shift  move  in the direction of the stroke  i can break down my thick natural hair with this brush with ease without breaking my hair and it helps the scalp create blood flow which helps hair growth      
761,5.0,                       this is the real deal and great for distributing product and forming curls     
762,1.0,                       this bruch is tiny  a mini  it does not say that in the description  returning      
763,5.0,                       i don t use this brush to blow dry but it is an excellent detangler  it has a nice weight to it and is easy to hold  the bristles don t bend when you brush thick hair and bristles that hold up is what i was looking for      
764,5.0,                       love this brush  it works great for my curls immediately  my little one has very curly hair and it seems that it does not work well on her curls  same day  but it makes a difference the next day  wish i had bought this a long time ago      
765,5.0,                       well made and works great  eliminates snags and tangled wet hair     
766,5.0,                       separates curls nicely     
767,5.0,                       for me  i have small hands and it s very difficult to hold when using while my hair is wet or even worse while i have products in my hair  excellent at detangling and separating my curls      
768,5.0,                       my daughter has could hair and she loves it      
769,5.0,                       this brush is so easy to use you will not believe it   just don t press too hard on your scalp because the bristles are a little hard   but it does detangle tangles my hair and helps me work the product through my hair  i love this brush and highly recommend it      
770,5.0,                       i have always loved this brush  very good at de tangling and very durable  i still have the last one i have that i ve been using daily since           
771,1.0,                       i recently purchased an authentic denman brush last year in england and decided to get one for my sister on  amazon     i m not convinced the one i purchased here is authentic  the bristles are much harder and can not be disassembled for cleaning like the other denman brush i use and also see on youtube       
772,5.0,                       after    years  my hair has become curly  i bought this brush on the advise from a professional and haven t regretted it  i m hoping to buy more      
773,4.0,                       this denman brush is absolutely awesome for detangling multi textured afro hair  and any hair texture less curly than that  the denman brushes i have purchased have worked better than any others i have used for this in the past  no beat up  bent bristles from all my hairstyling abuse  lol  however  with this new brush i more recently received  it appears as though they ve changed the plastic that the handle was made from  and it seems to be a bit more fragile than the one i had before it  they ve also updated the shape of it  in my inescapable clumsiness  and with slippery products on my hands  i dropped the brush on the hard  tile floor twice within the first week and a half of using it  and it  now  has this huge crack on the back of it from hitting the floor in the same spot  see photo   i am purchasing another one  just in case that crack decides to get any bigger  it isn t moving down any further  at least  but it is widening on the top the more that i use the brush  btw  the gold logo on the back was there when i received it  but washed right off in the shower  hence the reason for its absence in the photo confound it  denman  why did you make such a fantastic  yet fragile  heavyweight  product  i am purchasing another one  because i love how well the brush does its job  i will just make sure i have an unreasonably firm grip on the handle while using it to prevent this from happening again  it said  heavyweight   yes  but this apparently did not mean  unbreakable   it can take on death defying feats like getting the tangles out of my unruly  wool   but i guess the  heavyweight  part would only apply to the fact that it doesn t feel like a feather in the hand anyway  this brush works like a dream  but treat it like porcelain  hopefully  the designers will return to the drawing board and  next time  use a plastic material that is a little sturdier and more suited for this application

775,2.0,                       this rips my hair out and i ve customized the rows everyway  this brush just isn t for me  but its okay for definition after i got my tangles out      
776,1.0,                       i bought this brush on the recommendation of a family friend whose stylist friend recommended the brand   i was looking for a brush to use on my    yr olds thick  straight hair as she wasn t doing the best job of brushing it and getting the knots out   when the brush arrived  it looked good  had a nice weight to it and comfortable handle   i gave it a try on my own thin  straight hair and was immediately disappointed   this brush pulled my hair quite a bit and frankly  hurt  i didn t give any opinion to my daughter when she got home from school   just told her that her new brush arrived   she tried it and immediately cried out and declared she wasn t going to be using it  i was not surprised   i m not familiar with what many reviewers describe as the  denman of old  so i can t speak to how this brush compares to previous models  but taken by itself  i was disappointed  i m also surprised since many reviewers commented that it worked great on their curly  thick hair bc again  this hurt my thin straight hair since this brush can t be returned  i m stuck with it  but i m going to buy the wet brush which was recommended by a number of moms i know  saw those recommendations after i purchased this one   oh well      
777,5.0,                       i cannot figure out how a brush helps my curly girl hair but it does   magical

780,5.0,                         star value brush  good for volume with a hairdryer      
781,1.0,                       received an inauthentic product  i recently lost my denman brush that i had for a year and wanted to buy a new one  i m very disappointed to say i received a fake product when ordering a new replacement  everything is completely wrong about the brush      
782,5.0,                       i have long curly and unruly hair  this is the only product that works for me     
783,5.0,                       i had this style brush for over ten years and finally replaced it with the same   the bristles had finally starting wearing out  lots of heat from the hair dryer    i have a lot of wave and body in my hair   i like using this brush for straightening my hair without it being stick straight   i love that its rubber  it seems to hold up better compared to the plastic bristle type brushes   i also like the weight of it for handling      
784,5.0,                       the headline says it all      
785,5.0,                       great  quality brush      
786,1.0,                       this brush was recommended by a few instagram accounts that follow the curly girl method but it did nothing for my curls  maybe i m using it wrong  it s supposed to enhance your curls  i would not recommend it      
787,1.0,                       bought this for my brother and it broke after one use   this is obviously not a genuine denman  but it costs what  denman would   shame on amazon   i know you cannot trust cosmetics  but durable items as well          
788,5.0,                       i was skeptical about this brush  i have to admit it does get my hair very detangled for my wash and go and for many other styles that i do  the only con is that is slips out of my hand other than that i love it     
789,5.0,                       so happy w this brush   it s not hard on my scalp but sturdy enough to comb my thick hair      
790,1.0,                       horrible  do not buy this they re knock off being sold as originals   i ve made a second purchase a   pack and those are legit      
791,5.0,                       i have  b curls and never knew that a brush could do this  after i applied my product in the shower  i brushed my hair  flipped it upside down  scrunched  went in with my microfiber towel  diffused  and voil   thank you denman for a wonderful product      
792,5.0,                       bought this as a gift for my daughter as a christmas stocking stuffer  she has thick curly wavy hair  and loves the brush  very happy with my purchase

794,5.0,                       my daughter uses it for her curly hair   she loves it      
795,1.0,                       i wanted to like this brush  i tried multiple times becauseof the glowing reviews this brush received by other naturallykinky textured ladies on youtube  i thought maybe the brush washelping to release shed hair  until i switched back to my largewide toothed combed and experienced less hair loss  tried again and again  to only experience painful breaking and pulling of my hair i have a super mixed range of hair  mostly  b  c  however withinthere are  c and  a hair textures  and well as just some spots ofloosely textured  frizz  with no curl near my forehead and crown i tried removing every other row  i tried only using   rows  i tried   and the results stayed the same  hair breakage  i tried using it in theshower with soaking wet hair and conditioner  damp hair with leave in  butnope  this wasn t the brush for me   i ll stick with my wide toothed comband finger detangling and keep my hair  ultimately  after   months of attempts this brush found itself in the trash  and it was a really expensive brush i do have to say it is a sturdy brush and it cleansed easily because of the removablebase and rows  however  this brush just wasn t for me        
796,3.0,                       still trying to figure out how to properly use this brush without breaking my hair  i still can t customize it to make it work  it does give me great curl definition but i lose a lot of hair too     
797,1.0,                       i opened this and was confused as to why it already had blonde curly hair in it     the rubber under the bristles is like not fully attached either    i m disappointed i didn t just buy something in store honestly      
798,5.0,                       i use the brushing method to break up my hair into more curls   it gives me so many individual curls instead of the more clumped  thicker curls   i love it      
799,1.0,                       i bought this brush on the basis of its positive reviews and am disappointed  it is heavy on the bristle end which makes it unbalanced and hard to hold  the bristles are too sharp and scrape and hurt my scalp  it doesn t brush my short hair well  and it is impossible to use with a blow dryer  i like a light vented brush with balls on the tips of the bristles  which is what i should have bought but didn t listen to myself      
800,2.0,                       i was expecting soft bristles like other denman brushes  but this one was hard  it hurt my scalp on my short hair  maybe this is made for people with thicker longer hair  but i wouldn t reccomend if you have a sensitive scalp      
801,5.0,                       best brush for wet hair  does not tear your hair out     
802,4.0,                       bought this brush after seeing multiple youtube bloggers use it to help define their curls  after using salon grade keratin for years  my hair needed this i love the result  and my curls are coming back

804,1.0,                       the brush came in damaged  open packaging  and then when i pulled the brush out  i noticed a good section of the bristles was completely bent  what is pictured is the aftermath of me spending time attempting to re straighten them      
805,5.0,                       it help me get the best out if my natural curls

808,2.0,                       too heavy to hold and didn t work on my hair so i returned it     
809,1.0,                       this brush felt terrible on my scalp and hair  it didn t detangle any better than a normal bristle brush and was very sharp feeling      
810,5.0,                       denman  d   brush is awesome for helping define curls  love it  helpful if you re doing the  curly girl method   cgm

812,5.0,                       now i can t do my wash and go days without this brush  my curls are so defined and bouncy will last for days  great quality too haven t had no problems      
813,5.0,                       love it  my daughter would not let me comb her hair without screaming   now with this denman cushion brush  i can comb her hair with little to no problems   great product  it works      
814,5.0,                       if you have type   hair this brush is great for defining abs clumping curls  i d suggest a tangle teaser or wide tooth comb for detangling more matted hair but this could do an ok job with that too  idk about  drying power  lol thick hair doesn t dry by brushing lol atleast mine doesn t      
815,5.0,                       this brush is great for detangling natural hair   i have mostly  a hair  i use it after washing  to detangle my hair with lots of conditioner in it  i used to use a wide tooth comb  but it was getting really hard  this detangles my hair in half the time  buy it       
816,5.0,                       this brush works in getting the style that i wanted  pampadour  i was also advised by my barber than the orange rubber helps in keeping my hair shiny      
817,3.0,                       it s a lot smaller than i thought it would be  however  the box does advertise it as travel size  it works really well at getting the tangles out of hair while it s still wet  also  you can customize it  if you pull the red piece out completely it opens up to let you remove or add the plastic bristles      
818,1.0,                       i have a curly hair and this brush doesn t work well on my hair  after using it i noticed my hair more frizzy and broken  i m not saying the product is bad but just didn t work fine with me  the worst thing is  amazon is denying my request to return it      
819,5.0,                       this brush is really helpful with detangling hair  provided you are patient  i used it to make sure that all of the product is evenly disbursed on my wet hair when putting curly hair products in  it s also much easier to clean as the brush part can be removed from the wand holder      
820,5.0,                       i really wish there was an option to upload a photo here  i have shorter hair than is recommended for this  with  b c  a  pretty much no curly hair influencers even get near what my mane is rocking  i so many hours on youtube  curly hair forums and reviewing the staple cg method and decided i need to blend cg guidelines with real world applications and landed on this for my need to distribute product and revive my faltering curl patter  and it did the job folks   i have a range of spirals from the pinky to thick hi lighter in size  reduced frizz and increased shine for literally days  wash day to day four i get nonstop compliments  please  give this brush time to adjust  play with it  play with how damp your hair is going into it and make sure your product is evenly distributed  it can get better  and maybe it s not for everyone but this is how it s worked for me     
821,4.0,                       this brush works well i wish wish thy didnt increase the price so much  within   months it has been increase by        
822,5.0,                       i ve just started my curly girl method journey and most of the videos i watched contained this brush  i previously used a wide tooth comb and although it got the job done  the denman is much more efficient at detangling  it can get slippery and difficult to hold from the product being used to detangle but overall this brush is everything  i would highly recommend      
823,5.0,                       this is a very durable and nice looking brush   i love this brush   worth the money      
824,3.0,                       have  c  a curls  prob need more practice and more hair curl product for better slippage cause i dont get the curl results  i just get frizz    i hear there is one with black bristles tho      
825,1.0,                       i m very familiar with the denman brush  as i grew up using them  but this one i received is problematic  for starters  the d d pieces at the top of the brush are misaligned and have literal gaps between them and don t look like they fit together so it looks like cheap crap  additionally  the  th row is missing a bristle at the top  i don t mind paying     for a hairbrush if it is quality  but this is most definitely not  recommendation  buy directly from the brand site      
826,3.0,                       i liked the brush for blow drying but for such an expensive brush  it slides out of place every time i use it and it started to fall apart  its not worth the money and i wish i could get a refund or a product replacement      
827,5.0,                       denman brushes are excellent  i have used these for years  this model is the most popular  it has   rows and works well for my hair  which is very long  over the years  they get harder and harder to find  but then i thought to check at amazon  yippee   i bought two this time      
828,5.0,                       love     
829,1.0,                       poorly made  somehow i did not see the reviews seeming the product a knock off  but it is pretty evident  to top it off  i had to email amazon in order to get my refund back  too bad     
830,5.0,                       beautiful brush you can see the quality and the color is to die for i m a curly girl and this brush makes it so easy to apply and style my hair would recommend just be careful which one you end up ordering i have the   row black one too and the quality wasn t as good you can see in the pictures     
831,2.0,                       i have curly hair  this brush didnt make them more defined it made them stringy  i had to take an other shower after using this brush to reset my curls back to normal  i really wanted to like this brush  ughhhh     
832,5.0,                       i m fully natural these days and bought the real denman  however i made do just fine for a year plus with the non brand purchased at sally s  time will tell if it s more durable  does the job  good detangler and curl bringer       
833,4.0,                       combs or brushes priced over     should have the budget for the branding to be embedded instead of printed  this brush is too expensive to have anything on it just fading or wiping away      
834,4.0,                       love this brush  it get some my very course natural hair deranged  can t wait to try to blow my hair out with it      
835,4.0,                       love that this makes distributing product in my hair much easier and it also clumps my curls better      
836,2.0,                       i have curl type  a and personally it did nothing for me    i searched how to videos multiple times to see if i was doing something wrong but i just think it works better for people with curl patterns above  a     
837,5.0,                       i love the denman brush  i got the purple and pink one  its super cute and when styling my curls come out so define  i love this brush for styling my curly hair  i highly recommend      
838,5.0,                       i have thick  c hair and getting any type of curl definition is nearly impossible but i used this brush just to detangle my hair with my cantu leave in and it had my curl popping i was truly amazed     
839,5.0,                       true authentic denman brush  the african violet color is beautiful  handle is sturdy and the curl activation is on boomboom    don t cheat yourself  treat yourself  i love it  you will too  buy it now   proceed to checkout     
840,5.0,                       it was easy to get the curl i wanted  i really works   definitely worth buying      
841,5.0,                       excellent     
842,5.0,                       love this brush for my daughters thin curly hair  wow

844,5.0,                       this item was a gift for my daughter who says it is her favorite brush now      
845,5.0,                       i brought this to start defining my curls  i have noticed a big difference  my curls don t form from the scalp and that s what i m going for  seems to slowly help  i will keep trying to get the desired curl pattern      
846,5.0,                       i had a hard time with this brush at first but i figured out that you need to use it with product and it s so much easier to use as well as taking apart      
847,5.0,                       love this brush so far  i ve seen a lot of reviews saying that they aren t real however   i purchased the white pink one and it came with the cardboard wrapping   label around the top and everything just like the one i received in cosmetology school  i seen some came just in a plastic wrapping so i m not sure about those  mine is real though  i have course curly hair so this works wonders        
848,5.0,                       very good quantity  detangles without damaging hair  cleaning brush is also easy      
849,5.0,                       after using my brush once  i was relieved at my curls   they were curlier than before  originally  i wasn t using a brush  just scrunching with my hands   i don t regret this purchase      
850,4.0,                       i like this brush a lot  it has   rows which is too large for my medium length of hair  but nevertheless i love it   easy to take apart for cleaning as well      
851,5.0,                       i use this product every wash day  great for detangling and styling too  i love this little brush      
852,5.0,                       used to help create curls on my natural hair   works good on my thick hair and performs as expected      
853,5.0,                       i bought a     hair brush  and i don t regret it  i use it right after i shower after adding product  and again after it s     dry as a touch up  my hair has been looking fantastic since i started this routine   caucasian hair  chin length when dry  moderate curl         i could have gotten one of the knock offs since my hair isn t too demanding  but i opted for the name brand anyways and i really like it the keys is that the spokes are linear  they are lined up in such away that it s like passing your hair through a series of parallel combs  it orders all the the hairs  reduces frizz  and helps curls clump more readily      
854,5.0,                       liked the quality and color of brush  helps me style my curly hair      
855,2.0,                       heard a lot about this brush and decided to give it a try  however  it was too weak for my hair      
856,5.0,                       my denmen works great for curly hair   can t believe the beautiful style and curl      
857,5.0,                       re purchased this brush after the rubber on my former denman fell apart after many years of use pro s of this brush    good for removing loose hair   some brushes i have tried to use don t collect loose hair adequately  so  end up with loose hair on my clothes  which looks sloppy  especially on dark colored clothes or work clothes    easy to clean   some brushes i have used are difficult to remove hair from   with the denman it s easy    doesn t pull my hair   i am able to use this even on my wet hair after showering before blow drying it  don t know if it matters but i have naturally straight hair so that s what i am using this brush on con s none     
858,1.0,                       i m not exactly sure if this brush is real or not but there are many signs leading towards it being fake  or if it is real    denman s stepped down quite a few notches on the quality  the pic on the left is one that i ve had for at least    years and has lasted me that long up until it broke a couple of weeks ago  bought the one on the right and only after a few uses  the bristles are already looking as if it s just as old  additionally  the crowns above the  d s  are not located in the same place as my older brush     the quality is horrible  see pic   really not happy with this but i ve already used it so it s no sending back      
859,5.0,                       i can clean this brush in a second  one grab of the hair in it and the brush looks brand new      
860,1.0,                       i bought this denman brush because curlies kept speaking so wondwrfully of these brushes  but this specific denman brush is of horrible quality for my hair type  too fragile  the thing keeps falling apart each time i try to detangle my hair  and instead of detangling my hair it tangles it   might be ideal for thinner  not so curly hairlies  perhaps for girls with wavier hair rather than  a and above   b girls  don t waste your money with this specific brush      
861,5.0,                       works like a charm  i have thick wavy curly hair and used to comb my hair out with wide tooth comb  this works so much better on wet or dry hair and doesn t comb out my curls      
862,5.0,                       this brush is a must have if you have curly hair  its optimal to use when your hair is wet  if you use it in the shower water will get trapped between the orange rubber part and the black plastic      
863,5.0,                       i don t know why i didn t own this brush sooner  detangling my natural hair has been so much easier  and i had an ez detangler before now  i bought the denman thinking   how much better is this than my current brush   so glad i bought it  it definitely is better      
864,1.0,                       i have had a denman brush for years and this product is unfortunately not the actual brush  this one was much smaller and the actual detangling process was almost impossible  i ended using my very old denman brush  but it worked     times better than this one  i recommend purchasing from an in person store or going directly to the website next time      
865,4.0,                       i like the red bed white teeth one better  this is much heavier  very sturdy  i think it would be excellent for someone with thick hair  because mine is on the thinner side  i had to be careful not to hurt my head  i went with the other denman brush instead      
866,4.0,                       my daughter hasn t been brushing her  c hair just been  putting it in a ponytail  but this brush untangled all the knots where as other brushes wouldn t even begin to  i did have to order and reorder due to receiving the mini styler which isn t made the same as the larger brush  it s been a long time coming denman       
867,5.0,                       i almost did not want to buy the brush because of the price  but it is worth every penny  it gets through my super thick  extra tight could hate and my daughters  hair  they re hair is more curly and not add thick  it is great for my son s short hair as well  never thought i could buy a brush that works for all of us  would buy again      
868,5.0,                       love this demi brush  it defines my curls and is pretty heat resistant when i used it to blow dry and straighten my hair  i don t find a use for any other brush      
869,5.0,                       this brush is bomb  i saw many you tubers with it and one day i was like  let me just get myself one   and i do not regret it  my curls are so much more defined and i ve gotten many compliments about it      
870,4.0,                       this is the second time i ve purchased this item  although i loved my denman brush the first time around it ended up falling apart on me  i am unsure if it was due to the excessive use or if it was just time to replace a the brush  as that is common with my  c  a curly hair  this time the bristles are stronger and the backing seems to be harder as well  it serves its purpose and nothings brushes through my hair in its natural state like this brush  very happy      
871,1.0,                       either this is not a legit denman brush or their product quality is horrible  i used this brush once and noticed that it is already falling apart  i m returning it      
872,5.0,                       used this for the first time today and i am in love  its does an amazing job with making curls pop and detangles with ease  love it     
873,1.0,                       this looks like the factory jacked up the brush  the rubber isn t glued to the back properly  hard pass  don t waster     on this junk     
874,4.0,                       it s an amazing brush but it came kind of ugly as you can see in the pictures the rubber was cut ugly the brush works very well it s just a product defect that some people get i will be returning this one because i just got the   row hot pink one which had no defects at all so just be careful what you order some brushes aren t as high quality as others you know they work but there just kind of ugly lol     
875,5.0,                       i use for curly hair  it is amazing how it ends the frizzies and forms beautiful curl patterns      
876,2.0,                       i feel like the brush is not the greatest quality  it seems to be made really poorly  there was also what seemed to be dirt on the brush  i m a little skeptical about it      
877,5.0,                       this brush has been with me for my whole big chop and i love her  i ve had all   rows of teeth for the whole awkward length stage and i m finally down to   and it s been amazing so far  my curls are so defined and it all thanks to this brush  it was very easy to use as a detangler when my hair was shorter  but now that it s gotten longer it takes longer to do with the brush so i use my fingers and finish off with the brush  however  it s kinda slippery to hold onto when my hands are covered with product so there has been some slips and tugs but nothing i can t handle  at first it was really hard to pull out the rubber part but after i had a couple times it got easier to slide in and out  i think mine had just been cut weird or something      
878,5.0,                       my niece loved it and definitely this product compared to others is great      
879,5.0,                       this brush was exactly like the other den man brushes that i ve purchased for my hair  i personally have only received that results i enjoy with my hair with a denman style brush and you can t get any better than the actual product  it was nice that the color is different from usual     
880,4.0,                       i ordered the denman brush to continue on my curly hair journey  i got the   rows which was recommended and think it works well  not a detangling brush  just for styling  but very good at clumping hair and met my expectations which i was happy about      
881,5.0,                       i have had my brush for over    yrs   it still looks and works great   i have thick hair so i need a brush that is stiff and will hold up when i blow dry my hair   it cleans easily and my grand kids all have ask to have mine   i will not part with mine it is the only brush i have found that will go through my hair to the scalp   i was thrilled tofind these on line as i have searched beauty supplies for years in searach of this kind of brush i have purchased one for my grandson who always used mine when he was at our home  now he will have his own   i will by more for christmas gifts since they are so uniquely strong and durable      
882,4.0,                    es bueno  pero si tienes poco cabello o muy fino no se lo recomiendo ya que es bien duro  lo recomendaria para un cabello grueso y mucho  lo tengo asi  y como quiera lo encuentro duro  it is good  but if you have little or very thin hair i do not recommend it because it is very hard  i would recommend it for thick hair and a lot  i have it like this  and as you want i find it hard        
883,5.0,                       great for any texture of hair  also works very well with hair dryers and drying hair  the bristles will not melt or burn      
884,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this is not a denman brush  it s a cheap and poorly made brush with the denman name and it s shameful that someone would try to pass this product off as a quality brush  absolutely disgusted in whoever is responsible for this  i m returning and also took a video which shows how awful this brush is made  i could have gotten a better brush at the    cent store  unbelievable  i m so angry      
885,5.0,                       great for thick  curly hair     
886,3.0,                    el cepillo efectivamente peina muy bien pero duele al usarlo  lo compr  para desenredar el cabello de mi hija de   a os y no creo q lo aguante en comparaci n con el que usaba  pesa  the brush effectively combs very well but hurts when using it  i bought it to detangle my   year old daughter s hair and i don t think i can handle it compared to the one he used  he weighs        
887,5.0,                       i cannot recommend these enough of you have curly hair  my husband even likes it for styling his short  straight hair      
888,5.0,                       i will be purchasing denman brushes for as long as i still have hair      
889,2.0,                       i love the denman brush  so much so that i have bought   for myself and family   my daughter is headed to college and came to purchase one for her and the price had doubled  i ve paid as low as    and as much as     in   years  i personally think that hike is excessive      
890,2.0,                       i think it s a bit pricey for what it is  i took two rows out as the manufacturer suggests  and really struggled to get the brush back together after   the rubber piece is too snug  not totally clear on why its so highly recommended for curls      
891,5.0,                       my granddaughters love this brush they both have curly hair     
892,5.0,                       makes the curls look great  curl definition and detangles great      
893,5.0,                       i now see why i have seen it in so many videosgreat for curly hair  defines the curls so nicely     
894,4.0,                       i don t use it to detangle my hair but i do use it at the top of my head and pretend it s a pair of scissors when making a bow curly  if that makes any sense   gives my curly hair lots of volume but i m still trying to figure out how to make my hair better with it      
895,5.0,                       the real thing i love this on omg hair doesnt rip too much off     
896,1.0,                       i typically love the denman brush but this version is very small and stiff and does not detangle well at all       
897,5.0,                       i dont know why all brushes aren t made this way  first brush that didn t rip out my hair  i have wavy but curly hair  depends on the humidity  i m like sarah jessica parker with a hint of ethnicity         
898,1.0,                       hard  nit like the black and orange versuim      
899,5.0,                       i can t believe i ve waited so long to try one of these brushes  i love it     the best purchase i ve ever made  it is worth every penny  i have  c texture hair and my daughter who is mixed race has very silky fine hair and it works good on both of our textures  so that is a a  to me      
900,5.0,                       this brush is amazing and it won t pull your hair out  it s easy and fun to use on wet or dry hair     
901,3.0,                       i didn t see much  if any  difference in my curl pattern while using this brush  it s not good at detangling  it pulls your hair even when soaking wet  i also tried it side by side to my regular padded brush and because of the things previously stated  i don t think it was a better purchase at all however  with that being said  i am black with a  b  c mixed curl pattern  and i have over   feet of natural hair this brush did seem to work better for my   yr old son s short hair at detangling  ease of use and making pronounced curls      
902,5.0,                       i love the denman   row styler  i own the origin and purchased this for the fun colors  it works amazing for my curly hair  best styling brush i ve ever used  always get amazing results  definitely would recommend        
903,5.0,                       love this brush  great on wet or dry hair and it awesome for curly girl method followers  there are tutorials online that show how to style curly hair with this brush  it s a great investment      
904,5.0,                       great brush and sturdy      
905,4.0,                       i m enjoying this brush so far  people say you aren t supposed to brush wet hair but it s just what i do  decided to try this brush because i was having a lot of trouble worth detangling with every brush but my daughters disney wet brush but my hair was starting to break some of the bristles  this brush is fantastic especially when i have leave in conditioner in  i will update with more use      
906,5.0,                       i love that the bristles don t have little balls on the end that get stuck on knots  we are still learning about the right way to care for my daughter s hair  this brush definitely helps  i figured out that if i hold it so the brush is pointing up instead of down or right at her scalp  so that just one edge of the brush is touching her hair  and it is basically upside down   then i can finally brush her hair without any risk of snagging knots  it takes time  and lots of conditioner  but i wouldn t be able to do this with any of our other brushes      
907,5.0,                       this is my favorite brush   my aunt used to used this brush on our hair when we were younger and i see why she loved it so much   it detangles the hair without pulling the hair out   i m glad i m back to using it      
908,5.0,                       so far this has been really easy to use and works well in my hair      
909,4.0,                       works well   the only thing i don t like about this brush is that the rubber the holds the teeth slides out from time to time  i have type  a hair and it s a great help  this is my  th denman brush as my daughter and sisters keep stealing them  lol     
910,5.0,                       my   years old daughter has curly hair that is past her bottom and she used to dread getting her hair combed until we started using this brush  i think it s a little speedy but it really does the job      
911,5.0,                       amazing brush  if you have any doubts  just buy it      
912,1.0,                       i saw the other reviews that said that this product was not real  but i bought it anyway hoping that i would get one of the real ones   i was wrong  the rubber is completely different  do not buy if you re hoping to get a true denman brush      
913,1.0,                       definitely a fake  when i received the brush  it was in an already opened box  the manufacturer of this fake brush should definitely go back to the drawing board  this isn t even passable  i ll be sending it back immediately   you re lucky there s no lesser rating than a one star      
914,5.0,                       i wish there were    stars for this brush  i adore how my curls turn out thanks to the denman brush  it took me some time to work out how to do the back of my head  but that s because i m a klutz   i love how much more controlled the curls are when i use this brush     
915,5.0,                       denman has been around for years since i was a little girl good quality andis still a perfect brush nothing to me can touch a denman brush it s in a class by itself would not use anything except a denman     
916,4.0,                       this product is impressive in terms of use  i ve used it twice maybe once and it after unraveling my braids of three days i noticed that my hair was still detangled and smooth  it was an emotional day for me to say the least  lolthis is the best detangle brush for  c hair that i have ever owned  however i am concerned about the pink part detaching itself from the brush  it looks like it s capable it s already disassembled slightly       
917,5.0,                       great brush but a little pricey   i got it because my friends recommended it for my curly hair and it works great   it just a to pricey for a brush      
918,5.0,                       amazing      
919,5.0,                       it is easy on your hands  detangle the curly long hair easily  not pulling the hair      
920,1.0,                       so i bought this brush because i needed another one  made sure i bought a   row brush  got set a   row brush instead cool whatever  i actually look at it and it looks like there is dandruff in it   i take it apart and there is clearly leave in conditioner in it    you can clearly tell it was leave in by the moisturizing texture and the smell gross       
921,5.0,                       completely satisfied  didn t even realize i was ordering the  heavy weight  model  but i m so glad i did because that was the exact reason i was ordering another denman  because the handle on my previous one had broken off  although this model is a little heavier than the regular   row denman it is well worth it if you have really thick  curly  afro textured hair  i often use my denman on wet hair which clumps my curls together  putting significant more strain on the brush  this brush is holding up well  highly recommend      
922,5.0,                       works great     
923,5.0,                       this isn t made for detangling but just to style  it really does help define my curls and perfects for helping make finger coils with a brush lol i don t know what it s called  it distributes the product all over my hair which is good because i have like medium to fine hair     
924,5.0,                       so i bought the african violet one because everyone was saying that the black one was fake and i got to tell you  this brush is no fake  maybe the black one but not this one  i even went on the denman website to compare and it s exactly the same  it works really good  had it for a month  i have thick  c hair and the brush has not pulled apart not once  very strong brush for the hair that i have  lol  i use it as a detangler and it works really good  enhanced some of my curls back to normal which i find very impressive  i spent        and i don t regret it      
925,5.0,                       i absolutely love this brush  a game changer when it comes to the frizz of my  c twist outs  makes detangling a breeze  great product for the price      
926,5.0,                       i think i don t really know how to used this  yet  my hair its wavy  and i have some straight strands on my hair  and it did make it more wavy  i will give an update later on with pics      
927,5.0,                       these are my absolute favorite brushes  they last a long time  are nicely weighted  easy to clean and are comfortable to use  they are the only brushes i have used over the past    years  i own   of them and would recommend them to anyone      
928,5.0,                       this has revolutionized my curly routine  i had no idea what i was missing out on  it s so simple to use  i section of my hair  brush with the denman  i have the   row  which is great for  b  c curls   use a small amount of product to scrunch and diffuse  love it   it s worth every penny      
929,5.0,                       when i starting detangling my hair for wash day using my leave in for the first time with this brush  my immediate thought was   this is incredible   the denman brush is absolutely fantastic for curly hair  i experienced no painful tugging  just an easy  super nice feeling of the brush gliding through my hair while getting the detangling job done  additionally  this brush really accented my curls than with a wide tooth comb  definitely use when your hair is wet or damp and use a leave in or defining cream for an even spread through your locks  if you have lots of hair  section your hair too for an easier time  i use this brush all the time now  for wash days  reset days  and refresh after wash days i have multi textured hair ranging from  b  c curls  high porosity and high density  i found the denman   row brush to be the best detangler for my hair      
930,5.0,                       we have been using it to comb through my daughter s fine  curly hair after washing and detangling with a wet brush   i divide her hair into vertical sections  like they do on youtube  and brush with the denman  then let air dry  and it does leave her curls more defined and springy i ve used it to detangle here and there on wet hair but would not use it for that primarily  the pink and purple combo reminds me of the     s in a good way and is very cheerful  we are happy with it   also happy it was made in the uk      
931,5.0,                       best brush ever  i learned about this brush from my stylist years ago  i have thick hair and a tender scalp  amazing to handle for any hair style and holds up for years and years with constant use and especially high heat blow drying  i never want to be without it so i just bought my third brush as a second back up for the times i might accidentally leave it behind on vacation by mistake  which i have   note  received it two days after i ordered it and it came in its original boxed packaging in new condition      
932,5.0,                       i love it      
933,4.0,                       nothing wrong with the product it just didn t work for my hair  i have watched several youtube videos singing its praises about how it would help encourage curl patterns  perhaps because my hair is permed not naturally curly  it didn t have the same effect      
934,5.0,                       this is specifically a styling brush  if you are holding it horizontally to detangle you are wrong  hold the brush vertically to detangle  or use a brush designed for detangling  use the brush horizontally to define your curls and or clump your curls  definition works best if you work in small  relatively thin sections or  panels  of hair  manesbymel  is a good resource on youtube for how to use the denman brush for styling curl definition if you hate this brush  one of the following is probably likely    you are using it wrong   you are trying to get hair that won t curl to curl  damaged or not curly to begin with    your hair is too weak to withstand the brushing so it is breaking offnone of these are faults with the brush itself  there is a little bit of a learning curve and the brush may not be the best option for everyone but it is a good product for what it is designed to do      
935,2.0,                       i lowered this down to   rows and i find i have more hair ripping out even when i am fully detangled than compared to using my regular wide tooth comb  not good for my curly hair     
936,5.0,                       everyone with curly hair needs this  make sure you watch videos on how to use it properly to define your curls  i wish i had known about this so much earlier        
937,4.0,                       so i either have the reallllly old version of this brush or like some other ladies are saying they went really cheap with them  my old brush is engraved everywhere and has the   symbol meaning it s legit  there s no   symbol on this brush anywhere   it does say made in uk under the bristles but  i m still not      if this is legit or not  i got mine from a strictly denman store in boston  ma guess i ll make a trip out there since there s nothing else to do and show them the brush      
938,5.0,                       this is like a magic brush my   year old is very tinder headed and hate when i do his hair but once i got this and used it omg this brush go straight thru his hair and he has big curls and this brush kept all his cruls     l love this brush and he does also         
939,1.0,                       so clearly not a real denman brush     
940,5.0,                       although it pulls my hair a little it s the only brush that i ve found that actually reaches everywhere  detangling every knot      
941,5.0,                       this was my first denman brush  i brought some  c naturally curly clip ins and needed the brush to detangle but leave the curls in the clip ins  and wow  it worked great     pic attached   can t wait to use it on my natural hair the next time i wash it  i now understand what the hype is all about  definitely recommend it       
942,5.0,                       thank you for the fast delivery  the brush is nice and easy to hold  i haven t tried using it with the blow dryer  but it does detangle my hair nicely      
943,5.0,                       i purchased the denman brush for my daughter to help tame her curly hair   it works as it should to help clump same curl patterns   good purchase      
944,4.0,                       this brush set angles my thick  curly hair better than any hair tool i ve used  i highly recommend  i have heard others say that the brush pulls their hair out  i wonder if they are properly brushing their hair from end to root instead of the other way around      
945,5.0,                       my hair is detangled  this denman brush does a good job especially when used with conditioner      
946,5.0,                       i love this brush  works well with adding leave in conditioner   my daughter has very thick and curly hair  this brush had no problem getting through the tangles  highly recommended for any natural hair      
947,5.0,                       if you have curly hair  this brush is must have  i use it in the shower when detangling my hair and it leaves my hair super soft and easy to manage  i have  c  a curls  the only issue i have and this might be because of the thickness of my hair  the brush slides apart a bit      
948,5.0,                       i have  b curly hair and this brush is the best invention for curly hair of all time   tip  brush from the ends of your hair first  then work your way up to the root      
949,1.0,                       i was using brush to detangle hair  and as i was brushing the brush collapse resulting in the photo below  i was not happy with this product  the description says  for all hair types  not true  the money i paid for this brush is not worth the purchase   waste of time      
950,5.0,                       this brush works exactly as described  i used the brush to detangle a    inch curly human hair wig  i completely wet the wig with a spray bottle of water  and brushed through the tangles starting at the bottom  then working through the top  i was able to brush through the hair without the brush snagging or any bristles breaking   i flipped  twirled the brush throughout the hair to create curls  the wig looked great after it dried  i didn t use any curling product on the wig because i wanted to test the brush without it  using a lightweight moisturizing curling product would probably help the brush create an even better curl pattern  i was skeptical about the brush after reading through the amazon reviews  but did further online research  and read more positive reviews  i m glad i purchased this brush  the key is to completely wet the hair  if you use this on african  american natural hair  i definitely recommend using a good moisturizering conditioner  and section your hair before carefully detangling  then brushing through each section and creating your curls  i don t know my curl pattern to list it  and suffer with alopecia  but  my hair is a tight curl  dry  and fragile  the brush worked on my natural african american hair too  the brush is easy to use  sturdy  and it really detangles and curls hair  ordering was seamless  and the shipping was fast      
951,5.0,                       originally bought this to style my curly hair  but it ended up being great to detangle brush my twin toddlers  hair  they have a lot of hair  so baby brushes were nolonger cutting it  but typical detangling brushes weren t working right either  the small size   bristle length placement make for a fantastic brush for their hair      
952,5.0,                       it distributes product throughout curls well and when you use the twirling while you brush method it helps to define my curls      
953,3.0,                       i expected the brush to be much smaller   it was advertised as having a longer handle so that is why i bought this one  with   rows over the   rows because i thought it would be easier to control with a longer handle    but overall it is a very petite brush so the handle is actually not long overall   hard to explain but hope that makes sense   i am still using it for curl definition    learning the technique and getting some success  but wishing i had bought the one with   rows as i think it would give me more control overall      
954,5.0,                       didn t know i needed this brush  until i used it   well made  comfortable in hand  great at detangling and distributing product      
955,5.0,                       instagram   manes by mel   sent me to buy this brush for my locks and i noticed a difference in my curls the first time  this is a photo of second day hair same products one month apart only difference is the brush i used      
956,4.0,                       you can t go wrong with denman brand hairbrushes   i bought the classic row style grooming brush for my son  and i like denman grooming brush with nylon bristles   luckily i  purchased   of the nylon bristle brushes a few months ago for myself bc they are no longer available      
957,5.0,                       i purchased one for myself and one for my niece   i use mine when i blow dry to ensure a straight blow out   the bristles feel wonderful on the scalp   when i start brushing i have to stop myself because it feels so nice   this type of brush also works well on my niece s naturally curly hair   it s a great detangler and gives defintion to her curls   it doesn t snag or pull out large amounts of hair   it s strong and won t break on you   denman i ve found sells affordable and well made products      
958,5.0,                       i just started the cgm  and saw that many youtubers raved about using a denman brush  let me tell yo u  this is actually magic  i was skeptical of whether or not its authentic based on other reviews  but it seems to be authentic  i ve never had one before   this   row brush has made my curls more curly and defined with results lasting six or seven days until i wash again  it definitely controls frizz too  i have long curly thick hair and this works perfectly  but if you have thin hair it might not be so great  as it does slightly tug on the hair when brushing it wet  i ve been working on how to gently pull with it  but it is a sturdy brush  which i like    the rows are removable  by pulling the back up then out and pulling the bristles out  but it is a very well made brush so pull hard on it to adjust the rows  i love this         
959,1.0,                       two bristle where broke and the whole thing keep sliding out i don t think they are because i have gotten many over the years from sally s and that never happends     
960,5.0,                       great for my daughters curly hair  very well made      
961,5.0,                       this is a great brush which really helped me with my permed hair  because of arthritis  i can no longer roll or iron my hair  but with this  i was able to do some crude sectioning which helped detangle and define my curls  i really needed this with salons temporarily out of business and am pleased with my purchase      
962,5.0,                       bought the brush for my curly wig    it really defines the curls  there s definite difference between the denman brush and a wet brush  easy to clean and reassemble  looking forward to using it on my natural hair      
963,4.0,                       works great de tangles like no ones business but it s very small       
964,5.0,                       now that i have it  i can t live without it  my hair is really curly like actually tight curls and the brush really defines and separates them and takes away my frizz  if it doesn t do that for you it has to be the product you re using or the way you do your hair  look on youtube to learn how to use it  i watch manesbymel     
965,5.0,                       my short haired husbands brush of choice     
966,5.0,                       works well for defining curls     
967,4.0,                       im not sure what all the rave is about with this brush  it s a brush and it brushes hair   period      
968,5.0,                       it s a great hairbrush  it is very easy to clean and has a nice weight to it  it  detangles  hair very easily   the bush feels solid and  durable  i don t feel bad throwing it in my gym bag      
969,5.0,                       this brush is not for detangling  it is for styling   and i use it for just that  styling my curly hair   i do wet styling and use it to define curls and a little product distribution   mostly for styling its perfect      
970,4.0,                       this is my second brush  the first one lasted about   years  i have a lot of hair  very dense so nothing s going to last forever for me  the brush is easy to hold and detangles well  the bristles are firm but don t hurt  it helps bring out my curl pattern      
971,5.0,                       this brush is amazing if you have curly or wavy hair it does not pull out your curls and helps define your curl clumps  use when hair is wet for best results      
972,5.0,                       i ve used just once so far and was pleasantly surprised with the curl definition created  i just brushed through after putting product in my  a b fine curly hair  scrunched  and warm cold shot blew dried on low  couldn t believe the defined curls created with just these simple steps  i have the   row and i m not sure if i ll remove any at this point  my hair doesn t tangle easily    so i m using this strictly for curl definition      
973,5.0,                       this brush has helped my daughters curly hair  after her shower i brush her hair as i m putting her products on  and when her hair is dry voila  her curls are smooth and defined      
974,5.0,                       absolutely love  curls are amazing and brush does what it says it will      
975,5.0,                       so it s slick surface combined with my slick hair products  and wet hair make it a little slippery   other than that this brush is great   the tangles fall right out of my hair and the curl definition it beautiful  i will definitely continue to use this product      
976,2.0,                       bristles too stiff   feels like brushing with garden rake might feel     
977,5.0,                       soak your hair with conditioner and this brush is amazing for detangling without breakage  it also gives amazing clumps on curly hair     
978,5.0,                       i use it after i apply my styling product to make sure it is evenly distributed  then scrunch up with both hands and the curl definition is amazing  you will notice the difference after the first use  i have  c thick curly hair down to my hips and it has caused shrinkage  shoulder length when dry  but i don t mind at all the definition and curl pattern has changed for the better  must have for curly girls     
979,5.0,                       these brushes are amazing at detangling kinky curly hair  i don t know what took me so long to purchase one      
980,5.0,                       detangles  easy to clean  doesn t pull on the hair  works product through well  love it for my curly hair  does not make ringlets curls easily  but does promote clumping      
981,2.0,                       heard a lot of good things about this brush  however  it pulled my  c hair out quite a bit  detangling with a wide tooth comb is a lot easier  i use this brush on my ends after doing the lco method to ensure my twists are detangled at the ends      
982,5.0,                       this is my third one over the past     years  so glad i was able to locate and obtain this tried and true gem of a hair brush  i have medium to fine  wavy to curly hair  the older i get the curlier it gets  but there s a lot of it and this is the only brush that works for my hair  leaves it shiny and without static in the dry winter air  the pink rubber base has enough give so that it doesn t hurt brushing though      
983,5.0,                       i followed through with a recommendation from  manesby mell   i never thought i would brush my natural curly kinky hair  but this brush has changed my styling routine while it is wet      
984,1.0,                       poor product  i m wondering if it was a genuine denman brush that i received  i owned this brand of brush before so i know of the good quality  this brush purchased from this seller did not work well from the very first use  the bristles twisted in all directions while trying to brush my hair and i have naturally curly hair  but it s not difficult to manage  so it isn t because of my hair type that the bristles did that nonsense  i tried to slide the pink pad with the bristles out  as those brushes can do  in order to fix it and it isn t sliding all the way back in  it s sticking  it brush also feels lightweight and not firm as the original denman feels  very disappointed in this purchase from this seller  waste of my money      
985,5.0,                       it works better on my dry hair better than my wet hair but i m ordering another i really like it i use it instead of my regular every day brush     
986,3.0,                       so far the brush has come apart from the base  but you can slide it back in  i m not sure if this is a real denman brush  haven t had it long enough to really tell all     
987,3.0,                       this totally seems to be a fake denman  as well as mine coming in what looked to be used condition      
988,4.0,                       it is nice  easy for clean  the delivery was at time      
989,5.0,                       my granddaughter can use this brush  with no help from me  to detangle her long very tight coils      
990,5.0,                       this product is very good for scalp stimulation and helps to promote hair growth   i thoroughly enjoy this brush     
991,2.0,                       i have fine hair and my style is a disconnected undercut  hair is about      inches long on the top this may not be the ideal brush for my type of hair as it feels very rough when it makes contact with my scalp  i thought maybe it would just be against my preference since this brush has so many high reviews  i gave the brush to my mother she doesn t like the feel of it either  she said the bristles feels as if they were scratching and leaving marks on her scalp  the comb is fine it self for separated strands and what not  but the overall feel of the brush just feels off  feels like the comb is too rubber  i will have to go back to using those brushes with thinner bristles and with the small balls at the end of the points      
992,4.0,                       gets the job done for my  b  c hair  detangles my hair evenly without ripping it  although  the rubber part with the bristles of the brush is starting to separate from the base but thats the least of my concerns nothing a bit of super glue can t fix      
993,5.0,                       it is not for detangling  it is for styling  i use it on my curly hair to get definition  and it turns out great every time  i highly recommend this to people with curly hair  it s a must have styling tool  there are plenty of videos online that detail how to get the best curly results      
994,1.0,                       i had to return the brush  unfortunately  it doesn t work on thin  fine hair i m an older female  with graying  moderately curly hair that is   or   inches longer than my shoulders  but even so  there was nothing for the brush to grab onto  my hair simply slid through the brush as i tried to twist it into cluster curls      
995,2.0,                       brush is small box it came in was smashed my send it back i have alot of hair     
996,5.0,                       love the brush  it does help define the curls  i will say all of the videos online make it look easy to put it back together after removing bristles but it takes some muscle power     
997,1.0,                       did we get a lemon  the bristles slid out of the handle and got stuck in my hair on the very first use  i put it back togther but it just happened again  this time the bristles fell out of the bristle track insert  returned it  annoying  zero stars      
998,5.0,                       this is an awesome brush for getting my thick  coarse hair to go where i want  it works with with blow drying and has saved me some time in styling  also  the brush feels very solid and sturdy  not cheap at all  would recommend      
999,1.0,                       used it the way videos showedto and wow what a huge waste  a comb works better to keep waves  curls and all it did was rip out my hair and make it look and what a joke     
1000,1.0,                       this brush is clearly fake  i used it to blow dry my hair and it melted     
1001,1.0,                       my big hear tore it up quickly      
1002,1.0,                       i was actually disappointed in this denman   it definitely did it s job as usual  however  as a stylist i want my things to stand out because a number of stylist use the denman on a regular basis   the photo is deceiving because this brush turned out to be a lilac  kind of pastel color      
1003,5.0,                       this is my everyday  go to brush and it is the perfect size  you do not need a large denman brush  i have  b c natural hair and this works for detangling on wash day  styling and everything else  love it with my protective styles too      
1004,5.0,                       this denman brush leaves my curls really defined and bouncy  this brush is not your every day detangling brush as the bristles are harder plastic  my hair is super curly so i use it on wet hair and it helps my conditioner glide through  i am very pleased with my purchase of this brush      
1005,2.0,                       this is not the first denman brush i ve owned but this is the first one that has repeatedly come apart  i ve never had to put any of my others ones back together but i am always doing so now     
1006,5.0,                       i use this brush in the shower after applying conditioner  it works great and does not cause any damage      
1007,5.0,                       perfect brush for detangling thick curly hair  i wish had had purchased one of thse years ago  this brushed cut down on the time it takes me to detangle hair      
1008,5.0,                       we love it  my daughters and i have super curly hair and it does great detangling  and sturdy      
1009,5.0,                       i ve only used once so far  but i was pleased with the quality as soon as i touched it  i ve heard a lot about denman brushes and finally decided to try it  i wish i had done so sooner  i love how gentle it is on my hair while wet  and how it defines my curls      
1010,5.0,                       i d been using a knock off brush for my curls  with good results but decided to purchase the real thing  the brushes look and feel exactly alike but the denman works better  i m not sure why but it does      
1011,5.0,                       i love this brush  my curls are so defined  i would not use this brush for detangling especially if you have curly hair  i only use it to create defined curls      
1012,1.0,                       i love our regular denman and it gets so much use it has to be replaced every other year  decided to try something new this time i hate this brush  the head slides out when you re using it  making it almost impossible to use unless you brush at an angle and hold on to the head rather than the handle it s extremely stiff  which the description does indicate  which is too rough for my kids  hair      
1013,5.0,                       really see a difference when using this  i have super curly hair and this brush helps define my hair and reduce its frizziness  i detangle my hair with a wife tooth comb and then use this all while my hair is still wet     
1014,5.0,                       combined with my styling and moisturizing products  this brush is everything   after using my detangling brush  i used my denman to brush product through each section of my hair before my two strand twists  my hair was gorgeous and   days later  still untangled   it s worth it       
1015,5.0,                       this brush is the absolute pinnacle of hard bristle brushes  it does everything such a brush needs to do  but without the bent prong problems with haunt inferior brushes  it is silent and strong  strong enough to untangle superman s knots  and do so with quiet confidence  without any unnecessary fanfare  this brush is tactical black as you have no doubt noticed  on your next mission with james bond or sterling archer  simply slip this denman wonder into your tactical bag beside the stun grenades  and you are good to go  well groomed and as handsome as you like  while you achieve your mission objectives      
1016,5.0,                       i had one of these for over    years  it still worked  it was actually even better than when it was new   but was so utterly disgusting to behold that my wife insisted i replace it  imagine over    years of gel and hair product build up   yeah  it wasn t pretty  i hope to have this new one for at least as long      
1017,2.0,                       has to be a sad replica    glue everywhere   logo already wearing when i haven t used it  haven t used it yet but terrible first impression     
1018,5.0,                       i love this brush   this is my second denman like this   the first one lasted about    years  the bristles started flopping   it s perfect for my fine  straight hair   i use it after a shower and for stying after it s dry   i rarely blowdry my hair      
1019,3.0,                       this brush does help with my curls  but i have to brush my hair out first with my wet brush to get all the tangles out or it will pull my hair out  i like that it is easy to hold and grip  if used properly  the results are awesome  i had to watch several videos to perfect my technique      
1020,5.0,                       good simple washable brush   used these for years     
1021,2.0,                       it s too small to be the classic denman brush   it for a child hand  i would not reccommend the seller or item  spend the extra    to get a true classic denman brush     
1022,2.0,                          or the quality has gone down greatly i have several real denman s that i ve had for years  but wanted a second d  to keep at the gym  ordered this one and immediately felt something was off  i ve shaved my head bald and the hair is just now growing back  about an inch long  and this new  denman  can barely get through it  whereas my old original denman  same type  d   was a beast in getting through my hair even when my  c  a curls were down to my shoulders  this new one is bendy and feels cheaply made  but since i can t prove it s a fake  i ll just have to suck up the loss of the money as this is going in the trash  and in the future i ll stick to buying from the place i bought from before      
1023,5.0,                       i like this brush  it s easy to clean  i haven t tried taking any rows of bristles out  i have curly hair and this brush is great for detangling      
1024,1.0,                       so when i received the brush there was no marking of an authentic made denman brush and instead has a gold sticker with chinese lettering on it  i then noticed the red plastic with the bristles that you are meant to be able to pull out in a real denman brush is glued shut into the brush  as well as the bristles and quality just really not being the same  i bought a denman brush directly from their site and could immediately tell the difference in quality and production  trust me y all  much better to get it directly from the site when you know its authentic  you won t be wasting your time or money     
1025,5.0,                       great for detangling my thick  long  wavy hair even if it s wet     
1026,5.0,                       i use this brush every time i wash my hair  i don t know what i d do if i didn t have this on wash day  it has decreased the amount of hair i lose with each weekly wash and also made detangling not as burdensome  my hair is very thick though so i need to use water and conditioner for slip when detangling      
1027,5.0,                       i have never ever been impressed by a hairbrush until this one   seriously  this brush is the bomb   knots and snarls are easily removed  even on my dry morning hair   and it has yet to get caught or tangled in my hair best part is  no more hair breakage   there is hardly any hair on my brush after a month of daily use i know this may be a little more expensive than what you typically find in the big retail and drug stores out there  but it is definately worth the investment   just think about how often you use a hairbrush fyi  i have fine hair that is pretty dense  a type curl      
1028,1.0,                       the brush is poorly made  the material that the bristles sit in is actually sitting up off of the brush  which i had to keep pushing it down      
1029,5.0,                       this brush is wonderful for nice curl definition      
1030,5.0,                       great brush  note  if you wish to remove some of the bristles or clean underneath bristles  removal is simple but to replace it back on the handle can be nearly impossible unless you know this simple tip  you must wet the brush to replace it  once wet   it will easily glide back on  trust me   i learned this the frustrated way until i read a review      
1031,4.0,                       when dealing with wet hair or hair covered in products   the part containing the bristles will slip out easily  which is annoying it s easy to clean and gives good curl definition when dealing with small sections     
1032,4.0,                       this is an excellent brush   my only complaint is that the rubber on the brush has broken loose on the ninth row  which causes the ninth row to pop out  i guess i m stuck with it because i purchased it in       other than that i love the brush for me and my son s natural hair     
1033,4.0,                       i have trained my curls with this brushjust went on yt on how to properly use it and it helped a lottotally recommend it     
1034,5.0,                       this is the real denman brush  there are brushes on amazon that are not the actual denman brush  this one is  you need a real denman brush if you have natural hair  the fake ones will tear your hair out  this brush is heavy and gets the job done  my hair is very curly and it really helps to tame the curls when i am doing a polished style  the shipping was fast and the price was right      
1035,5.0,                       excellent quality defanging brush for natural hair  curly  wavy  and everything in between  i purchased the   row   very study design   well made  solid purchase so i m pleased      
1036,5.0,                       i bought this brush for my    yo granddaughter who has very  very  very curly hair  she also hates getting her hair combed or brushed  this brush not only was easy to use and get through her curls  but her hair definitely looks better  it really helps with the frizz  i even ordered one for my daughter  in law  who has similar hair   i highly recommend this brush      
1037,5.0,                       purchased for my daughters curly hair routine  she likes the brush      
1038,4.0,                       a good brush in every way  except i m still getting a static effect that causes me to get shocked by it   same thing with my old brush   but then again  i ve always been prone to static shock more than most people  so maybe it s just me         
1039,5.0,                       if you have curlier hair than  a  b  this brush might be for you  the denman brush really helps disperse product into your hair while training your curl pattern  pros  my hair was more defined and less tangled after using the brush  cons  it s time consuming to use the brush on all sections of the hair  keep in mind that the denman brush is not made for detangling      
1040,5.0,                       fabulous brush truly the best on the market  my family and i have been usually this brush and it s great for our thick italian hair         
1041,5.0,                       this is a fabulous brush for strangling hair   i have lots and lots of fine hair that tangles easily   this brush went through it quite easily without ripping at it   i also bought one for my incredibly picky niece with the same hair type  and she says she loves it also      
1042,5.0,                       this review is for  b curls  it definitely made my curls pop and have definition  i use it after i detangle my hair with a wide tooth comb  do not use this to detangle any afro textures hair cause it will rip your hair out  the bristles seems really strong  use it like i said and you will have some beautiful clumped together curls  i had the best curls in over a year from using this brush      
1043,5.0,                       strongest brush and will make even a nappy head like mine straight  love it      
1044,5.0,                       great detangling brush      
1045,5.0,                       i love this brush  i ordered because i saw a youtube video of a girl with curly hair using it  and her curls came out amazing  i always do wash and gos  and i usually would only brush comb my hair in the shower style it once i was out  but sometimes if i waited a little longer to style it  my hair would get dry and frizzy  it would be almost impossible to get my curls defined without getting back in the shower  with this brush  now all i have to do it spray my hair with water  put product in it  and comb it through with this brush  and my curls are poppin   my image shows before and after use of the brush about    minutes after getting out of the shower  the brush is also very sturdy and you can take rows out if you want a looser curl      
1046,5.0,                       i have allot of very fine hair  it is a combination of wavy and straight  read a review of this brush and decided to try it with not much hope that it would work  will try anything on my hair at least once  lol  watched a video online about how to use it and off i went to shampoo condition my hair so i was starting from scratch  followed the directions i wrote down  air dryed it  yup a couple of hours for results  boy was i happy with the results  i have really nice frizz free waves  what i always wanted but never could achieve  please remember  what works for one person may not work for another which is why i try everything at least once      
1047,5.0,                       i love this brush to detangle and style my curly hair  it takes out my tangles quickly and i lose a lot less hair then when i finger comb  because i detangle in the shower with conditioner  it slips out of my hand a lot  but that is to be expected  i also use it after apply my styling cream  to make sure it gets to every strand      
1048,5.0,                       after watching several tutorials that touted this as the go to brush for curls  i bought it and wow  the results are fantastic  my curls have a better shape and there is clearly less frizz  my hair also dries faster and has a better overall shape than before      
1049,5.0,                       my hair desperately needed this  it doesn t just rip my hair out and can get through my curls as needed      
1050,5.0,                       i have modified the brush to have every other row and it s perfect  i shed very little hair using this brush  i also purchased the mini version for my baby girl and with the same modification works well for her  great for detangling and smoothing hair without undue stress on your hair      
1051,5.0,                       denman brushes are the best brushes ever made  the classic is the best  i ve used them from the late   s  and that one i used until i got my new one about a year ago  so cheap it is not  it does not fall apart  i had long  to my butt  curly hair for years and it never let me down  they must be buying some cheaper one to save many  cause they are wrong about the denman  best brush and only brush for most of my life      
1052,5.0,                       i love the denman it helps detangle thick curly hair and also when styling your hair after getting it wet      
1053,5.0,                       bought this for my daughter to detangle hair when wet  it did not work  the bristles move too much which makes it ineffective for detangling      
1054,5.0,                       i love my denman brush  i have been using it for years and still going strong  i prefer to use this brush to detangle my  c  a textured hair than a wide tooth comb  it is also easy to use and hold     
1055,5.0,                       i haven t used a brush on my curly hair since i was a teenager  for anything other than blowing my hair straight  but  when i saw youtube videos of women with my type of hair using this brush to style their natural curls  i had to try it  i like it  it works great for separating your curls  hair looks almost as good as when you finger curl it and can be done so much faster      
1056,1.0,                       this brush fell apart after use  it s very flimsy  would not recommend overall  try a different brand      
1057,5.0,                       love this brush makes my hair feel and look shiny  and it good for combing out hair without causing tangles or pain      
1058,5.0,                       i began my curly girl journey at the beginning of covid      i have tried a multitude of products as my hair is more wavy than curly  i was getting frustrated bc i have witnessed some curls but lately even my waves our flat  i have used this brush one time and i have some full curls and the best waves i have ever achieved  i also used less product and a lot less effort at trying to scrunch to create more waves  this is a must for anyone on a curly girl journey if you actually have more curl instead of waves i can t imagine what this would do for you with a lot less effort      
1059,5.0,                       good quality  does not seem like it will break  works great on my hair     
1060,5.0,                       recommended by my salon stylist    much cheaper than retail so gentle on my wet hair

1069,5.0,                       i love this brush  it forms perfect curls on my  b hair      
1070,5.0,                       if you purchased this brush to de tangle your hair  unless you have short to medium  straight and fairly fine hair  you are going to be drastically disappointed   try taking out a few rows of pins and it might work ok as a de tangle brush   or  better yet  skip this one and get yourself a proper paddle brush  or wide tooth comb  that is specifically meant to tackle wet tangled hair   enough said about that  onward to my review why i purchased this brush i have  b  a curly  dry ish hair that always could use a boost of product and styling methods to make it curlier and to have the style last   this brush is perfect to style your wet curly hair  once it has been de tangled    i would say i have fine to medium density hair  but tons of it  and use a light leave in and then a styling cream  some use a hybrid creamy gel if it has some slip   to style my hair with this brush   you need some slip or it is not going to work   what the brush does is distribute your product  styling cream  evenly  helps to separate the strands  and because of the half round shape  can put a nice bend to your hair   all of that helps your hair clump and curl much better than using your fingers alone   think of it a bit like finger coiling without all the time and effort depending on your curl type  you can get anywhere from nice loose waves to tight ringlets   i suggest checking out youtube for some pointers on the different methods of use for this brush   also   seal  your styling with a gel  it will help hold it for a few days my last  tips  are what brush to purchase   i have layered hair and my shortest hair  on the top of my head  is about   inches long up to bra strap length hair and the d  works best for me on my longer hair   i feel that the d  is a bit big for my shortest length hair and i have been experimenting with the d   and d      so far  i think the top of my head is too short to get much benefit from any denman brush so i do a combination of finger coiling and twisting the d     unfortunately that is also my  straightest  hair and hoping with time and the denman i can train it to curl a bit better if you have very long hair  you may prefer the d  as there is a bit more surface area to make your styling go a bit faster   i have seen styling of the d  vs the d  and the end results are not that noticeably different   the d  is similar  but a heavier brush but i have never used it to know of any difference in styling your curly hair and finally the d   and d   are best for shorter hair   i find they work ok on layered hair  but i would suspect either would be absolutely perfect for a single layer bob one final note if you have very thick hair   you may wish to remove a row or two of the pins or else you might never be able to get the brush through your hair  no matter how much of a slippy cream you apply   you could also try the d    or free flow   they come with less pins to start hope this exceptionally long post has been helpful   good luck on your curly girl journey
