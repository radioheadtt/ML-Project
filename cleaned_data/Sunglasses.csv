0,5.0,                       great sunglasses for the price  i ve paid more for ones that broke the next day  these are great and vision during the day is great  i don t wear my sunglasses at night like a creeper or a tool so i can t comment on the visibility during those times  great buy and quality product      
1,5.0,                       these are very good for the money  polarized and look good     
2,5.0,                       great sunglasses and they are polarized which help with driving  lightweight and comfortable      
3,4.0,                       ordered   sets one set had a broken bow not bad      were fine  i guess   out   is not bad      
4,5.0,                       i like is pretty comfortable     
5,5.0,                       excellent     
6,1.0,                       brought the three pack  never again they are really small and flimsy  dollar store glasses are better than theses   would maybe buy for a child that s it     
7,5.0,                       for the price  i can t complain thank you      
8,5.0,                       high quality for great price  my new favorite pair      
9,5.0,                       these are great glasses  the shipping time was horrible over a month but i m not sure if it s amazon or something else at fault  all of the shipping was supposed to be handled by amazon  the glasses are great though      
10,4.0,                       so there are many possible combinations here   i bought the     pack  matte black frame black lens   matte black frame black lens    one pair is a wayfarer clone  the other is a clubmaster clone but the lenses are not black  thankfully   because if they were black they wouldn t transmit any light   indeed  the description shows six possible colors   grey  g    blue  green  red and silver   no black   and no brown either  although some of the combinations say that the lenses are brown   contradictory and very confusing the lenses i got were more like bluish grey   very nice visibility   they are plastic  just like the frames   despite the high ratings here  don t confuse these glasses for maui jim s   the high ratings for these glasses can only be driven by the low prices   and it is for that reason i gave them   stars   they are a step up from the glasses you find in any tourist shop in a beach town  and actually for a lower price   so that s nice i tested out these two pair of kaliyadis glasses  and a pair of the polarspex wayfarer clones i also bought here  on a drive cross country and back of the two pair of kaliyadis that i got  i m not a fan of the look or feel of the wayfarer clone   i like the look and feel of the polarspex wayfarer clones  although i like the visibility of these kaliyadis better however  i like the kaliyadis clubmaster clone a lot   very light and comfortable  and they look good   an excellent value overall  between these kaliyadis and the polarspex  which are both highly rated at amazon  i liked the kaliyadis better   for     for two pair  it s hard to go wrong      
11,5.0,                       everything is as described  they are very comfortable and do a good job of protecting one s eyes from excess uv rays      
12,5.0,                       ordered these glasses twice  lost the first pair but i love them  great quality for the price  would      recommend     
13,5.0,                       just got these today  but they are very lightweight and seem like good quality  they come with cloth baggies and a microfiber wipe the sunglasses also come with a little card that proves to you that they are actually polarized  i could see dolphins when i was wearing the sunglasses  but when i took them off  the dolphins disappeared       
14,5.0,                       literally one of the nicest pairs of sunglasses i ve owned  very similar in quality compared to top shelf brands  love the style and quality     
15,5.0,                       great product   sturdy and lightweight      
16,5.0,                       great value and great product     
17,5.0,                       love these sunglasses  so comfortable  sturdy  and excellent quality polarized lens  we ve already bought two different sets and love them both  highly recommend just as the other reviews say      
18,5.0,                       great for vacation so you don t have to worry about losing more expensive ones in the water no i didn t learn from experience   not sure how long they will hold up but it s   for     so i would be good with a few days      
19,1.0,                       they come in nice packaging but they feel super cheap and the leg broke after one week of use     
20,2.0,                       i know i cannot expect much when purchasing sunglasses for such a low price  but i do expect    at the very least   for them to last more than a few uses  unfortunately  all three broke within a month or so of use  this would be understandable if i was rough with them or careless  but i literally kept them in my ray ban s case for safekeeping  so  if you want some low cost throwaway sunglasses that will not last  these may work well  otherwise  avoid this buy      
21,5.0,                       wonderful sun protection from coastal sunshine  great price and wonderful quality  can t beat this price    will buy again if need be      
22,5.0,                       bought for myself and my girlfriends  both pairs look awesome and are polarized so you can actually see  it also comes with a case and microfiber cloth for both      
23,5.0,                       bought these for my girlfriend who like the black colored ones i got  she absolutely loves them and wears them constantly here in sunny oklahoma     
24,3.0,                    se pelan muy r pido y son muy sencillos        
25,1.0,                       the left lens is darker  wearing it makes me feel nausea     
26,5.0,                       great looking and great eye protection   getting some complements      
27,5.0,                       love these  they are unisex and work with every outfit     
28,1.0,                       i put these on and immediately knew i d be retiring them  i turned around in direct sunlight around an hour or   after sunrise and could hardly see anything  it hurt my eyes to wear these because they reflected sun from behind me at an angle into my eyes      
29,5.0,                       they re not too dark  but really diminish glare from sunlight upon the snow  they re also useful on overcast cloudy days      
30,5.0,                       love these sunglasses  i was skeptical of the lens quality for affordable sunglasses  but these are clear and without any haze or distortion  good fit  comfortable and i will definitely order again when i need to replace these      
31,5.0,                       i chose this set with the blue lenses and turtle frames and they exceeded my expectations  for only being    bucks  you get   quality sunglasses and they did the job on my first cruise  i did lose a rubber nose piece  but that s no fault of the glasses  i ll add a picture to show how they looked in real life      
32,5.0,                       great deal    the sunglasses are nowhere near as cheap as i thought they would be      
33,4.0,                       after wearing these almost everyday since ordering  i love everything about them  the only con is they are a little  tight on my temples  recently my wife s         raybans broke  she couldn t  find any thing she liked at the hut so they gave us     off on another pair  they really suck you in  sooooo  i ended up walking out with a brand new pair of rayban justins   i ve been looking at getting a pair for a while but didn t need or want to spend rb     the difference between the rb and these on amazon as far as comfort is night and day  the rb justin is much comfier for me    the finished product over all tho the differences are marginal at best   i asked myself are these rb really worth         vs        for two pair on amazon  absolutely not    the rb are better don t get me wrong  but not         dollars better  i also paid         for a pair of ditas tho so take my advice with a grain of salt lol      
34,5.0,                       they are fantastic        
35,5.0,                    buena calidad        
36,5.0,                       stylish sunglasses and provide super blocking of the sun rays     
37,5.0,                       best pair of sunglasses i have owned  i bought these because i am irresponsible with sunglasses always breaking and loosing them  these are high quality for a low price      
38,4.0,                    est n muy bien solo que uno sali  un poco chueco pero la calidad es buena        
39,5.0,                       i will def buy again  this is my second purchase because people keep wanting them and i give them to them  lol     
40,5.0,                       very good quality     
41,5.0,                       awesome style  blocks the sun  and for a great price  if they ever broke or got lost i would definitely buy again      
42,5.0,                       comfortable to wear and easy to fit into a small purse  good sun protection too     
43,5.0,                       love these glasses  and the shape and size ended up being great  also a   pack was perfect so i could keep a pair in my car  a pair on me  and a backup pair in my backpack      
44,5.0,                       amazing for the bright sun     
45,5.0,                       very good quality and style     
46,5.0,                       once you ve worn a polarized sunglass its tough to not have them  i wanted a pair to keep in our  nd vehicle  these two pairs cost less than the last pair i bought at a bargain chain  i m happy with the fit  the clarity of the lens and the style  i highly recommend      
47,5.0,                       these sunglasses were just what i was looking for  they work great for blocking the sunlight when i am driving or just out in the yard   lightweight and comfortable      
48,4.0,                       very comfortable  stylish and light weight     
49,3.0,                       cute  but the upper plastic part of the frame on the wire pair broke in short order  even with very gentle use   the plastic pair is  so  polarized that they give me a headache in the car  the windshield must be polarized as well   and you cannot look at a newer phone screen with them on  lools like an oil slick      
50,2.0,                       the side corners of the sunglasses constantly reflect what s behind you  so wearing these shades would tire you out after a while  a bit distracting  to say the least  the nose pads are also a bit too noticeable to the wearer  feels like the nose is being pinched by a baby plastic lobster  if that makes any sense       
51,5.0,                       i bought this for my nephew for our christmas gift exchange   they looked great on him   nice looking shades at an affordable price     
52,5.0,                       guilt free glasses for the pool or river  for how cheap and awesome these are you can t go wrong scooping up a pair or two can t tell you how many ray bands i ve lost doing hood rat stuff at the local watering hole no longer an issue now      
53,5.0,                       haven t even used the blue one but the black one looks awesome and does it s job what else could i ask for for this price too      
54,5.0,                       granted  these are not super duper fancy sunners   but when i buy those  they still break get run over sat on lost   for this price  these are surprisingly good sunglasses  i picked the two pairs of all black  one blues brothery and the other that s a throwback to     s glasses  and i like and will wear  em both  in fact i m back buying an extra set for when these eventually break get run over sat on lost  lol  if nothing else  these polarized babies make an excellent spare set to leave in the car  received quickly and needed no adjusting  recommended      
55,5.0,                       nice set of glasses  polarized  and each came with a sleek black carrying bag and cleaning clothe      
56,5.0,                       i ve bought these twice because i lose my glasses  i love the polarize part and they look cute  comfortable too      
57,5.0,                       i have had these glasses for about two weeks  the wayfarer pair is a little bigger on my face than i hoped  but the clubmasters fit amazingly  the material is a matte black rubber that feels high quality  and the hinges do not feel weak      
58,4.0,                       pretty good quality for the price they don t feel as cheap as a pair of gas station sunglasses  the tint is just dark enough where it doesn t bother me to drive in them  the rimless do seem a bit small but i have a big head but the retro rayban clones fit just fine      
59,4.0,                       these fit me well  but my husband has a bigger head and they did not fit him well at all  quality is great though and i m enjoying them a lot even if my husband can t      
60,5.0,                       very light and comfortable      
61,5.0,                       love the glasses  great price comes with a case and cleaning cloth  have one pair in my car and one at home      
62,1.0,                       frame cracked on the joint due to cold weather  it will as fine until went out for a walk in the evening and start feeling that it doesn t fit well  after returning home i inspected the temple is cracked  we really enjoyed these glasses but didn t expect to break like this      
63,4.0,                       they are what they are  but i think they re worth six or seven bucks apiece  they look pretty good at a distance  they re lightweight and have polarized plastic lenses  hey  three pairs of clubmasters would run you around          so  at least they got that going for  em      
64,2.0,                       the semi rimless pair fits good  i don t love the nose guards though  they re annoying with any readjustment of the glassesthe full rimmed matte black pair are slanted on the nose and earpieces connections so they re offset on my face to the side for the price they re pretty good      
65,4.0,                       i bout bundle    pairs  and they are great  one came a bit crooked but overall great buy for    bucks  lenses are great and there is barely any glare      
66,1.0,                       not polarized  bought for fishing  worst investment ever made          
67,5.0,                       clarity of lenses is perfect      
68,5.0,                       high quality     
69,5.0,                       love these   they look good  are solidly made and no big deal if you lose a pair because of the great price      
70,2.0,                       cute glasses but broke the  nd day didn t drop or anything   i thought they were cute a   pack his and hers   my husband loves them but my pair broke the second day i was really upset because i needed glasses and these came right away amd were adorable but didn t last   maybe i got a bad pair      
71,5.0,                       i liked how it includes   pairs for the price  they are high quality and the polarizing was nice to have on the drive      
72,5.0,                       all three pairs are similar but unique in their own design      
73,5.0,                       it s a great product  i used to have a pair of sunglasses  but i broke them because i was careless  ha hai just tried the product  it s really good quality  now i have my own sunglassesafter driving no longer have to worry about the sun glare  ha ha ha     
74,4.0,                       these have held up for a while  i wear one pair daily and my girlfriend wears the other  definitely a good investment for  cheap  sunglasses  overall  the quality outcompetes the price  it s almost a no brainer if this style is your fancy      
75,5.0,                       these are wonderful   visible images are crisp and very clear  love them        
76,5.0,                       i love these sunglasses   there nice light weight      
77,5.0,                       love my glasses  stylish yet functional  best value sunglasses i have ever owned  there is hardly any compromise in workmanship  packaging is also impressive very good product  thinking about buying few more pairs for my family      
78,1.0,                       really disappointed with these  the reflective lenses started coming off and i m now covered in a glitter like dust that has remained coating my entire body through a workout  rainstorm  and shower  so i m not sure as to how i should get rid of what i m assuming is the polarized coating off of me      
79,5.0,                       only writing a review because i keep getting a email asking me to do so  the glasses are cool  impressive packaging  very nice for the price      
80,5.0,                       i use them when driving or walking around  big fan of these and they don t look weird on my head  which is always a plus  always a plus  there s never a time when it s not a plus  every single occurrence of it not looking weird on my head would be considered a plus  quite literally  it is a plus when it happens  every time without fail  there s not a time when it happens when it is anything but a plus  if the instance occurs  it is surely  unequivocally and unmistakably  a plus  without exception  i would consider it a plus if and when they do not look weird on my head  and these sunglasses do not look weird on my head      
81,5.0,                       stylish and affordable and great price     
82,5.0,                    muy buen producto  y cumple el prop sito para el que fue adquirido        
83,5.0,                       feel cheap but look and work great   comes with a nice fabric storage pouch and cleaning cloths  good value      
84,5.0,                       great sunglasses for the price     
85,5.0,                       great value for for product comfortable and blocks sun without hindering vision     
86,5.0,                       ok guys    i just got finished buying all of my lightning deals on amazon   i went to my mailbox today and got a package that i was so happy i received   these glasses are awesome   i thought i was getting one pair  but inside the box marked kaliyadi was two pair of amazing glasses that look great  i am going to order another set   thanks my friends at kaliyadi    rob paisola in las vegas nv     
87,5.0,                       great sunglasses     
88,5.0,                       my son was very happy with these glasses as a gift      
89,5.0,                       i love the pair of sunglasses     
90,5.0,                       love  great quality and even better fit  polarized      
91,5.0,                       not a bad thing but had better for same money      
92,5.0,                       yes  better than the ones i always buy      
93,5.0,                       from   days of using the sun glasses  i would definitely recommend them      
94,5.0,                       love love love     im ordering them again      
95,5.0,                       nice glasses good sun protection     
96,5.0,                       so far so good  haven t owned them for very long  can t respond on durability but they look good      
97,5.0,                       they feel good and pretty sturdy for the price tag  i always buy cheap pairs of sunglasses because i m naturally careless with them  these are one of the better pairs i have bought on amazon      
98,5.0,                       my boyfriend loved these  great that its a pack of two  very sturdy  looks great on most face shapes  my boyfriend usually looks strange in sunglasses  self proclaimed  but these he thought looked good on his face      
99,4.0,                       great improvement over the dime store glasses   good protection      
100,5.0,                       these are great sunglasses  they are definitely worth the low price  they are well made and look very similar to raybans  i purchased these because i wanted the tortoise shell that look identical to my rayban glasses  but i ve ended up wearing the all black pair the most because they re so stylish      
101,3.0,                       you definitely get what you pay for  you can tell the lens itself is not completely secure within the sunglasses and the frame for one of the sunglasses broke for seemingly no reason within the first few uses      
102,5.0,                       they are perfect and they are awesome for the price      
103,5.0,                       great fit and quality  holding up well and i wear them all the time      
104,2.0,                       i debated writing this but decided to spare someone else from this experience i originally bought a   pack and loved them for the first week  these sunglasses are stylish  lightweight and have clear and crisp viewing  then  after a week of normal use  one of the side pieces that goes behind your ear started to snap off at the hinge near the glasses part  i thought maybe i just had a defective pair and threw them away i bought a   pack all of that same style  because i love how they look  and within two days  the exact same thing happened to one of them  as pictured   two separate orders  two separate glasses  same style but different colors   this can t be a defect then four days later  the plastic part near the inside of the nose randomly breaks off a different pair  as pictured   this part connects to the plastic over the glasses which lifts up every time i try to wear them now three sunglasses all breaking within a week of use  no  these sunglasses are stylish but are made of cheap  brittle plastic  these are not inexpensive glasses rather they re cheap quality glasses  if you want them to just look cute for a few wears then they re worth it for just that  however  don t rely on these being around for more than a couple of weeks      
105,5.0,                       i never spend a lot on sunglasses because i don t take care of them  but i still love a cute pair  these sunglasses are so cute and much nicer than the price suggests  they are not flimsy and the lenses actually block out the sun really well  good buy  i just wish one of the two packs had the kind i wanted because i would have paid a little more for a second pair      
106,3.0,                       guess i should have looked at more pictures of members  just gave the rimless pairs to my girlfriend because it just does not look like a pair of men s glasses      
107,5.0,                       i would but another pair      
108,5.0,                       these products arrived quickly and are a great deal for the price  sturdy and hold up well      
109,5.0,                       light weight  good sun blockinggood fit   nice looking         
110,5.0,                       love the product but some minor deatails are that the big square sunglasses are bulky but do the job and the small circle sunglasses are the best glasses i have wore in a long time and the blue color is nice     
111,4.0,                       the women s glasses feel pretty chinsy and are not comfortable at all  but the men s feel nicer      
112,5.0,                       great value      
113,5.0,                       this pack of sunglasses are great  bought them for my husband and myself  the all black ones are a little bit bigger than the ones with the bottom silver frame  so it worked out perfectly for us  they came with their own soft cover and a cleaning cloth  which was a great bonus  such a good deal and awesome quality  highly recommend      
114,1.0,                       just   pair was the right size definitely not satisfied     
115,5.0,                       always lose ray bans  i bought like   of these and don t care if i drop them in the ocean  they are actually polarized too  great sunnies     
116,5.0,                       bought this for a gift very good design  light weight and good value for the money i would buy it again      
117,4.0,                       so i was looking for a reasonably priced pair of replacements for my last pair of sunglasses that were sadly lost  i knew i wanted something good but didn t want to drop more than      bucks like i did on my old glasses   at the end of the day  sunglasses get used often and sometimes in the hustle of life they either are lost or get broken after spending some time looking around and comparing options i settled on this pair because for the price   are better than one  i have not been disappointed  they are light weight  they feel great on my face and they get the job done  would be nice if they came with a case but they do include some nice cloth pouches to keep your glasses clean and safe when not in use  overall very satisfied with my purchase      
118,5.0,                       best quality for your buck      
119,2.0,                       the glossy semi rimless pair looks great  i only wore them twice and the screws came out   of course i lost the screws and just threw the glasses away   i really wish they held up better because they look just like higher end sunglasses      
120,5.0,                       i haven t done one of these in a long time  possibly ever  but these are great  i wish i could cuss a bit to emphasize how great these are  they re super inexpensive   i wish i had gotten the three pack now  instead of the two   but sturdy and protect my eyes great  i m really pumped on these  and i m actually telling all my buddies about them  no joke  they re great      
121,5.0,                       both these shades are good for what your paying for the lenses are clear and the frames fit perfectly      
122,4.0,                       these are great but the pair with the metal arms fits a bit small on the face  happy overall       
123,5.0,                       good design and for the price not worried about losing them out on the boat  i always prefer polarized sunglasses and these are perfect for me knowing i ll end up losing them or tearing them up  i can always just buy another set because it s super affordable      
124,5.0,                       the glasses was so nice my teen borrowed a   pairs     
125,1.0,                       these sunglasses did not make it   weeks before the frame cracked and the lens has fallen out  kept in the case when they weren t being worn  not a good value at all      
126,3.0,                       the product arrived as described  in the box was a dust wipe to remove excess dust as well as one storage case for the   pairs of glasses  the glasses are a bit lighter in shade and appear  see through  from the other side  they also seem to be rather flimsy but i guess when you buy   pairs at once you re expecting them to break over time      
127,5.0,                       love these  i wear the wire frame  not masculine  gave the plastic frames to my brother  they fit well and you can t see through the lenses      
128,5.0,                       fashionable and great sun blocking lenses      
129,5.0,                       didn t expect this quality  exceeded my expectations     
130,5.0,                       this pair of sunglasses is sleek and stylish  and they provide superb protection against uv rays      
131,5.0,                       super flattering on his face  he loves them  came with a cute black pouch and lens cloth      
132,5.0,                       best bang for your buck      
133,5.0,                       these sunglasses live up to everything the provider states      
134,5.0,                       loved these glasses definitely worth the money      
135,5.0,                       i like it very much  good customer service attitude  the color is darker than ordinary blue  lighter than black  it s nice to see  it s half the price cheaper than physical stores  i m very satisfied with online shopping      
136,5.0,                       great value here  i can never find sunglasses that fit my stupid face but these seem to work fine  they don t look goofy at all  the polarized lenses work great  could at least see the dang fish in the water ignoring my bait  these are some great cheap sunglasses that feel great  light weight and work well  might order another pair just to keep in various places  my fianc  even stole a pair as soon as i opened the box even tho she has multiple expensive pairs of sunglasses      
137,2.0,                       the hinges are not good  one has plastic stuck in it and won t close properly  i am disappointed in the quality for the money     
138,5.0,                       one of the best sun glasses i have ever used  i use them for driving during the day and they are absolutely great  they even bring a polarizing test  i ve let them fall  sat on them and threw them in the car and they haven t broken  cant wait to use them during the summer         
139,5.0,                       i love the style and comfort of the sunglasses  i have gotten a lot of compliments when i wear them  i would definitely buy them again      
140,5.0,                       sunglasses fit good and look well made   very pleased with value      
141,1.0,                       these are kids sized glasses  they don t fit adult faces      
142,5.0,                       i loved them  ended up buying another pair      
143,5.0,                       good     
144,5.0,                       slightly larger than standard clubmasters  which are too small for most  perfect fit     
145,5.0,                    c modos y exelente protecci n        
146,5.0,                       unisex  durable  great quality polarized sunglasses  very comfortable fit and no fading of gold  many compliments mistaken as ray bands  highly recommend  no scratching after dropping and swimming with them hope this is helpful  you can t beat the price      
147,5.0,                       these fit good and aren t too darkened  but are just right  of course  however  because of the shape  sun can get in on the sides but that no big deal for me because it doesn t bother me      
148,5.0,                       nice glasses fit comfortably   well made      
149,5.0,                       first of all    pairs what a great value   secondly trendy designs and lastly the quality is great   these are for my wife and she has a small face and wish these were a bit smaller  other than that these polarized glasses are amazing      
150,5.0,                       i absolutely love those sunglasses i kept the brown one for myself and gifted my husband the black one      
151,5.0,                       i don t dislike i do like it very much i do use for driving and walking  the are great event in night     
152,5.0,                       i really like them but when i got it the package was open     
153,5.0,                       these sunglasses are perfect  could not be happier they re lightweight but sturdy  polarized lenses block out a lot of the glare  stylish looking and the price is amazing      
154,5.0,                       excellent sunnies for next to nothing      
155,5.0,                       better quality than the price reflects  very comfortable      
156,5.0,                       i was very happy with the purchase of these   sunglasses   sharp looking  good quality and very inexpensive      
157,5.0,                       i love the sunglasses the quality it s outstanding i would definitely buy again     
158,5.0,                       these work well for what they are  i love the matte black and brown colors  they are also very light on my head and don t give me a headache      
159,5.0,                       made strong like the old fashion glasses  they have screws to tighten when needed  the frames are strong  and beautifully made  and it comes with a cloth bag  and lens wipe      
160,1.0,                       i purchased these sunglasses due to many great reviews  so hopefully this is a fluke  however  if it s not  i strongly suggest you not purchase these sunglasses  i wore the  wayfarer  style glasses four times over the course of three days  the next thing i knew  i noticed the right lens lying on the ground  the frame snapped in two at the top and the lens popped out while they were on my face  the  clubmaster  style glasses were my back ups  after one wear i noticed the frame starting to crack at the top of the left lens  in essence  this is one of those situations where you get what you paid for   and i m out    bucks  i d also note that while the lenses are polarized and seem pretty nice  there is a tint of blue for the  wayfarer  and red for the  clubmaster  which can and does get annoying  not good for driving  especially       
161,5.0,                       good glasses for the money     
162,5.0,                       they are great sunglasses  i will definitely order again      
163,5.0,                       i ve only had them a few days but they feel very nice and well put together and two pair was a super great deal     
164,5.0,                       awesome     
165,3.0,                       very small  pictures on people s faces are a bit deceptive to their real size      
166,5.0,                       these are  amazing rayban dupes love them great for your money and they are polarized        
167,5.0,                       very cute  look expensive when cheap     
168,5.0,                       thecare very confortable and good value for the money     
169,5.0,                       they are quite stylish and i wear them every morning  i like that it comes with a cloth to clean them and a pouch  highly recommend  super cheap but quality is great      
170,4.0,                       i really love the look of the matte black framed pair the second pair seem a little small on me or maybe i m just not used to the semi rimless look  i left off one star on sun protection because i feel like the rimless ones let in more light on the sides  i probably should have expected that though both pairs are nice and dark  they are definitely polarized  both very lightweight without feeling like cheap plastic i ve only really been wearing them for about a week and they re great so far  i ll definitely update if i notice anything else      
171,5.0,                       great value  comes with glasses pouch and micro fiber wipes  durable and quality is amazing      
172,5.0,                       i ve got no complaints about these sunglasses   they were much better than i expected for the price and have been using for over a month   i m always pleasantly surprised when a product turns out to be better than i expected      
173,5.0,                       these sunglasses arrived in just a couple of days and they fit very nicely   the polarized lenses are great   couldn t ask for a better value      
174,5.0,                       these two pairs of sunglasses are identical to the pictures if not better  very lightweight and super stylish  it s a great deal for a great price  i will buy more         
175,5.0,                       great glasses for cheap      
176,5.0,                       i love these sunglasses so much  been wearing them for almost a month now  they were so cheap and stylish  it s so much better than my old expensive ray bans that i used to have  don t shell out your      for a pair of expensive sunglasses  just buy these  they are polarized like it advertises  these help with my eyes so much  especially on those bright summer days when it feels like the sun is blinding my eyes when i m walking or driving      
177,4.0,                       nice glasses  fashionable  was happy with product  but build is lightweight and fragile  would buy again     well i actually need to because both pairs snapped where nose cushion meets frame  still beats breaking an expensive pair  maybe the introduction of a frame case could help protect frames and promo brand at the same time if ofcourse the font isnt too cheesy  thanks idk lol      
178,2.0,                       not large enough for       man  these are small glasses   would be fine for child or young lady      
179,2.0,                       these never quite fit correctly  no matter how much research i do to make sure they fit  plus  they are rather cheaply made        
180,5.0,                       the sunglasses work great and really are polarized  perfect fit for myself and my husband     
181,4.0,                       good sunglasses for the price  much better protecting my eyes than the     guess sunglasses i got  i think those were more for fashion than function i think      
182,5.0,                       these are really stylish polarized glasses   i liked them so much for myself i bought them for a friend      
183,5.0,                       i break and sunglasses too much to get raybans  so these are the next best thing  it doesn t make things as dark as raybans do  but since i have a sunlight sensitive eye color  it keeps my eyes from hurting even when the sun is out  only thing is that you have rainbow  peripheral vision but it s not too bad  i love them      
184,5.0,                       great product   thank you      
185,5.0,                       cannot find a better pair of sunglasses for the price  it comes with a cool polarized card to check your lenses  i compared them with my      ray bans and they we re identical  they re very light and can be worn all day no problem   the brown frames with the blue lens are my favorite but you can t go wrong with any of them   these are perfect for a family vacation everybody gets a pair and if you lose or break them it s no big deal  ordering more for bachelor party      
186,5.0,                       these are amazing quality for how low priced they are   same weight as my real ray bans and the polarized lenses are very clear   i will probably order another set just to have extra      
187,5.0,                       i ordered the red lenses but i think they are not the exactly same color that appear on the page     
188,5.0,                       love that i bought three pairs for a great price  been using for nearly two months  and i am still happy with them  they look nice and do the job      
189,2.0,                       i got the set of three  the one with silver rims is audibly creaky when opening closing it  an issue with the hinge i assume  but basically unusable  feels like it s going to break every time i open close it      
190,5.0,                       my family and i go out on the boat a lot and my mom always has to sit in the back with a towel covering her head because of the glair from the sun hitting the white boat  so i ordered these and she absolutely loves them  they block out the glair and help with the headaches      
191,5.0,                       really good quality for the price   comes with a small bag and cloth for each pair which is a plus      
192,5.0,                       really nice glasses for the price     
193,5.0,                       perfect value for the money     
194,5.0,                       wonderful glasses  i have been looking for a pair of polarized ones that were inexpensive  alas  here they were  thanks again for your product      
195,5.0,                       they were great wore them fir vacation to vegas great sun protection and good blackout glasses     
196,4.0,                       i found these glasses to be of medium quality   for the price  this makes sense   beware that the lenses are close together  so if you have a big head  they will not fit well i missed the return window on these  so now i am stuck with the glasses   i won t wear them unfortunately  but they are still decent quality      
197,5.0,                       let s be honest  these are cheap gas station level sunglasses trying to look like ray bans  but they do a great job at it  and let s face it  three pairs for that price is insane      
198,5.0,                       i was looking for some polarized sunglasses after seeing adds for     ones on instagram  i checked here and love these ones  solid build  two pairs  and actually polarized  they send a card with them to show the polarization  the wayfarer ones are rubberized soft touch coated  super premium  i like them both a lot  good value for sure     
199,3.0,                       don t waste your money  very cheap made      
200,5.0,                       i bought these for my    year old granddaughter and she loves them       
201,5.0,                         pairs for this price was a real bargain  they do prevent daytime glare while driving      
202,1.0,                       only sent me   pair of sunglasses from the   pack i bought  i m gonna be honest though  i do like the pair i did get  glasses look tiny but fit really well      
203,5.0,                       wow  these sunglasses were one of the best buys for me this year  they came in a very appropriate sized box for the glasses  it includes a cleaning cloth and a small pouch for the glasses  the quality is light and durable  i can barely even feel the semi rimless on my face  for the price you get such a great deal and the sunglasses are polarized  you really can t find a better deal        
204,5.0,                         nice ass pair of shades for cheap   looks like straight ray ban clubmasters   they look and feel like their good quality but for mere pennies compared to how much you ll spend on high end models     
205,5.0,                       good sunglasses for the price  stylish  pretty comfortable      
206,4.0,                       a little stiff but nice  they look stylish and well made  durable plastic      
207,5.0,                       particularly like the light weight      
208,3.0,                       i love the styles very much but when i got it the   pack they where all smooshed into a box and i was hoping they weren t broken n then i took them out the arm pieces or whatever you call them felt stiff like if i open them too hard it would snap off and the last thing is they where way to small for me the pictures shown and in the reviews looked fairly big but when i got them they looked like the size for kids     
209,5.0,                       excellent   as good as the more expensive ones i ve purchased in the past     
210,5.0,                       great value for the money      
211,5.0,                       the quality on these glasses is amazing for the price  the other day i bought one pair of glasses  same model  and it was     and the quality was very bad  i m happy for this purchase  thanks       
212,5.0,                       good value     
213,5.0,                       these sunglasses rival ray ban and oakley  but the value is unbelievable      
214,5.0,                       this is the style i like  fit great  good darkening     
215,2.0,                       was working very well until one of the nose pieces broke off after a few months of use      
216,5.0,                       love the quality  and can t beat the price  use these all the time and you have an extra pair for your passenger  way better than other sunglasses i have bought on amazon      
217,2.0,                       was ok for a while  thought the quality was more or less what i paid for  however  the semi rimmed glasses broke under very minimal pressure so i don t even think they re worth the     i spent for the two  naturally  this occurred  wks from purchase  one week after return window ended   don t recommend      
218,3.0,                       one pair broke within a week  the other one is getting close to breaking   not great at all      edit  the seller contacted me after i left my original review and offered a full refund  three stars due to great customer service  they also asked for a picture to help them improve the product  hopefully the quality will improve soon      
219,5.0,                       they re those gas station glasses you can loose because they were like five bucks a pair but they look good  they re comfy and polarized  if you loose sunnies at the cyclic rate like i do these are your jam      
220,5.0,                       the price came down to about    for each pair i bought  compared to      pair of raybans i have  they look exactly alike  which is to say these are high quality  there are counterfeit raybans floating around amazon  and reviews pointing this out are systematically suppressed  don t waste your money on those counterfeit brands when you can get the same look here  and for much less money      
221,5.0,                       great for fashion and love the polarized lenses for golfing good value     
222,5.0,                       i think i spent like        on these and they look amazing  got the nice polarization  and feel nice and sturdy i guess i should honestly wait a few months to see if they truly feel durable before posting this  but on the other hand  to get a pair of sunglasses that look and feel this nice for         if they broke  i d just buy another pair lmao sometimes it makes more sense to buy a cheap pair of sunglasses for ten bucks and replace it if it gets lost or broken than to invest      on some ray bans or something that can also get lost or broken  probably just as easy  or maybe even easier considering people steal nice sunglasses all the time love these so far      
223,4.0,                       for the price that they are  they re pretty worth it  they re polarized and have the same sort of style as ray bands  but not nearly as expensive      
224,5.0,                       good looking glasses   well made and a fair price      
225,4.0,                       i was looking for a replacement pair after i broke my favorite pair of sunglasses that were similar in style to these  these are great and definitely worth the price  i don t like paying much for sunglasses because i lose or break them easily  the only thing i don t like about these is the nose piece gets caught in my hair when i place them on top of my head  my old glasses had that built in to the frame  i also wish the metal was silver rather than gold  but overall  these are a great buy      
226,5.0,                       honestly way better than expected    both styles super cute totally let s me customize depending on outfit choice that day love them both and the different visually was astronomical good buy would buy again and for the price of   b sic pair you get two genuinely well made sunglasses with case and cleaner dope buy     
227,5.0,                       i cannot hold on to a pair of sunglasses for the life of me  so i refuse to pay a lot of money for them   this delivered three for a great price the day after ordering   one to leave in the house  one for the office  and one for the car   so far i m happy      
228,5.0,                       love them  exactly what i was looking for and even arrived early     
229,5.0,                       light and fit well     
230,5.0,                       much better than expected  the women s pair    i don t like to pay alot for shades because i tend to lose them  these were inexpensive and figured they d be generic but i am quite impressed      
231,5.0,                       i got these for my husband that is constantly losing his sunglasses  i thought these were a great deal since its   and different colors in the same style my husband likes and if he lost them is fine since it was real cheap  well he really liked them so much that he thought i had spend so much money and was kinda up set  but once i showed him he couldn t believe how good they were  he also liked that each pair came with its own pouch and microfiber wipe as well      
232,5.0,                       bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves them  worth the money      
233,5.0,                       two pairs of amazing glasses  i took one and my husband took the other pair  they are great   definitely a happy buy      
234,5.0,                       good quality product      
235,5.0,                       these were exactly what i was looking for    pairs for a fraction of the designer branded ones   how can you beat that  great quality and a wide selection  these are my new every day sunglasses for the summer      
236,3.0,                       these are somehow larger than a similar version i ve previously gotten   too big for my face  nose  they feel cheaper too  they work alright for the time being though      
237,5.0,                       i love the sepia tone glasses  i bought   sets one for my car and one for my bfs      
238,5.0,                       these glasses are very well made and packaged  they are extremely comfortable and lightweight and look good on anyone  both pairs came with small pouches as well as cloth wipes  the company put a lot of effort into the details and i feel it was well worth the money and i would definitely recommend these or buy them for my friends and family      
239,5.0,                       christmas present for hubby  he is constantly losing sunglasses so i gave up on buying him expensive ones  he needs polarized though  so these are perfect  came quickly too      
240,4.0,                       the only problem is that the mechanism where it bends feels like there s some resistance and that s it i really love the orange hue that the blue ones have on them  makes colors outdoors pop  none of the parts have fallen off or broken and i ve been pretty rough on them i would buy this product again and again  especially since i can just throw them in my bag and not worry about them getting scratched      
241,5.0,                       these are some very nice looking glasses  the top part of the frame is matte so if contrasts nicely with the gold  they are also polarized so it s very comfortable on your eyes      
242,2.0,                       as soon as these sunglasses came in the mail  i fell in love   they re great for any occasion and are super lightweight  unfortunately  they did break but since the price is great i would consider buying again      
243,4.0,                       great glasses with style  but  appear to have only one size for me   too small  very  sad because i really like the style weight   and  grip  glasses should be for a women or children      
244,5.0,                       stylish polarized sunglasses  they re a bit smaller than i expected  but they are also a lot sturdier than expected  would recommend for anyone looking for a nice pair of relatively cheap  polarized sunglasses  also great that they come in pairs  but there is only one bag to hold your sunglasses  which can hold both pairs but not ideal if you re giving one of the sunglasses to someone else       
245,5.0,                       good quality  good price   these were for my    year old   they look good and the quality of the lenses appears to be good   you get two pair and two soft pouches for carry      
246,5.0,                       these are so comfortable and look like you paid a lot more  the polarized lenses keep everything in view so you can keep them on your face instead of taking them off when you re not sure like simply darkened lenses force you to do getting   pairs is huge because i m able to switch them out depending on what i m doing great value for the buck       
247,5.0,                       got in the mail today  haven t tried them outside yet but they look really nice  look pretty good quality for the price  not impressed with the packaging just ok  i buy non expensive sunglasses cuz i always lose them    i ll be ordering these again       
248,5.0,                       love that they actually do what they re supposed to  look great and come with good presentation  bought this and also very expensive designer s glasses and ended up returning the expensive ones because they looked cheaper  these look better and do a better job  would absolutely recommend     
249,2.0,                       i thought they would be better made      
250,5.0,                       great deal for two pairs  they came in one day  they were just as pictured described  they seem durable  but since they were cheap i wouldn t be disappointed if they weren t durable  they seem to be good uv blocking sunglasses      
251,5.0,                       great glasses   the polarized lenses are super clear   nicely made and look great on my big head      
252,5.0,                       these glasses are as nice as my ray bans  i am so impressed  cannot beat the price  wow  how do you afford to sell such nice glasses for so little  thank you seller     
253,5.0,                       i got several pairs of these   no distortion   they work well in all kinds of sunlight   i d purchase again      
254,5.0,                       i ve had my sunglasses for maybe four months and now my lenses are completely scratched  not sure how but now i can t see out the lense  id buy again but now i know what to expect  works great for sun protection      
255,5.0,                       i love these glasses  they are nicely packaged and each pair comes with its own fabric bag and cleaning cloth  they are nice quality and value  i am happy to have not just one pair  but three to choose from      
256,5.0,                       love these sunglasses     
257,1.0,                       these sunglasses feel really cheap and flimsy  i ve bought inexpensive sunglasses that feel better quality than these  they also could stand to be a little wider as well      
258,5.0,                       really like the glasses  lightweight and comfy  the sports looking ones are but large so i only use the round lens ones     
259,5.0,                       these are perfect  way better quality then i expected at the price point      
260,5.0,                       feel like  pair of      sunglasses  awesome shades      
261,4.0,                       light weight and fashionable     
262,5.0,                       i am very pleased with these  they are a great value for the price  these glasses are comfortable to wear and have a very pleasing appearance  they have been durable to my neglect such as carrying pock and sitting on them  flying off will riding motorcycle and cleaned up well after falling into some wet concrete  i will buy again when and if i wear these out or manage to break them      
263,5.0,                       light weight and worth the price      
264,5.0,                       purchased a   pack  they arrived  i was so impressed i immediately bought an additional   pack they re sturdy and polarized  they fit well and don t feel like they re going to snap every time i put them on i purchased these after losing several name brand sunglasses that cost   x  more  never again      
265,5.0,                       crystal clear      
266,5.0,                       you will not be disappointed  packaged like a high end pair of sunglasses      
267,5.0,                       the brown pair with brown lenses are now my favorite sunglasses i own  great value  well made  and that are universally flattering      
268,5.0,                       great for the price  good eye protection  seem like good quality      
269,4.0,                       like the size and color of these sunglasses  dims out the sun and gives a sharper picture of the environment  sounds weird but it makes everything look much clearer without the sun glares  if the sun is directly in front of you  it can still give you trouble without also using the sun visor      
270,5.0,                       very useful when the sun starts to irritate your eyes      
271,5.0,                       love these for my boyfriend  they look exactly like the pictures and are polarized     
272,3.0,                       love these sunglasses   the only dislike is the nose pads keep breaking off after a couple of months  third pair that have failed in less than a year  are replacements available      
273,5.0,                       i love these i got them for my boyfriend and they look perfect very modern and trendy and it comes with           
274,5.0,                       for the price  you cant beat them  they work as well as my lost original ray ban s  fit my large face well and look good  i highly recommend and would even recommend at a price point higher than this      
275,5.0,                       sexy lookin     
276,5.0,                       i bought these sunglasses for my husband because he notoriously loses everything  i wanted glasses that looked nice  but were easy to replace  these are stylish and have been confused as ray bans  they are very light weight  but haven t broken  they have polarized lenses which are very nice  we have bought two of the two packs so far and i anticipate we will buy more in the future     
277,5.0,                       i ve gone through a couple of pairs of ray bans in the past few years and wanted something that looked good without breaking the bank  these are comfortable to wear and my wife says they look good on me      
278,5.0,                       these are awesome for the price  a lot better than i expected  came with microfiber wipes and carrying bags      
279,5.0,                       best bang for the buck  i am one of those who don t believe in spending lots of money on sunglasses  i love them and wear them all the time      
280,5.0,                       good looks  good fit  good price      
281,5.0,                       great set as always this is my third set of them i always recommend them to friends      
282,1.0,                       the glasses were great the first few months but less than   months later  the tinting appears to be coming off  these have been inside when not in use  no scratches but looks terrible  i do not recommend  of course the return window was only    days      
283,5.0,                       great product for the price       
284,4.0,                       handsome sunglasses  comfortable  tight temples  good sun protection  i can feel the glare relief  but i have no scientific way to measure effectiveness of the uv block    comes with a micro cleaning cloth and storage pouch  so  for      great deal their only problem is they re not      optically clear  when i stared at an object  and moved my head around  passing all areas of the lens over the object  i noticed some  wavy  spots where the lens wasn t perfectly things it isn t really noticeable though when you re outside in the sun doing stuff  i m just a perfectionist photographer and notice these things  i m also very unlucky  two new beam wiper blades i bought for my car make the same exact smear on my windshield in the exact same spot in the center of my vision   so you may get a pair that s fine      
285,5.0,                       the best  comes with warranty for a year  don t ever stop making them     
286,5.0,                       they feel solid  they look good  the polarized really works well  i ll be buying another set soon      
287,5.0,                       these pair of sunglasses are a bargain  good quality and style  both come with a separe bag for protection      
288,5.0,                       i used them everyday  very lightweight and crystal clear     
289,5.0,                       these are a very high quality for only being around    dollars  i have very sensitive eyes and these worked great in the bright sun  will buy these again when i need them and i      recommend      
290,5.0,                       great look  great purchase for the price    awesome experience     
291,5.0,                       very good value for money      
292,5.0,                       the only negative i have is that they tend to reflect the sun behind you  that is more a function of the style than the glasses themselves  they are inexpensive and look good too  classic style      
293,5.0,                       very impressed with the quality and price of the sunglasses   each came in a separate eyewear bag with lens cleaning  cloth   may order a pair for my niece since she really liked the frame      
294,5.0,                       wonder glasses definitely recommend great buy  very light weight and the polarized are amazing worth it for the prices     
295,5.0,                       the fit and quality for the money make it an excellent value      
296,3.0,                       glasses are small  fit for a small face     
297,5.0,                       i m still kinda blown away with the quality  i ve had raybans before  and the quality  in the lenses  on these glasses are extremely close  great deal for the money  i even got   for the price of       
298,1.0,                       these sunglasses broke after just a few uses  then area right at the joint gave out  making them useless  i could not find a way to reach out to the sellers via amazon  very disappointing kalyadi team  if you can see this  what is the process to have a replacement sent      
299,5.0,                       these are super cute and dark  they aren t too big for my face  which is an issue in the past  love them       
300,5.0,                       great fit and value   don t fall off when on top my head when indoors      
301,5.0,                       i m not gonna lie  this is probably my best pair of glasses i have purchased from amazon and in stores elsewhere  i would highly recommend this  they are fully polarized and   for   you really can t go wrong for this price  if you like me and only buy cheap glasses because you lose them a lot  well these are the best cheap glasses ever  feel nice  smooth and tough because i have dropped them a few and still no cracks or scratches on them      
302,3.0,                       the lenses are amazing when it comes to sun protection   i always wear these when i drive  however  a big downside is the overall build quality of the frame  its really cheap and feels like it can easily break at any moment  they re not sturdy so i m constantly worrying about them and have to be extra careful with how i atore it too  wish it was stronger      
303,5.0,                       came in a very quality box both pairs with cleaning cloths and microfiber carrying cases     
304,2.0,                       edit             the film on the glasses has begun to peel and come off the lenses  the glasses have been hard to use since that happened  i really wanted these to be great but you get what you pay for  these are not good for long term these sunglasses have been great for driving and going to the beach  they are lightweight and polarized which makes them a dream when sitting on the beach  since they re such a good price i m not freaking out if i lose them while swimming      
305,5.0,                       excellent product     
306,3.0,                       sunglasses     
307,5.0,                       i really like these sunglasses  i love how lightweight they are  people think they are ray bans  they look that great     
308,5.0,                       great sunglasses  good quality for the price  have had them for a while now and they hold up really well and look great      
309,3.0,                       lenses are very large  looks giant

311,5.0,                       my father enjoy it     
312,5.0,                       well made for the price came with protective bag and cleaning cloth     
313,5.0,                       this is the best product i have purchased so far regarding sun protection   they have absolutely no glare at all  and as an   to    hour daily driver  they are amazing   great quality  and value for the price    thank you from a very picky sunglasses user       
314,5.0,                       these pair of sunglasses   are perfect for summer  i bought it as a present for my husband  but once i tried them on i told him to give me a pair  lol   you can wear them all they long and you won t get tired of them  they are perfect in all ways      
315,5.0,                       this is a great product  only thing i wish was for them to be mirrored but other than that very stylish      
316,5.0,                       these are beautiful  i have been looking for these same glasses locally for about a year with no luck  i can t wait to wear them in the beach          
317,5.0,                       great deals  each pair have there own storage bag and cleaning cloth      
318,5.0,                       very nice sunglasses  lightweight and come with microfiber cloth and case for each  worth the price     
319,5.0,                       best bang for the bucks     
320,3.0,                       these are okay  they are polarized  which is nice  but the build quality is not very good  i like the style  and i like the price  but the inside of the lenses is too reflective  or maybe the lenses are not curved enough  but i am constantly seeing reflections in the lenses while i m wearing these  it s really distracting  especially while i am driving  not going to recommend these  but the price was fair      
321,2.0,                       great glasses while they last  but don t expect to get more than a months use out of them  the stem on the glasses to go over my ear broke within a month of using them  would not recommend      
322,4.0,                       frames are decent and sturdy  nice style and a good level of sun protection  was only disappointed to find one of the lenses scratched upon arrival  overall  for the price paid  it was a decent deal      
323,5.0,                       worth every cent spent     
324,5.0,                       great sunglasses  came on time and well worth the money      
325,5.0,                       my husband absolutely loves his sunglasses       
326,4.0,                       these sunglasses are very light and fit nicely   they were what i expected      
327,5.0,                       love the glasses   great price and fast delivery  this is my second set  grandkids got the first ones  they really liked it      
328,5.0,                       nice look driving glasses      
329,4.0,                       i literally use these everyday  my only critique was that on one of the shades one of the nose guards broke of   a quick fix we just broke the other one off and it still fits pretty good  i don t expect very high quality with the price but it still works very well and looks stylish   even got a compliment from a friend of mine about how my shades look   little do they know how cheap it was   but thats my little secret        
330,5.0,                       wow for the price these are great glasses   fit my head and will buy them again     
331,5.0,                       my wife like them alot      
332,5.0,                       the finish on both pairs is a soft matte and they fit both of us extremely well  super stylish and affordable plus they come with a case and a cloth  the polarization is great for sunny beach days        for value      
333,5.0,                       it was worth it      
334,5.0,                       look i buy r bans left and right but i needed some i could use to throw around  not these i know its   for       but for       if i took the logo off my other frames you couldn t tell build difference  as for the polarized part  its definitely full polarized not the half a   film ones you see on cheaper shades      
335,5.0,                       i bought these for my boyfriend because he goes through sunglasses like crazy  but i wanted them to look nice  he loves them  gives him an option of choosing more than one style  they are durable for the price and feel like they ll last for a while   hopefully lol also came properly packaged and with all parts mentioned in the caption      
336,2.0,                        nd pair i bought both of which broke within   weeks of use  the padding that sits on your nose fell off both pairs so the little screw got lost  would be great glasses if they didn t break so soon from just light wear too only wore them in the car while driving      
337,5.0,                       love these glasses  high end looks and comfortable fit  does not look cheap  will definitely order from this company again     
338,5.0,                       bought these sunglasses with fairly low expectations but they ve worked very well for me so far  packaged well  built well  and affordable      
339,4.0,                       i lost a pair of sunglasses similar to these and when i saw the price point on these i thought to myself   buy these  why not   so i get these in and at  st impression i thought they were well made and after wearing them for a couple weeks now i will probably buy another set as backups  great price and so far apparently well made      
340,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                       son geniales comodos y ligeros te protejen la vista de los rayos fuertes del sol        
341,5.0,                       good product and quality     
342,5.0,                       i love them  good looking      
343,5.0,                       they aren t some fancy      pair from sunglasshut  but they look and wear well nonetheless  don t have to worry about breaking or losing them ether  since each pair is all of    ish  very light weight   polarized well  can t beat it for what it is      
344,5.0,                       awesome     
345,3.0,                       decent glasses for the price but don t expect anything nice  the bows that go around your ears are super flimsy and dirt cheap  other than that they re good     
346,4.0,                       i would buy again if the company offered the same men s pair    of the same kind of sunglasses  instead of the   that s a men s and   that s a women s       
347,3.0,                       sun glasses broke little use     
348,2.0,                       great and stylish sunglasses  came with two which i wasn t expecting  my semi rim sunglasses however broke only a few weeks in as the hinge holding the ear piece broke off after only a few uses under light stress conditions  hoping i can get a replacement and will adjust review accordingly      
349,5.0,                       higher quality than expected  great deal     
350,5.0,                       i only can say it s the best     
351,5.0,                       glasses are well made  lenses are clear  no distortion   quick delivery  highly recommend  will buy again      
352,5.0,                       arrived super fast   good quality for the price paid and fits well      
353,5.0,                       for the price it s a great deal  if they break it s ok because i didn t spend much money     
354,5.0,                       cool pair     
355,5.0,                       love these   leave them in the car   nice cleaning cloth   would buy again   great value and quality      
356,5.0,                       great product for a reasonable price      
357,5.0,                       great shades for the price  thanks     
358,5.0,                       the best sunglasses ever      
359,4.0,                       i am using them all day and they are great but i m  afraid they might scratch too easy      
360,5.0,                       i liked these better on my girlfriend than i liked them on my self but whatever for what i paid for them  i wasnt expecting a microfiber cloth  etc  good value      
361,5.0,                       very satisfied with these sunglasses  they are very light weight and the uv protection is strong  i purchased a two pack and had a small issue and the seller helped resolve it immediately  highly recommend for the price      
362,5.0,                       i had a pair like these when i was a teenager and got these for my son as a birthday gift  he loves them      
363,5.0,                       they look nice  don t cost a fortune  and are polarized see if you can test which way they polarization is in your phone screen because mine mismatched with the glasses and it blacked out my screen when i was wearing them unless i turned my phone sideways  not the glasses makers fault  almost every other phone i saw was fine  only mine had to be the odd duck      
364,5.0,                       great sun protection and worth what i paid for love that each pair of glasses came with its own case      
365,5.0,                       three pairs of polarized sunglasses for     i feel it s a great deal  they fit nicely on the face  not too loose or snug  not too big even for a females face  set comes with one cloth sunglass holder bag  a lens wipe  and a little card with a photo that can be seen only through the polarized lenses  nifty      
366,4.0,                       the sunglasses seems like they are built well and good value good assortment of color lens and design  the sunglasses are polarized and come with a card to verify the polarization pros stylish and similar design to ray bans good variety of lenses and designs colors good polarization cons no protective hard case only   fabric pouch was included  there should be a minimum of   fabric pouches  although these pouches will not really protect the sunglasses overall good value and quality but should have included more accessories      
367,4.0,                       glasses broke after   days of use update the support team reached out to me and replaced the glasses free of charge for their lifetime warranty  still have to wait until new ones get shipped out      
368,5.0,                       value pack for those of you who lose and break your glasses keep on in your car  bag and one on the desk and you ll always have a pair  look good  fit well adequate sun protection     
369,5.0,                       these are exactly what i was looking for  i had a pair previously that were durable and effective and these appear to be similar  also comfortable      
370,5.0,                       great sunglasses  had sun protection     
371,5.0,                    exelente ibersion porque sebe muy claro y lo polarisado ayuda aproteger los ojos del sol super polarisado        
372,5.0,                       first impression was  wow   the sunglasses feels like one of those branded sunglasses out there but cheap  the quality is amazing for the price  definitely would buy again      
373,1.0,                       don t buy  lens popped out on one and the nose piece broke on the other  horrible glasses  don t even use them hard  just putting them on my face broke them     
374,5.0,                       the shading effect of these sunglasses is very good  and it is very cool to wear sunglasses      
375,5.0,                       great price for what you pay for  these are well made compared to others for the price  they work well while fishing too      
376,5.0,                       love these glasses  super cute  comfortable  and definitely protective and stylish      
377,5.0,                       they look great  keep me from squinting in the sun  and great value   i love they came with cleaning clothes      
378,3.0,                       what you would expect for cheap sunglasses the polarized test is bologna  i tried the image with a pair of spy sunglasses and the dolphin was there so my guess a coating that s unique to their glasses  they are pretty flexible and will loosen over time  the vision is good but when compared to other brands they are ok not as clear just dark  the lenses scratch easily and are hard to wipe clean even with the case  you get what you pay for and they worked well for what i needed but by no means will these be your number one sunglasses in my opinion      
379,5.0,                       one of the best products i ve purchased  love that bags cleaning cloths are included for each pair      
380,5.0,                       simple and cute  i ve never had polarized so i ll see how different they are      
381,5.0,                       love the quality and all the little accessories that comes with it  love the price as well      
382,5.0,                    son hermosas y funcionan perfecto        
383,1.0,                       the sunglass coming missing a part it s waste of money     
384,5.0,                       i actually bought this   pack for my husband and i  we each love our sun glasses  they fit well and are great quality for the price      
385,5.0,                       sleek and stylish with definitely higher quality materials than you re used to for shades at this price  highly recommend      
386,5.0,                       very happy with fit  style    clarity of sunglasses  ordered second pair       
387,5.0,                       great pair for your money  they are lightweight and polarized so great to wear if you have an expensive pair you don t want to lose or damage  still great quality      
388,5.0,                       i m a fan of inexpensive sunglasses  i have an expensive designer pair but those lenses get dirty and streaky very easily  i much prefer ordering a few pairs at a time and if they break or the lenses get scratched  i don t feel bad about recycling them and starting over with a new pair  these don t look  cheap  and the lenses block the sunlight      
389,1.0,                       the glasses were very scratched when i received them today  all i had done was take them out of the package  keeping the sticker and tag were still on  and put them on  i quickly realized i could not see out of my right eye and figured it was due to scratches on the inside of the glasses  a huge disappointment and frustrating since i do not think they are wearable  i would definitely recommend getting a different pair of glasses      
390,5.0,                       love the styles   quality good and just what i was looking for      
391,5.0,                       finally found a pair of driving sunglasses that are truly polarized  seem well made and comfortable  just the job      
392,5.0,                       my son needed some sunglasses and these were the best      
393,5.0,                       i just bought these after a friend recommended one of my friends to get it and i was like why not buy it myself and truthfully they are worth every penny  i m already recommending most of my friends this so why not buy it for yourself     
394,5.0,                       these are great sunglasses  they also have great customer service  i had a little problem with one of the pairs and i contacted them  they gave me a refund for the flawed pair and i was able to purchase a new one  there was no crazy process  just straight to the point and very helpfull       
395,5.0,                       good sunglasses     
396,5.0,                       great sun glasses for the price      
397,5.0,                       looks more expensive than cost     
398,4.0,                       good glasses for the price      
399,5.0,                       i didn t know what polarized sunglasses are  the effect is simply amazing  it is unlikely that i am now able to wear normal sunglasses      
400,5.0,                       these definitely help while driving in the winter time   i would recommend these for any season   they also come with lenses cleaning cloth and a travel sack      
401,4.0,                       after holding on to my expensive sunglasses for a record number of days  i lost them  this has happened to me before  for my next pair  i decided that i d go with cheaper glasses  these glasses have lived up to the hype  i m very pleased and if or when i lose a pair  i ve got two extras  what s not to like      
402,4.0,                       i like the style of these glasses  the only complaint i have is the smell  they smell kinda like garbage  weird i know  i don t really understand but whatever       
403,5.0,                       this was one buy i was so thoroughly surprised with  i had a cheap set of sunglasses that looked like this that i really liked but lost  got these and good god i am so happy  they definitely have a high end feel for them  and even come with a cleaning cloth and a velvet storage bag  they feel very sturdy and durable  and wear very comfortably      
404,4.0,                       great and work as described     
405,2.0,                       the clubman style glasses have been the better of the two sets so far   not the best build quality  but at least they haven t broken yet   that s unlike the wayfarer style glasses which broke at the hinges on the very first day of use   the metal hinge snapped out of the plastic after only a few bends      
406,5.0,                       great sunglasses and for that price  even better  i got this sunglasses for my husband because we are going on a trip next month  i didn t think they were going to be as nice as they are  i even might end up using them too      
407,5.0,                       i was really happy with these  i wanted a knockoff version of the clubmaster ray bans because those are more that     and that s just too much to pay for sunglasses in my opinion   i took the two metal framed ones and gave the plastic one to my friend  we both use them pretty frequently  no complaints and they are polarized      
408,5.0,                       great value   visually looks well made  light weight  and feels sturdy     
409,4.0,                       for the price it s a good purchase  i wish the hinges would work easier  kinda stiff the hinges when open and close the arms  lens does not have any curve to it  very straight but can see clearly  need to get use to the feel of it  can t beat the price for clarity though      
410,5.0,                       i absolutely love these  they are so fashionable and durable  i had a pair of these and unfortunately lost them so when summer came around again i purchased them again because i loved them so much      
411,5.0,                       stylish  and functional     
412,5.0,                       these shades are worth buying  no regrets at all     
413,5.0,                       comfortable  effective and seems well constructed      
414,5.0,                       love these sunglasses  the women s frames broke a few weeks after wearing them  and customer service was very helpful and quick to get me a refund  i bought a new pair of the same frames and they fit great      
415,5.0,                       my eyes are very sensitive to sunlight  and here in the southwest good light protection is needed  these work very well  and hold up well to regular use  the price for such handsome and excellent glasses is excellent      
416,5.0,                       i and my husband are both bad about laying down sun glasses   so we try to make a work for us compromise and keep our sanity and budget too   we keep a pair in the car   and a pair in the night stand   we both need large frames and on the budget racks  choices are few and most of the time its styles for young folks   thank you amazon buyers for thinking of us      
417,5.0,                       not only do they feel good on my face but the material of the sunglasses is very smooth  better then what i was expecting honestly      
418,3.0,                       they are ok sunglasses  pretty cheap quality      
419,2.0,                       very flimsy  very cheap  reminds of those play glasses ya get as a kids  zero peripheral vision protection      
420,5.0,                       best cheap sunglasses around look great wear one out you have extras        
421,5.0,                       great variety of styles super uv protection      
422,5.0,                       a good value     
423,5.0,                       there are excellent  this is the secound pair i purchased   i had my previous for a year no and i wanted to keep another set at my other car  i recommend it      
424,5.0,                       i use these sunglasses to drive  i ordered three pairs and use the black with gold frame accents  i gave my dad the tortoise shell and he loves it for driving  he retired a    year old pair of aviators for these   i then gave the all blacks to my son who throws them around and they have still been without a scratch all in all  this product is no ray ban s by any means  but you get what you pay for  the visual quality on these are great  and definitely recommended by me      
425,5.0,                       light weight  fashionable  inexpensive      
426,5.0,                       these have been my go to glasses  pretty high quality for the price  and it doesn t hurt when they re claimed by the lake or left somewhere  the lenses can scratch a bit easier than premium brands  but they re great otherwise  i ve bought a ton of pairs over the past several years      
427,5.0,                       high quality products at a more than reasonable price  i was surprised by the quality of the product  the packaging and the warranty      
428,5.0,                       perfect for any type of out door activity  also great when driving      
429,4.0,                       nice     
430,4.0,                       a little tight on my face but cute and a good price     
431,5.0,                       i purchased these sunglasses not expecting much but once i received them i immediately realized that i made the right decision  the packaging was clean and neat  but beyond that the sunglasses were truly polarized and it works so well  you could easily mistake these for a big brand name pair of sunglasses because of the quality  i would absolutely recommend these to anyone      
432,2.0,                       feels like a cheap costume toy     
433,5.0,                       love how they fit  nice and snug  plus they are really dark so it a lot of sun comes threw  better then my ray bans     
434,5.0,                       what we needed     
435,5.0,                       love    i had worn a pair to a family gathering   a cousin had a pair that were ray ban brand that looked identical to these  we actually had a hard time deciphering which was which without looking at hers that said ray ban  these are one twentieth the cost of designer brands of course so it s a no brainier  these are lightweight  adjustable    will look good on literally anyone  this is my second time buying the   pack because i just can t speak to how awesome they are  these are great gift ideas too  buy them all      
436,5.0,                       i m actually surprised  definitely worth it and beyond      
437,5.0,                       these sunglasses fit my need for driving under different sun light conditions during the day light weight  with adjustable nose pads are a plus value with options to choose a different lens   frame colors you can t go wrong on this one      
438,5.0,                       was sorry they didn t come in before vacation but they were here when i got back   so far built tough like other clear glasses i got so i m extremely happy        
439,3.0,                       didn t like it  poor quality  but they re cheap     
440,5.0,                       great value      
441,4.0,                       nice sunglasses for a good price     
442,1.0,                       dark and cheap     
443,5.0,                       i love these   the look and how they actually protect your eyes  definitely worth your money    a little secret is    get these instead of     dollar ray bans     best    dollar investment     
444,4.0,                       i lose sunglasses a lot   so decided on these and they seem to work well      
445,5.0,                       light weight and stylish  would definitely buy again  great price too      
446,5.0,                       bought them as a gift  he s loves the variety      
447,5.0,                       the glasses themselves work perfectly in the sun when driving  which is why i purchased them  but the silver trim on one of them is thin which slips when in different positions and feels either too tight and close to your eyes or loose at the bridge of the nose  i just prefer not to wear them but they work just as well  but my nose may not be the right fit  they came with a nice case but only one      
448,5.0,                       these are the  rd pair i ve bought  i lost the first two and like them that much      
449,5.0,                       these are great   why is anyone buying expensive versions for   x the price tag here   highly recommend      
450,5.0,                       i love these shades   i wear them every day   look very elegant  i have had them for about   months and still awesome  i my purse is always a hot mess so i m surprised they haven t gotten a scratch     
451,3.0,                       a little stylish  well polarized  works good enough  not great  just good      
452,1.0,                       cheap very cheaply made products i mean for     what do you expect right      one of them broke already and lets see how long the other one last but have to say i liked the blue one     
453,5.0,                       such a fantastic deal  two for the price of one  very lightweight  great visibility  just an awesome deal  i couldn t recommend more      
454,5.0,                       i was in need of a new pair of shades  these both are great  i use the solid black ones for exercising outside  cycling  running and the other pair for when i attempt to have a fashion sense  i have none   fit well  dont move when walking around  some cheaper shades hurt when wearing them or leave marks on my face  these dont      
455,5.0,                       would recommend for the price any day  the quality is light but not super cheap material like when you go to cancun and someone tries to sell you stuff on the beach  would      recommend  i ve lost       sunglasses in the ocean when i was one vacation and i vowed to never take good ones on vacation and these are great alternatives        would recommend     
456,5.0,                       needed a new pair of shades to protect my eyes from the sun while driving  but wanted to keep the cost low  i came across these on amazon  these are very nice shades for the price  i purchased the two pack and i love them  they are better quality than you would get in the stores  not cheap plastic  no they are not high end  duh   but they appear to be well made  they include a polarized tester allowing you to see the stark difference between no polarization versus polarization  glad i came across these  also  you get two microfiber cloths and two microfibers pouches to hold the glasses  if you buy the two pack   i like the pouches much better because they don t take up as much space as the cases  lastly  they have a free replacement within one year if you have quality issues and a lifetime breakage warranty  how awesome is that  you get a free repair or replacement on damaged parts  i almost put that card in the trash  glad i took the time to read it  if you are in need of a new pair of shades and don t want to break the bank   give these a try      
457,5.0,                       purchased as a gift for husband and he loves them      
458,5.0,                       very light weight   at  st they feel a little cheap but once you put them on   i changed my mind   don t even know they are there   great value   perfect gift     
459,5.0,                       worth the money     
460,5.0,                    muy buen producto        
461,2.0,                       well  my wife stole the little ones and i love the bigger ones  nice and light  great polarized view love them update   p s  the layers pilling apart  what the hack   didn t last too long     
462,4.0,                       these glasses are really nice  i use them all the time  the polarized effect makes phones and tinted windows have a weird effect  other than that the glasses are great and definitely help with the sun protection of my eyes      
463,5.0,                       these were amazing   i love them and they are super cute  the polarized lenses also are so beautiful and bring out colors so well   a must buy  i will always get these ones from now on      
464,5.0,                       loved the style the comfort and the price      
465,5.0,                       i bought this for my daughter  she loves them     
466,5.0,                       i bought these for my son and he absolutely loved them     
467,5.0,                       i love love these sunglasses   it s a must buy  then it comes with two pair can t beat that       
468,4.0,                       i ordered two pairs of sunglasses for    dollars  these sunglasses fit wonderfully  they are polarized  they look just like the pictures  with this being said    you re paying about    dollars for a pair of extremely light sunglasses  theyre so light  very thin  and they feel as if they ll snap between your fingers  but what do you expect for the price  overall  i love these sunglasses  cheap yet stylish and look high quality  however don t expect these to last forever  these sunglasses are everything they claim to be  just keep in mind the price you re paying for it        
469,5.0,                       only had these for a couple of days but they re so nice  i like the ones without the large black frame because they don t squeeze my head as much  but that s a personal issue  i think they re great quality for a great price      
470,4.0,                       overall  this is a good deal for   pairs of sunglasses  they aren t super dark but they still do a fair job of protecting your eyes from the sun  there were small scratches on the lens on   of the pairs  although i don t really notice when looking through the lens  the left arm on   of the pairs was also quite tight and required adjusting with an eyeglass screwdriver      
471,5.0,                       these sun glasses are just like the ray ban without the branding  they re beautiful and economic  the sun is hardly an issue now when driving out west during the evening      
472,4.0,                       good value  like the dark color  like that pull string bags for carrying are included      
473,5.0,                       stylish  clear and comfortable     
474,5.0,                       these sunglasses rocked  my hussy and i looked great in them and they were well used during our staycation  they provided maximum protection at every stage and there were tried and tested catamaran cruise  glass bottom boat rides and many offsite excursions  they looked even better on an au naturale island      
475,5.0,                       i wouldn t recommend these to men because they do run small but for a woman they are very stylish      
476,5.0,                       so perfect     
477,5.0,                       love these came with two sunglasses and both came with a cloth       
478,5.0,                       great product but be aware of size     
479,4.0,                       each comes with a storage bag and lens wipe  lightweight and good sun protection      
480,5.0,                       absolutely incredible  i usually have a hard time finding sunglasses that match the shape of my face but these did wonders   great quality and comfort is amazing  i totally recommend      
481,5.0,                       for the price they re really cool glasses i bought them for a gift for someone who drives and he was very thankful and he still uses them to this day     
482,3.0,                       these sunglasses seem to be of good quality and the packaging was great  unfortunately coming in   styles made them   very different sizes  this made only one of the pairs suitable for my purposes  i thought to give the other pair to my husband  but prescription lenses interfered  so i have to send them back      
483,5.0,                       great price for the quality and my high school son      
484,5.0,                       polarized  uv blocking  feel quality  great purchase      
485,5.0,                       i can never buy expensive glasses because i break them often  i ve bought this set twice now  first pairs broke not due to poor craftsmanship  kids      but they feel great and get the job done      
486,2.0,                       view thru plastic lens not good quality      
487,4.0,                       these come as a pair  the design of each slightly different  i like them      
488,5.0,                       this product absolutely exceeded my expectations    i honestly thought getting   sunglasses for such a cheap price that the quality of this product would be cheap  the quality is high end  i really feel like i m getting away with something by getting   pairs of sunglasses    lol absolutely without a doubt will be recommending this product to all my friends   family       
489,5.0,                       i didn t expect much at this pricing and was pleasantly surprised  both parties arrived in separate wrapping within the same box and   microfiber wipes  the glasses are very light weight and comfortable  i have a habit of flipping my glasses from my face to my head and they stay comfortably in both positions  the polarization is good enough quality for what i wanted and these will be perfect for the pool or beach      
490,5.0,                       good     
491,5.0,                       i just got contacts so now i can stunt with some shades on  i bought these shades for the ones pictured in the front  when i received it i didn t realize that two came with it  i was excited  but i wear these all of the time  they really protect well in sunlight      
492,5.0,                       i got these as a christmas gift for my dad  he s a stylish older guy that has a tendency to lose his sunglasses  these were very stylish and affordable   perfect for him  he loved them      
493,5.0,                       great product  great service      
494,4.0,                       good fit   im not      about the style   but over all decent      
495,4.0,                       if you got a bigger body then most  im         pounds don t buy these  maybe my head is big but these show off your entire eye brow looks wierd  but if not then these look pretty nice ended up giving these to my gf      
496,5.0,                       love these sunglasses   stylish  cheap  and polarized   get a ton of compliments on them      
497,4.0,                       these glasses do what they are supposed to  they work a soft bag and cloth for each pair was a nice touch update  not even two months in  the first pair has broken  i have not abused them in any way  shape or fashion  the plastic part across the top of the left hand lens broke right above the screw  fortunately i ve got two spares  i m going to try a drop of superglue  but this does not bode well         
498,5.0,                       blocks out everything  my haters  uv rays  light  hope  love      would buy again     
499,5.0,                       really great quality for the affordable price  even comes with multiple microfiber cleaning rags     
500,5.0,                       these look way more expensive then they are and very sturdy     
501,5.0,                       great     
502,1.0,                       don t waste your money  they re super cheap and flimsy  i ve had better for the same price  like the lens is trash  the frame is trash  it moves sometimes like if someone push you by accident  the lens would pop out on purpose  trash      
503,5.0,                       great style for summer  price was perfect      
504,5.0,                       he wears them all the time     
505,5.0,                       i really love these glasses  i was a afraid these would be too big for my face  as i have a smaller one  but they look great  there is such a difference in the way things look through these  everything is more vivid  grass is greener  and i can see better when driving with these on  i may have started a trend as many of my friends and family want a pair  definately worth what little bit of money you spend on these  i definately recommend      
506,5.0,                       really nice pair of shades for the price      
507,5.0,                       just what i needed     
508,5.0,                       the look like a designer brand as opposed to cheap     
509,5.0,                       awesome look and feel     
510,5.0,                       better quality than i expected for the price  they feel like similar glasses i ve had in the past that cost nearly           
511,1.0,                       received my glasses with numerous scratches  looks used  honestly  my assumption is that i received a returned item      
512,5.0,                       good and hardy sunglasses  just don t put them in your pocket  obviously  because it scratches the uv coating on the lens off  i frequently lose my sunglasses so having an option where i can buy cheap sunglasses that look cool and are relatively tough is nice  i purchase these in multiple colors      
513,5.0,                       i stopped buying expensive sunglasses a while ago because it just wasn t worth it  companies like this one have gotten so good at making good sunglasses that don t cost a month s worth of groceries  the polarized lenses are just as good as any glasses i ve ever owned  and they feel great to wear  i ve never had better sunglasses for the price      
514,5.0,                       the matte black is so sleek and they are so crystal clear  it definitely makes driving easier  i m very pleased with the value for money     
515,5.0,                       comfortable  appear well made and stylish     
516,2.0,                       received the tortoise design instead of the glossy black one i ordered  however it does the job and looks decent  but it still sucks i received the wrong one      
517,5.0,                       for the price these really exceeded my expectations   they re much sturdier than i expected     
518,4.0,                       using these sunglasses for summer  they are great and comfy  i definitely recommend them      
519,5.0,                       glasses look great and seem to be of great quality   my fianc  assumed they were expensive sunglasses   great value for the money  i will purchase again      
520,5.0,                       great sunglasses at a good price

523,5.0,                       great price and good looking sunglasses   however  the lenses are very thin  cheap plastic      
524,5.0,                       bought these to leave in the car for driving in bright  glaring conditions   they are light weight  fit well  and give comfort to my eyes      
525,5.0,                       i have only had these for a week or two but i was very pleased when i received them  they feel quality  not just for     dollar sunglasses they feel quality period  not to mention they look real good  you get two pairs  two carrying pouches  two cleaning cloths  really makes these things feel premium  i d absolutely buy these again  if your hesitating and looking for a sign  this is it  get them      
526,5.0,                       fit great  great price  i bought   pairs and love them  i did have one pair that the nose piece fell off but was easily repaired      
527,5.0,                    me encanto en verdad  es un excelente producto  son mis lentes favoritos hasta ahora

530,1.0,                       poor quality  haven t even had them a month and the glasses broke  luckily i can glue it back together for now      
531,5.0,                       sunglassess look expensive despite the price   stylish and durable      
532,5.0,                       i bought these polarized sun glass   pack on a whim and i am very happy with them    of the pairs fit my face very well  while the third pair are perfect for my wife  they are not the most expensive pairs you can buy  but for our purposes these more than exceed our expectations for the price we paid      
533,4.0,                       great clone of the clubmaster  however they are made of cheap light weight plastic      
534,3.0,                       they are stylish and comfortable but a bit flimsy so they might not hold up   not sure they are actually polarized      
535,5.0,                       best sunglasses for the money  comfortable and we ll made   not cheap at all      
536,5.0,                       love these  cheap and very well made  good to be everyday sunglasses  they re polarized too which is awesome      
537,5.0,                       i fall in love with my new sunglasses  i feel like show off   but save a money than ray ban like      to up       
538,5.0,                       just got these sunglasses in today  i ordered them based on their price so i wouldn t lose my expensive sunglasses when i go to the beach  honestly  i may be more worried about losing these now  these sunglasses are such great quality  very sturdy and packaged very well  i never write reviews  but i had to with these  i never expected such high quality when i purchased these  i strongly recommend     
539,5.0,                       i was hesitant  but i took the leap and got the two pack wow these glasses are perfect in their simplicity  i m thinking of purchasing   more just to have  great product      
540,5.0,                       looks and fits great  have forgotten i m wearing them most of the time  great protection for your eyes

544,5.0,                       great quality for such a low price  i got these as for my stepmom because she always loses her sunglasses  so i didn t want to spend a lot on a pair she d lose or break  however i ended up keeping a pair for myself because they re very cute but also great quality      
545,3.0,                       the lenses are very flimsy   they work but i suppose i should understand at the price paid  i shouldn t expect a really good pair of glasses      
546,5.0,                       very cute and not too big     
547,5.0,                       they are definitely on the cheaper side and reflects the price  they look great and does the job

553,5.0,                       fits perfectly snug and is lightweight  the texture is soft for a plastic frame      
554,5.0,                       my son really loved these shades  they are truly polarized  all three pair come with its own bag and cloth  well worth the money  will be purchasing more in the future for my other son      
555,5.0,                       cool shades  fast shipping      
556,5.0,                       these are well made  very light weight  and have clean clear vision throughout the entire field of view   i couldn t be more pleased   they re more comfortable than my ray ban club masters      
557,4.0,                       the lenses are great for the price  they re almost too light and fall off my face  but otherwise they re great for travel so if you lose them it s much   lost

561,5.0,                       for the price  these sunglasses work great  super stylish and light weight      
562,3.0,                       here s the lo down   i didn t know what to expect with these glasses   they have lasted   months with semi regular use   but alas  they now are broken   here s my take pros rediculously comfortable  seriously sometimes forgot they were on my face price point  pretty cheap for what you are getting   they do feel a little cheap upon first handling but they sort of  break in  if you will cons film  as you can see in image  the film is peeling and bubbling   this started about   months ago   maybe i needed to clean more often and store in their fabric case more often cheap construction   this almost is a double edged sword   they are light and they goes a long way for weight on your nose bridge   but  their construction is plastic y   i went to remove the glasses from my head yesterday and the arm just broke at the hinging mechanism overall purchasing these sunglasses isn t a bad move but there s two considerations   you will need to take special care of cleanliness and storage most likely   second  these are cheap but effective     but for how long   participating in a purchase pattern of this sort of product obsolescence feels more like a subscription framework if you want something to wear ever so often  go for it   if you want something that has an ounce of staying power  spend more and get better quality nice while they lasted  rip      
563,5.0,                       came nicely packaged  quality seems ok   see how they fare on an upcoming florida to michigan roadtrip

581,4.0,                       i liked the fabric cases  the cleaning fabric and the price  good value      
582,5.0,                       i ve ordered several pairs from kaliyadi over the past couple years and all have been great  they re very high quality and none have broken  and most importantly they look great  i ve had multiple people compliment them and ask where i got them  shipping is quick  and the customer service is the best i ve dealt with on amazon  you seriously can t go wrong ordering these      
583,5.0,                       nice pice for two pairs of glasses      
584,3.0,                       they are fine  but one screw that attached one of the temples fell off after about   months use  so i either have to get a new pair of glasses or buy a repair kit      
585,5.0,                       i got these for my boyfriend  he s very sensitive to light so he likes his sunglasses super dark  he said he can wear these without having to squint  they re   x darker than any sunglasses he s ever owned  he never writes reviews but asked me to for him  get these sunglasses      
586,5.0,                    excelente estilo  muy bonita        
587,4.0,                       i like them  i did get one with the lense popped out but i jus simply popped it back in  they do feel sturdy and look stylish  but i don t feel that they are durable so handle with care  oh and they work     
588,5.0,                       for this price  you d be dumb not to purchase this  got the all black frame and the ones with the silver rim  super cute  fits perfect  and doesn t look cheap

590,5.0,                       i love these glasses  i get tons of compliments and they protect well against the sun and very fashionable  why spend  x or  x the price when you can get these and save a ton of money and still look great      
591,4.0,                       i keep a pair in my home and one in my car  these are great and stylish      
592,5.0,                       sharp looking sunglasses that look as good as expensive brand names   value is outstanding      
593,5.0,                       i went on a search looking for uv protection glasses and i came across these  looked into it since it s summer time and i can t handle the bright sun or it will give me bad migraines  i m glad i choose these because they are perfect       
594,5.0,                       definitely worth the price      
595,3.0,                       i needed something more to keep out glare   but the value was great for   eyeglasses for          
596,3.0,                       i have been wearing the matte black sunglasses for three days now and noticed that the matte finish has rubbed off around the ears where the frame was in contact with sunscreen   i love everything about the glasses otherwise  but i thought this was pretty disappointing   sunglasses are a likely accessory at times when one might be wearing sunscreen   just my two cents      
597,5.0,                       i didn t know what to get my husband for christmas and he s always asking me for my sunglasses  i didn t want to get him pricier glasses since we don t know his style for these yet  but he loved them  they re great quality for the price and super cute      
598,5.0,                       i love these sunglasses  these sunglasses look exactly like high end ones without breaking the bank  they are sleek  professional looking  comfortable with no painful or awkward feeling anywhere  and legitimately polarized  you can definitely tell the difference when wearing them outside in the sun  it feels like you can see everything more clearly  these sunglasses come with a soft storage bag  lens cloth  and polarized testing strip  shipping was fast and customer service reached out offering help which is always nice when companies put in the effort to follow up  overall        would recommend         
599,5.0,                       exactly what i expected with the purchase  worth the amount paid  i d buy them again came with a little bag for the glasses as well      
600,5.0,                       these are an amazing deal  great quality  comes with soft cases and cleaning clothes  lenses are real polarized lenses  i wear one pair for runs and they are perfect      
601,1.0,                       they broke the first time i were them  all i did was take them off and they broke because it stuck on my ear slightly      
602,5.0,                       i bought these for my fianc    i   i was so surprised at the quality  they look   feel so nice      
603,5.0,                       love the design and how great they work  definitely worth the money      
604,4.0,                       not quite what i was looking for  i expected the frames to be just a little bigger  they didn t fit my face like similar pairs that i own  on the plus side my daughters like them so at least they won t go to waste      
605,5.0,                       buy these sunglasses     i needed some cheap polarized sunglasses that i wasn t afraid to lose  i was shocked with the quality and for the price they can t be beat  you won t regret it      
606,5.0,                       wonderful quality  great protection and quite stylish   plus they come with their own protective satchel and polishing cloth   definitely a deal      
607,5.0,                       they fir great  and block the sun very well  love them      
608,2.0,                       i bought the two pack with one black and one brown one while i use the black glasses more frequently they work great and are super robust however the brown pair just broke one day after the    day return policy expired  i used them occasionally the last    days and this came very unexpected      
609,5.0,                       it s pretty simple they protect your eyes from the sun lol  in all seriousness though they are great glasses  i know people like buying brand name glasses expensive cause everyone wears them and well it s style  but these glasses do what they need to even if they aren t that brand name  i do recommend them      
610,5.0,                       i absolutely love these sunglasses  i highly recommend      
611,5.0,                       they fit amazingly and they work excellently while driving and doing other outdoor activities  rather durable and flexible for the cost

613,5.0,                       the full frame style has been difficult to find for me  very inexpensive also     
614,3.0,                       one of the glasses had a broken nosepiece and is unusable  i already tossed the shipping package before noticing this      
615,5.0,                       these sunglasses are fantastic it s like buying raybans or oakleys for a fraction of the cost complete with a logo lens cleaner and logo case wow      
616,5.0,                       these are so cute  they work so well and are able to actually protect my eyes      
617,4.0,                       i like these sunglasses  the packaging was quite nice as well  only minor complaint is that one of the temples  part that goes on the sides of ur head toward your ears  was quite loose one one and not on the other  should be a simple screw tighten fix hopefully      
618,5.0,                       light weight  cute  and you get   for that price  great product  idk how sturdy they are as i ve only had them for a couple of months  but seem sturdy enough      
619,5.0,                       love super comfortable and stylish     
620,3.0,                       not that great quality  a bit bigger and rounder than i thought      
621,5.0,                       good material good for the price     
622,5.0,                       my boyfriend loves these  the metal ones pinch his nose  i dont know what that means  they come with a sack for hold the sunglasses   the cloth to clean them  each      
623,1.0,                          received only one pair of a   pack   item was nothing like the product image   not even close      
624,5.0,                       y all about a killer deal  you get two pairs of sunglasses that are badass  they both came in their own box  along with a soft bag and cleaning cloth  they are exactly like the photo and do exactly what the description says  i m obsessed  and they look awesome    highly recommend      
625,4.0,                       these glasses are as expected   they are great for driving in sunshine and comfortable to wear   wish they had more of a curve to the lenses to prevent sunshine from coming in sideways   happy to have   pairs for the price      
626,4.0,                       decent for what paid  dont last long     
627,5.0,                       this is why i love amazon  i have another pair of great glasses and wanted something that was also a good value  this is it  fast delivery  pleasantly surprised about the style and finish of these sunglasses  even compared to my tom ford  the glasses cases are also better than expected  as always a  delivery and customer communication  happy to have these      
628,5.0,                       too small for an average sized or larger adult  i have them to my   year old daughter who is     and   lbs if that gives you a better idea      
629,5.0,                       stylish sunglass  that you ll never be afraid to lose or break  might not be top quality  but for intents and purposes  gets you about     there  compared to the       name brands  and honestly no one can really tell     
630,4.0,                       love these sunglasses  for the price they are stylish   do the jobmy only complaint is when driving with the glasses on i can t read the words on the dash  so i have to take them off to read the radio  gas gauge  etc        
631,5.0,                       super cute and lightweight  great quality too

633,5.0,                       i really liked these glasses  even though they felt a bit tight at first  it s easy to forget you are wearing them  they look great  so great that someone was inclined to steal them from me the first day i wore them     
634,4.0,                       i love the frames and the lenses  actually  i cannot believe they are so inexpensive because they are much better than i ws expecting  because of the low price  i got three pairs  now i have spares      
635,5.0,                       great pair of sunglasses   nice to get   pairs to keep a spare      
636,5.0,                       love my sun glasses   in the picture they look very nice   but when i open the box    they look even better     
637,1.0,                       awful quality  arrived scratched and didn t come with sturdy bag      
638,5.0,                       i like that my eyes are protected from the sun and they are stylish

656,4.0,                       for the price  these sunglasses are awesome  not the best quality as i imagine they can break easily  but then they can be replaced for not much spent   this is a bit wasteful in my opinion   i m deducting one star because my eyes are visible through the lenses  i wish the lenses were less transparent  nevertheless  the rest of the product is great  i love the shape of the glasses  they combine angular with circular lenses in a fashionable way  i think they look very nice and go with any outfit  i also highly appreciate the thoughtful packaging  i was very impressed with the box the sunglasses came in as well as the protective coverings and cleaning cloths  overall  i definitely recommend these if you re looking for budget sunglasses of this trend

660,5.0,                       i kept looking at on the rayban website to see if their club masters would go on sale  i was browsing mindlessly on here and found these sunglasses  read the reviews and thought to myself the price can t be beat  worse comes to worse i m out      well i m actually blown away by the quality and the sun protection for the price point  i am impressed and will be buying more in the future  the best thing is  there are two pairs so in case i lose or break one  i have another one      
661,5.0,                       great product  unbeatable price

669,4.0,                       it s   pairs for like     so i gave it a shot  i personally found the hinges to all be too tight upon delivery so i loosened them to how i liked them the metal bridge looks cheap close up on them all  but i think everyday people passing by you wouldn t notice and it s fair for the money spent you can see your eyes especially on the gold and tortoiseshell green pair  just a note for people who like to their eyes hidden     
670,5.0,                       very impressed with the quality of the glasses  nicely packaged and includes   cleaning  clothes and storage bags   highly satisfied       
671,5.0,                       great value   nice glasses    i purchased these for friend who always loses or breaks his gossip has and he really likes them      
672,5.0,                       was surprised by good quality     
673,5.0,                       never leave reviews they deserve it  cheap and they hook you up     
674,5.0,                       i bought these because i lost my ray ban sunglasses and i refuse to pay that much for another pair  they re expensive  so i decided to just get something cheap that shaded my eyes from the sun  i have a big face so the glasses had to be wide enough to accommodate that  as well  i checked and found these  they re comfortable  cheap  look great and i got two pair for one price  i love them  and i know i won t be upset with myself for losing them      
675,5.0,                       i m blown away by the quality and look of these shades  i ve spent hundreds of dollars on other brands that end up getting lost  i can t believe how adorable and well made these are  will definitely buy more in the future      
676,5.0,                       these shades are perfect for the price  i purchased the orange lens wayfarer and the black on black semi rimless  they are made with sturdy materials and come with a nice microfiber bag and microfiber cleaning cloth  the wayfarers rims and arms have a soft rubber material over them which helps them from falling off your face      
677,2.0,                       after two weeks of on and off wear the brown pair broke at the hinge point  very disappointing after barely being used      
678,5.0,                       great value and stylish shades for my grandson  one of my better gift choices      
679,5.0,                       the glasses are well made and look just like the photos on the here  the biggest draw for me was the customer service  the sellers sent me an email offering service before the glasses arrived  highly recommend these glasses for a cheap option  but it didn t feel like i was buying cheap sunglasses      
680,5.0,                       husband loves them     
681,5.0,                       i had previously bought these glasses but lost them  here i am buying them again because they are not cheaply made and work so well against the sunlight   your money is well spent here and you won t regret it      
682,2.0,                       buy cheap get cheap   wont buy again  these are throw away glasses at best     
683,5.0,                       excellent sunglasses   must buy       
684,5.0,                       love these glasses  they look and feel like i paid    times the money     
685,5.0,                       if you are like i am and are very reckless with your sunglasses then it makes sense to buy these fancy dancy glasses for three pairs of pretty cool looking pairs of glasses for around      that way you can change them out every four months after you scratch the lens so bad you can t see just throw them away and grab a new pair it sure beats thrashing a      pair of ray bans     
686,5.0,                       great polarized glasses for the price plastic lenses  but look like glass my second order      
687,5.0,                       great for driving and they aren t so big      
688,4.0,                       the polarization is great  very crisp and clear  not too dark for everyday wear  only   stars because the materials feel like they won t be durable if i damage them  but at     for the pair they re really quite impressive      
689,5.0,                       i love that i received   different looks in sunglasses   i love that they are dark lenses since my eyes are very sensitive to the sun   great buy      
690,2.0,                       way too big for my face  the bridge measurement is too far spaced  i did not find them flattering at all and nothing like ray bans  club masters      
691,5.0,                       great value on the   for    deal  these are perfect for the summer      
692,5.0,                       these glasses are great  i ve never been a fan of super expensive sunglasses bc i tend to lose or break them often  i d rather not have to be super careful with expensive glasses  a three pack of these bad boys is perfect  comes with nice microfiber bags and cloths  they are also polarized for an added bonus  if they break over time  i just buy another pack  love this product     
693,5.0,                       great sunglasses for the cost      
694,5.0,                       ilovemyglassestheylookveryexpensive     
695,5.0,                       i purchased both pairs of sunglasses for my son  he loves them      
696,5.0,                       i really can t believe how great these are  the nose band was mildly uncomfortable at the beginning but that went away quickly and these are so comfortable and attractive  lightweight  decent polarization  and really cute on men or women  makes me feel more together when i don t have makeup on  gave a pair to my ex boyfriend and he wears them every single day without fail  major success      
697,5.0,                       i love these  i m always ruining my expensive sunglasses so decided to buy a cheap pair to see  i m loving these  so trendy and good quality      
698,5.0,                       i wished the lenses were darker and offered a non slip sweat resistant on the nose bridge      
699,5.0,                       nice solid glasses     
700,5.0,                       i bought this set to share with my boyfriend  he took the   top ones and i got the  rd pair  this are great quality and great value for the price      
701,5.0,                       i m happy with the sunglasses  they have a great  smooth finish  the glass is crystal clear and are very comfortable  my only complaint is that i wish the lenses were a little darker  otherwise  a good find      
702,2.0,                       inexpensive and lightweight  very poor sun protection  they look good though  arrived on time   no issue with seller      
703,5.0,                       the sunglasses are fantastic for blocking out light while still being able to see pretty well  i use these while driving  it makes things in the distance slightly more blurry  but they re pretty great  a little hard to clean so hang on to the cleaning rag that comes with it      
704,5.0,                       for a low price you gonna get quality  light weight  and stylish shades like no other  it s literary a ray ban without the retail price tag     
705,5.0,                       had these for a little over two months now and for the price that you pay for three polarized and i repeat polarized sunglasses is amazing no complaints with these at all especially when comparing to other name brands  the size  fit and feel on these are really great  if i did have to nit pick something about them it s that the pouch that they come with is just a microfiber pouch  so don t expect any type of drop protection when storing them      
706,5.0,                       it was too good to be true but it is  this got me thinking is something up  the design is very high quality for the price of the glasses and the design itself is beautiful soft matte finish for the wayfarers and refined and elegant feel to the clubmasters idk about the other glasses will definitely be hearin from me again      
707,5.0,                       greater     
708,5.0,                       they are very nice sun glasses and   different colors      
709,1.0,                       i was wearing this and then moved to the top of my head as the sun went down   frame just broke apart   first started with them deformed and then broke at the hinge   buy something better quality      
710,3.0,                       just bought my second set  they really are good sunglasses  however one of the frames cracked off the lens where the screws meet the two parts  the other pair broke but that was my fault  so   stars total but i do like them      
711,5.0,                    definitivamente hermosos  me encantan        
712,5.0,                       i bought these for my fianc  for our trip to denver  he loves them  he doesn t even wear sunglasses but he said he will rock these anytime the sun is up  definitely a must buy  very stylish      
713,5.0,                       love these     so cutee     
714,4.0,                       ok  light weight and thin  but reasonable for cost     
715,5.0,                       well  it s big and it s wide  it makes buying eyewear difficult when i put on normal sized glasses  the stems at the sides will dig into my temples and produce lumps on the top and bottom which makes it look like i have a fat head  i mean  i do  but i don t want it to look like i do i get tired of buying the large over sized styles of the   s and   s   you know  the aviators and huge versace type frames  otherwise it s the large sporty wrap arounds that you should only wear when doing sports i usually only get to pick out fun retro styles when i stumble onto a pair at a flea market or the local chinatown  but even then  fit is usually an issue well when i saw these as a  lightning deal with frames measuring      i decided to try them out they fit nicely without squeezing pinching at my temples   the stems are also long enough that i can push these things on top of my head like a headband when i m by the pool and don t need them but wanna keep my hair from falling down into my eyes they are not the best quality  pretty light  but at    a pair  they ll do   i m not the type of person who constantly has sunglasses on   i tend to keep them hanging from my neck of pushed up on the top of my head  where over time the lenses will get scratched  and will put them on only when needed  so these were perfect also each came with a little drawstring pouch and microfiber to wipe the lens  quite handy and thoughtful inexpensive  large and stylish   i would buy them again at    a pair      
716,5.0,                       amazed at the quality of these sunglasses   this price for one pair would be reasonable  but it s so fun to have three looks   will try to add a pic  i don t have a small face but they still look a little big to me compared to the actual wayfarers i lost      
717,5.0,                       we thought they would be of low quality because of the price but took a chance anyways  not at all  they are packaged a lot nicer than you would expect and they have kept up to par like a more expensive brand would  absolutely love these and will buy again      
718,5.0,                       best sunglasses i ever bought  very pleased with price and quality      
719,5.0,                       so cute     
720,5.0,                       driving florida the sunshine state they work really well     
721,5.0,                       good quality for the price and do indeed block the sun from scorching my retinas     
722,2.0,                       alright i get it  i got two pairs of sunglasses for      i guess i just had higher expectations  i lost a pair of     polarized sunglasses on the boat so i was looking to replace those  where we boat polarized glasses are a near necessity to spot sandbars  these glasses if they are polarized are not polarized well if that s a thing  they don t work as polarized glasses for being able to see in to water etc as i had on my more expensive ray bans one pair broke the first time i wore them  the wayfarer style  and they re now in the river  i ll continue my search for a decent and affordable pair of polarized glasses  these are not the ones      
723,5.0,                       overall  i am very satisfied with the sunglasses for protection from the sun  and ilove the style  good value      
724,5.0,                       pretty good quality  optically they don t have any weird distortions  tint is on the dark side probably     light pass if i had to guess  darker than     good buy      
725,5.0,                       like other branded sun glass  these sun glass are of good quality and fits perfectly on face having light weight the polarized effect is excellent and given comfort during sun light focusing on face during driving would give   start for its excellent quality with the price they offered      
726,5.0,                       i ordered these classy snazzy glasses and got dozens of compliments a screw fell out a month later and my boy jack b says he s giving me a full refund so i can order a new pair excellent quality  youll look like a super star  no one can see you staring with the black lens  amazing customer service this ones for you jack      
727,4.0,                       lightweight  with adjustable nose pads  fit is nice  construction seems to be fine and durable  and the lenses have no waves or bubbles or deformations   exactly as described  colors are a good way to choose which matches the outfit      
728,5.0,                       i received two pair of polarized sunglasses for what would have been a really good price for one pair  a little big on my face  but otherwise comfortable  good looking inexpensive glasses that i can wear on my walks and in the garden without fear of losing an expensive set of glasses      
729,5.0,                       i recently got the shades and absolutely love them  it blocks the sun when driving unlike most shades  i also wear them when not driving because they are so effective  you cannot beat the price and they are very elegant and sophisticated  definitely worth the purchase      
730,5.0,                       bought this for a christmas gift      
731,3.0,                       the glasses are decently made  especially for the price  i don t remember dimensions being provided on the product page and going by the pictures  i assumed these were adult size sunglasses  they are actually pretty small  if you re an average sized adult male      or more  you should probably look elsewhere on the positive side  the polarization is nice and even in direct sun i am able to see clearly  which is great for driving  i ll just have to pony up and get something larger  and probably more expensive       
732,5.0,                       my boyfriend loved them     
733,5.0,                       impressed by the product presentation  and the quality itself  i got a black lenses with gold edges it is an ideal pair of glasses for someone that is looking for good uv protection and style without being a brand lover      
734,5.0,                       these are great  exactly what i wanted and more  glasses included a microfiber wipe and bag per eyeglasses      
735,5.0,                       this was my first pair of sunglasses i ve bought online  and i m am in love  these block the sun  are light weight and cheap  i highly recommend      
736,5.0,                       these sunglasses are a great value   they are really nice looking and provide good sun protection      
737,2.0,                       it literally didn t last   month and it was ruined fidnt touch water or anything     
738,5.0,                       great price for   glasses    they definitely are as the description says      
739,5.0,                       very happy with my order  good quality  would recommend      
740,5.0,                       great for the price cannot complain  i m super hard on glasses and these withhold the test of time  otherwise i d buy ray bands      
741,5.0,                       excellent product severe solar deflectors     
742,3.0,                       these are dollar tree quality glasses   they are so cheaply made  look and feel like they can easily break  not worth the price  they do look nice at first glance i ll give them that but you re better off going to dollar tree to buy these glasses than spending the     on these      
743,5.0,                       love it  it was on time  and the quality it s simply amazing for the price  comes with a pouch and a cleaning tissue      
744,4.0,                       what i dislike is that its not for large head size my husband doesnt have the average head size so it was too small for him  i ended up using it but over all i love it      
745,5.0,                       good value  great overall protection     
746,4.0,                       these seem to be of decent quality for the price  but i would only recommend if you a relatively large head face  they are very large  my face is on the normal slim slide  and they looked huge on me      
747,5.0,                       very nice glasses  high quality      
748,5.0,                       really enjoy glasses     
749,5.0,                       love it     try no to let them fall in the floor     you will have to take fix it     
750,5.0,                       best sunglasses i ve ever had  they are definitely worth the money  the gold in real life looks very plasticy but from a distance they are the best      
751,5.0,                       like the way they feel  light weight and comfortable      
752,1.0,                       i got a pack of    and the box came very damaged  one pair was very cracked and the arms were broken and could lay very far out  not fitting  another pair had broken nose pieces and the arms were too wide to fit my head  the third pair was lopsided and looked bad  the reviews said these were good but that wasn t the case  i will get one pair of decent glasses than   pair of these      
753,3.0,                       nice but kinda cheap quality you get what you pay for     
754,5.0,                       well made  sturdy and well fitting      
755,5.0,                       we love these pair  looks really cool  highly recommended  hopefully they last  they feel so fragile         
756,4.0,                    les agradezco   muy buena calidad   pero podr an decirme cu l usar en el sol del d a y cu l en la noche        
757,5.0,                       i love these  they re super cute on  not too heavy but not flimsy at all  the polarization is amazing considering i drive into the sun both ways on my commute  and the best part  the nose piece doesn t get stuck in my hair  the come with a microfiber cloth  for cleaning  and a satchel so they don t get scratched in my purse      
758,4.0,                       very nice just wish the frame was little bigger cause a lot of light comes in from the sides     
759,4.0,                       here is a photo of the balck pair i bought next to my actual raybans   they are virtually identical and fit the same   i don t know that the polarization is consistent with manufacturing as the other pair that came with my purchase seems  more polarized  than this pair   they look and fit good though      
760,5.0,                       i love my sunglasses     they stay on my face  this is my  nd order for these just to have spares   i had someone ask if you can see your eyes while wearing them i would say a   out of     i m very happy with my purchase  thank you  deana     
761,5.0,                       i really like this glasses because its polarized and the images appear to be sharp and more clear recently went to a road trip and this glasses totally rocks the trip i really liked it and its really good for photography as well  to be honest you wont get this much of a quality in a lower budget glass like this i really recommend this to everyone     
762,4.0,                       good  material  polarization  stylebad  too wide if you have a small facereturning as i can t adjust the nose pieces enough for it to not annoy me      
763,5.0,                       durable and good polarization     
764,5.0,                       these are great  comfortable and lightweight sunglasses  the price was right and you get two pair i highly recommend them      
765,5.0,                       i got two pairs for      you can t beat that  and they are great protection in the sun      
766,5.0,                       i really like these  they are lightweight and comfortable  perfect for driving  at the game  or just working in the back yard      
767,5.0,                       very lightweight  works great for sun protection  i also use them when recording videos while using filming lights and they block out some of the lights also      
768,3.0,                       good looking sunglasses for the money  they feel very plasticky but that s alright it s what you expected for what you pay  if you re looking for a pair of sunglasses that are cheap and look great these are perfect and you don t have to worry about losing them or scratching them only problem is that if you use them for a couple hours the nose pads will be marked on your nose and it will hurt       
769,5.0,                       exactly as advertised  they look just like sunglasses three and four times the cost      
770,5.0,                       the glass are great for driving  but if you have a heads up display  it goes invisible because of the polarization  but everything else looks super clear      
771,5.0,                       great deal  and really good quality sunglasses for the price  they look great too  can t beat it      
772,5.0,                       they re perfect     
773,5.0,                       these are the best off brand clubmaster sunglasses are seen  they are very lightweight  look great  and are sized right  a lot of the cheaper glasses in this style tend to be a little larger than raybans and have cheaper looking plastic but these are perfect  especially with the   pack option  these seem to be the best value on amazon for the price      
774,4.0,                       glasses are great  but to much of gap that let normal light in      
775,5.0,                       i loved these sunglasses  sadly lost them  but will most likely be purchasing another for this summer

778,5.0,                       love them  they really block out any sort of light and look surprisingly good for the price      
779,4.0,                       awesome product for the price  they look great on the face and the lenses are super crisp  my husband and i were able to share which is amazing because my head size is smaller so the flexibility in the frame is awesome because it doesn t pinch your temples hard and give you that annoying headache      
780,5.0,                       always enjoy purchasing inexpensive glasses  these are quite lightweight but the uv protection and polarization is really perfect  they come in a nice case as well which was not expected  definitely looks more expensive than it is      
781,5.0,                       value for money and it looks great   awesome price for   great sunglasses       
782,5.0,                       i like the quality     
783,5.0,                       love these glasses  they re dark enough for my sensitive eyes  and fit perfectly      
784,5.0,                       great sunglasses  i love them      
785,3.0,                       these sunglasses look amazing and feel good  however  if you are in a car with tinted windows  you will see lots of color throughout the window and as well as lines  that made me replace these      
786,5.0,                       i am happy i chose these shades  fit n shape perfect from just ordering online  happy customer  just adding that delivery was never handed to residents as it states  package was outside on front stairs      
787,5.0,                       quality  used for softball and baseball games     
788,5.0,                       these are great  both are polarized and work fit like a     pair from target but it s   for      totally worth the money    i love them     
789,4.0,                       i got   pair of polarized sunglasses made outta plastic one shiny one matte that i wear on my face they work     
790,1.0,                       i don t know what i expected for the money  but they feel so light and cheap  they don t look bad and they work  but save your money and spend a little more for a better product      
791,5.0,                       the glasses are an affordable substitute for more expensive polarized glasses  the pair with the chrome finish is a bit flimsy  but the flimsiness has not affected its use  i love that that each pair of glasses comes with a pouch and a cleaner      
792,4.0,                       thumbs up     
793,5.0,                       amazing  high quality  stylish and comfortable sunglasses for a phenomenal price  we purchased the   pack and they fit my husband and i perfectly  will be purchasing again       
794,3.0,                       the lenses seemed small to me  maybe i m just used to larger lenses  i m returning these      
795,5.0,                       we have an affenpinscher that barks incessantly at men  to the point where it can be stressful to have people over  she would also bark at the neighbor  and anybody that would pass by not anymore  there might be a quiet little  ruff  occasionally  but even that has become rare  no more waking up the baby  or ruining quiet moments  no more ruined dinner parties highly recommended if you have a problem dog      
796,5.0,                       great value for the money   have an everyday pair and a more dressy pair     
797,5.0,                       these are excellent sunglasses and a fantastic value   they are unisex and both my husband and i can swap the different frames between us   we were definitely impressed with the quality for the price      
798,5.0,                       i broke lost a few pairs of ray bans over the years and wasn t willing to spend more on another pair  luckily i was willing to try these out before splurging on another pair of expensive sunglasses these are great sunglasses and they look really good  my only complaint is that the smaller one s lens is ever so slightly curved so that there a tiny little bit magnification looking through them  not even really noticeable though  otherwise a great purchase  and they seem really durable      
799,4.0,                       i received a pair of the retro glasses and the standard polarized sunglasses  the retro ones fit me perfectly  the more standard glasses were too wide for my face  both were delivered scratch free with awesome cleaning cloths and cases      
800,5.0,                       these frames are substantial they fit nice and snug  the lenses are clean and clear and polarized  a quality eyeware at a very fair price      
801,5.0,                       not good for larger faces but really nice glasses for the money      
802,5.0,                       there pretty sweet  fit great  also came with two drawstring carrying cases and two cleaning cloths  highly recommend for the price  you won t be disappointed  instead blown away      
803,5.0,                       light and comfortable and classy looking   i was pleasantly surprised      
804,5.0,                       i chose this pair because they were the perfect style  one for me and one for my fiance  i got the silver rimmed ones and they fit my face perfectly  the other one fits him perfectly  also got him another   that were different colors because why not   great value for your money definitely reccomend       
805,3.0,                       cheap looking  the ones with metal look better than the others  i think these should cost less      
806,4.0,                       couldn t ask for better shades for the price  feel a tad bit cheap bc they re so lightweight but again  i think that comes with the price  other than that  they look great  exactly like the picture  and are great for uv protection      
807,4.0,                       tight product  looks good and is really light weight     
808,4.0,                       the sunglay them selves look nice but the quality doesn t match it  they feel very cheap and fragile  we ll see how long they last but i guess you get what you pay for      
809,5.0,                       fits well  like them a lot     
810,5.0,                       i think at this point i have about   pairs of these floating around   i really like them and tend to loose sunglasses a lot so the price is right and the quality is high      
811,5.0,                       for three pairs of sunglassses  you really can t get a better deal  i m someone who always loses a pair in the river so to have a few backup pairs for less than the cost of most single pair glasses is fantastic      
812,5.0,                       the sun blockage      
813,5.0,                       surprisingly good  very nice sunglasses for the price  high quality bags are included with the purchase  as well as cleaning clothes  overall very pleased  no complaints      
814,3.0,                       not what i expected to be  they run smallit fit good on my   yrs old boy  but too small for my husband       
815,5.0,                              
816,5.0,                       two penjoy airs of glasses for this price how do you go wrong   they are not ray bans but for the price     
817,5.0,                       i wear these shades everyday  between the black and the brown  you can put them with any outfit  they are stylish and light weight  thumbs up     
818,4.0,                       all i wanted was some low cost sunglasses in a nice style  and have them polarized now  i ll keep it real  these  are not luxury or super strong sunglasses  but this product is exactly what i wanted  it works  they look good  enough   and i m happy with my purchase  if you want to spend more you could totally get superior sunglasses  but for this price you are getting exactly what you expect  and i can t complain      
819,5.0,                       these sunglasses are fantastic  they are very stylish  very comfortable  and on top of that  they come with a lovely soft case so they don t get scratched  and a very soft cloth with which to clean them  these glasses couldn t be nicer  i highly recommend them      
820,5.0,                       great product  the polarized glasses do the job of giving you a good vision overall specially when the sun is beating down snd reflections are worse on the road  when you are walking around etc   for the money   it does a great job  the design works for square shaped faces as you see in mine      
821,5.0,                       i wear sunglasses daily and usually buy name brand expensive pairs  these sunglasses are better than any name brand that i ve owned      
822,3.0,                       these were pretty cheap so it s not surprising the quality isn t great  i liked the style  but the materials are not a great quality and when you wear them  something about the shape of the lense seems to distort my vision  i would recommend investing in a better quality pair      
823,5.0,                    muy buen producto        
824,5.0,                       honestly was skeptical   impressed      
825,5.0,                       the sunglasses provide great value all around  they are light weight  have a nice look   good quality and protection from the sun      
826,5.0,                       wow beautiful    everything about this purchase is beautiful      
827,5.0,                       love these glasses for the price you can t beat this deal with a stick  the quality of the glasses are great and they re polarized which is fantastic the packaging is gray as well it comes with a nice microfiber case and cleaning cloth i mean what more can you ask for  at least give them a trat least give them a try     
828,5.0,                       what s not to like     
829,5.0,                       these are amazing quality for a reasonable price  definitely worth the buy      
830,5.0,                       at the behest of my eye doctor i got rid of the transition lenses and prefer these shades  it has taken a couple days to adjust  however  these shades knock down so much more glare and light than i expected  these shades are amazing      
831,5.0,                       i love these glasses   great quality and i will definitely order agaim       
832,5.0,                       our whole family has these glasses  four adults  they re great  the stand up to careless use  they re dark enough that big snow and beach sun don t overwhelm them  polarization is excellent      
833,5.0,                       very nice item much better than i expected good value      
834,5.0,                       this was a stocking stuffer      
835,5.0,                    excelente para un regalo a un chico        
836,4.0,                       sun protection is good  but slightly small and a bit uncomfortable at times      
837,5.0,                       excelente     
838,5.0,                       the smooth matte finish box they came in also included two premium microfiber cloths and two microfiber bags        would buy again     
839,5.0,                       cool   for   purchase  indeed      
840,3.0,                       too round imo     
841,5.0,                       cost effective and very comfortable  highly recommend      
842,5.0,                       amazing quality and great guarantees   definitely great quality and fashionable compared to spending hundreds of dollars     
843,5.0,                       they shipped faster than originally expected  they feel like good durable material and frame the face well  would buy again      
844,5.0,                       a little narrow but appears well made   stylish and light   good but for the price     
845,5.0,                       awesome for the money  polarized doesn t feel cheap   no ray bans but     of the quality for     of the price     
846,5.0,                       these are a great value for the price  considering i got the   pack  it s hard to take care of sunglasses  let alone expensive ones  these are a great option for affordable  good polarized sunglasses      
847,5.0,                    buena protecci n   ambas muy bonitas         
848,4.0,                       good price   stylish   compared to my costco polarized pair for fishing  only fair   for the money  you can have a pair in the boat and one in the car      
849,5.0,                       these glasses exceeded my expectations  plus you get two pairs   all i ll need in sun protection  if i don t lose them       
850,5.0,                       exceeded expectations   glasses are lightweight   quality  and include a cleaning cloth with a nylon carrying case bought two and will definitely get more  i will use one for driving and the other one for golf  i drive long distances several times a week   so these will be a great help to keep my eyes from tiring and to clear the glare also can t wait to get on the golf course with them      
851,5.0,                       great quality and polarized at a great price  item came quick and nicely packaged  thank you so much  really enjoying these sunglasses      
852,4.0,                       love these sunglasses  great size  flattering shape  and good polarization  my one dislike is this weird smell some of them get that smells a bit like asparagus pee  it s not enough to keep me from wearing and it didn t happen to all of them but it was noticeable  over all  great product      
853,5.0,                       i love love love these  they work so well and fit amazingly i highly suggest them     
854,5.0,                       these sunglasses are great  i love the look and how light weight they are  they are very clear to see through      
855,5.0,                       i have one nice pair of sunglasses and i m going to the lake soon so i wanted some that i didn t mind if i lost but that were still decent quality  these are amazing   they look so good on and the fact that they re polarized is even better  they re really nice quality      
856,3.0,                       these are definitely light weight  but they are not as dark as the picture shows   i wanted the lenses a bit darker  i love the flat black color of the frames  they were delivered quickly and boxed appropriately      
857,2.0,                       i really like these sunglasses   they are super clear and comfortable   problem is as soon as i got them i got scratches almost immediately on the lenses   seems like the coating is a bit weak   other than that they are awesome      
858,4.0,                       good fit  correct on all features  ie sun protection  light weight   great price     
859,5.0,                       great glasses    loved them for the price  plan on getting more too        
860,3.0,                       i understand you get what you pay for and they do the job minimizing brightness but they are kinda painful  the sharpness digs into my skull if i raise them for any extended period of time      
861,5.0,                       theses sun glasses are just what i needed  they are light weight  great polaroid protection  and a great price  i would normally pay the same price for one pair at local stores      
862,5.0,                       arrived well packaged and with cleaning cloth  alongside with a carrying pouch  they are certainly polarized but is not such agresive that you can t see the screen of the phone like others  i m a very picky customer and this satisfied me for this price and good for every day      
863,5.0,                       the sunglasses are comfortable to wear and you get   pair of glasses they block out the sunlight very well      
864,5.0,                       these were better than expected   my son wanted a better pair of sunglasses and he likes this style in ray bans  i was not ready to pay that much till i knew he liked them and could take care of them   after buying these  i really liked them so bought some for myself and the rest of our family   the three pack options are great and come with cleansing cloth and bag to keep them from getting scratched   i will only buy these from now on   fit perfectly  great in the sun  good near water   the polarized is a bonus   not heavy at all  very comfortable      
865,5.0,                       a            
866,5.0,                       i initially bought these as my throw away pair so i didn t expect much  however  the sunglasses are way better than i expected for the price  the frame is lightweight but it s not flimsy and the lenses have great polarization  these a great cheap sunglasses and yes it actually gives you   pairs      
867,5.0,                       looks great and so far it didn t break  great value for the money      
868,5.0,                       felt like i was taking a risk getting   pairs of  polarized  sunglasses on amazon for      figured they would either be really cheap built quality or not actually polarized or both of those things  however  the sunglasses i got feel pretty sturdy  and are definitely actually polarized   plus they re really comfortable      
869,5.0,                       honestly i get ur money s worth in a good way    there actually pretty good quality and the pair comes with a card to check the polarization    micro fiber case and little rag to clean glasses  i bought this for my trip to mexico and was well worth it    cause if i lost them i wouldn t care and    if the got damage i wouldn t care but all around i really liked these will definitely be buying more of these glasses really good quality        
870,5.0,                       i am loving these sunglasses  i haven t been shopping for anything more than the basics in these covid times  so thought i would check out the sunglasses here  i m not a fancy person  but it is helpful when glasses fit your face  i was worried  i can t carry those    s glasses look   but they are perfect  as well as very good sun protection  and not too close to my face  helping avoid the sunglass tan lines a little  they are also very sturdy  don t fall off my face  and generally don t get stuck in my hair  the catalyst for me looking for glasses in the first place   my hair is pretty much like a fuzzy slash  so if they didn t get tangled in my hair  you re probably safe  they did get a little stuck in the eye pad part  but not bad  the hinge area   rest of the glasses are pretty smooth  i am happy      
871,5.0,                       love this sunglasses for the price  they are lightweight and the sun protection is amazing     
872,5.0,                       really nice  considering the price      
873,5.0,                       i changed my rating on this one to   stars   it definitely is polarized  so these are officially my favorite sunglasses of all time pros   comfortable  fit well  lightweight  dark tint  look nicecons none  this part is what i m eliminating from my review    the description says polarized  but every other pair of polarized glasses i ve ever owned had some occasionally funky effects with led screens and a bit of a rainbow pattern on tinted car windows   these do not while i don t miss those things  i have to wonder if they are really polarized   if they aren t as advertised  do they really block uva and uvb        
874,5.0,                       first impressions are fantastic   the packaging was nice and the glasses look and feel more expensive than they are  comes with a case and microfiber cloth for each pair which is nice  build quality appears to be solid  although i have only had them for a few hours so we ll see how well they hold up  i don t like spending big money on sunglasses because i break or lose them way too often so i was looking for a pair or two of inexpensive but decent quality glasses in popular styles  these fit my requirements perfectly so far      
875,4.0,                    hermosas        
876,5.0,                       first  getting two pairs for the price of one is always a plus  but when i put on these glasses  i feel like my vision is so heightened  which is probably just due to the polarized lenses   i can see clearly  but notice that if i m looking at something black  like a black car  i see what looks like the light spectrum  at any rate  once you get over that  these glasses will become your go to classes  i like that they go with anything and i ve received compliments on both pair when i wear them      
877,5.0,                       so far so good  i think they look great and one of the three was broken but the seller sent a replacement after a quick email exchange      
878,5.0,                       sun protection  good look and value      
879,3.0,                       you pretty much get the look you want down and the style of glasses resembles those much more expensive  however  the quality does not match that of the more expensive brands  mine is loose and flimsy and could easily break  if you want a quick and fast fashionable accessory  get these  otherwise  invest in a more quality pair of glasses      
880,5.0,                       great product  great customer service  highly recommend      
881,5.0,                       literally had someone saw these looked way more expensive than they actually were  really like these as a cheap pair of sunglasses     
882,5.0,                       these sunglasses feel great  and they all come there own pouch and cloth      
883,5.0,                       they look good   don t look super cheap  a good buy     
884,5.0,                       absolute excellent quality and reasonable price  especially convenient for me to wear when traveling  especially comfortable  light and convenient  excellent quality and reasonable price     
885,4.0,                       good sunglasses  however my wife didn t like the style  i returned them      
886,5.0,                       can t beat this deal  needed some new sunglasses and got two for the price of one      
887,5.0,                       they keep the sun out so they do what i paid them to do     
888,5.0,                       these arrived on time  and as advertised  i was able to try them on and they look great  and fit similar to other wayfarer knockoffs i have had in the past   i haven t had an opportunity to wear them outside  but they included a little card that reveals dolphins with them on to prove they are polarized   so far  two great pairs of sunglasses for the cost      
889,3.0,                       ok product quality  of the frames could be a lot better  very flimsy     
890,5.0,                       they look very nice i like them     
891,5.0,                       stay on my head very well  don t slide down my nose   no gaps on the sides that let in sun      
892,5.0,                       super cheap but great quality for glasses you don t kind damaging or losing like i always fo     
893,5.0,                       all were in good condition  right amount of tint  just that there were both matte instead of one being glossy  but that s not an issue  antigua and they actually are polarized      
894,5.0,                       these glasses are very stylish and protect your eyes well from the sun  i suggest buying these      
895,4.0,                       just received my glasses  pairs  and i m happy with them  definitely worth the money  would ve been   stars had i received exactly what i ordered  instead of getting the   pack of matte glasses that i ordered  i got   matte and one glossy  either i received the wrong pair or the product description doesn t clarify that one of them would be glossy  either way the product descriptions should be more helpful rather than having to study the pictures   its not the end of the world but i definitely would ve preferred them all to be matte  would ve been   stars considering the price      
896,5.0,                       as someone who tends to lose his sun glasses  often  i bought these on sale because they are the style i like  and polarized  and came with   pairs  plus a nice bag for each set with goodies and stuff let me just say  i hate cheap feeling sunglasses  i can t do it  for the    a pair i paid for these  it felt worth the gamble and it paid off for sure  i would have paid full price  the material feels nice  the hinges are firm and not just thrown together  and they are polarized in a way that is noticeably different than non polarized   they even give you a polarization test in the package   i m doing my best to take care of my glasses but if i lose them again  i ll definitely be buying another pair of these     
897,5.0,                       very comfortable on nose  nice looking and i get compliments      
898,5.0,                       good value  no case      
899,4.0,                       i liked them very much rest the view and they serve for the sun  the truth i justify what i pay

902,5.0,                       i needed sunnies for the car  i just had cataract surgery and my eyes are sensitive   these are nice and dark and feel high quality   so happy i bought the two pair   i m using both the  male  and  female  style  i find them uni sex   great products

905,4.0,                       good sunglasses for a great price  i lose my sunglasses too often to invest in an expensive pair  so these work well  you can definitely spot out that these aren t some high end name brand stuff      
906,4.0,                       great value i did not realise that i was getting   pair shades  very light weight  polarized  came with picture card to show polarization  micro fiber bag and cloth  note  both frames are delicate and lens are plastic so if your hard on glasses        
907,5.0,                       great sunglasses for the price  they re comfortable and easy to adjust     
908,5.0,                       got both pair for a good deal  light weight and fresh      
909,5.0,                       the only thing i wish is that it came with three little cases instead of just one case      
910,5.0,                       definitely worth the money  with cheap glasses i don t expect much  but these are pretty good quality for the money  bought them for my son  and will be buying again for my father      
911,5.0,                       i love the design  you get two pairs  and you can t beat the price  they re awesome  it comes with two microfiber cleaning cloths and two little pouches to store them in  love it     
912,5.0,                       i was expecting these to be a  you get what you pay for  deal  i am glad to be wrong  true  they aren t super high quality  but they don t feel cheap either  they work just as they should  they are comfortable  and they look just fine  at the price point  these sunglasses can t be beat      
913,2.0,                       originally were very nice but ended up breaking after using only a few times     
914,5.0,                       these two styles are high quantity and light weight     
915,2.0,                       the vision is good but the material is cheap in the second time the glasses were broken     
916,5.0,                       great product for cost  highly recommend  especially if you lose your glasses a lot like me      
917,5.0,                       fits perfectly over my glasses without being heavy   makes it pretty dark inside the car  but is perfect when i get out   have to walk in the sunlight  glare problem solved       
918,5.0,                       these glasses look great and the quality isn t bad considered the amazing price  good value     
919,5.0,                       perfect and in a three pack just buy it  i m not gonna pay     for glasses im gonna lose or break     
920,5.0,                       best bang for buck  i love the style of these sunglasses and they help so much with protecting my eyes    problem with polarized sunglasses is that i cant see my cars gauges as well and i can t see my heads up display in my car  thats all polarized sunglasses though      
921,5.0,                       if you just need sunglasses but don t really care about quality  this ll work  just be sure to measure your head compared to the width of these frames  i think they are on the narrow end for folks with small heads like me  other than that  can t complain much at this price point they are polarized and light      
922,5.0,                       definitely a steal    very good quality and lightweight  i was looking for ray ban styled glasses that are affordable  got a pair for my man and i  such a great price too i might have to buy more    stars all the way  i only wish they came with hard cases but i just bought some cheap ones on the side so it s all good      
923,5.0,                       i love the style of both  i did feel that they where a bit to big  but better than my other pair of sunglasses     
924,5.0,                       good quality  good optics  good style      
925,5.0,                       these are very cute and exactly what i was looking for      
926,1.0,                       i understand these are cheap ray ban knock offs   i don t expect the same quality as the originals   these look pretty good   the frames are definitely thinner and lighter weight   the wayfarer style fits well   the clubmaster style not so much   these are totally unwearable as the lenses are foggy   it s like looking through vaseline   my eyes hurt within    seconds of putting them on indoors   the optics are the worst i have ever put on my face   i m not going to risk the health of my eyes   these are going back immediately        
927,5.0,                       very light weight and comforteble     
928,5.0,                       these are the nicest glasses i have ever bought they cut the sun and glare down like you would not believe here i las vegas just awesome   so light weight   cleaner and pocket holder for each pair   two pair for less than price of one pair any where      
929,5.0,                       i have received compliments on the way they look from my grandchildren  wore them for a three hour sunny drive and they were great   i ordered because i did not want to go in person shopping with the pandemic   very happy with these   fit and look great      
930,5.0,                       got these for my boyfriend in the matte color and he loves them  got him the two different styles and he wears them all the time  he has sensitive eyes so the polarization is perfect  definitely recommend      
931,5.0,                       i was sick of paying       for ray bans  scratching  a lens   or   years later and being told i would have to replace them  instead of getting a lens replaced   i got these two for      nd you d never know the difference        
932,5.0,                       great product  i recommend it  fast delivery by seller      
933,5.0,                       perfect  well made      
934,5.0,                       you definitely get your moneys worth out of these sunglasses   for the price you pay  they look good  lightweight and nicely polarized   the plastic is fairly thin and potentially fragile  but i d purchase them again      
935,5.0,                       amazing glasses  and for the price i m shocked at the quality tbh      
936,5.0,                       i actually really like these glasses  i was searching for a pair to use as my official  adult  glasses to keep and care for  these are really good  very very good for the price  i was a bit hesitant about it since it was so cheap and the brand wasn t well known  but they re very good  solid  good polarization  and they come with a little soft case and a little lens wipe  felt rather luxurious for how much i bought it for  overall i really like it  they re very good for the price and work as well as you d expect sunglasses to     
937,5.0,                       i love that you get three sets for the price of one set from a traditional store  they all look great and the added bags and cleaning cloths for each set are nice to have  so far they have held up well and they seem fairly sturdy  time will tell if they are prone to scratching     
938,5.0,                       i swear all my pairs of glasses break within   weeks but these have been good so far  very durable and they are in fact polarized  definitely worth the price  would buy again      
939,5.0,                       exactly what i needed      
940,5.0,                       i do love these shades  you can get   and for the price  you almost can t beat it  i like that the lens don t just make things darker like other shades i have gotten  it s almost like a tint if i m describing it right  the only thing i don t like is i wish i can curve the glasses but it doesn t feel like you should bend them  i do recommend these glasses  the description is exactly as it says and you won t regret      
941,5.0,                       love these glasses so stylish and good quality with great price     
942,5.0,                       this product definitely didn t disappoint  i love the product for the price and it seems to be great quality  i would recommend to friends and family      
943,2.0,                       they are ok  the shape is totally more feminine than masculine  they re also pretty thin and feel like they ll break easily      
944,5.0,                       i ve used these on really sunny days and they do a great job of blocking harsh sunlight while driving      
945,5.0,                    son muy livianos y excelente visi n         
946,5.0,                       they really are polarized  very cute      
947,5.0,                       light weight  i wear contacts and the polarized lens help protect my eyes from the sun      
948,5.0,                         pair of good polarized sun glasses     
949,5.0,                       they are great for the price  i don t care if i accidentally break or lose a set  they are comfy also and don t look too cheap     
950,5.0,                       surprisingly good quality  comfortable in the sun  nice bonus of cleaning cloth and cases   i m quite happy      
951,5.0,                       the products are great  they are high quality and extremely comfortable  as a former employee of sunglass hut  i can honestly say that these glasses are the best replacement for ray bans i ve ever owned  i ve had several pairs of the  official  club masters and i have to say that for the price  there s not one reason i wouldn t pick these first  for a pair of polarized lenses  usually a      price bump  these are beyond worth the money  the plastic is noticeably lighter than the      store brands but i believe that s one reason i am able to wear them all day without any discomfort  the all black color option is by far my favorite and has a beautiful look to it  while the tortoise shell color has a clean matte finish that you can t usually find in stores  only the customized pairs  the build is light but sturdy  extremely comfortable and flexible around the nose  and an even cleaner without all the branding marks all over them    pairs allows me to keep one in the car  one at home and bring a pair wherever i go  while the extremely low price makes it so that i don t have to  baby  my frames and can actually wear them without worry  that  or just switch up the options to pair them perfectly no matter the outfit or occasion       great buy and i think i just found my new go to frames   to put it in short form  if you want the ray ban look and quality but can t afford        getting   pair of these for     may be the best all around deal on the market      
952,1.0,                       the glasses are a gift  therefore i will not wear them and do not know how good they are as far as sun protection  but they feel very very cheap  i know you pay for what you get  but i didn t expect them to feel so flimsy      
953,2.0,                       got these sunglasses for my boyfriend and they were great at first  but they only lasted   months  i know the price is low  but the screws were randomly falling out      
954,1.0,                    son c modos y livianos  aten an adecuadamente el sol para sentir el gusto de conducir sin problemas  me gusta el estilo de cada par de anteojos  actualizaci n              despu s del uso normal  el calor hace esto en mis lentes  adem s puede verse rasgu os en ellos  esperaba m s  pero ahora me siento un poco decepcionado         
955,5.0,                       i don t leave reviews but i m going to for these glasses  they re awesome cheap ass sunglasses  blown away for the price  ordering more     
956,5.0,                       the quality is above what expected for        they are so snug on my head which is hard for me to find a lot of times  they are a classic expensive look as well     
957,5.0,                       sunglasses     
958,5.0,                       i bought these for my husband and he said he really likes these sunglasses  he s a man of few words so that s all i got from him lol     
959,5.0,                       hey fellow buyers  firstly i have ordered a few amazon shades and i usually get what i pay for  but these puppies are a steal  both pairs are actually high quality whereas i thought the plastic ones would be cheap  they fit really well and for the price you can t go wrong  at the mall these would be at least         so if you wanna get some nice glasses for a realistic price these are the way to go  also they come with a little polarization tester which i thought was an awesome touch  i hope this company conuines to have reasonable prices and quality products      
960,5.0,                       really high quality sunglasses for very cheap  good polarized lenses  would definitely recommend      
961,5.0,                       these glasses are amazing for the price  so well packaged and look great  i will definitely buy more      
962,5.0,                       great for the bright az sun      
963,3.0,                       arrived nicely wrapped up  thought it was cute until i unwrapped  was disappointed there s no way to put it back on     and the pair has a scratched on the nose part aswell      
964,5.0,                       while the frames look good and are lightweight   which is fantastic  the lenses themselves aren t all that great  there is a rainbow effect which is distracting  overall pretty much what i expected with this product  i can t imagine you can get a better pair for the price      
965,5.0,                       great value look and feel great     
966,5.0,                       i loved these  great uv protection and versatile     
967,5.0,                       i bought these for my partner since he s always stealing my sunnies  i figured they were classic and unisex so if he didn t like them i could keep them for myself  he looks great in them  they are lightweight and decent quality  glad i bought them      
968,2.0,                       i received only one and i had to return it next day     
969,1.0,                       loved the sun protection with these but unfortunately   the plastic arm broke just below the screw within the first week of wearing  left me thinking these may not be made with the sturdiest of materials      
970,5.0,                       wow  i just broke my favorite pair of raybands last week and i bought these to hold me over until i found another pair  well my search is over  both glasses are super fresh  flight  and look very very expensive  they are legit polarized and i m probably going to keep buying this brand  forget dumping all your   into designer stuff when you can get these        happy      
971,5.0,                       loved these  able to match with my boyfriend  glasses are polarized and help so much with the sun  for   pairs and the quality of the glasses  the price was so worth it      
972,5.0,                       the different glasses i got were unique each one  i loved the designthe metal framed ones are a little tight but they are still a great  value and everything else is goo     
973,3.0,                       the pairs are cute for the price  its nice to have an assortment  however one of my sunglasses  the darkest ones  came inverted  one section is completely inside out of how it should be and screwed on tight  too late to return which sucks      
974,5.0,                       love these sunglasses they are sleek and amazing     
975,5.0,                       i love these sunglasses  so comfortable and fit my face perfect  love the price and i don t have to worry too much if i lose a pair  i did just order more i m excited to show off      
976,2.0,                       you get what you pay for  these are cheap sunglasses  i ve only had them for   weeks and they already broke  i have been very careful with them because i could tell they were cheap  somehow this morning they broke  i set them in my cup holder in my car and came back out    minutes later and they were completely cracked by the screw that attaches the arms to the lenses  i m very disappointed because i really liked the way they looked on me      
977,5.0,                       these are super cute and comfortable   you can t beat the price      
978,5.0,                       they are nice  when you look at your phones it s a little weird but it s not bad     
979,5.0,                       well fitting  great looking   great value      
980,5.0,                       i got these for my husband s birthday  he loves them  they fit the face well  much better than other brands in this style      
981,5.0,                       excellent quality and performance  nice touch with the individual glass holders and piece o fabric to clean the lenses     
982,5.0,                       i m not a very picky person when it comes to sunglasses  but i do like quality  these sunglasses came in great shape and also came with its own soft case and cleaning cloth        would recommend

985,5.0,                       bought one about   months ago  i love how they look on me  i bought a   pack recently because i like them so much  i now have   different colors  they re polarized  lightweight  stylish  and the price is excellent  they seem well made  but may not be as durable as the higher      sunglasses  only time will tell  but if used with care i am sure these can last a couple summer seasons      
986,5.0,                       ok     
987,5.0,                       i use one for running and one for everything else  the quality of these frames is amazing for the price  the polarized lenses are awesome as well      
988,5.0,                       awesome value  these are great glasses and you get   pairs  we lose sunglasses a lot so there s no need to buy expensive ones  these have great style

991,5.0,                       very light but strong and durable  i m very happy with this purchase  perfect fit and very comfortable to wear      
992,3.0,                       worked well for a couple months  you honestly get what you pay for      
993,5.0,                       polarized  affordable  and stylish  i m incredibly happy with this purchase  i wasn t expecting much for the price  but the build feels sturdy  i was pleasantly surprised to see the elegant minimalist design  there s no plastering of brand logos anywhere on these in an attempt to turn you into a walking advertisement  they re incredibly comfortable and i was impressed to see that  despite the low price  my   pack came with three microfiber carrying pouches with each pouch including a microfiber cleaning cloth      
994,5.0,                       awesome fit and amazing quality and discounted rate  nothing more can be expected      
995,5.0,                       these are decent sunglasses for the price  under       they look good and i have absolutely no complaints at all  they come each in their own pouch and each has a cleaning cloth  i am pleased with my purchase  good buy      
996,5.0,                       clean and simple well worth the money     
997,5.0,                       amazing product   good quality and very good price        
998,3.0,                       the frames could ve been more matte  the pictures on here don t show just how glossy they are and that gives off a cheaper look and feel  that aside my pair cane with crooked nose pieces so they don t quite sit as normal as they should and you absolutely can not see your phone screen with them on  that aside the lenses are super dark which was a big bonus for me and the gold accent is pretty classy looking  matte the frames  fix the nose pieces  and you have a pretty solid set of shades     
999,5.0,                       excellent quality  you cannot tell by the looks that they are not a premium brand glasses  got my pairs for under      great value for a great product      
1000,3.0,                       i love these sunglasses  they fit really well and are actually polarized  however  i am giving   stars because it has only been a week  and one pair has already broken  i made sure to be careful with them  but while i was taking them off  the plastic broke around the lens  i just wish that they didn t break so soon      
1001,4.0,                       they are perfect     
1002,5.0,                       the package includes   different styles of clubmaster frames    the quality is great and the accessories that s included are great    i really feel excited about shopping here    will for surely shop here again      
1003,5.0,                       for the price  these are definitely worth a look  the frame has a substantial weighty plastic that doesn t feel like it will crumble into dust like some other glasses i ve purchased  the hinges aren t spring assisted but still feel sturdy and move smoothly  the lenses are dark  but not enough to feel like i m wearing welding goggles if i walk indoors or drive through a tunnel  the polarization can make using a laptop or my phone a slight challenge depending on the angle  but that s really not a big deal      
1004,5.0,                       item was as described by the seller and arrived as scheduled      
1005,5.0,                       love these sunglasses   pleased with the comfort and light weight most noticeable to me was the fact that the lenses are good size and the arms extend over my ears   i have a  big head  and it is good to find sunglasses that fit so well      
1006,4.0,                       i just got these a few weeks ago  and i really enjoy them  not super great material  but definitely good for the price  usually with sunglasses they hurt my nose or ears if i wear them for to long at a time  but i haven t had that issue with these bad bois     
1007,5.0,                       i love these shades  they block the glare from the sun and they are a good find for the money      
1008,5.0,                       the sunglasses are a great backup pair to my prescription sunglasses  and they re polarized  which is pretty awesome      
1009,5.0,                       bought these for my boyfriend and he loved them   i have ray bans and the lens quality are similar  and for the price these are definitely worth buying      
1010,5.0,                       i never expected to find a polarized sun glasses cheap  love it      
1011,5.0,                       didn t expect this quality for the price  very stylish  durable  i ordered sunglasses online several times but always ended up returning them because of the size being too large than advertised  but this one fits so well plus i got it in a deal      
1012,5.0,                       they look just like in the picture and are a good value for the money  if you re looking for sunglasses that will last you for years and years these may not be the ones you want  but for those of us who lose a pair once or twice a year these are great      
1013,5.0,                       these classes are cute has hell and fit amazing  i m stoked i bought them      
1014,5.0,                       fantastic  the lenses are beyond good  and it comes with two glasses  one for me and one for the girlfriend at more than a friendly price     
1015,5.0,                       overjoyed without great of a deal this was  i love the style and the fact that it came with two separate styles  the unboxing experience is wonderful  beautiful packaging and included are two separate carrying sacks along with two microfiber cloths  everything is labeled with the brands name proudly displayed  fantastic      
1016,5.0,                       really like the quality of these glasses  they are the perfect balance  not too expensive that i get upset if they get lost or break  but quality enough to enjoy wearing them  will probably buy another set for when my current ones are misplaced  they have quality polarized lenses for the price point      
1017,5.0,                       i was reluctant to order sunglasses on line but these are very nice glasses  they also seem well made  comfortable on  lightweight and polarized      
1018,5.0,                       after years of buying designer sunglasses and losing them or breaking them  i was done  i needed simple wayfarers that were dark and black  these fit the bill  they are lightweight but don t feel cheap  i keep one pair in the car and the other in my bag  stop spending      plus dollars on sunglasses  these look better anyway      
1019,1.0,                    no se me entregaron estas gafas y        
1020,2.0,                       there is a substantial glare on the edges of the lenses when wearing them  it s distracting     
1021,5.0,                       they re fifteen dollar sunglasses for      a piece  definitely a must have if you lose them all the time  honestly surprised at how much i like these  get em     
1022,5.0,                       these are pretty freakin  great  they re the only cheap sunglasses i ve had where the screws didn t loosen in a month  they look good  they re cheap enough that i don t have to baby them  and they re nice and dark  actually polarized  too  i can see into the water when i go fishing with them      
1023,1.0,                       good value and looks sturdy  will update when they get a little use      
1024,5.0,                       i am an absent minded gen x r and i loose my sunglasses all the time  i found these glasses and love them so much i ordered several sets  they are high quality and fun      
1025,5.0,                       i will not lie and say i had high hopes for these glasses    pairs for under     how could it be   but let me say these are great   the three options are good quality and stylish   i have bad luck with sunglasses so this was an amazing deal  they do not look cheap and are very sturdy   i would highly recommend these as they offer   great color options for you      
1026,5.0,                       looks good     
1027,5.0,                       they are of great quality and have amazing uv protecting lenses  definitely buying again      
1028,5.0,                       my husband loves these  he got the wayfarer kind and the trendy black rim sunglasses  they are super polarized and have held up well      
1029,5.0,                       the quality of the sunglasses is very well done for the price youre paying  ive already dropped them by accident and didnt even get a single scratch  i have my ray bans and still prefer these  they are super light weight so they are comfortable to wear all day  highly recommend them      
1030,3.0,                       over all  i liked the glasses style  i had to return both pairs  too much reflection on the inside of glasses  i put them on and could literally see things behind me      
1031,5.0,                    me gust  mucho y para lo que quieras compraremos        
1032,5.0,                       these are easily the best sunglasses you can buy at this price  i was shocked how nice they were when they arrived  on top of that  the satisfaction guarantee from the seller  and the attention to providing a top quality experience with their product  blew me away  i m buying all my sunglasses from kaliyadi      
1033,5.0,                       my kids asked where i got them       
1034,4.0,                       good for price but wouldn t buy again      
1035,4.0,                       great sunglasses with good uv protection     
1036,5.0,                       really cute and good sunglasses     
1037,5.0,                       my husband uses these for work and he usually has a hard time keeping track of his glasses but so far he hasn t lost these  quality is great for the price      
1038,4.0,                       i love everything about these glasses besides   thing  the pair that have rubber nose pads fell off fairly easily  this would not be a huge issue if they did not become very uncomfortable afterwards  otherwise i do love the glasses  i would recommend getting a pair that did not need the rubber pads      
1039,4.0,                       these sunglasses are for real polarized and the plastic is very light weight      
1040,4.0,                       i like these glasses because they have a nose piece for me  i do not have a large nose bridge and need that extra piece to help hold glasses on my face  these are light weight and i do feel they could break easily  however they have not yet broken  you can t beat the price      
1041,5.0,                       pretty good quality for some inexpensive shades  the nose pieces are adjustable and seem like they will hold up to multiple adjustments  comes with one cloth carrying cleaning case and cleaning cloth  it also came with a neat polarization check card with a dolphin on it  the polarization is decent while still allowing me to use my phone      
1042,4.0,                       found these sunglasses to be a pretty good value overall   the quality was a little better than i expected for the price  i really like the looks  and the polarized lenses offer ample eye protection without being too dark   the only thing that prevents me from giving a   star rating is the fact that they are a bit too light   i would like them more if they were a little heavier  with a more substantial feel   otherwise  these are of reasonably decent quality  and are a much more affordable alternative to ray ban clubmaster sunglasses      
1043,4.0,                       these are great but very flimsy  accidentally kept in my purse and the frame cracked  but i will buy again  look great and cheaper than raybans  polarized too      
1044,5.0,                       for the price thay you pay is great      
1045,5.0,                       these are amazing  great purchase     
1046,5.0,                       like most of you  i was skeptical  two pair of really nice looking shades for under     bucks   they have to be cheap quality or uncomfortable  well  i m happy to say that i purchase these in matte black and they are outstanding  i can t believe it   they look good  they re comfortable  they actually work very well as polarized shades  i m telling you cannot go wrong with this purchase  there s a reason why these are     stars with almost       reviews  these make really awesome gifts that won t break the bank  i use these while riding my motorcycle and they fit well under my helmet  no pressure points and no pinching  i highly recommend these polarized sunglasses      
1047,5.0,                       very good for sun protection  very light weight  good value for money

1056,5.0,                       unless you re an expert on sunglasses  i don t think you can go wrong with buying these  two pairs for      if i lose one  or want to switch it up  for    each i don t even mind giving one away to a friend  buy these  they work  they look great  you won t regret it      
1057,5.0,                       ok first of all price   i bought   pack  and its like nothing for this    they are very good looking polarized and also the quality is realy good  honestly this are realy good in this price range      
1058,5.0,                       good quality  worth the money no doubt comes with its own bag and cloth for cleaning  happy with it      
1059,5.0,                       great quality for the price      
1060,5.0,                       awesome for the price      
1061,5.0,                       i really like how they are so light weight and and a value for money because the sun protection is phenomenal  i have brought sun glasses at target they were good too but expensive     dollars for one pairs and here at amazon    dollars for   heck yes      
1062,4.0,                       definitely not the best quality  but if you re looking for sunglasses to be able to throw around and not worry about  these are great  they are extremely lightweight and fit well      
1063,2.0,                       these did not fit on my face nor my wife s  these are more like children sunglasses     
1064,5.0,                       needed to replace a pair of ray ban wayfarers that got stolen out of my car   these glasses stayed in the car and used primarily for driving   after taking a hit for an expensive pair  i decided to see if a less expensive quality replacement was out there that i did not mind losing a quick online vide review search lead me to these i rwceived them yesterday and immediately noticed that they wor higher quality than your average discount  sunglasses that you would find on a rack   the frames material felt like high quality plastic  not brittle at all  the hinges were well secured and did were not squeaky and opened smoothly   the lenses seem like lenses and not cellophane  the big test came when i drove east into the sun the next morning   firstly  looking into the sun was clear with no blur from the glare that should have been there   there was no graininess that is very apparent in cheap glasses   the colora although darker  appeared accurate   they were absolutely amazing the set of glasses also came with individual bags and cleaning cloths  as well as being packaged in a sturdy box   these are excellent glassses   well made and dies the job  i highly recommend      
1065,5.0,                       i adore these shades  high quality  sturdy  good looking  these glasses are amazing  they do exactly what you need glasses to do  hide from sunlight and make you look cool lol  the polarization is a major  plus  they are worth the buy      
1066,5.0,                       great fit and quality for the price     
1067,5.0,                       good value      
1068,5.0,                       this thing is a blast  how is it so inexpensive  two polarized goggles at    bucks or something  also the feel is extremely fine  it literally seems as a close rip off of a rayban  if you are into brands then forget about it  but this right here is the android for ray ban s apple      
1069,5.0,                       cant beat   pairs for the price and quality  i bought   pair for     before purchasing these  the pair of grant foster glasses didnt even compare to the quality of these  my boyfriend loves them and now his friends want to order these as well  they all remarked on how comfortable these glasses were and refer to the maroon pair as  perfect driving glasses       
1070,1.0,                       the lenses had problem after   day of normal use  cannot see outside clear  thought it was some kind of stain  but apprantely it might just be low lense material quality      
1071,4.0,                       i actually like these sunglasses   they are the first pair ever that i have been able to wear   everything is very clear through these sunglasses and they block the glare from the sun very well  the only negative thing that i would say about these are that when looking out of my driver side window  i see rainbow colors   it can be distracting  but overall these are great sunglasses      
1072,5.0,                       sturdy and great at repelling the texas sun       
1073,5.0,                       these were so well built that it was stolen by pick pocketers hahahahahahhaha  i bought these knowing that sunglasses are one of the most stolen items off tourists  i was pleasantly surprised how well the polarization worked  it was the best but for the price  you can t go wrong     
1074,3.0,                       i really liked the all black ones  but the silver wire ones are bent and don t sit on my face straight     still loved the bags and micro fiber cloths they came with  but still upset a pair is not straight        
1075,5.0,                       great product  for me i needed coverage for the sides of my eyes also  very good quality glasses

1078,5.0,                       bought these with low expectations   just needed some sunglasses for driving  i am thoroughly impressed by the quality of these glasses and the addition of a carrying pouch and microfiber cloth  the sunglasses were packaged very carefully and arrived with zero scratches or damage  i very much like the lens quality on these glasses and the build material is also very nice        especially for the money      
1079,5.0,                       great quality  comfortable and nice      
1080,3.0,                       they fit sort of oddly  i wear cheap sunglasses and always have  but these sit kind of far off from your face in an odd way  but they are truly polarized and the clarity is super nice

1100,5.0,                       these things are absolutely amazing for the price they come in at  they are sturdy  feel good  do not look cheap  and offer great sun protection  they even come with a bag to carry it in and a lens cleaning fabric  highly recommend      
1101,5.0,                       these are awesome glasses   they easily beat similar brand names that cost    times as much   i can t imagine paying for the brand name unless you just need it to bolster your self confidence        
1102,5.0,                       nice pair of sunglasses for few dollars     
1103,5.0,                       i am soooo impressed   i bought ray bans before this which was      and these compare sooo much in looks with the club master but for way less  i m so happy with this purchase  definitely worth the money      
1104,5.0,                       i love both  they are lightweight   but not cheap
