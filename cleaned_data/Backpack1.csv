0,5.0,                       this has tons of room   i use this as my work bag  plenty of room for everything i need   it has lots of pockets to keep everything organized   well made      
1,5.0,                       this backpack is great  it has lots of storage space and it s just darm cute  i love the fact that it has side pockets inside and outside  the day i recieved it  it was raining hard  i tested it and my paper books are dry  i usually carry a medium backpack for everyday use  and with this upgrade to a large  being able to hold all my items with extra space  has been wonderful  totally recommend      
2,5.0,                       i really like this backpack  it s super cute and well made  i love the patterns  i have the pink floral one  it s big with lots of pockets for storage  it would be perfect for carrying a laptop  although i don t use it for that  the main pocket opens up really wide so it s easy to access everything inside  it would be good for traveling as it has a strap to hook it on your suitcase and it s super spacious  i mainly use it as my everyday bag for work  but i m planning on also using it when i go on trips because it s honestly such a great backpack  i love it and i d definitely recommend      
3,5.0,                       i use it for work  large to carry lots of stuff  i love the zipper closure   many compliments      
4,5.0,                       omg  i love this back pack  it has so many zippered pockets for things to hold them inside  even a place to hold my water bottle  excellent product  i ll use this for years to come   thank you so much        
5,5.0,                       literally the best backpack ever  it s very sturdy  great storage capacity  and fashionable  can fit normal purse items along with laptop and two large text books  the side pockets for water bottles easily fits my    oz bottle      
6,5.0,                       i love this backpack  i am a college student and this backpack is perfect for me needs  very protective for my laptop and ipads and the sleeve for electronic devices is slightly higher on the inside so if you sit your backpack down a bit quickly without thinking they don t hit the ground hard  a good amount of pockets and space and it even charges my phone  great great purchase i m surprised it isn t more expensive  oh and i also like that it has pockets for a waterbottle or umbrella that aren t mesh and that it has both backstraps but also purse handles if you choose to carry it that way      
7,5.0,                       i now have two of their bags and i love being able to consolidate my laptop and work items with my personal items i would carry in my purse  the bag is cute enough to not need a purse sometimes      
8,4.0,                       this backpack is the bombdotcom  my daughter just started middle school and all her stuff woukd not fit in the standard backpack so i searched for a new one and finally found this one  it is awesome and the way it opens up it cool  the only negative is it is extremely hard to close  it has to be lined up perfect in order to zip      
9,5.0,                       it s perfect for what i needed  it is huge i carried     bags to work every day  this bag took it down to    love  love  love all the pockets and organizations  the pictures don t do it justice  it s sitting beside a  gal aquarium and i could literally fit the aquarium inside this bag      
10,5.0,                       i m very pleased with my backpack  it s so roomy and perfect for work   they thought of everything that i may need   it s not only very practical but very stylish as well   i highly recommend     
11,1.0,                       save your money  after using this backpack for   months  the strap began to detach from the pack  then zipper teeth fell off the zipper which cause one zipper to fall off  then the final zipper did the same and now the backpack is no longer usable  when i contacted the seller about the strap they told me  basically   too bad  you re out of the return window  move on to a different brand   this company s backpacks will cost you twice the amount when you have to replace it      
12,5.0,                       i ordered this bag  along with others  to be used for a personal item during a multi continental  trip  i chose this one over the other options because of its space and the way it opened  it was also the cheapest of the choices  this bag exceeded my expectations and was the right choice  this bag endured   long flights  i stuffed it way beyond capacity  with enough clothes for   or days  it held up extremely well  i was able to put spare shoes in one side pocket with a water bottle in the second  i used the front pocket for toiletries  the built in charger was also an added bonuses  i did have to remove the items from the side pockets to be able to fit the bag under the seat on the plane  i loved the extra straps at the top that gave you the option of carrying it instead of wearing like a backpack  purchase this bag  you won t regret it      
13,5.0,                       so far i am loving this backpack  it has so much space  but even when it s full it doesn t bulge out and become huge wide like many other backpacks  the main reason i was backpack shopping in the first place   right now it is holding my laptop  giant calculus textbook  a notebook  a whole set of extra clothes  and various other things such as chargers and a pen bag  so useful the only negative i have to say is that i wish it didn t have the handles on top or it would be nice if they would at least lay flat  instead of sticking straight up       but that is a minor complaint        
14,5.0,                       i absolutely am obsessed with this bag   so cute and so much storage   as a busy college student in medical school and mom i knew it would be perfect for me and i was so impressed when it arrived   it rains a lot where i live so being waterproof was super important to keep my computer and electronics dry while walking through campus     stars       
15,5.0,                       great backpack     nice and roomy  it poured down raining  st day i used it and nothing in bag got wet  i was so happy  i get lots of compliments      
16,5.0,                       i work in the school system and we re virtual this year  but i still have to report to the building  my laptop was being carried back and forth in a different bag and i was running out of space and ways to organize   this bag is hands down the best purchase i have made in quite a while  i am so glad i got it  i love it  it has so much storage space and the material is very durable  the zipper is sturdy too  all around great bag  so many compliments too on the design      
17,1.0,                       when i got the bag in  i fell in love  it was so cute and great quality  or so i thought  as i have carried it the last   weeks to class  it has started to fall apart  the stitching and the straps have come undone i am very disappointed        
18,5.0,                       i ve always preferred backpacks vs  purses  i often have to travel with my laptop for work  and i hate how purse straps fall off your shoulder  this backpack is way better than i could have imagined   it s cute for work and holds a ton of stuff without looking bulky  plus it s functional for outside of work  i m a mom of   toddlers and i can easily put snacks    water bottles  wipes  etc in it for our trips to the zoo or playground  and its waterproof  just buy it now      
19,5.0,                       great bag  i travel for work and finally  a laptop bag that can hold my huge water bottle  it s perfect for my classy days of work and my i m going to be a bad ass and ride my three wheel motorcycle  spyder  into work  i got my lunch snacks in and laptop including two binders and still have space  the charging port is so useful while waiting at airports  great but i d buy      
20,5.0,                       i like this bag  i use it for work and personal  has plenty of room for various items   have not had it out in the rain so can t comment about the water resistant      
21,4.0,                       the backpack it looks like the picture  it fits my laptop  ipad  cellphone  etc  it is padded inside  so it is comfortable  one of the zippers pull tabs is broken already  so i m removing a star because of that  i m careful with my stuff  so i m not sure when that happened  the backpack easily fits a water bottle  has very nice inside and outside pockets      
22,5.0,                       this is a beautiful backpack and the room and pockets that is has is amazing  just what i needed      
23,5.0,                       this is perfect for my school bag  i am an elementary teacher and my old backpack has a big hole in it  my husband told me to look for a backpack on amazon and i researched for weeks    i finally settled on this one and i and in love   the size is perfect as it im holds my laptop  papers to grade  and my notebook  i love the charging feature and the pockets  the drink holders are perfect  i may never carry my purse to school again  love it    oh and the print is just what it shows on the site  i will update soon for durability      
24,5.0,                       this backpack is absolutely perfect   i bought it for an upcoming trip to visit family and amonly bringing a personal item onboard with me  we are flying frontier and checking a suitcase  and this backpack is perfect  it s spacious  stylish and i ve gotten many compliments on it  can t wait to travel with it      
25,5.0,                       i love this bag  i initially bought it for the laptop sleeve and charger but this bag has become a favorite of mine so quickly  i use it everyday for every occasion  sleeping out  this backpack has space  need to put away a winter coat  this backpack has space  travelling and need a personal item  space in this bag  enough pockets for all your needs  keeps things organized   and still good for daily use  would      recommend      
26,5.0,                       my    inch laptop fits perfect as well as all my other daily work essentials  plenty of pockets in the main compartment and the smaller compartment to keep things organized  i use it as a daily work bag and i ve gotten so many compliments      
27,5.0,                       as a college student often shifting from weekend activities to the school life  my backpack endures tremendous amounts of stress  however  this backpack is perfect for me because it holds up very well  its waterproof finish prevents water damage from my water bottle or sprinklers on campus and its usb port ensures that my phone will never be low on battery  its specialized pocket secures my laptop without worry  i can fit all my textbooks and am left with ample space to store anything i need  some might say that a backpack this size is too excessive and large  but its design promotes maximum capacity and function with no impractical features  i definitely recommend this backpack because it will exceed your requirements      
28,5.0,                       this backpack has such a cute design and has so much space  the bigger main compartment has pockets and zippers inside the lining for little things you don t want to get lost  and the smaller front pocket has slots to keep your credit cards and other small items  i love how it has a terminal on the outside to plug your phone in to a portable battery  i plan on taking this with me to universal studios  so the waterproof material will make it perfect if it ends up raining and will also make it easy to clean  happy with my purchase      
29,5.0,                       this is actually a really cool backpack  my    year old requested this for her backpack this year  i was a bit unsure  but it s actually really cool  the material feels like it will hold up and it has a lot of pockets  it has a pocket for a laptop and a smaller pocket for like a tablet  it can fit both of those  her binder  a math textbook  and still has more room  i also like the way the top opens like a bag  it s possible huge binders might not fit  but i bet this would work for most people        would buy again      
30,3.0,                       i really want to love this bag  it s so cute   but i m only in my second week of college and the strap is already ripped   so disappointing  i read all the reviews before i settled on this one   and when i i recieved it i was very happy   so farm  the only items i ve carried in it is my   in macbook  my small planner  a notebook  and pens and pencils   i have not carried any books yet and am a little annoyed that i will have to purchase another bag for the purpose that i intended this one to be for   it gets three stars only for space and visual appeal   but seems to be a waste of money if durability is what you want      
31,5.0,                       i d buy as a gift for someone  i had no issues at all  lots of storage room  so much that u put so much in there that it get super heavy to carry

45,5.0,                       a very roomy bag  i am not a floral girl but i absolutely love this print and so happy i went with a pretty print over a solid  i needed a wide mouth bag for my camera gear and zoo trip  easily accessible   my kids can get into the bag with no fuss or without me having to take it off to fight to open the main zipper   it feels pretty durable  straps seemed a little thin but wearing it for an hour with water bottles and shoes on a outing i didn t even know i was wearing a bag   all pockets are big enough for bottles to slid in and out while not falling out   water has been kept out  all in all its the best bag i ve purchased for what i need it for      
46,5.0,                       so i will admit  i wasn t expecting much from this bookbag but did see it was water resistant and because i walk everywhere thought eh why not give it a try  as soon i opened it i was impressed with the quality  once i unzip it and opened it up i was impressed with how spacious it was and all the pockets and areas for things  the  st time i used of course it had to rain  lightly but raining nonrheless  this kept everything nice and dry  i had laptop and tons of paperwork and not once did i feel it too heavy  the straps and nicely padded as well  i m a teacher and bought this to use as my teacher bag and it s so well worth it      
47,4.0,                       this was just what i needed to be able to carry all my supplies plus my laptop comfortably  i m not crazy about the feel of the fabric but it is waterproof which is vital  the main zipper opens up nice and wide to load the backpack and to find stuff  it has plenty of pockets and it s adorable my only gripe is the ease of zipping both the pocket  the edging gets caught  and the main compartment  can be a little cumbersome to quickly zip up   but i m happy with it overall       
48,4.0,                       super spacious  super pretty  fairly sturdy  i had to repair one of the straps because it got too heavy and i dropped caught it by the strap so the seam popped a bit  i had laptop  tablet  changes of clothes  shoes  toiletries  water bottle  flat iron  small purse    phones  cords and chargers in it at the time and had been traveling on planes for    hours that day when it popped  its very spacious but be careful with overloading the weight  or just dont let it slip and grab handle to take all that weight      
49,4.0,                       i love this bag  i got tired of using my shoulder laptop bag because i felt like my things were just thrown in there  but this keeps my laptop secure  has plenty of compartments for personal and stationary items  i m only giving it   stars because i ordered the blue bag and was delivered the black bag with red roses  my colleague loved mine so much she ordered the blue bag and will be using it as a diaper bag  this bag has various uses      
50,5.0,                       great for everything my daughter needs for the day at school  she a teacher   she able can put her lunch in it with all her other stuff     
51,5.0,                       i love this  it s great for school and travel  also it s super cute     
52,5.0,                       omg this is the best backpack i ever bought  it is beautiful  they colors are vibrant  and it feel luxurious to the touch  this bag was packaged well  i literally have   complaint  will buy again and will suggest this company      
53,5.0,                       holy moly this is a beautiful bag very big with tons of pockets and the color is very vibrant just like the pic     
54,5.0,                       seems like a good bag but i m a little irked by the sizeable tag in the front  the photos don t show that there s a tag so i expected that it wouldn t come with oneedit  the seller contacted me and corrected the problem     
55,5.0,                       so i bought this to use as a diaper bag and it is amazing  this bag is already better than the actual diaper bag i was using previously  it has a good amount of pockets for organizing your things and the main compartment is great for diapers and wipes  the material it is made of seems to be very water resistant which is great because my last bag had milk and juice spilled in it fairly frequently  i am very pleased with this bag and if you are considering buying it i would highly suggest it      
56,5.0,                       the bag is stylish and appears sturdy  the appearance is at least as attractive in person as it is in the photos  i thought it could be gaudy  but no  it s very pretty  i get loads of compliments on it  the zippers are a shiny gold  it has outside pockets that can snap shut  the carrying handles have reinforced stitching  and it has two little grommets on each of the fours straps  additionally  the inside pockets are padded and have a velcro strap for added security   the inside also has several smaller pockets including a zipper pocket  i have not used the charging port  personally  so on comment on that   it has some padding inside and several different pockets on the inside   i also like the material  it s more like a  pleather  almost a vinyl so that s great for spills  but it looks nothing like your granny s vinyl tablecloth  it appears to be fairly water proof or resistant  as for travel  it seems a little bit on the heavy side  but i am short and not too strong  so that could just be me  i first began search on land s end and other sites  but nothing really seemed at all attractive  then i looked at amazon and found this  it was way cheaper and i m really enjoying using it  i would but it again if i needed another  or as a gift amendment  i have owned it for a while and i noticed that the stitches on one shoulder strap are loosening  i keep my laptop and several books in the backpack and it is heavy   i think perhaps you should be careful about the weight  if it s too heavy to be comfortable carrying by the handles  as opposed to the back straps  it may be more than the bag was designed to hold  i still like it and i use it almost every day bonus   one of the inside padded pockets is designed perfectly  to hold a tablet ipad      
57,5.0,                       i m a nursing student and my biggest struggle was carrying my binder  coffee and backpack at the same time so i needed something that would fit my    binder in it  with the unique opening of the bag i definitely fit my binder and folders  plus it has a laptop pouch  also the pockets on the side have elastic so my tumbler and water bottles always fit  the built in pencil pouch was amazing to have also  i      recommend this bag  so much storage and very practical along with amazingly cute      
58,4.0,                       this is a beautiful and well made backpack  i took one star off because the color is quite a bit different than the picture  the flowers aren t as pastel  but more of a coral pink  but otherwise this backpack is quite sturdy and comfortable even with a heavy laptop in it      
59,5.0,                       holy cow  my whole arm can fit in here   i was planning on just using this gorgeous tropical backpack for excursions on a cruise and for my flight    but i might have to switch out my traditional school backpack for this one now    i m a masters student and have never owned a backpack this nice   pleasantly surprised that the quality over met my expectations    such a fantastic deal for the price   some times things on amazon are not what they seem when they arrive to your door  but this backpack blew it out of the park  you can tell that it is a high quality  multifunctional product just by touching it and looking through all the storage compartments  would definitely recommend using it everywhere you go  if you look to my last picture you re able to see i splashed some water on the backpack to see if it was truly water resistant  i am pleased to say it passed this test  you know how many times i ve been walking to class and end up with a soggy backpack  and scared i damaged my macbook air laptop    not worried anymore  hurry add this product to your cart today  such a great deal and a super high quality item you can t find in the store     competitors of in store brands are charging upwards of     for a low quality backpack that cannot compete with this one   i will be using this for school  travel  airplane trips  cruise excursions  beach trips  day trip  rainy day trips  etc   thank you so much         
60,5.0,                       this backpack is the best one i ve had so far  you can use it for anything  diaper bag  travel bag  or just for school  lots of storage and many pockets     i love it and i recommend to all moms     
61,5.0,                       so many compliments on this bag i have lost count  it s well worth the price  super cute  very sturdy  the zippers are strong  and i have been using it everyday since i bought it  it is definitely water resistant  love love love this bag        
62,5.0,                       love it  was delivered fast and feels so light weight even with my laptop in it  almost makes me freak out thinking i lost my laptop  haha  love the material it does not feel cheap to me      
63,3.0,                       not sturdy   my strap has torn almost all the way through in a spot that can t be fixed  would not buy again      
64,5.0,                       this was bought for school  it is huge and perfect for all the books and even the chrome that has to be carried  it has been durable and easy to keep clean  love the amount of storage it provides      
65,5.0,                       this is my first ever review   i always check reviews before ordering but rarely feel something is worth a review but this bag is worth the review   it s stylish and functional  it completely meets my needs and easily hauls a laptop  several binders and a wallet  not to mention a ton of small things in the outside pockets  i have already sent this link to two other because they want my bag lol  great product        
66,5.0,                       i have had this bag for a couple of weeks and it has easily become my favorite bag  i get lots of compliments on it  i travel a ton and am constantly doing small overnight trips  it s a perfect overnight bag or carry on   i love that there s a spot for both a computer and an ipad  i love that the bag is bigger than a typical backpack  but stronger than most bags due to the way the top opens   which makes me feel more secure about what i put in the bag  plus you can easily see and access everything as opposed to digging in more regular backpacks  it s easy to open the pockets and they even have a clasp at the top to hold the handles together which is a smart touch  while i am not a big fan of carrying an additional charging pack  i like that this bag gives you the option to do so  great bag  would definitely recommend      
67,5.0,                       i am more of a tote bag kind of girl  but i couldn t seem to find one big enough to comfortably hold all of school supplies  so i broke down and bought a backpack  this backpack is big enough to hold all of my school essentials   my macbook  a textbook  two notebooks  a   inch binder  and a nalgene bottle   with room to spare  the main compartment opens differently than traditional backpacks  making it easy to access what you need without spilling everything else out  as an added bonus it doesn t look bulky and the floral print is cute      
68,4.0,                       i came across  and eventually purchased  this backpack because i recently invested in a      inch laptop   and for those of you who don t know  a      inch laptop is huge  since i am a teacher and am working hybrid  i have to carry my laptop to and from school  my older backpacks were not cutting it  so i settled on this lovely item there are some flaws in this backpack  but the pros outweigh the cons first  the pattern is gorgeous  the colors and just as bright and bold as the picture shows next  this backpack is brimming with extra features   i never knew a backpack could have so many options  there is plenty of storage space for everything  i can t even get into the amount of pockets and nooks and crannies this backpack has   if you re obsessed with organizing your things  like  every item has a place    this backpack is for you  you can even put a charging doc in here  and charge your items discreetly from the pockets  and yes  it does fit my      inch laptop with ease  plus my smaller chromebook   but then the backpack gets really heavy  more on that later    also  i like that this backpack has handles  so   if you don t feel like wearing it on your back  you can use the handles and use it as briefcase  very clever there are two things that are worth mentioning before you decide to purchase this  one  this backpack is not made of cloth  but rather a plastic y material   i don t really mind that  however  because of this  i feel like stitching is not very durable or strong  this backpack   especially where the shoulder straps are   seems like it is not durable to last several heavy loads   which is a shame  because this would be ideal for a carry on only time will tell  i don t overload the backpack because i want it to last long  but then what s the point  i suppose this definitely is a nice purchase  as i am super happy with the space and the overall look of this backpack  i will be sure to update the review if i see that the stitching it coming apart  but so far so good      
69,5.0,                       super cute and sturdy  only complaint is that because of the way it comes packaged  it tried to fold in half if you don t have a large laptop or textbook keeping it upright  otherwise  a great purchase     
70,5.0,                       i need a backpack for my daily commute to from work to downtown chicago and i travel on the bus  i carry my laptop  lunch and gym clothes shoes  it fits but not as big as my previous backpack  a herschel  i wasn t able to test the water resistance  review below   pros   it s affordable  the print  black background with flowers  is nice as expected in person   the handle at the top are perfect for when you need to remove hold your backpack on the bus other tight spacescons   the material is plastic vinyl so you get that smell with the bag but it goes away eventually  no pads on shoulder straps  i carry a lot and go everywhere with my backpack on a daily basis  i imagine if i filled this to the brim  it wouldn t be comfortable on the shoulders while carrying it for an extended period of time  also  the material during the summer might not be ideal      
71,5.0,                       i was worried that the straps wouldn t be long enough  i am not petite    so the first thing i did was try it on   hallelujah   the straps were long enough  this will be great for traveling   spacious interior with lots of pockets for organizing all the little things   and a large main compartment for my knit crochet projects   i may look for a smaller size to use for everyday   thanks amazon      
72,1.0,                       the bag is cute and has lots of neat features but it is falling apart already and i hardly use it  it has my laptop and some cords but the zipper teeth are already falling out   and i hardly even ever zip it up  i maybe have used it     times in     months  bummed      
73,5.0,                       my granddaughter needed this   great  buy her locker is her backpack  the school she attends now does not have lockers  it will amaze you how much this bag can carry the backpack has several pockets  battery low on electronics no worries plug it in to backpack  water resistant  yes it has rained for   days  she has had no problem with water leaking inside  it can be used for travel  but for my grandaughter it s a backpack that is not on closet shelf with others thank you     
74,4.0,                       love all the compartments and sections in this bag  lots of pockets and it s bigger than i expected it to be nice floral print  love that there is access and a port for charging looks a little on the cheap side though  i think it s the fabric and finishings  i don t expect it to last for years  it seems like the zipper may break at any moment      
75,5.0,                       use this every day to commute to work   love the one opening instead of multi pockets like other backpacks  holds everything i need   have received compliments on it   great price      
76,5.0,                       i just started working as a nurse and bought this bag to carry into the hospital with me  i like that it is large enough to fit my stethoscope case  lunch  ipad  and scrub jacket but is also made of a wipeable material  it does not fit in my provided locker but i m able to fit it nicely out of the way on a shelf  i love that i can tuck the straps into the suitcase belt so they aren t dragging or hanging down on any surfaces  small lock fits nicely through the zippers if i want to secure it further  and it s nice that there are little elastic pieces on the cup pockets to place my badge when i leave  nice inner pocket available to place my small wallet for safe keeping  the bag itself isn t too heavy and the backpack straps  while not heavily padded  are comfortable enough to carry  the only thing i wish was different is i wish the velcro strap inside had a longer strip of velcro because it doesn t really meet in the right spot  is too long  otherwise  great bag      
77,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          updating my review after a month or so of use  i still absolutely adore this bag    the print is so cute and it has so many compartments for literally everything  it s spacious and is a tad heavy when you try to hold it by just the handles when it s full but once it s on your back it s perfect and feels super light weight  would definitely  it s been snowing a lot in colorado and so this bag has been a life saver carrying everything i need for class so i can focus on not slipping on ice  came to buy another one for when this one gets old and i m super sad my cute print is no longer available but the options i love as well      
78,5.0,                       i was looking for a sturdy backpack to use for work  it holds so much stuff and doesn t look bulky  it carries everything so nicely  it has so many compartments that you can organize everything and not have to worry  it s a perfect backpack and the print is so cute  highly recommend      
79,3.0,                       i only gave this   stars because it s cute but not the color as shown  its more of a  vintage  color look  the tan color is more prominent than the black  i was hoping for the dark colors     
80,5.0,                       i love this bag    my niece got one for school and i had to have one as a diaper bag   i can fit so much stuff inside it and the rfid charging are handy extras     
81,5.0,                       love this backpack  super cute and use it as my nursing bag  can wipe it off with a bleach wipe and not take the germs home with me      
82,5.0,                       this review is for the blue flowered backpack  which i absolutely love   it was well packed and delivered very quickly   the backpack itself is so pretty  sturdy  good quality  and i am so pleased with it that i wish i could give it more than   stars   it would make a great gift for a student to haul around books and school supplies  or as a carry on bag while traveling   it comes in various colors  so it would work for men too   the fabric is waterproof  and a bonus for me is that the lining is a light color  which makes it easy to search for things inside   the zippers are gold  shiny metal and make the backpack look classy   i definitely recommend this backpack and would buy it again      
83,5.0,                       love my backpack i have receive many compliments i use it as my work backpack and fit my laptop perfectly i m happy with my purchase      
84,5.0,                       i bought this backpack for work as well as for a carry on  i love that it has multiple pockets inside as well as outside for various things on top of having a large compartment for larger items  i can fit my books  lunch box  water bottle  coffee mug  change of clothes  make up bag  and an umbrella all in the backpack with room to spare  it also comes with the capability to charge your phone if you have a power bank  love it for traveling      
85,4.0,                       i really enjoy this backpack   i love the design and totally see how it is used for traveling or a bigger purse  i use it for college and love how big it is compared to other backpacks that i have had  it fits a full size laptop in the laptop slot  but the downside is that you cannot fit a laptop case around it so i am always worried about my laptop getting broke  it has room for the phone charger on the size which is super helpful as a college student and can fit all my notebooks and folders and pens etc inside the main pocket  the smaller front pocket is very roomy too  if you are looking for a backpack with space that is pretty  this is for you      
86,5.0,                       just arrived today  but so far i m impressed   it s a thick vinyl  doesn t seem cheap  so much storage  and the colors are so vibrant   i hope this lasts me a long while   for reference i m           
87,5.0,                       this bag is very roomy  it holds my laptop  notebook  purse  and lunch  my favorite part is how the top of the bag opens like a pocketbook  so it makes it easier to put thing in  and it holds its shape  there are several pockets on the inside which is great  so everything doesn t just fall to the bottom of the bag  i use this everyday to carry things to work   it is much easier for me to use a backpack than one of those messenger bags  and  i love the floral pattern  the price is awesome      
88,5.0,                       i am so happy with this purchase  the bag is beautiful  well made  and sturdy  it has plenty of pockets and storage capacity  i like that there is easy access to the charging port  and the band to attach it to luggage perfect for my office and travel needs      
89,5.0,                       great bag    tons of room   would definitely buy again      
90,1.0,                       i love a good floral print backpack but the zipper is not the best quality  it was so cheap that i contemplated keeping it but then i decided to return  what is the point of a backpack with a zipper that didn t work   last thing i needed was more clutter in my closet      
91,5.0,                       has alot of storage compartments  loved how  light it weights  was perfect for my trip to cancun  they sprayed our bags and of course did not affect this one because it s waterproof      
92,5.0,                       i bought one of these for my new job in the black with roses and my grown daughters loved it so much i bought one for each of them for valentines  i like that i can fit a lap top computer or i pad with my work planner and a few note books  i can also fit a few  make up  type bags inside tucked neatly to one side  i use one side for my medicine and one for make up  i really like the organization in the front pocket as well  i have room there for large cell phone  full size wallet  keys  pens  etc  plus it s   rfid   sage  i absolutely love this thing  i took it with me to get my hair done so i could work while my color processed and now my hair dresser is getting one for herself too  well made  beautiful colors  zippers are  sturdy  great product      
93,5.0,                       i was so excited to get this backpack  i have been looking for one that is sturdy and is more like a bag rather than a traditional backpack  this was a great choice for what i wanted  the quality seems sturdy and strong  the bag has great space and i love the water bottle holders on both sides of the bag  i am eager to see how it handles travel later in the year when i travel more frequently  i am excited to use this bag and hopefully it will last me for years  the price seems worth it so far      
94,5.0,                       i was very pleasantly surprised with this back pack  my daughter needed something asap and my budget was limited so i wasn t expecting great quality for         i was shocked when it came  its sturdy  its weather resistant  it holds a ton of stuff  and she was really excited with the design  she s in middle school so she was happy to have something unique and cool  she can fit her full sized ipad  about   composition notebooks  a pencil pouch  a midsized make up bag  an umbrella  a water bottle and her hoodie all in the main compartment  there is a front compartment and the side pockets for a water bottle that she doesn t use  but its nice that she still has space to expand into if she needs those extra compartments   i highly recommend this bag for middle school aged kids and up  i would even reccomend it for travel as it really does carry a surprising amount of stuff  the only thing i don t like about it and she finds a tad frustrating at times is that zipping unzipping the main compartment is a little awkward  i think because the sides of the top opening bend at the ends  theres like a flexible strip of metal or something in the seams and it doesn t always want to close easily  even still  that s not a huge deal  just slightly annoying sometimes but totally worth it considering the quality of the bag  it looks like it would cost        minimum if you bought it at a department store      
95,4.0,                       too big for everyday unless it s used as a diaper bag  great for traveling      
96,5.0,                       just received my bag and i absolutely love it  the design as well as function of the bag is amazing  it s lightweight and it has straps to put on my luggage  i m going to use it at an upcoming disneyworld trip  best of all it has a charging port on the bag so i can charge my devices  it has a side pockets on both sides with a button for my water bottle and my macbook fits perfectly inside   perfect mommy bag as well      
97,5.0,                       love this bag  am a preschool teacher and it meets the needs of all i have to use  nice print also      
98,5.0,                       this bag is fabulous to start off  i use it daily and has yet to show any wear at all  even with the weather it s gone threw   the backpack part is great as i walk alot during the day and makes it easier to carry my laptop and other items from place to place without anyone know what is inside      
99,3.0,                       i love this bag in general  what i don t love is how it was shipped to me  it was folded up in a box  so  now it has a permanent crease in the middle of the bag  it won t stay standing up or open  multiple times i have walked in to see it had fallen off my desk and my ipad laying on the ground  luckily not shattered      
100,5.0,                       recently flew to n c  this awesome backpack replaced the need for a purse  i was able to fit my medicine in one compartment  hair and makeup things in another compartment  a sweater  my walking shoes and my laptop and charger  and btw the outer port  to enable me to recharge my electronics is the main reason i bought it    it was raining  but this wonder backpack repelled the water  the strap on the back allowed me the ease of sliding it securely on the handle of my rolling suitcase  this back pack was full to the brim  yet easily fit under the airplane seat in front of me  i bought another one for my daughter and granddaughter  this is bar far the best backpack i ve ever owned  stylish  functional  and extra plus features      
101,5.0,                       i absolutely love this backpack  they way it stands up  the way it feel durable  and most of all  the amount of space    its is the best backpack i have ever owned

103,5.0,                       i just received my bag today and i couldn t get over how adorable it was and how much space was inside  i was completely blown away  material on the outside is good and thick  can be wiped down with no problem at all  i can t wait to use it on my trip next weekend   i would absolutely buy another  maybe i will soon      
104,5.0,                       love it   this bag makes it so easy to stay organized  it s very sturdy and i tested it in the rain today and the water slides right off  it s super comfortable to wear  great investment       
105,5.0,                       just got the backpack today and i m already loving it  it came just in time since i have a business trip which requires me to carry both my laptop and ipad  as i was leaving it started to rain outside and as soon as i got to airport security i thought the backpack was wet but no it is still dry in the inside  this was definitely a smart buy for me      
106,5.0,                       it did come out a little bigger than expected but hey  bigger is better right  i think this would definitely be perfect for a hiking trip since it s got a lot of room  which is a plus because my family loves hiking  the backpack is cute as heck  and the little charging port is awesome  because for one  my husband loves to shove his portable charger into my usualy little backpack i have with me and crushes my stuff under it      
107,5.0,                       this backpack is amazing  i m a teacher and i bought this for one of my co workers  we couldn t believe the quality and how perfect it was to fit our laptops  lunch box  water bottle and extra papers  i loved it so much i ordered one for myself     i wish it came in even more floral designs because it s beautiful      
108,3.0,                       i love the pattern and the wide mouth opening  it makes it much easier to grab my things out   i use this for a work bag and i only just got it the other day but so far i am glad i ordered   update             the strap that holds the   handles on top broke  the magnet cracked and fell apart  i will still use but kind of sucks      
109,5.0,                       i am a frontline worker and i ll be using this bag for work  so far the stability and texture feel like it may hold up to the demands of a nurse      
110,5.0,                       i am very pleased with my purchase  it is a great looking backpack  and has a sturdy design  it has plenty of room for everything you could possibly want to carry  although it may get a little heavy if you carry too much  but i love it  and used it the very first day i received it i really like the way it opens on the top  it has a purse feel  but also a convenient backpack style to it  i know i will get plenty of use out of it      
111,5.0,                          ounce bubba water bottle in one pocket   ounce contiguous coffee tumbler in the other   inch hp laptop  size guess charge cord   in aoc usb powered monitorconnector usb cord  notebooksdeodorant  headphones walletverdict  it fits a lot of stuff i am pretty happy with the overall style and build it looks cute but professionalthe portable monitor is a little tall for it  i have to push it down a bit to zip overall  very happy so far with the bag      
112,5.0,                       i just received this backpack and i love it   i am in a position where is need to carry my office with me everywhere i go and this backpack makes that possible   it is roomy enough to carry my laptop  lunch bag and all essentials i need for the day   one of the things i love most about this product is the deep side pockets  they securely hold my water and coffee with out worry about them falling out  which is the downside to many other bags    being a professional i would love if this bag came in solid colors      
113,5.0,                       amazing bag  i thought it had plenty of room from pictures but in person its even more roomy to fit sooo much  i have been using it as a tablet bag purse and diaper bag all in one  makes it much easier to carry everything in one bag and not having to cart around multiple bags for everything  i would highly recommend this bag  i ve already had to tell some mommy friends where to get one and that no it s not a typical diaper bag as it s a laptop bag but its handier than some of the very expensive diaper bags that some clueless childless person designs      
114,5.0,                       i can t say enough good things about this backpack  i carry too much to fit comfortably in a purse  but i didn t want a plain school backpack looking backpack  the appearance is very pretty  nice pattern  bold colors  sparkly gold details makes this look like a much more expensive backpack  it has lots of storage  the outer pockets have a strong magnet closure  the front pocket has a zipper pouch and some other storage pockets  and holds more than i expected  the main compartment is awesome     pockets  zipper pouch  and   separate spaces to place laptop books etc  it s huge on the inside  can hold quite a bit  i like the hand straps  and while i wish the back straps were a little more padded  it s still quite comfy for the amount of stuff i carry in it  it has held up well so far  no fraying or issues with zippers  the material keeps it from getting dirty  i ve recommended to friends and family      
115,5.0,                       this backpack is so cute and functional     i got it for my daughter for college and she loves how much storage capacity it has  she also loves that it is waterproof for those rainy snowy days      
116,5.0,                       i bought this for my daughter to use for school  she s required to use a  inc binder and carry her chrome book laptop etc this year and needed something with more room  this bag is amazing  so easy to put items in and retrieve them  the open top vs a zipper the extends down each side makes all the difference  tons of little pockets inside for organizing and the quality of the construction is amazing  this bag is going to last a long time and it s waterproof material is not that this crap you normally see that tears easy  plus it s super cute  best bag ever hands down      
117,5.0,                       i love this backpack   i saw a co worker with one and admired it   she showed me how it has a wide opening and all of the space and pockets within   i just got mine and it keeps everything so organized for me   i travel daily as a counselor to different schools and it works great      
118,5.0,                       happily surprised with this backpack  first  i love the print and the fact that s it s weatherproof  it s sturdy and lightweight and has so much room for stuff    i love the way the top opens up   it s like a clam shell closure and stays open and gives you easy access to all of your things pockets   so many pockets inside and out  my stanley thermos fits very nicely in an inside pocket  the   outside side pockets have elastic straps attached to hold your stuff securely  very nice there are   padded pockets inside for laptop or ipad or whatever you want to store safely the inside material seems thin but a quality that i think it will still hold up i am going to love this back pack  i can tell already i was reimbursed for this product after leaving my review that being said   my review is honest   i do love this bag  do not let the  free product  reviews steer you away      
119,5.0,                       this bag is truly awesome  i am able to put my lap top that is      my books and my personal items  i put this bag on my back and i don t feel its heavy at all  the cushion that it has on the back side really helps i totally recommend it      
120,5.0,                       i absolutely love this bag backpack  i have needed a bag for work for atleast   yrs but couldn t find   i liked  they are all made for laptops or little kids  i don t have either  even though this bag has spot for laptop it can be used so many more ways  i carry a lot of h o with me to work and this backpack is wonderful  love the way it opens up  love all the different pockets   compartments  wasn t sure i would like the pattern   colors  but i really like it too  if i could recommend anything it would be to have more color   pattern options  but other than that    so far so good         
121,5.0,                       where do i start  well all my co workers are jealous now  because i can pretty much bring my life in there    i work in hr and i sometimes have to work at home  laptop  charger  paperwork  my big ole coffee flask  the dark blue bottle in the pic  my makeup bag  even a huge eyeshadow pallet  ladies   i almost feel like i am traveling every day   i work    min away  in another county  and it helps because i have to bring breakfast and lunch some days  i also go to job fairs as an employer  and i bring all the applications in there  stacked neatly  the side pockets are so wide  i can put a shaker bottle in it  the fat ones  and the charger thing  works great  if you remember to charge your power bank   all in all  i am using it for alot of things  it is comfortable to carry  and it is definitely waterproof   its snowed and rained on me  and all my things stay dry  i dont stress about putting it on the floor  cause i just wipe it off clean  i swear its the best thing since sliced bread   to me the front zipper area has alot of space to put pencils pens  sticky notes  and even a stapler  at that job fair  it s been great  i haven t traveled  but i travel far daily for work  so it is pretty much my daily luggage   good for keeping your meds and menstrual pads tucked away i hope y all enjoy my review  i wish i could say more      
122,2.0,                       all of the storage and the look of this backpack is good but one of the main features i was looking for was for it to have a cell phone charging function  it is supposed to but mine came without the hardware inside the port on the outside of the backpack  i just now needed to use it and discovered the defect   and my return window closed two days ago      
123,5.0,                       i was so tired of carrying around a purse over my shoulder when i was in the airport  i did it for so long because i couldn t find a bag or purse that was stylish and would fit everything i needed into it  finally i found it  this bag is stylish  spacious  water resistant  and has plenty of storage and pockets to keep everything organized and secure  one of the best parts of this bag is the luggage loop on the back so i can securely slide it onto my carry on bag at the airport  it s fantastic  stop searching for backpack purses and just buy this one already  best bag at the best price      
124,5.0,                       what i liked about the backpack is its very study  very easy to adjust the straps and comfortable to war  it also has a ton of  pockets that are nice and deep  the backpack has several pockets in the front pocket and a lot of pockets in the inside portion  also the laptop pocket is nicely padded and provides good protection for your laptop  what i liked about the laptop pocket is how well it fits my laptop as it fits my    inch laptop very well  what i did not like about the backpack is the usb cable on the front  i just wish it was on the inside not the outside of the backpack just because i don t like my phone exposed to weather  other than that i would recommend this backpack to anyone  overall though this is an awesome product and i highly recommend it to anyone      
125,5.0,                       i bought this bag to carry my laptop to and from work  it has so much room  i can fit everything in it plus some  i ve gotten so many compliments from my coworkers and some have already bought one for themselves  highly recommend      
126,5.0,                       love this back pack  very very spacious and comfortable      
127,5.0,                       i decided to get my girls some portable dvd players    but i wanted them to be able to keep them safe as well as keep all the accessories together  this bag is more than large enough    it s actually a little larger in person than i realized  the design is super cute  also seems to be very well made  the girls are going to love it      
128,5.0,                       i bought this and i love this bag  very easy to carry and exactly as expected  company is very good  answers all questions and very helpful      
129,5.0,                       keeps my chromebook dry  keeps water bottle cool due to insulation  it s just the right size for my needs      
130,4.0,                       the storage capacity is really good it fits my macbook in it and other things i have such as books  my macbook accessories  and other school supplies  but the picture design on amazon is way different than the one in person  in person it seemed slightly off colored and built different than the one on the picture  other than that its amazing its nice just a little different  it s as if someone you see on tinder looking extremely attractive but when you meet them in person they re still attractive but they look slightly different than they do in their picture      
131,5.0,                       i think this is a great backpack for carrying a good amount of items  i have my important items in it and still have a lot of space for more  i love the idea of carrying a power station in it  can t wait to use that feature  very waterproof because it is made out of waterproof material  i was hoping for fabric  but this will be great      
132,5.0,                       this backpack is cute  water resistant  large storage compartment and has a padded section to protect your laptop  i am excited to start using this for work and am very impressed  seems well made and do hope it will hold up well      
133,5.0,                       the bag is bigger then what i thought which is ok  i plan to use this as my personal item bag on   upcoming flights  the charger works and it has a lot of compartments for storing items   the luggage strap is handy as well  the only thing i will warn is this bag stinks and will need to be aired out before using  i will update once i travel with it      
134,5.0,                       lots of pockets  seems durable but just got it so time will tell  my teenager loves it       
135,5.0,                       first off  this is the first backpack that i ve enjoyed looking at and carrying   very durable  with plenty of pockets   i had no issues at the airport and it was great to connect my portable charger directly to my bag   no searching for an outlet   i also received lots of compliments  thanks for a great backpack      
136,5.0,                       i was pleasantly surprised with the quality and size of this backpack   great features for the price   backpack is very roomy   plenty of space for your laptop  charging cables  other electronics  drink  files  etc   could also easily be used to carry a change of clothes and other items needed for an overnight stay somewhere   highly recommend      
137,5.0,                       this is the ultimate teacher bag at a great price   it doesn t feel flimsy at all   i keep it packed to the gills and it still looks like new   nothing has gotten wet even with some showers i have walked through   i do wish the zipper was a little more smooth on the track  but it is super strong so it doesn t bother me much   my whole team bought these      
138,5.0,                       so  i ordered this bag to add to my travel collection  i absolutely love the versatility of this bag and the fact that you can sit this bag on your suitcase and have it secure so that it will not fall off  the bag as an rfid pocket to keep your credit and debit cards safe from hackers  the bag as two places on the outside for a water bottle or umbrellas and two places on the inside of the bag for the same items  the feature on the outside of the bag that allows you to charge your devices was a bonus  i would recommend this bag for travel      
139,5.0,                       this bag is amazing  it is perfect for business trips  cute and stylish too  easy to handle  or strap on  very roomy too      
140,5.0,                       i purchased this to use as a backpack purse   the description was very accurate  i loved the print and large main pocket  although  the description did indicate the dimensions  i realized after receiving it that it was ust too large to use as a purse   even though i love large purses  if the material had been a softer more broken in material i probably would not have returned it   it would work great as a travel bag  i would highly recommend this for travel or a student  but not a purse      
141,5.0,                       i bought this for a hospital stay  lots of room  lots of pockets  love it     
142,5.0,                       this bag is great  it s the perfect size for traveling  not to mention the space  there s a lot of pockets and storage  and when you re not using it  you can fold it in half to store    i d recommend this as a traveling or school bag due to it s size      
143,5.0,                       absolutely love this bag  bought it because i needed a new backpack as my first work backpack after graduation but also wanted something that would look nice professional backpack for  laptop and travel from the appearance  it is like a diaper bag but its internal structure is different  it is a excellent laptop  travel  work backpack  it suits all my needs even if i carry lots of documents a power bank  a notepad  my    inch laptop  snacks lunch  some name cards and pens all of my items fit in this bag at once  i use it everyday to carry my stuff to work i ve been using it for almost a month now it serves it s purpose well  i do worry that the amount of items i carry would put stress on the stitching  but i haven t encountered any problems as of yet i was satisfied that the  laptop pocket  was padded because part of my reasoning for buying this bag was so i could have a separate space for my laptop so it wouldn t be damaged  i now use the zipper pocket to protect  my important documents or other items from being lost  and i love the diaper bag opening  no more digging blindly to find something i also used it for travel since it has a lots of space make it easy to carry clothes  my needed toiletries  snacks  my computer and all my other travel items if there is any improvement that i could suggest to the company for this backpack  it would be an addition of a smaller zipped pocket on the shoulder straps of this bag as it is very helpful to carry boarding pass  itinerary  public transport cards etc  rather than opening the front pocket which is not always very accessible when you travel on buses trains regularly      
144,5.0,                       this is a great bag for storage  it s also durable and very cute  but it does hurt my lower back because it pushes the weight of the pack into it      
145,5.0,                       i love this bag  the versatility is great  i can wear as a backpack or tote with the handles  the design is cute and stylish  i am using it as a work bag  because for whatever reason nurses love totes and carry a lot of things  it is very spacious with several compartments   i highly recommend this back pack      
146,5.0,                       update        was sent a new one  and i didn t even have to ask  amazing customer service  the new one was absolutely perfect  no upside down pockets would have given   stars if it wasn t for the fact that the pockets on the inside of the front pocket weren t sewn in upside down  the mini pockets are super helpful for smaller things but they re completely useless now      
147,5.0,                          i bought this backpack to fit my large laptop that is very heavy  it fits perfectly    love the fabric and the easy top opening as well as the waterproof fabric   i ride the train to work so the waterproof aspect will keep my electronics dry    fast  fast  fast delivery  i received it in   days and was amazed at how fast i received the backpack i ll definitely share with friends and co workers      
148,5.0,                       love everything about this backpack    plenty of inside space with padded   divided pockets plus lots of exterior pockets   purchased for airplane carry on as well as daily use while on vacation  tablet  notebook  itinerary  small toiletries bag  travel rain jacket  hat  water bottle  small purse  sunglasses case  magazine  phone  cables   powerbank and room for more  has rfid pocket  usb port   luggage strap  all   features other bags didn t that i looked at  beautiful design   great quality material  strong zippers   love the   reinforced handles on top when i want to carry it  it sits nice on my back   straps are wide but lightly padded so it doesn t feel bulky like some with thick padding  did not dig into my shoulders  i will be using it beyond travel once i return for day trips too  don t hesitate on this one      
149,5.0,                       this bag is so big and spacious  i m a nursing student and a nursing mom so i needed to find a bag that fit all my school and clinical things as well as my cooler for my milk and pumping parts and this bag is amazing for that  there s a spot for everything and it all fits perfect  i also live in florida so on rainy days my things aren t getting all wet and i ve been recommending this bag to all my classmates and already sold a few on it  would definitely buy again      
150,5.0,                       love it  love the hydrangea print   love the fact that it is made of water resistant material  the wide opening at the top makes it so easy to pack  luggage strap to go over handle of carry on or suitcase makes so much sense  i  bought a high end back pack with those features but it was way over my budget so i returned it   then i saw this item with the same features so i went for it and boy am i glad  enjoy yours      
151,5.0,                       this bag is amazing  i got the floral one and the pattern is super cute  the bag looks exactly like the product photo  i was not disappointed at all  i love the different compartments inside the bag  and i love the fact that the laptop compartment is padded  i didn t know if the laptop compartment would be able to fit my bulky laptop but it surprisingly fit with zero issues  i love this bag      
152,5.0,                       i have to carry my laptop form work home every night and i love the room you get with this bag as well as how cute it is  i will soon be buying another one for my at home use  for everyday outings      
153,5.0,                       got this for my daughter for college  she wanted a pretty backpack  that was floral but also could act as a purse  this bag is that and more  it s gorgeous  it opens at the top to allow for a laptop  straps are comfortable  has a very durable feel  and also very pretty  great customer service too      
154,5.0,                       i love love love my backpack  i use ur for work and i have gotten so many compliments on this bag  many great components for storage  and also a usb inside which is always a plus      
155,1.0,                       returned immediately   was a very plastic feeling   not a fabric      
156,5.0,                       awesome backpack  the storage was great  i took it on my flight and it was compact enough not to be too much in the way  the compartments were perfect  also  it looks nice too  really happy with it and my sister wants one now as well      
157,5.0,                       love how much room there is  holds my laptop safely as well as all the necessary cables and accessories  and there is still room for books and personal items     
158,5.0,                       i got this back pack for a disney world trip with kids  it was perfect for the plane ride and kept all our entertainment in it plus diapers and wipes  it was perfect for walking around disney world very comfortable  it s huge on the inside  looks of pockets and storage options  great for traveling      
159,5.0,                       i work in a school and purchased this as a more grown up looking way to carry my laptop and supplies around   i think it s beautiful  and i get lots of compliments on it every day   i would recommend it to anyone who likes the aesthetic  as it seems to be very well made      
160,5.0,                       so i ordered this for my new laptop to do away with carrying around a sleeve  and this thing definitely delivers  pockets  pockets  pockets    i love the diaper bag style opening as well  now i just need to get a power bank to test out those capabilities  but so far  i m really loving this bag  the material inside does seem a little thin  but luckily growing up around a commercial fabric salesman it s actually not a bad fabric and should hold up  that s the only thing i found wrong  i love this bag though      
161,5.0,                       love this back pack  i honestly thought seams would rip and a strap would break   neither happened  this bag held my     laptop  kindle fire    power cord for laptop    months of   medications  a mouse  a full wallet  a charging pack  and canon  d body   on a trip from georgia to houston       
162,5.0,                       one of the best backpack i had  because i travel for work it fits perfectly with my business note pad  ipad  water bottle  and many more can t say enough  it was worth my money and you will be glad you bought the bag  perfect for traveling and hiking if u like like me  love love it      
163,5.0,                       this purchase made me very happy  exceeded all expectations  the size  the colors and most important the sturdiness  it s even water proof so the days it rain i won t have to worry about my things getting wet  my lab top fits perfectly in the slot  this has become my favorite bag for work  more room than i imagined and i can fit all my items needed plus more  the straps  are wide and sturdy which supports easy varying and  weighing on shoulders  the weight of the bag still feels lite with all my items in it   i have already referred this purchase to a friend and she has also ordered her one in a different color      
164,5.0,                       the stitching looks very good  the zipper hardware is fine  smooth  and sturdy  i have not tried out the durability of the  coated   waterproof material  it is very spacious with compartments galore  so one should have enough pockets for everything  the lining does not be the most fine   but it seems adequate  there are little gussets that allow a little more space for your ipad or flat objects  the magnetic snap closures are a nice detail as well as the elastic on the side pockets to secure the drinks  the usb charging port and the inner side pockets are added perks  this is a large capacity bag  so one might not want to overload it  the only thing  i would have added would be a back anti theft pocket to put one s phone or passport  the front pocket does have a lot more organization than other bags  but i still look for a back pocket  most importantly  it has its own unique look  normally i would not have picked up a floral bag      
165,4.0,                       i love this bag  this has made me a backpack person  i ordered it for a weekend vacation to and then the pandemic hit the us and my weekend became a week long drive when we flew it was so convenient as a personal  item bag  all the important things were able to stay with me and i could easily over pack and still find what i needed when we decided to make it back home by any means necessary it was an amazing survival backpack all that being said i m not sure if i have over worked it or have a bit of a dud  after walking   blocks with a laptop and   vintage vinyl records i noticed that the shoulder strap had ripped half way right where it is sewn into the bag it hasn t ripped anymore and has been used regularly since march      
166,5.0,                       i ve had my bag for a week now  i love it  it fits everything i carry on a daily basis plus i have plenty of room for extras  i ve even been able to put my lunch bad in it without any issues  the inside and outside elasticized pockets are great for holding water bottles and travel mugs as well as an umbrella  i can even see myself being able to throw a pair of ballet flats into one of the inside pockets during the winter for work  i did notice that one or two other reviews mentioned that their backpacks arrived folded in a storage bag which they felt compromised the integrity of the padding  however  my bag arrived the same way and when i took it out of the bag  i immediately took my laptop and put it in the backpack for a couple of hours  i haven t had any issues with the backpack tipping over  there is a thin hard board that sits on the bottom of the bag which helps with stability  this is folded up when you get it so i took some of my everyday items and sat them in the bottom of the bag to train it down  i believe this has also helped with the stability of the bag  i haven t seen any signs of issues with the straps but it s only been a week  i ll try to update my review if there is any issues  otherwise  i ve had so many compliments on my bag  it s probably the one bag i can see lasting me for a long time      
167,4.0,                       only lasted four months until the zipper broke   and too late to return then they sent me a new one for free   thank you thats great customer service      
168,5.0,                       i needed a laptop bag that i could travel with  since every backpack i had was way too small  this backpack is perfect  it has plenty of room for your laptop  a couple small notebooks or a tablet or something  and everything you need to go with them like chargers pens etc it s comfortable to carry  and so far seems pretty durable    it s also perfect for a weekend trip along with a laptop  it s padded in the back   there s plenty of pockets  the side pockets fit the   oz hydroflask perfect  for reference  with some give to them all in all a  backpack      
169,5.0,                       much bigger than i expected  it can hold my laptop  binder  several notebooks  and my photography camera  it also has several pockets and the colors are bright and pretty  not sure on durability yet  will update at a later date      
170,5.0,                       very roomy and nice material  a little bigger than what i was expecting but i m fine with that      
171,5.0,                       my old backpack broke and so until i found one i liked i was forced to carry a small one around that is not suitable for college  luckily i saw this one and it is huge   there are tons of pockets and it s super big  plus it has great support for my back  if you re a college student and need one i recommend this one      
172,5.0,                       i got this for an upcoming work trip as i was very tired of my shoulder hurting with the company issued laptop bag  this bag is very spacious and my laptop fits without any issues  i also have a   year old and     year old and i m likely going to start using this as our diaper bag too  very well constructed      
173,5.0,                       i bought it for storage of my laptop it fits perfectly by my bedside love them space the bag has   then charge port is a added plus the only drawbacks for me is kinda bully on my back so i wear mine on one shoulder  otherwise i will purchase from this sellers again because they put the backpacks on sale i got mine for       love it      
174,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          um  wow  this backpack is amazing  first impression was  sweet  it s pretty  then i wanted to know its functionality  i had another backpack but it was ugly  functional  but ugly  for work i am constantly in and out of the courtroom and i like to present professionally with some class and sass  but i need a well structured bag that can handle the weight of what i have to carry around in it  and organization is a must  this bag does it all beautifulwell made w strong materialwater resistantcarry in hands or as a backpackallows for great organization      
175,5.0,                       this product is exactly what they say it is  if you in college its the perfect backpack  it has so many compartments in it makes organizing so much more easier and less cluttered  you might think its too small in the pictures but its the right size to fit     textbooks  a laptop  and a couple spirals  and the way the zipper is  it makes the bag less bulky looking on your back  the zipper is also straight so it makes putting things in and taking things out so much easier  i got the rose pattern one and its just so pretty  the pictures online do not do it justice  the water bottle holder is nice and big  its stretchy enough to put not just a water bottle but other things in the pocket as well  and it is waterproof they do have a nice seal on the backpack to prevent water from soaking in  they do have the usb charge port that makes life so much easier when traveling and in public as well can but secured onto you travel size bag as well  the quality is just so nice  its well worth the price and buy       
176,5.0,                       i recently started a new job and needed a laptop bag with a lot of space and pockets  this one was perfect for me  it protects all of my belongings and it s very efficient  once i have all my things in it for travel  it does weigh a little bit  but of course it does because i have so much in there  despite the weight  it s still comfortable around my shoulders and doesn t strain my back  i really love the strap on the back so i can put it over my carry on bags  that helps tremendously   overall  i love this bag and i ve had it for about four months now and no regrets  i have dropped it a couple of times  still good as new      
177,5.0,                       i like the look of the bag and size  it is very pretty   i love it     
178,4.0,                       while this bag is very pretty and durable  it was a little larger than i anticipated  but that is a personal taste  many people prefer lots of room for storage which this has  it claims to be a laptop backpack  but the padding inside is actually very thin for safety of a laptop  it does have many features such as the water bottle holders  small pouch in the front lots of interior space and of course the usb cable in the backpack itself  overall decent quality excellent for the price      
179,5.0,                       i loooove this backpack  it s cute  comfy and has a lot of room in it  it also has several compartments inside so you can easily organize your stuff  i get compliments all the time and it truly is water proof  looks great  works great  prob will buy another  looks exactly like pictures      
180,3.0,                       i really like this backpack but i do have one complaint  i debated about keeping this or returning it based on this one complaint  it s super heavy  even before you put anything in it  outrageously heavy  so  since it s basically the cutest backpack in the world and it holds a ton and i love all of the pockets  i ll keep it  i will only be using it on days i walk straight from the car to class and back  i d never take this traveling or try to carry it all day      
181,5.0,                       i am a college student and needed a new bag  this is perfect  it has secure safe compartment for my laptop which was a must for me  i also really like how it is designed to stay upright when sitting on the floor or any other surface  a lot of book bags tend to lean to the front or back when sitting upright  i also got a lot of compliments on this bag i highly recommend       
182,5.0,                       really amazing product  has a lot of room and i m excited to take it on my next business trip  love the pattern and all the compartments so things don t get lost while traveling  the only thing was the zipper was snagging a bit so it was a little hard to zip open and closed  but would but again      
183,4.0,                       i use this bag for my college classes and it s perfect for me since i commute  there s enough room for my books and notebooks  snacks and drinks and i love the laptop sleeve  my bag has taken some spills but no damage has ever happened to my laptop  i will say they may not be the sturdiest quality  my first bag started tearing at the seam of the strap so i returned it for a new one which was a quick and easy process  but on the replacement one of the zippers came off and i had to snap it back  overall it s a good purchase  but it s not superior quality so maybe expect a snafu here or there     
184,5.0,                       i am obsessed with this backpack  as a teacher i ve tried out many different bags over    years  i no longer have to worry about my bag slipping of my shoulder  the two side pockets are perfect for my water and tea that i bring to school everyday  the inside compartment is spacious  and so is the front pocket as well  it has enough room for my laptop and books that i need to carry back and forth to school      
185,5.0,                       as a college student i need a bag that is big enough to carry my binder and laptop too and also some other books and notebooks  i love the bag design      
186,5.0,                       wow i was very impressed with this backpack  i bought it for my daughter to travel with and it s beautiful and well made  i love that it opens wide on top and the interior is lined      
187,4.0,                       i love everything about this backpack except how heavy it is  i put my ipad  planner  a couple books  and a water in it and it seems so heavy  i love all the pockets inside and how it opens from the top  good backpack for traveling with all the storage and keeping everything organized      
188,5.0,                       i ve been searching for the perfect travel bag and this is it   it s not too small or too large  i recently went away for a girls weekend trip and this bag exceeded my expectations  i was able to store my ipad  snacks  wallets  itinerary and still had so much space for other items  the inside pocket fits my   oz water bottle with ease  on our return trip home we got caught in the rain but nothing inside my bag got wet if you are considering this bag  my only question would be what are you waiting for   trust me  you won t be disappointed      
189,3.0,                       i like the color and size i don t like that it was folded in half and stuffed in a zip lock bag it has a bend that can t be fixed      
190,4.0,                       i absolutely love this backpack  i use it every work day and it carries everything i need it to  only disappointment i felt in this is that the colors are not as vibrant as it shows in the advertisement  i was expecting a bright magenta and pink for the flowers and it seems more hushed  kind of more camouflage y i was really looking forward to the brighter colors  other than that this bag has everything as advertised  i ve had it for a few months now and it has definitely been durable  retained shape and absolutely waterproof  i stand by my purchase as it has definitely been a great bag and haven t returned it for that very reason      
191,4.0,                       i ordered this super awesome backpack and i love it   however  when i ordered i was reading reviews prior and some had mentioned that the straps might not be as attached as they should  i use my bag as a backpack for school purse for work  i carrying a planner  binder with paper  pens  and my wallet in it  and after the first could uses to put on my back the strap did this  i m not super concerned but i also worry that it might not last all semester  other than the strap  it s awesome       
192,5.0,                       i love this bag   i ve had it for a year   i ve taken it on trips  and have used it everyday for work   it s stylish  well made and it protects my laptop well while allowing plenty of room for the other stuff   highly recommend      
193,5.0,                       i ordered this bag on a whim my husband had bought me a new computer and i was looking initially for something that would protect it  i was esctatic when this one was delivered and i realized i could not only fit my laptop but also lunch and personal items i use while at work i am overjoyed with this bag     
194,5.0,                       very good quality and pretty design      
195,5.0,                       i really do enjoy this backpack  it s very sturdy with a lot of storage compartments  it can hold weight and it s water resistant  plus  it s a nice size backpack  i m happy with my purchase      
196,5.0,                       love this bag  pretty  perfect for travel  and i love the usb port  super roomy as well        
197,5.0,                       i was looking for something to use as a carry on that also had a luggage pass through for rolling around the airport between flights  this did the trick and more  love that it comes with a power port to plug my battery pack into and a water bottle pocket that held my big yeti water bottle snuggly  no worries about it falling as with other backpacks  the sleeve for the laptop is snug  and plenty of room in the inside and outside pockets  like that it isn t chockablock full of pockets    sometimes you just need a big pouch to stuff things into rather than squirreling away in a variety of places  only to spend more time rummaging for them when you can t remember where you put what      
198,4.0,                       way better than what i expected  i carry a lot of books a     laptop  an ipad my phone  a charging block  a change of clothes  my lunch and snacks  in the side pocket i can easily fit my   oz hydro flask and the front pocket is perfect for my flashcards  writting utensils  my apple pencil and other goodies  this all works without bursting at the seams  my normal school bag was bulky  ugly  and couldn t hold all my books and things  this one is so cute and fits everything      
199,5.0,                         stars across the board   i absolutely love this bag  i bought it  because the backpack i had originally bought for college did not have any storage  this exceeded my expectations with all of the pockets  it is big and spacious  and i could still fit more in this bag  the only complaint i have is more with myself than the bag  i didn t know how huge my laptop was  so it doesn t fit  but i m not even mad about it  lol      
200,4.0,                       beautiful backpack but straps tore out after minimal use   hopefully  the company will offer a replacement update   the company sent a replacement as well as a refund  they were quick to act   thank you      
201,4.0,                       just got this bag for carrying my laptop back and forth to work   it is a beautiful bag of great quality and comfortable to wear    bag has a protected fabric that makes it water resistant  which i appreciate   lots of pockets and neat features   good size bag on the inside   i only have one complaint   the interior side pockets poke out a little bit and when i try to put folders in the center  they sometimes get caught on the pockets   i wish they were more gathered at the lip of the pocket so they didn t hang out   other than that  i m extremely pleased with the bag      
202,5.0,                       this bag is incredible  i ve been wanting to switch to a backpack instead of a purse and when this bag came it was even better than i had hoped  the material it is made out of is legit  the zippers and hardware are very high quality and i know it s going to last  not to mention it is so adorable  i ve already gotten a ton of compliments on it      
203,5.0,                       this bag holds everything  i am a musician and teacher so i carry a lot of gear and books  this bag holds all my stuff and books along with my ipad and tablet  i love the myriad of pockets to hold all different sizes of things  it is completely waterproof so none of my music gets wet  i also love the multiple ways of carrying this bag  finally  i love the flat bottom and zip top for easy access that doesn t fall over while looking through to find the book i need for the moment  this is a great bag      
204,5.0,                       i ve had this backpack for a few weeks now  i have gotten so many compliments on it at work  it has kept my items dry from pnw rain and when my water bottle leaked in the side pocket  it has a great frame  so the backpack will stand on its own without falling over  i haven t used the usb functions yet  but that wasn t a priority when i bought it      
205,5.0,                       where was this bag when i was in grad school  it s literally the ultimate travel bag  throw everything else away  i use this for work and it fit literally everything and more  you can fit a laptop  ipad  books  chargers  cords  and so much more  the weight distributed evenly  the bag opens nicely and the portable charging port is a major plus especially for traveling      
206,5.0,                       this is a very nice bag  they did almost everything correct  unfortunately  i will have to return it because the lower   side straps do not match the bag  they re beige  it does not blend or match with the colors of the bag at all  so it does not look nice when you wear it on your back as the unmatching straps get exposed beside your arms  also  the buckles are very low quality  also  when you hold the bag from the top as a regular bag  the backpack straps hang down loose  there s no compartment or pocket to stuff them in  however it s a spacious bag and the fabric design is pretty  the makers should ve used the same fabric for the lower and side strap      
207,5.0,                       i love everything about this backpack  the pattern is feminine without looking like an old lady bag  the waterproof material keeps my backpack clean from any liquids  ensuring my laptop stays dry even from rain  carrying two textbooks  a binder  a laptop  a small portable charger  all my writing utensils and my personal items is so much easier with this backpack  i m able to carry a lot of things like my hydro flask  wallet and makeup  having multiple pockets both inside and out      
208,5.0,                       looks just like the pictures sooo big but not to big to be a ever day bag at the same time     
209,4.0,                       i bought   of these for my   th grade girls and they love it  it s nice and wide at the opening  allowing easy access to contents  the padded divider is perfect for their laptop   only issue we had was on one of the backpacks  the zipper was really stiff and wouldnt zip past a certain point  the return was soooo easy and quick and they sent a replacement quickly      
210,4.0,                       i really  really like this  backpack  it is well designed  full of thought out compartments and flaps  the charger feature is nice a bonus  the metal zippers are study and heavy  it easily fits my lap top and i pad   only a few minor complaints stop me from giving it   stars  the color is a bit off from the picture  the flowers are more peach than pink  not that big of a deal  but not what i was expecting  the second issue is with the interior material which seems a bit thin and plastic y  if i could give a     star rating this back pack would have it      
211,5.0,                       love it  its perfect for carrying everything i need for work  would recommend     
212,2.0,                       i would have loved this backpack  but the first time using it was on a big trip  but one of the shoulder pads ripped or was never sewn right in the beginning  i came back from the trip after the    days  hopefully the company will still work with me  also  the backpack alone is quite heavy      
213,5.0,                       it has more room then i thought and it s very well made      
214,5.0,                       so cute  exactly as pictured  i love that it is sturdy and can basically stand up even when not full  also has lots of room for what you would need for school  or if wanted to use instead of diaper bag  or even purse  great hit for          
215,5.0,                       i m so glad i purchased this item  it s actually great quality and has plenty of storage  holds my    inch laptop  great for work or school      
216,3.0,                       this backpack would have been the winner of all backpacks for me had the straps not ripped the first day of use  it is stylish and fits a lot of items  i bought it for our vacation and was able to fit my    inch macbook with two chargers  headphones  purse  dslr camera  glasses  wallet  umbrella  and water bottle  there is even a strap that fits on your suitcase handle so you don t have to carry it on your back through the airport  i just wish the straps were made a little better      
217,3.0,                       i absolutely love love love this bag  it just saddens me that   weeks in my straps ripped  i don t over pack my bag to the point of being heavy  i usually have my ipad and   in macbook  a small notebook  pens and charger  maybe a poland spring water bottle from time to time  but i still end up with ample space left over  i love the bag just was disappointed at how easily the straps ripped      
218,5.0,                       the bag turned out to be a bit larger than i expected but that s perfect  i bought this to be able to haul everything back and forth to work with me without feeling like i m juggling a purse  lunch bag  water bottle  and travel mug and it has room for all that and more this bag is also perfect for overnight trips  a gym bag  or a diaper bag  it has enough room to carry everything and looks so cute      
219,5.0,                       i love this backpack  it s sturdy and beautiful  i used it for a vacation in montana  it was my  purse  on the airplane ride  it holds loads of stuff and with all of the pockets  everything is organized  i received compliments on it wherever i went      
220,5.0,                       lovely travelling bag that is of top quality  i hate hauling around the airport hand luggage  pocket book  carry on   just too much hussle  with thi lovely bag  you can carry all the necessary items  including laptop  tablet and not have to carry additional luggage on the plane  love it  there are enough compartments which makes this bag even better and it also has a usb charging port      
221,5.0,                       this is the one to buy  i bought this backpack for a trip and oh my gosh is it roomy  super pretty and well made it holds everything with plenty of pockets to store all your stuff so you can stay organized

223,5.0,                       so far this bag has held up as a carry on bag for   flights  it is roomy inside  i was able to pack a change of clothes  toiletries  a pair of shoes  snacks  and my tablet and still had room left  it fitted perfectly under airplane  seat and was comfortable enough to wear on my back      
224,5.0,                       this backpack is gorgeous and functional   as you can see  in my pictures  it can hold a lot of books in addition to a laptop   i ve been wearing using it for about a week now and it is very sturdy yet comfortable on my back   the material is very durable and holds up to my rough housing   i tend to throw my bag in the back seat  but no tears so far   i especially love the two handles   it makes it very easy to carry   i m also pleased with the fact that it stands up right when i set it on the ground   it hasn t tipped over   overall  i m satisfied with everything about it   i plan to use it to travel in the next few months  so i m excited to see how it holds up      
225,5.0,                       and my mom really loved it  lots of storage pockets and nice big size      
226,5.0,                       i always go safe with colors so this time i decided to branch out and get this floral pattern  i was pleasantly surprised  i actually like the pattern and have received many compliments on it  the storage space is huge and can hold everything you will need  it looks very well put together and i am very pleased with this purchase  if you are like me and like to keep it safe  you can take this risk and won t regret it  go for it        
227,5.0,                       got it for my daughter and she absolutely loves it   many pockets and patterns are pretty   water bottle picket inside   and there is apparently a panel on bottom that flips down so bag can sit up on its own      
228,5.0,                       beautiful  floral laptop bag  i especially like the many features this bookbag offers and the versatility  i can wear it on my back as a bookbag or carry it as a purse  great quality too  if you re considering purchasing this bag  go and do it before the price increases  the product will not disappoint you  you will be amazed  the pictures do not do this laptop bag justice  you need to see it for yourself

230,5.0,                       i m long past my college days  but i still like pretty and function able backpacks for work and travel  this one wipes clean  but is not cheap plastic  nor does it look like plastic   i usually end up cramming too much stuff in laptop bags  but this one  has a feature that when you unzip it  the top opens up to a framed    x     rectangle  more pockets and places to clip keys onto than i have ever seen before  i love it

235,5.0,                       this backpack is awesome   it is really big inside but the expandable top design makes it look normal sized   i m using it for a work bag and it fits my laptop  all chargers and accessories  a portable power bank  my lunch  my wallet  a couple bottles of water and it s not even half full   i can t wait to take it on a trip and see how it goes  the strap for a spinner will be nice to have  when it first arrived  it was folded in half and it made the shape odd but i loaded it up and hung it on a hook over the weekend and it straightened out on its own  i ve had so many compliments from women in how cute it is and men on the size and practicality  i ve seen a few reviews about the strap not lasting but for      i ll just get another one if that happens  been using this one for about a month and it s holding up perfectly   use love to see more patterns available

237,3.0,                       i absolutely love the design of this backpack  but i gave it the amount of stars i did because one of the only reasons i bought this backpack was because it was a usb charger  so i plugged it in and it did not work  then i thought  hey maybe i need to charge it  so i plugged it into the computer  again did not work  so finally i hooked it up to a box charger and charged it for   hours  i came back from dinner and noticed that it still hadn t been working  i have tried all that i could and it does not work  if you were planning on buying this backpack because your phone dies quick in school and you re looking for a way to charge it  don t waste your time      
238,5.0,                       i really love this backpack  i originally bought it for my daughter who had an under armour backpack and kept complaining it was too small  so she picked out this one on amazon  i loved it so much  i stole it from her for my work needs and now i ll order her a new one  it has great storage for my laptop  papers and files and essentials  i have replaced my old rolling briefcase with this backpack as it is  much lighter to lift into my car and my old one was causing tennis elbow problems  i am the owner of a physical therapy clinic and this backpack meets all my needs   not to mention  it is so cute with the floral patterning  it is not only functional but adorable and stylish at the same time   thank you

247,5.0,                       so i was super picky when i was looking at bags this was the only one that met all my qualifications  in a bag  the final factor was the rfid pocket which i think is really important to have these days  the vague itself is super spacious with two side pockets for water bottles or umbrellas and such  i was also pretty particular about having those antitheft snaps  it doesn t have a zipper lock but the snaps with definitely make it take longer for someone to steal your laptop  if you picky about it you could probably buy a luggage lock for more protection but i just wanted something that deter or chase theft to take longer than just an old bag  the bag is definitely water resistant and it is both sturdy in frame and in fabric which i was super impressed with  i have no doubt that travel with this bag will be easy and the design is very cute too      
248,5.0,                       so much room   beautiful pattern   i receive lots of compliments

268,5.0,                       love this backpack  i use it for work only  will hold my very small laptop  i guess it will hold a    inch laptop well also  i also carry the cooling fan base and power cord  lots of pockets  easy to carry even when full  only one problem  after one week   one of the zippers sticks a little  i will probably just use the other zipper most of the time   so nice several of my coworkers want one too  can be cleaned with cleaning wipes      
269,1.0,                       shoulder strap is ripping off instead of taking good care and proper handling  i bought this backpack on october  i only use this backpack just to carry a laptop and a lunch bag  i don t  ride bus so i don t carry the bag on my shoulder all the time  the backpack sits in my car the whole time  i use it to keep my stuff organized and handy inside  the bag is made out of poor quality material  that s the reason the shoulder strap is falling off from the stitch  disappointed with the amazon quality control      
270,5.0,                       i bought this backpack to use between the office and home  this has got to be the best backpack with lots of storage  i have tried many including the swiss army backpacks and this is by far my absolute favorite  i haven t used the charging port yet because i haven t travel with it aside from between office and home   i m from michigan so you never know if it will rain or snow   this has protected my laptop from both  if you are on the fence i really think you should get this a go you will love it as much as i do

282,3.0,                       top zipper has not broken yet but i expect it to at any time   it keeps getting stuck on the corners as it goes have had to have my husband work very hard to get it unstuck and it is not caught on anything or the bag is not overstuffed  the zipper going around the corners  tries to come off the track      
283,1.0,                       my daughter didn t use this backpack until this school year          she was in school from september   thanksgiving and then again feb   today              so  roughly    in person week s of school   well  today the strap broke   doesn t seem like a quality product for it to break with that limited use      
284,5.0,                       perfectly fits my oversized gaming laptop  really impressed  none of my old bulky backpacks could do this  and it has the traveling strap to go on top of my carry on  plus backpack strap and handbag options  looks so high quality and cute

315,4.0,                       i bought this backpack recently and i really loved the color  it looks very cute and girly i was kind of surprised that the bag was sooo huge when i opened it  it has a lot of separate compartments  some with or without zippers   one pocket  which i believe it supposed to be the laptop sleeve  was very nice because there was a lot of padding and a velcro strap to keep it secure in place i think that even though it looks normal sized  it has the capacity to store so much  especially if one knows how to pack well  it is also really good because of the quality of the material  the backpack is thick and study enough to withhold a lot of weight without the seems ripping  which happened to my old backpack   but it is light enough by itself so that it doesn t feel too heavy to carry overall  this is a great bag to use for daily use  since it holds up well

328,5.0,                       love this backpack  it has a lot of storage and many pockets and zipper pockets inside  good quality material      
329,5.0,                       this backpack is great  it has a luggage strap so it is perfect for traveling and it s also the perfect size for a personal item on an airplane and as a school backpack  i bought the gray with multicolored flowers and blue and green leaves and it is stunning  my only problem is the backpack comes folded in half so it is a little bent until you put your stuff in it      
330,4.0,                       the backpack i ordered was the pink roses   it had plenty of room for everything   my complaints were the coloring was not as pictured  it was too bright oranges for me  and the material is vinyl plastic

334,5.0,                       i am a nurse and i was looking for a bad that had several pockets and could accommodate all the things that i carry  i am also in school  so if it could serve two purposes even better  when i first started looking  i wasn t looking for a backpack  however i am extremely glad that i happened upon this bag because it is amazing and i love it   it has several inside pockets  it has a front organizing pocket  side pockets  it even has   inside laptop pockets so that you get the perfect fit for the size of your laptop  you can t go wrong getting this bag  and its also cute        
335,5.0,                       i was looking for a college backpack that would fit my laptop  binders  big water bottle  and calculator  phone  etc  that i could also use for travel when needed  i am slightly embarrassed to admit that i did a lot of research on backpacks  i compared many different styles  sizes  brands  etc   this one met all of my requests and more  the only thing i wish is that it came in other color options than floral  but it easily fits all my college essentials mentioned above with room to spare  it fits my    in chromebook smoothly  with padded protection and my large metal water bottle  the features that set this backpack apart from others is the luggage strap  the front pocket with slots inside  bonus  rfid pocket i plan to use when traveling   the handle on top  makes it so much easier to lug it out of the car   and the extra side pockets on the inside   which honestly get a little bit in the way when i am trying to fit my binders in  but i am glad they are there so i can put my large mophi for my phone and use the cool charging outlet overall  this has saved me at school  i was literally carrying around   backpacks before  and i can t wait to use it for traveling  i highly recommend it  if you are okay with floral print      
336,5.0,                       everything they said about this bookbag in the reviews were true  the best bookbag i have ever brought  my money was well spent  i used this bag for two trips already as a carry on and i was able to fit a weekend worth of clothes in it      
337,5.0,                       i don t normally leave reviews but this backpack is wonderful  it s big and can fit all my work stuff and laptop  i am a teacher and have many books to carry  the floral design is gorgeous    the compartments are great and are in the right spots   beautiful bag for a great price       
338,2.0,                       cute bag  loved the pockets inside and out  the strap for putting on a roller board handle is a life saver  however  after only   trips the shoulder straps are tearing from their connection points  would not recommend for heavy travelers  as a laptop and some notebooks were enough to wear it out in less than   months      
339,4.0,                       i like this bag  but if i pack it full  it s hard to close and zip  i guess i just won t fill it so much  it s very cute and protects my laptop with a cushy layer of padding  i love how many pockets it has     
340,5.0,                       great backpack being used by high school student  design is attractive and has a multitude of compartments  can easily fit a large laptop  books  binders  etc  side pocket can hold a large water bottle  there s also a usb connection allowing for portable charging  you supply your own power bank   the purse like zipper opening on the top is pretty functional  very wide and allows for easy access to items   a nice break from the traditional backpack designs  has held up well so far and quality seems excellent  note the material is not like a fabric  more reminiscent of like an insulated cooler  if that makes sense   this  however  does make it seem really water resistant which is great protecting your electronics and papers inside  overall  very pleased with the bag      
341,5.0,                       i love the design and the interior of the bag is beautiful  no one would believe i got this for such a low price      
342,2.0,                       there is no padding in the straps  which defeats the purpose of the bag  i bought this napsack because it was really cute and had great reviews    but i m disappointed with the bag  it does not distribute weight very well  so a laptop plus my other handbag items feel really heavy  also the straps look like they re about to fall off soon      
343,5.0,                       love this bag  especially the doctor style opening at the top  tone of compartments and really durable  already getting compliments  thrilled with a bargain     
344,5.0,                       the backpack has some nice features like charger outlet and nice big pockets for gadgets and stuff  the material is very good and feels high quality      
345,3.0,                       i am most disappointed that the zipper was busted when i received it but i didn t have time to return it  the zipper  even if it wasn t broken  is really hard to zip back and forth  i was also expecting it to be fabric but it is almost plasticy because of its waterproofness  overall it s very cute and i love all the pocket placements and the laptop sleeve and floral design  oh  and i don t love that it won t stand up when sitting in the floor  it flops forward but that may be because of what i have in it or because of how it was shipped and it s broken in yet      
346,5.0,                       it is a beautiful backpack   it is functional and professional looking without being too  cute  for business  i do like the  doctor bag  opening as i can easily open it and see exactly what i have and need for the day   i do wish they made it a little taller for my     laptop  but it is fine for my       laptop      
347,5.0,                       i absolutely love this bag    i needed it for work  i have   jobs and am never home so i carry lots of stuff with me at all times    this bag is perfect    zin fact i plan to order one in every color and print that they have available

350,5.0,                       this backpack was purchased for my daughter to take on airplanes for her business travel   it opens from the top  with several compartments  and has an area for id  credit cards  money  tickets  etc   it also has a computer charger  and will fit under the seat      
351,5.0,                       i ll admit it  i m a bag person  lol  i like cute bags  but i don t buy the expensive ones often  this bag is beautiful  it looks and feels much more expensive than it was  it s very sturdy and the zippers glide so nicely  i would have thought this bag would be at least     if i saw it at the store    at least  it fits my       laptop perfectly  there s still plenty of room for many notebooks planners  my long power cord  mouse  mousepad  etc  without even using the exterior pockets  and it s so stinkin  cute    love it        
352,5.0,                       ok so  this bag  can hold  all of the things  i have a huge hydro flask  and i m the mom friend that brings everything everywhere i go  this bag is a magical bag  it holds all the things and i m obsessed with it  it s perfect for traveling  for college  for trips  all of it  hey person reading this  get this bag its perfect     
353,5.0,                       i was pleasantly surprised by how nice this backpack was when i opened the package  it s sturdy and definitely waterproof  and the print is pretty  i got it for my mom for traveling  and she is thrilled  haven t used it yet  and will update the review after i do  but first impression is it has surpassed my expectations      
354,5.0,                       this bag is so pretty  really roomy and seems sturdy  i ve used it for a cross country overnight bag so far  so good  the only two things i would change is a better padded handle and a small pocket near the top for passport ticket wallet      
355,5.0,                       i really love this bag  it was been in my wishlist for months and i forgot about buying it  now that it is finally here i love the waterproof material and all the compartments  i am very satisfied with my purchase      
356,5.0,                       this bag is extremely spacious  more than enough room for a laptop  personal belongings and even baby items if you need to  you can charge your phone from the inside but you ll need to connect a power pack on the inside for it to charge  definitely water resistant  i absolutely love this bag       
357,5.0,                       i spent a great deal of time researching backpacks to find one with all the features i was looking for  this backpack didnt disappoint  the colors are vibrant  the design of the multiple pockets and ability to carry a lot if items  yet keep them all organized  is amazing  i first used it for travel and appreciated the strap on the back that allows it to connect to my suitcase handle  it fit well  with plenty of space to spare  under the seat in front of me  after vacation  it easily converted to my work bag  i can fit full file folders  binders a crossbody purse  my ipad  and even my lunch in it  great product        
358,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i love this laptop bag  i run a small business and needed a carry all briefcase for carrying money  documents  my planner  laptop  etc from work to home daily and this does the trick  can t speak to water resistance or durability yet as it s still new  but it has so much room inside and the way it closes makes it perfect for carrying document sized items without bending or folding  my only drawback is the weird little label  in the photo  on the front but i think i m going to cut it off and replace with fabric patch      
359,5.0,                       this was actually better than expected i m going on a weekend trip and it actually fit a lot of my cloths of folded correctly     i m super happy with this  i ah e a   year old and it works with my stuff and her stuff in it       
360,4.0,                       this bag is lovely but it was too big for a purse  i wanted something a little smaller so i returned it  other than that  it is well made and a beautiful color      
361,4.0,                       i really like this backpack   i ordered it because of the doctor s bag style of opening and price  but i am so pleased with it   the zippers are quality and smooth to operate   there are tons of pockets  and they are very well organized   the flower print is gorgeous  i got   compliments on it the first time i used it to walk around a large hospital complex   the only reason i didn t give it   stars was because the shoulder straps do not seem to be sewn in enough   maybe they are  though  because there are no problems so far   i will update as i put more wear on the backpack      
362,5.0,                       i m tickled pink with this purchase i actually snagged it last minute based entirely off the cute floral pattern  but it ended up being so much more than a regular backpack first of all  it s roomy  it opens like a diaper bag and it can fit my kindle  and laptop easily  but my favorite part was the little pouch for my battery  i don t have to take it out of the bag  it connects directly to a usb charging port and i can plug my phone in from the outside there are sooo many pockets  i got this for my cruise two month travel to australia  i like to keep a lot of things in my bag  tissue  med kit  water  change of clothes  etc  and it can fit everything with room to spare you won t regret this purchase      
363,5.0,                       i love this book bag  it s plenty spacious for the books i need and holds my laptop perfectly  and i get compliment after compliment on how stylish it looks  i ve only had it a week or so but the stitching and material seem high quality and well made  but so far i love it

365,5.0,                       i am a kindergarten teacher and  i use it to transport my laptop or chromebook to and from school each day  it also works well for weekends to the camper  carrying school supplies and clothes for the weekend      
366,5.0,                       love the color and style   lots of storage space   great material   granddaughter loved it   may have to get another one for her sister

370,4.0,                       cute backpack  durable material  but disappointed that the interior liner that hold the bag open is curled and will not lay flat      
371,4.0,                       cute backpack  it s a gift so i can t speak to it s actual usage but when i opened it  the zipper was very tough so i m hoping this won t be an issue      
372,5.0,                       i love this bag  i had previously purchased a bag similar to this but was dissatisfied with it and upon my returning it  this bag popped up in items that i may like on my amazon homepage  i purchased because it was the right size and the aesthetic is so cute  it holds all the things i need for school and the compartments are perfect  my only gripe with this bag is that even when i don t have many items or heavy items in my bag  it still feels sturdy  but i think this may be because the construction on the bag is very good  i get so many compliments on this bag      
373,5.0,                       i was looking for a laptop bag that wasn t only stylish  but practical  i have a   month old that sometimes travel with me when i m doing business and i didn t want to lug a whole bunch of bags around  this bag holds it all  it holds my laptop  wallet  keys and her baby stuff  mom s know what i m talking about   i also wanted a pop of color   something that wasn t boring  and this bag did not disappoint  i love this bag  i also think it s really cool that you can put a charging pack in your bag and charge your phone from the outside  how cool is that   definitely getting a bang for your buck on this bag

375,5.0,                       love the look of this backpack  only had if for two weeks  so i can t yet say how it will hold up  but the straps don t seem like they re the sturdiest  i feel the need to be somewhat gentle with them  other than that  it s perfect  love all the pockets      
376,5.0,                       absolutely in love with this  super spacious and the handles are great  bought this bag for traveling since it also had the charging port  honestly so handy and i m more than excited to start using it more often

378,4.0,                       i love the bag but would not recommend it  i m a school teacher and started using it in august  nothing crazy  just laptop and papers to grade  it s already falling apart  straps will eventually not be functional and color is fading  wish things were different  space inside is amazing   now i can t use it update  company was so sweet in sending me a new one without my knowledge  i really do love this bag   excited to try the new one out      
379,4.0,                       i really like the design and features of this backpack  the material does not feel durable  it was packaged all folded up  which left it out of shape   the bottom plastic support panel has not straightened out after several days of weighting it flat

382,5.0,                       i love this backpack and have gotten many compliments  i originally was searching for a laptop bag for work  then i came across a similar product on amazon and realized that i could use a bag like this for school  work  and travel   adter looking through the other brand  none if their bags had all of the perks in one bag   this one is perfect   there are tons of pockets   it is water resistant  there is a usb charging port on the outside  and it can ride on a suitcase  perfect  i couldn t be happier      
383,4.0,                       i got this bag for school this year  it s perfect for a college student like me  it has a little usb plug that you can plug your phone charger to and on the inside you can hook up a portable charger  i tested out the bag by taking it on a family road trip  i practically fit my entire life into this bag  it holds everything  even when i had everything i needed in it i could still fit more in it  my only problem with it is that its a little stiff and uncomfortable  i m sure i just need to break it in some more  but do with comment as you will      
384,5.0,                       i bought this bag the mid of december and by the end of the month my strap had already ripped  otherwise  i love the bag very spacious and is super cute  just wished it held together a little better than it did update was not expecting a replacement  love this bag so was excited to have a replacement  this one is holding up pretty good will update if any changes      
385,5.0,                       i love the fabric it repels water nicely  i would like there to be a zipper cover so that water doesn t get in through the zipper but i m not trekking through the wilderness with this thing so the short time between my office and the car is not a problem  i had to take some time to get used to the clamshell type opening at the top but now i am fine with it  the straps can get a bit uncomfortable after half an hour in the store but like i said  i m not day hiking through the redwoods with this just using it for a carry all and literal  bag of holding   i may reach in one day a pull mary poppins out if there      
386,5.0,                       this backpack is exactly what i needed for transporting my school materials and ipad   everything has its own place and plenty of space for everything   will purchase again        
387,5.0,                       absolutely love this bag    i got it to hold my      ipad pro and it fits perfectly  and my kindle fits perfectly in the pocket in front of it  the area that holds the laptops is thickly padded so i m not worried about it getting damaged  it does not come with a docking unit to charge      that is literally the only down side  the zippers are heavy duty and i can already tell that this is perfect for traveling and for a carry on  and i know that this bad is sturdy enough to last years

396,3.0,                       when i originally received this bag  i was like this is a great quality bag  well after   uses the bag ripped  there was nothing more than a lenovo       laptop and a notebook inside the bag  such a huge disappointment  i hope this is just a defect    update  i was given a full refund      
397,4.0,                       i love this bag  sadly  the first one didn t work  the usb port   pleasantly  amazon exchanged it no questions asked and sent the new one before i even shipped back the first one  this usb port works  the bag is perfect to carry my hot bento lunch  and all my gear for work

404,5.0,                       very durable bag  strong stitches and water resistant fabric  my     laptop fits snugly into the laptop pocket  love all the different pocket options on the exterior and interior of the bag  the floral fabric is cuter in person than in the pictures  very pleased with this purchase

406,5.0,                       good bag for being on the go  being able to lock zippers is a plus     
407,3.0,                       the bag is beautiful   the pictures hardly do it justice   it s nice a roomy and the fact that you can carry it with the handles  like a purse  or on your back like a backpack is so nice   the problem is that with a week and a half  the seam of one of the straps started coming aloose   you can see the pictures above   we bought the insurance warranty  so hopefully we can get it replaced      
408,1.0,                       edit  junk  straps have ripped off already  not even four months use      
409,5.0,                       i love this backpack  i start college in the fall and i wanted a backpack that would be sturdy  protect my laptop  and hold my textbooks with extra room  this backpack does just that  i was a little nervous buying something at this cost  but it was definitely worth the money  this backpack is good for school  work or even packing light for a trip so you don t have to carry about a duffel bag or a suitcase        recommend       
410,5.0,                       i ve been searching for a good laptop bag for work  many were an outrageous price and didn t have a lot of space or pockets  this bag is everything i wanted and more  the straps are adjustable and very comfortable  the material will be great for rain or snow to protect my laptop and the pocket on the front has compartments for all my accessories  i finally don t have to carry a purse in addition to my laptop bag  if you re on the fence even a little bit buy it      
411,2.0,                       the backpack strap broke the first day that i used it  i did not have that much in it at the time  thank goodness it had handles or i would have been unable to use it at all  it was very pretty and the style was exactly at mentioned  too bad the quality isn t that great   i had just bought it when everything shut down for covid so i was unable to return it      
412,5.0,                       this bag was perfect for my carry on bag  i love the laptop pouch as well as all other pockets  i didn t use the charging port  but i am sure it s a great addition for someone  just get it  you will not regret it      
413,4.0,                       very nice bag  much bigger than it appears in pictures and so stylish  i only take a point off cause the back where the handle is is coming apart after about   months of use  pretty bag but maybe not for consistent use      
414,4.0,                       let me start by saying i love this backpack  it s so stylish and has lots of space for all the stuff i need  i carry my ipad and laptop with me  and the two slots and the velcro securing strip cover them both  lots of space in the main bag  i also love the idea of the external usb port so you can charge your phone and use it  which is great for traveling  however  the external usb port comes unstuck and gets lost easily between the lining and outside of the bag  the staps aren t ergonomic  and become tiresome very quickly  especially if you re carrying a lot of weight  two devices  a water bottle  and a change of clothes plus a walk across campus is just about enough for me   i really wish it had a buckle for across the chest  the zippers stick a bit  but that s easily fixed by rubbing them with a pencil  overall it s a good backpack  and i d buy it again      
415,5.0,                       i am in love with this bag  i don t even have a laptop i travel with and it is so handy for everything you would want and need to put in it  i bought it for a flight i had where i wanted to buy presents for my niece and nephews and it had plenty of room for all three presents and much more  so many pockets and room  i also love that you can hang it on your luggage  wear it as a backpack  or carry it as a purse      
416,1.0,                       strap came apart after one weeks use  carry a laptop  charger  notebook and a couple of pens inside that cldnt weigh more than     lbs total   very disappointed  will be returning      
417,5.0,                       i got this bag for a trip that i was taking and it was so convenient on the plane and to get through security with my electronics easily accessible      
418,5.0,                       bought this bag for our daughter for school and travel  she absolutely loves it  it s fits all of the things she needs to carry around as well as has a wire for charging her phone  it s light weight  the design fits exactly what she wanted and it has enough pockets for all her needs      
419,3.0,                       i use this backpack everyday  i would in the health field so i have to have my laptop and calendar everydaytoday i went to put my backpack down and noticed my right strap is already ripped from the main stitch   i am so upset and i don t know how to correct this because i really did love this bag and told all my coworkers to purchase one      
420,5.0,                       haven t used yet bought for an upcoming trip can t wait to use it  very roomy and lots of pockets inside and place for your tablet well made and love the print wanted something for a female not to look like a guys bag    very happy     
421,5.0,                       i really love this backpack  i was in need of a nice looking backpack with a lot of storage space  i m a teacher and carry so many things daily  laptop  chargers  papers to grade  gym clothes  gym shoes  packed lunch  water bottle  medicines  phone  wallet  pens  stationary  makeup  etc  before this bag  i was using a tote bag and it was a mess because it didn t have compartments and it hurt my shoulder  after the tote bag  i switched to a backpack but needed something bigger and with more storage options  this backpack really fit the bill and i ve been so happy with it since i got it  it has so much space  looks adorable  and helps me keep everything i need in one bag  i get so many compliments on it daily and have recommended it to many of my teacher friends and coworkers  i foresee it being great for travel as well  i ve been so impressed with the quality of everything from the cloth to the interior to the zippers  overall  i would definitely recommend this bag      
422,5.0,                       i needed a bag to help eliminate my having to tote around   or more bags to work  this is perfect   i can fit both my laptop and ipad with plenty of room left for note books  etc  even weight distribution and lots of pockets for pens  water bottles etc  the pictures make the color look dull  but they are actually beautiful and vibrant  good quality for a reasonable price      
423,3.0,                       first  i love the handles so i can carry it like a bag  and how it opens so i can see everything in my bag without digging  but the wider mouth is a little deceiving  i keep thinking i can put more into the bag but then it won t close  i bought it as a carry on and could fit everything i needed in it until i tried to put my      laptop in it and then it wouldn t close  i had to take stuff out before it would close over my laptop  this bag fits the same amount as my    backpack from aldi  and it is really heavy before putting all my books and electronics inside  it s really nice that it s waterproof and has a luggage strap  which is partly why i bought it   but overall it was a little disappointing since i couldn t fit everything i needed      
424,5.0,                       ordered this to use when o fly  perfect fit for my ipad pro  lots of pockets for all the stuff i need when i fly      
425,5.0,                       bought for a teenager for a back to school backpack   she loves it and i love that the zipper is on top   much easier to put items in backpack and remove them      
426,5.0,                       i get tons of compliments on it  when i get to class i tuck in the straps and carry it from the top so i can slide in and out of the row easily it keeps me so organized even when i just throw stuff in i love the open mouth top so i can easily see everything      
427,5.0,                       i use this for work and it has enough space and pockets to keep everything organized and is comfy to carry  i have received plenty of compliments on it  haven t had it long so we will see on durability and water resistance     
428,5.0,                       i bought this bag for myself and one like it for my daughter of a different brand   this one is superior  more internal pockets  fortified bottom  and wider strap for luggage handle in the back   top notch bag  so glad i got it   i don t like flowers  so i was disappointed with pattern selection  but it actually looks nicer in person and has grown on me      
429,5.0,                       edit  i received a new bag after my initial one ripped on the inside  customer service is exceptional  so far so good  my first bag could have been a manufacture error  loved this back pack at first and still love the space and design  but i received this in december as a christmas gift and the lining is already ripped  i carry a laptop and   notebooks daily as i m a college student and many text books are online  i can t even imagine how it would have held up with actual books      
430,5.0,                       this backpack is perfect for everyday use for my family  lots of different options for organization and with   kids this is a huge plus  the material is wonderful because liquids just bead right off and wide away easily  zippers are very strong and reliable so our oldest isn t breaking them right off       recommend      
431,5.0,                       bought for travel and because it has the strap to slide onto my carry on luggage s handle  works awesome  lightweight but sturdy  has plenty of pockets and i like that it can stay wide open at the top when needed to access my things toiletries at the hotel yet it closes easily with plenty of handles and easy zippers as well as having the usual adjustable backpack straps on it  holds a lot of weight too with ease      
432,5.0,                       i was looking for something pretty and functional and i found it  i love all the storage places  pockets  and it s pretty too  i have opted to ditch my purse  since i was carrying     bags a day  and now i have just this one backpack  love the opening on the top too  makes reaching in and finding things super easy       
433,5.0,                       update  this company really takes their feedback seriously  after my first backpack zipper broke the company issued a replacement  how awesome   the first day i brought it to work i received three compliments on it  the backpack itself has so many compartments and extra space that you can easily fit everything you need and keeps it organized  also love that i can charge on the go  makes it very convenient  love this backpack and so happy i get to use it again        
434,5.0,                       well pulling it out of the package  i was already excited  the bag is very sturdy  the material is very durable and as described  it has ample amount of space to take with you just about everything  i will be using this bag strictly just for when i travel  i took a few pictures to give me an idea of the space inside  the first picture is the outside the second i was down to my inner elbow with how deep the bag is  it is also it opens up very wide as well  now there is an ipad pocket and also a laptop pocket  i have the      in  rd generation ipad pro  it will fit in the pocket  but it s not deep enough for it to go down all the way however with my pro and its case it will properly fit in the laptops lot  so i m not sure if you could safely store your       in laptop in the laptop pocket  maybe in a   in  overall i am completely satisfied with my purchase      
435,4.0,                       being that it is winter  i do wish the straps were a little more accomodating to my winter coat  currently sub zero temps f    and it does not stand upright as pictured   other than those two things  great bag      
436,5.0,                       i was looking for a new laptop work bag and one thing i wanted was a backpack  i have kids and i am generally carrying more than just my own items  this bag is attractive  professional  offers a large amount of space for everything i need  i love that it has the luggage strap for when i m traveling also   i ve received many compliments on it and i feel it s a great time with a fair price  i d purchase again in the future

441,5.0,                       this is a great product especially for me as an older woman  it s difficult to carry things around with my arms but the backpack really helps  i love its large capacity and the features that it has  the fact that it s waterproof is an additional bonus  thanks for a great product

453,5.0,                       i used this during my semester abroad and it was fantastic  it has framing to maintain its shape at the top and close easily  which i really liked since you didn t have to wrestle with the zipper if the bag was full  it also has so much storage and pockets to keep you organized  i especially liked the strap on the bag to put on top of rolling suitcases  so i didn t have to always carry it on my back  it s really cute  functional  and waterproof  i      recommend      
454,4.0,                       i really love that this bag is cute and functional  the charging port is awesome because i slide my power bank in the inside pocket and my phone can be in the outer side pocket with easy access and its still deep enough to be concealed  i love the front pocket as well because it holds a lot more than i expected  the zipper is sturdy and slides nicely  what i don t like is the straps  they are thinner than i would like and don t stay tight  it is ok for  short trips or for trips where you are not carrying the bag all day  but  i spend two days walking around museums while carrying this bag and it definitely made my shoulders and neck sore  the only other thing i wasn t crazy over is that the fabric on the inside seems cheap  although it hasn t ripped yet  i ve had and used often this bag for a few months  i could see it not holding up if it were being used on a daily basis  overall  i do like it and think it is a great bag      
455,5.0,                       when i first received this bag i instantly fell in love with it it holds a lot and is great fabric and did i mention absolutely beautiful sadly   days later i noticed one of the handles was coming of the stitches i contacted amazon and was instantly sent a new one i love this backpack      
456,5.0,                       if i am      honest  i love this backpack  it is really pretty  extremely spacious on the inside which is great since it holds all my text books  a really great feature is that it is water proof  i tested this by parking on the other side of campus without an umbrella not knowing it would storm later that day    half a mile of a walk later  my phone  laptop and textbooks were all dry  i couldn t say the same for my clothes           would recommend      
457,5.0,                       oh my gosh     it s exactly what i wanted   after searching for several days  i found this one wanted a fabric that wouldn t easily get dirty in the under seat of my chair on a plane   so excited when i got it yesterday    perfect in every way      the fabric has a coating on it that can be wiped off so easy       it is a great size without being to big   can t wait to use it in april             
458,5.0,                       amazing backpack  soooo beautiful and full of space    looks great for school  work  travel      
459,4.0,                       generali was looking for a new backpack to replace an adidas one i have had for years  now that i am in college  i know i don t need to carry as much  i take most of my notes on my ipad or laptop and both fit snuggly in the desired slots  i have a     hp and a       ipad  i only got to use it for a week before school went online because of covid     but i have been nannying two kids since then and i continue to use this bag everyday  all the reviews with pictures and the amazon pictures look just how my bag came  it was almost smaller than i thought when i first opened the package  but it s capacity is pleasantly large prosi can easily fit a large water bottle     oz contigo or tal brand both fit  in the side slot  i even can out two kid water bottles on the other side which is great for this summer while i am a nanny  the charging ability is great for my phone and my battery fits easily in a slot on the inside of the main pouch  i have used this bag in the rain a few times  never staying out too long  but i don t have to worry about my things getting wet   however  the inside of the drink slots are not waterproof between the water bottle and the inside of the bag  so if your bottle is dripping  it can leak through the fabric into the main pocket  but from the top and outside of the bag  i have not noticed any water getting in conswhat i mentioned above about the inside of the drink pockets is my main con  the only other thing i have really noticed is that the straps are not super comfortable all the time  being that i have them to their max length and that i have used it a lot with sleeveless shirts  the non padded parts do rub on my armpits  if i am wearing a t shirt  i have noticed it is a lot more comfortable but can still dig in a bit if the bag is very heavy      
460,4.0,                       i really like this backpack  it s not the most super highest quality ever  but it s actually pretty decent based on the price  my only genuine complaint is that the zippers don t zip smoothly  it fits my       laptop and has pently of room for all kinds of other options  also  when empty  it maintains a folded in half shape which is very handy for storing it      
461,5.0,                       i m so glad i chose this backpack  i absolutely love it  it s stylish  i can fit all my college books in it  it just came yesterday and i ve already got compliments on it  i m definitely going to buy again  i also have no doubt i ll be able to fit my      maybe a         hp pavillion x    in it along with all my books      
462,5.0,                    me encant  mi mochila  es s per espaciosa y colorida  me encanta        
463,5.0,                       this bag blew my expectations  i was amazed when i unboxed it  it has so much room and different compartments  it got everything i needed for my trip and still had room for more  i will be absolutely using this bag for every trip from now on    update i still love this bag   years later   i m now using it as my diaper bag because it fits everything i need including bulkier cloth diapers      
464,5.0,                       the open top design is amazing  makes it so much easier to get things out on the bus or at the store without fearing that my things are going to fall out  i also really love the hand strap option  it s a more professional way to carry a bag for work meetings and events  and unlike regular backpacks  these hand straps are sturdy i also really like all the pockets and dividers  i was looking at other similar bags  but i didn t like how they didn t have pockets inside to help keep things organized  which is why i chose this one in the end i wish there had been more variety in design choices    i got the hydrangea    design because i avoid rose designs  but while it s really pretty  it s a little more  busy  than i would have liked  especially for work  which is why i need it  i would recommend expanding into more subtle design options    solid black  grays  blues  greens    maybe some faint prints with stripes  dots  chevrons  and things like that to fit a more professional look regardless  i do love the bag and i m really pleased with it      
465,5.0,                       i am a teacher who is currently teaching online  this bag has made it much easier to carry my laptop and other work related items between school and home  there s a great deal of space inside  i plan to purchase another for travel  it will be perfect for quick trips or as a carry on bag      
466,5.0,                       this is a really nice backpack for travel   room for my tablet with keyboard and purse items   i carry a small cross body for my destination   this is a great buy   functional  attractive floral design  sturdy      
467,5.0,                       this backpack is amazing  it was so easy to travel carry on only as my suitcase fit in overhead and thus fit under the seat  i m picky about not putting any stuff on the floor where so many feet have been  but this allows me to spray clean and wipe it off when i get home  it opens wide at the top and is easy to load up  i honestly can t say enough good stuff about this pack and plan to buy one for each of my kids and grands for their christmas present this year  note  i never bother to write reviews but this item deserved one  buy and be happy you did      
468,4.0,                       gave it to my great granddaughter  on her    birthday for her laptop and she was wild over the look  reminded her of her sr  prom dress     
469,5.0,                       this bag is pretty darn fantastic  the color pattern was exactly as shown in the pictures  i was concerned about the fabric feeling like a cheap nylon backpack because it s waterproof  but it was a nice quality  i love the hub for the charger  since my phone is always dying  the bag has tons of pockets  inside and out  i love keeping my id card holder  sunglasses  chapstick  etc all tucked in pockets because they get lost at the bottom of my bag and there s more than enough room for everything to have a place  the laptop sleeve looked small but my     laptop fit right in  i could put in my laptop  all my normal junk from my purse  a water bottle  and still have a ton more room  this bag is just about perfect      
470,5.0,                       for the price i love it  i would pay     more to have better quality zippers and lining fabric  but everything else about it is amazing with so many pockets and sections it s easy to keep everything organized      
471,5.0,                       this backpack is perfect for my daughter in law school  stylish  useful  water resistant  and holds exactly what she needs it too  she is always getting compliments as well  which is a bonus  would recommend this backpack      
472,5.0,                       i bought this backpack to carry my laptop on a trip to florida  not only is it well made  the storage capacity is great   i love the fact it has the built in usb adapter   the material is definitely water resistant   for traveling  the backpack fits perfectly under the seat on the airplane   the woman who was sitting in the seat across the aisle from me complimented me on the backpack and asked where i got it   i m very happy with this purchase      
473,5.0,                       love the color and the storage  super backpack      
474,5.0,                       very nice bag for the price  it s bigger than i thought which is very good for travels  i like that it has only one big section inside and one small only for a laptop  it s super convenient      
475,5.0,                       i bought this backpack not thinking i would really need it  but man i m glad i had it  went on   flights last week and it was beyond handy to have  even if you don t have a laptop  it made everything convenient  boarding passes  passport  wallet  etc  i went with a friend you had a different travel backpack and she ended up returning her s to get this one  the strap to attach to luggage is a huge bonus while traveling  and the front little pocket i love that it is a zipper not just a magnetic flap  feels more secure  i thought i would only use this for travel but now i use it for work with my laptop  side note  if you have a     laptop it will fit into the center but won t zip up all the way as shown in photo   not a lot of people have the giant laptop so i don t think it s a huge deal  i have it and still use it because i love the backpack that much      
476,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i loved the bag overall but the zipper defect really upset me in this one  i got the bag in july and it s already come apart at the seam of the zipper mybe this is my product alone but it s very disappointing bc it s such a wonderful bag     
477,5.0,                       got this for my wife  i though it was maybe going to be small but its big  she loves it  she can fit everything she wants in there lol  she loves how she is able to charge her phone with it  amazing product definitely recommend  will definitely purchase again     
478,5.0,                       i use this bag for work and i have to say it has exceeded my expectations  i saw a few mixed reviews about quality  but the style and setup of storage space was really appealing  so i thought what the heck i ll try it out  i m glad i did  the material is like a coated canvas  which was a pleasant surprise  it has tons of storage  the doctor bag style opening makes it super easy to take things in and out  i also like that of i have anything over sized i can leave the top open and use the carry handles  the color is stunning  very vibrant  when i got the bag i did note that the box was heavy  i though maybe i got the wrong product  but no  it was right and the bag just has slight heft  which adds to the quality of materials  for me      
479,5.0,                       this bag was excellent  i bought it for travel but due to covid    i didn t have a use for it any more but i liked it too much to return   gave it to my friend to use as a diaper bag the bag looks exactly as pictured with its beautiful pattern and size  multiple compartments to stay organized  the water resistant pattern   charging port is a added bonus  with the wide opening   its wired so it stays open when needed  i can definitely see my self repurchasing if the world returns to normal      
480,5.0,                       i love this bag  it s pretty  sturdy  and very spacious  very nice  it will fit my laptop easily  and other travel essentials  perfect for a carry on bag  school  and work  i especially love the opening at the top and the carry handles  i may buy another one for a gift      
481,5.0,                       i ve gotten many compliments with this backpack fits all my needs  the zipper however broke and wasn t able to close  the seller kindly reached out to me  definitely great customer service wasn t expecting to get a replacement  the backpack is worth it and the seller makes me rate higher  thank you     
482,5.0,                       got this for college  looks great  and fits everything nicely  even has a spot for laptop  and a charging port for phone      
483,5.0,                       i receive my package just   days  i opened it and i simply loved it and i could pack some great few things i need  i always take it to work with me  on my full day i love the black and red roses  hey it s must buy  even it s a lot better then carrying a purse      
484,5.0,                       this is a very nice backpack i love the way it stands up  the top stays open so that it is easy to work out of and the laptop pocket is great i haven t used the charging port but i do like that feature      
485,5.0,                       yes i gave   stars because of the space and the pretty print but the back is already tearing i m not happy at all       
486,5.0,                       i loved this backpack  it was like a marry poppins bag in the inside there is so much space  i am overall really pleased with the product it looked very similar to the picture  this back pack has   cup holders a charging cable and lots of pockets  i am using my bag for traveling but it could be a diaper bag  a work bag  or a school bag  it is water resistant and would be perfect for any weather condition      
487,5.0,                       this bag is fantastic   i get so many compliments   i work full time  work   days a week doing home care and go to school online   needless to say  i have to carry alot of stuff with me every day   i have been looking for a single bag that can carry everything i need  and this is it   it fits my      in laptop  it s a rather tight fit  but it closes fine and does not impact the rest of the storage capacity of the bag   it holds my small lunch bag  umbrella  large water bottle  binder  planner and wallet   the outside pocket is great for makeup  pens  and extras   the external charger access is great too   the fact that the top opens wide allows everything to be visible in the bag   it seems to be holding up well after   weeks of heavy loads and daily use  and it has proven to be rain and snow resistant as well   plus its very pretty   love this bag      
488,5.0,                       my mother in law ordered a similar item and so i decided to order one for myself  i frequently have to bring my laptop home from work  love that it has the usb cable built in  the design is super cute  and the fabric zippers seem very durable  i would purchase again without hesitation  also the price point is great  my mil paid almost double and the quality is the same      
489,5.0,                       i love the colors  the lighter color inside makes it easier to see all the way to the bottom  only problem i have is filling this thing too full  heavy     it holds my ipad and computer as well as books and lap board  then there are the outside pockets  side pockets are great for all my different water bottles  love it    handles on top make it easy to manipulate the pack when i m not backpacking  love how this opens up for packing and retrieval  yes  i am well pleased with this backpack  better than any i ve had so far  time will tell how well it wears      
490,5.0,                       amazing and chic laptop bag   i have to carry a laptop for work and had been searching for something with a classy handbag look to it   i received mine today and it actually better that what i expected   it s large  extremely durable  space effecient  and beautiful all at the same time   i love it and highly recommend this product      
491,5.0,                       i m quite impressed with the quality of this backpack  it has ample storage for a multitude of items  the zippers are heavy duty  the waterproof material is perfect for where i live weather wise  and i really like the large side pockets with the sturdy elastic and snap enclosures the little extra features like the rfid protection pocket and built in charger are just icing on the cake i especially love the hinged enclosure at the top giving the bag both structure as well as being an appealing design feature this is day one so i ll update how it holds upto the daily wear i ll be putting it through   i m not kind to my baggage so i have high hopes for this      
492,5.0,                       this is a beautiful computer bag   can use it with handles or as a backpack   my daughter bought this one and had nothing but good things to say about it  so  i purchased one   it is made of a sturdy fabric that i expect will last for many years to come   i would recommend this showy bag to anyone wanting a computer bag with lots of room      
493,5.0,                       this bag was a lot better than i expected   it s really cute  i m glad i went with the pink  so many reviews showed how pretty the pink was  although i originally was going to go for the red flowers   it s big enough that it holds all my clipboards for my classes   i m a teacher and it fits my chrome book plus tons of clipboards  my water bottle and snacks   very happy      
494,5.0,                       besides being super cute and eye catching   this bookbag is really functional and durable  i use it daily between travel and work  it holds up and is fashionable   the usb port for the charging is good too  it allowed me to use my power bank at full capacity   the connection provided didn t slow down the charging speed      
495,5.0,                       i couldn t believe the size  color  quick delivery  amount of room  charging outlet  stitching on all important parts of backpack  big wonderful zippers  plenty of storage  the style of the bag is like unzipping a purse  easy to get to computer  you can carry a computer plus an ipad   can t say enough about this purchase   i bought the blue backpack and i m going back to purchase the black one      
496,4.0,                       i love this backpack so much  i was very disappointed when the bag ripped and the sharp metal bar poked through  it actually ripped my arm open is how i found this  i wish it was a stronger material at least where it s against sharp metal  but i love the storage on this bag  slightly heavy but worth it  wish i could get another but slightly pricey     
497,5.0,                       great bag so far and has tons of room for a one night carry on with room for everything you need for travel or just for a work bag to and from the office or between client offices  i highly recommend this stylish book sack to anyone that needs to carry multiple electronics plus all the extras you need for work or play      
498,5.0,                       this backpack is exactly what i was looking for   as a teacher  i needed a tote to carry my laptop  water cup  coffee cup  papers files and other personal items to and from school every day  this backpack has plenty of storage for all of the above  i especially love that the cup pouches on the outside are expandable with elastic to hold my yeti cup      
499,4.0,                       i travel to conferences for work and also travel for pleasure  this backpack is perfect  it has room for multiple water bottles  my laptop  my ipad  all my travel documents  and more  i love that the backpack is more structured than most backpacks  the design of it makes it able to hold a lot more than usual  and keep it all organized  the floral print is gorgeous  the only  flaw  i d mention is the accent and interior color  i wish it was red or pink instead of a weird yellowish gold  still worth the money      
500,5.0,                       this bag is huge  plenty of space for work  travel  personal items  use as baby bag if you like  several inner pockets and outer for all my needs  pattern is pretty and love it zips from very top  easy  convient  adjustable straps  fabric nice  quality meets expectations  so happy with this purchase  would recommend      
501,5.0,                       this bag is honestly fantastic  it is so spacious  i m currently using it for a work bag because my laptop fits  but i can t wait to use it for travel  the way it opens at the top is also a plus  you can see all your items like in a tote bag  but you have the added luxury of being able to carry it like a backpack  who wants a heavy bag on one shoulder all day  no one    the addition of the luggage strap makes this purchase a no brainer  luggage straps are great so you can securely stack your luggage  if you have a carry on suitcase  or any rolling suitcase  you can just pop this bad boy on top  use it as your personal item  p  and it will be secure and ready to rock      
502,5.0,                       love my bag for college   the charging port actually charges my phone   i highly recommend this for every day use even cause you can charge your phone anywhere and ladies can use as a purse or use for school       
503,5.0,                       i ve had this for over a month now  i carry it to classes two times a week  very stuffed to the max  very heavy load  this bag is absolute perfect  i feel like my complaints are so small they re insignificant but i will list them cause it s a short list  first is that the tiny magnetic snap strap to keep the top handles together does fit around both the straps and stay held shut  with some effort i can get it to just barely stay together but any small jolt causes them to come disconnected  second is that the shoulder straps are a bit narrow for my personal liking  third is that i would have loved to seen some kind of protective hardware on the bottom like those little metal knobs you see on some luggage  but that s just an opinion  my only concern i had pros to buying the bag was that the waterproof material would feel cheap  either to stiff or to flimsy  that is definitely not the case  feels sturdy but not brittle stiff feeling  all in all i love this bag   in the pic i can close the it with my small purse thrown on top on the books and binder      
504,5.0,                       so much better and more beautiful than i expected  expected a thick canvas  but it has a smooth plastic coating  really well made  tons of space  big water bottle pockets and thoughtful pockets inside  i m so happy with this big beautiful bag  love the handles and straps the dislikes i had  that the zippers didn t tinkle together with every step  i wish there was more padding on the back and straps like on my other school bags that are more male marketed      
505,5.0,                       i use this as my work bag   it has great storage capacity and makes it easy to get my stuff around  i do a lot of walking at work and have to carry a laptop and documents for tracking behaviors and health      
506,5.0,                       my daughter loves this for college   thank you     
507,4.0,                       i got this as a gift for a friend of mine  she was really happy with the way that it looks  and the fact that it has a built in chargers is really helpful  she goes to college so it s really convenient to have be able to charge her phone this way rather than be stuck to some outlet  i gave   stars on each category because it hasn t been in use long enough to really give   stars for traveling  water resistance  and durability  but it s looking good so far      
508,2.0,                       this bag is heavy without anything in it  it s going back so i can t really speak to the durability     
509,5.0,                       i ve been using this as my work bag and i really like it so far  i bought it two months ago and it shows no sign of wear and tear  i especially like that the top opens so wide so it s easy to find things stored inside  it has enough separate compartments to be helpful without being so many that you can t find what you re looking for  also  the side pockets open really wide so they fit even my widest water bottle  i will eventually be using it on work trips as my carry on so i like that it has the horizontal strap on the back so it can slide over a rolling suitcase s handle  i wonder  though  if the stiff handles will stick out when i try to put it under the seat in front of me on a plane  either way  i would definitely recommend this bag      
510,5.0,                       i bought this backpack because it looked really cute and my last one was falling to pieces  it arrived in the mail really fast and i just opened it and it seemed to be really high quality  i am a little shocked though  to how small the package was but it all seemed to fit  i think it was worth the            
511,5.0,                       this backpack is awesome  it holds so much  it has a separate pocket for your ipad or laptop so you don t have to have it on top of all of your other things  it s very well made  the best part is the charger port on the outside of the backpack  just plug in your portable charger to the cords on the inside and then plug your phone cord to the outside  no more having to hold your bulky charger  this backpack has made my life so much more organized and i highly recommend      
512,4.0,                       i really like it  its really sturdy  its too heavy for me and bigger than i expected  i use it as a diaper bag  hurt my back after  hrs of walki g around with it      
513,1.0,                       i was sooo excited to purchase this bag after seeing a coworker with one  it is beautiful and  i thought  really well made and sturdy for the price  however  i have been using this bag less than one week  carrying my macbook air  a binder  and a couple notebooks  and one of the steps has ripped already  i still love the design  but all of that is useless if i can t actually use the bag     i am sad that this bag won t be around as long as i had hoped when purchasing such a stylish item

515,5.0,                       love this bag  fits everything i need for work and then some  love the pattern and the water resistance material  the straps could be a bit more comfortable  but overall very happy with the bag      
516,5.0,                       i really like the idea of this backpack   i bought it for my sister who is in college and she absolutely loves it   she is able to fit her computer    in macbook air  and several books in this backpack along with lots of other items   having the usb charge port on the outside is such a great idea   i am very happy with this purchase   my sister is super happy with the bag      
517,5.0,                       it was better then expected  i spent several days looking through backpacks over and over again  just trying to pick the best one  it has several pockets and it is very spacious  absolutely love this bag         
518,5.0,                       as a college senior i usually only carry a few items all around campus  my laptop  chargers  notebook  pens pencils  and a water bottle   i was using a cute tote before but it was killing my shoulders  this bag was the perfect solution and worth the price for me it all fits  and the doctor bag opening was honestly a selling point for me  the structure of the backpack keeps everything in place and avoids that sagging weight that a lot of unstructured backpacks have  it s like carrying a comfortable and conveniently sized box on your back  but without looking like you need to be professionally evaluated i ll try to update this review to see how it lasts after some use  so far  it s a spacious backpack and it holds my       laptop with an inch or so to spare  the weight distribution is great  it feels light and i like the spacious side pockets  the material is very smooth and soft very comfortable to touch i got this because it looks beautiful  the color is the same as the picture  without color difference and i would recommend it since it is very fashion and functional      
519,5.0,                       this bag is perfect to use for work  my laptop fits perfectly  there are plenty of pockets throughout and is very roomy  the pattern is very pretty and looks just like the pictures  love it      
520,5.0,                       absolutely love this bag  the quality is amazing  i love the vibrancy of the flowers  i also love how the bag opens so wide to accommodate all of your stuff and also so you can easily see where things are  great bag  great price      
521,4.0,                       i was looking for a backpack with more storage pockets and this fits the bill  there are interior pockets   with padding for ipads  kindle  etc  and pockets in the outer zipper compartment  it isn t really fabric  but more of a waterproof vinyl type material great for commutes in bad weather  i m not sure how long it will hold up under significant wear  but it suits my purpose
