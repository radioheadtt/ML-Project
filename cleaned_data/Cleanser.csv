0,5.0,                       i love this facewash for combo to dry skin  it s cleansing and easy and doesn t really smell like anything  doesn t strip away oil as much as other cleansers      
1,5.0,                       i got tired of buying  high end products  that did not work  i have sensitive skin and was getting worse acne from trying so many products  this face wash cleared up my skin completely within a week  great price  and really works      
2,2.0,                       while it is very moisturizing and rinses well  it does not remove the slightest amount of makeup  which makes you wonder how clean it makes your face  secondly  i might get a pimple once or twice a month  if at all  however  after using this for a week  many pimples popped up on my chin around my mouth  i discontinued it and the acne went away  because i love cerave s other products  i tried again after three weeks  same thing happened  broke out around my chin  my skin is normal  i was disappointed  especially as it is not cheap and i have to throw away the entire bottle      
3,4.0,                       i absolutely loved this facial cleanser  it is super hydrating and also helps with acne  it doesn t really have a scent to it though so if that matters to you  i wouldn t get it  it s also nice because a little bit of product goes a looong way  this bottle will last you a long time  definitely nice for dry or normal to dry skin      
4,5.0,                       i absolutely love this face wash  i have been using it on my face and body for months now and i always feel clean and moisturized  there isn t a scent which i prefer and the bottle lasts a really long time  would buy again      
5,4.0,                       it s one of the most suggested products around and that is why i purchased it  it s a great smooth cleanser and does it s job well  it s also a great deal price wise  the only issue i am encountering with this is that  upon squeezing the pump it spurts out straight at you instead of falling in your hand      
6,5.0,                       great for sensitive skin  keeps skin supple      
7,5.0,                       was highly recommend to me by a pediatrician i work with for my daughters skin that started to break out  mainly her t zone  and i saw how well it started to work and it keeps her skin moisturized my daughter said she noticed her skin doesn t feel dry anymore  so i started to use it to help with my  mask ne  and definitely giving this   stars  i use it everyday  highly recommend      
8,4.0,                       my skin is extremely sensitive and prone to adult acne  especially mid cycle  as well as turning brilliant shades of red when using many so called gentle cleansers and lotions  my forehead flakes from dryness no matter how much moisturizer i use  i have tried cetaphil and now cerave  i used cerave for a long time and was pretty pleased with the results until i found a new cleanser that was even better for my super sensitive skin type  marcelle ultra gentle cleansing gel   i won t go back to cerave again  but it was cheaper than marcelle      
9,5.0,                       super gentle and moisturizing  my face never feels striped or tight after using  no harsh smells  i have delicate skin in the fact anything dries me out  this does not do that  it is amazing for dry skin  if you have oily skin this might not be the best option for you  people with dry skin buy this  it does not break me out at all     
10,4.0,                       i originally bought this to use to remove my makeup thinking it would be emollient enough to break it down   the mascara i use is the fiber tubing kind that is removed with just water   but i thought this would create some  slip  so that i wouldn t be tugging on my eye area too much  that s a no no at my age   it doesn t provide as much slip as i was hoping   but it is better than nothing   i think cetaphil has more slip  after my mascara is removed from my lashes   i lightly tissue it off  i used to then wet my face and massage   pumps onto the rest of my skin  doing this  i noticed that it was not removing my makeup if i rinsed it off and it felt like it mixed with the makeup and created a film  i would tissue this off  then do a second cleanse with a foaming wash like the cerave foaming cleanser or dove bar to get the residue off  what i have learned is to massage this on dry skin   this seems to make it more effective in removing makeup   i am then able to rinse it off  i still do a second cleanse  but i would do this anyway because i also use my clarsonic during this stage  on days that i don t wear makeup   i will use just this to wash my face  i wet it with water first because i am not removing long wear makeup  and not do a second wash   i do feel that it keeps my face soft after using it  i wish it was more smooth when massaging it onto the skin   but i can feel that it is adding a layer of moisture barrier on my skin   i have oily skin  but i could definitely see this helping keep drier skin more moisturized      
11,5.0,                       the fluid is much thicker and clearly hydrating my skin  unlike the cetaphil cleanser i ve been using for years  i actually enjoy washing my face using this face wash  completely fragrance free  i feel like i m really treating my skin well with it      
12,5.0,                         stars but you already knew that  before i discovered this cleanser  i was using dove for my face constantly breaking out and now i have scars from acne and all along it was the dove wash that was causing it  cerave saved my skin      
13,5.0,                       i love cerave  i ve used this product and their moisturizing cream product on my sensitive  combination  acne prone face for years with good results  i tried quite a few higher end products before settling on cerave and none of them even compare      
14,4.0,                       takes off make up easily and leaves my face soft and clean  i do have sensitive skin if product has too much perfume  this has none   no burning or redness  have i tried better face washes  yes  but for the price  this works  worth a try      
15,5.0,                       i bought this product for my husband to wash his face with on a daily basis to help get rid of rosacea  he has used it daily for a couple of months now and i apply prescription metronidazole topical cream after that  his rosacea is gone   this gentle cleanser has really helped the healing process      
16,2.0,                       none of their cleansers have worked for me  this one is no different pros  it doesn t dry my skin out or smell bad cons  made me break out even more than i current am  i ve been struggling with adult cystic acne  ever since i got off birth control years ago  i was hoping this cleanser would help  but now i have tiny white heads all over my face on top of the usual cystic acne i ve been trying to get rid of      
17,5.0,                       try this out  dermatologists recommend it for a reason  we have a tendency to want to go for things that look fancy or for the products in sephora or ulta or the department stores  trust me i m guilty as well  but  not when it comes to my skin care  when it comes to skincare i lean more towards the recommendations of dermatologists and estheticians  i ve received more  drugstore  recommendations than anything and cerave comes highly recommended  i m    years old and i am so happy with my skin that i go out with no make up  just moisturiser and sunscreen      
18,1.0,                       buyer beware  counterfeit product made me break out  it would have been easier to pick up from the store and save myself the headache      
19,5.0,                       i ve used the cerave hydrating face wash for a month now and it s really helped clear my skin up along with a few other products  it really helps clean make up and dirt off your face  when it goes over your lips it feels a little bit like chapstick as well  that s how hydrating it is  another plus is that it smells like nothing  so if your skin is anything like mine and can t handle scented products   this is for you however  because i have very sensitive skin and it has left a few whiteheads every now and then but nothing that was too crazy or couldn t be taken care of  i think it can be a hit or miss with people but it worked well for my very dry skin      
20,5.0,                       my daughter asked for this and has me using it too  it works great and doesn t cause any reactions for us      
21,5.0,                       my coworker always pointed out that my face was breaking out  even after informing her of what i was using  she recommended this for a while and i finally broke down and bought it  i wish i had listened  i notice less breakouts and i only get flare ups when i don t use it      
22,5.0,                       the best cleaner i have ever had for my dry skin     
23,1.0,                       like other buyers say this product feels like lotion  and does not clean your face at all  i think the seller might have just put some non scenting lotion in the bottle because it s horrible  don t waste your money  get it from the store      
24,5.0,                       i like how detailed the instructions are   they tell you the water should be lukewarm  put a little on your face first  and rub in circles away from your eyes  i just ate a burger and washed my face after when i feel very greasy   this made my skin feel so much better  i noticed my lips were chapped after and i needed chap stick  so maybe this isn t      top scorer on moisturizing   just use moisturizer and chap stick and it s fine   i won t know for a while if this helps fix my skin irritation problems      
25,1.0,                       i don t normally spend time writing reviews  but i felt others should be warned after reading similar reviews  i decided to try this product  i felt the complaints about the product not actually cleansing might by biased by people with higher standards than i i was wrong there is something very off with this product  it smells and feels normal  but as soon as you apply it to your face  some kind of weird oily residue seeps down  i can feel it on my lips every time  after washing away the product  there is still oil left to the touch in the t zone  and i do not have excessively oily skin   i tried using the product multiple washes and multiple times  same effect it s ridiculous when you have to wash your face with  another  cleanser because this one doesn t work im switching back to the regular cerave  avoid the hydrating one at all costs      
26,5.0,                       the only facial cleanser that does not dry my face  have been using this for the last   years and at my age of     it even improved the texture of my skin  thank you cerave      
27,5.0,                       love this  i use am and pm as the first step in my skincare regimen  it is cleansing without drying out my skin  i do have sensitive skin and i have had no reactions to this formula  my new favorite product      
28,5.0,                       i have extremely sensitive skin and since becoming pregnant  i have broken out so bad  i wouldn t recommend this to remove any makeup and would say to make sure you use remover wipes before washing your face  my acne has cleared up quite a bit since using this and you get a really decent amount out  all you need is about a half a pump for your entire face so i can see this lasting a while      
29,5.0,                       i love this face wash  my maskne was getting really bad then i started using this every time i shower and now my skin is clear again  it s very gentle and feels good when you put it on  i will definitely keep using this stuff      
30,5.0,                       i love this face wash  i have repurchased this for   years now  it s very hydrating and does not strip your skin or leave it tight and dry after use  i do take off my makeup first with a makeup wipe or micellar water  which i would do no matter what cleanser i use  then i follow up with this cleanser and i have no issues with the cleanse i get  would      recommend especially for dry or sensitive skin  but you can use it on all skin types       
31,5.0,                       i am starting to take better care of my skin and with cerave i am noticing a difference for my oily and sensitive skin      
32,5.0,                       i like that it is not scented  gentle  and does not leave my skin stripped  it cleanses but leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated unlike a lot of cleansers out there  i buy the biggest container so i can use both on my face and as body wash  i love how long it lasts and how gentle it is      
33,5.0,                       this has worked better to clear my    year old son s skin than proactive at a fraction of the cost  it is also gentle enough for my    year old daughter s sensitive skin      
34,1.0,                       i bought this thinking it would help with acne  the acids in it are specifically supposed to clear out black heads but instead i ended up with  what i assume was a chemical  burn  my face was red and radiated heat for about   days after my last use  it stayed dry and after copious amounts of thick moisturizer it started to flake off and heal i m extremely disappointed because of the price i paid for it and that it s basically trash after a couple days of using it i isolated this product  i never used anything else that was new or irritating to my skin  and it slightly burned when applying it  so i can tell you with full confidence that this product is trash  dont waste your money     
35,5.0,                       works great for super dry and sensitive skin  i struggled to find the right cleanser and this one was a savior  my skin has improved so much after using this  it does not lather and does not have a fragrance  however  it does not clean away makeup on it s own so it is required to wipe of makeup before using this cleanser      
36,5.0,                       i have dry sensitive skin so i never really use any products for my face because i always break out with how sensitive i am and this is great  it goes on kind of like lotion which i m still getting use to  i only wish it got soapy when putting it on  i think it s funnier that way lol my skin usually has dry patches all over my face but not since i ve been using this  overall this is great and i ll definitely be purchasing again      
37,5.0,                       what can i say  it s the perfect no nonsense cleanser for my dry ish skin  it doesnt leave my skin feeling stripped  cerave may not be the most flashy instagramable brand out there  but their ingredients are simple and effective  will purchase again      
38,2.0,                       this was too hydrating for me  i didn t feel clean after washing my face with it and it left a greasy feel  i won t be buying this again      
39,1.0,                       my husband really likes the foaming cleanser so i thought i would give this a try  not a fan of the scent and my face doesn t feel super clean after washing  but that might be because it doesn t foam at all  so if you are looking a cleanser that foams look elsewhere  this product is more like cetaphil      
40,5.0,                       i waited a while to really use this before writing a review  i normally have very oily skin but lately i ve been getting severe dry patches on my nose  lip and chin  i ve done alot of research and tried a few different gentle hydrating cleansers with no luck  i decided to give this a try after reading the wonderful reviews  it worked almost immediately to get rid of the dry patches  it is great  and does not make my face more oily  my skin looks the best it had in a long time  it s smooth and looks very healthy  this stuff is amazing   will buy again  great value      
41,5.0,                       when i was younger  i had oily skin  now that i m older it s more dry  but i still get some pimples  i also have very sensitive skin  especially on my face  this is the best cleanser that i ve ever used  i wash my face two times before bed  using a microfiber cloth  the first time gets off most all of the makeup  but i wash it one more time just to make sure   i use full coverage foundation and concealer   honestly  i have really good intentions to use moisturizer  but i skip it most of the time  this cleanser is enough once i accidentally purchased their other cleanser that is formulated for oily skin  but i broke out  i think it may have over dried my skin  and my skin over compensated  i went back to this  and it cleared right up cerave is a great company  and i really like almost everything i ve used of theirs  sunscreen  moisturizer  lotion   i tried them first when my dermatologist recommended them  compared to a lot of other beauty cleansers  you can t beat the price  this  like all cerave products  is fragrance free  since fragrances tend to irritate sensitive skin  i don t notice any smell at all if you are thinking about trying it  i would recommend  it works great for me  and i recommend it to all of my friends      
42,5.0,                       this is it  my doctor recommended this cleanser for my daughter s acne prone sensitive skin  everyone in my house ended up loving it and we won t use anything else fyi  it goes on damp skin like a lotion and is rinsed off  there are no suds or bubbling  it is not soap  it is a lotion type cleanser great for sensitive skin and no scent     
43,1.0,                       generally  i like this line   however  when i used this cleanser  it stung my skin   i thought that it might have been a fluke or a negative reaction to some makeup residue  but the second time it stung worse   then  after reader by the ingredients more carefully  i discovered that this cleanser contains alcohol   furthermore  most products which are gels  of which ch this is one  contain alcohol  which has a dehydrated by effect on skin  while the marketing often promotes the product as preferred for dry  sensitivity be skin since it glides on so easily   i now avoid all gels  as well as any other product containing alcohol  for use on my face  neck or d collet   and i encourage others with dry  sensitive skin of any age  to do the same   after all  dermatologists are not perfectly knowledgeable   they  practice  medicine just like all their other colleagues      
44,1.0,                       i don t recommend this specific cerave hydrating face wash  first  it feels like washing with lotion  it does not foam at all  and my face doesn t feel clean after using it  it also caused my face to have minor breakouts too  i ve tried other cerave cleansers  e g  renewing sa cleanser  that one cleans a bit too well  and it makes my face feels a bit tight after use  i ve also tried the foaming facial cleanser  that one i think works the best  it foams really well  feels clean  but doesn t make my face feel tight overall  i would rank foaming facial cleanser the best   renewing sa cleanser    cerave hydrating face wash it s just a really bad formula  don t waste your money on this      
45,5.0,                       this stuff has saved my skin  i have dry skin and it has given me the hydration i need  it is also so gentle and has no scent  which i love  i have sensitive skin and this product has never irritated it      
46,5.0,                       this helped me with my break outs so much  i have dry skin during the winter and greasy skin during the summer  i started using this in the summer months  along with tons of water    and my skin cleared right up  in the winter it s moisturizing so if i forget my actual moisturizer it s not that big of a deal i love it      
47,5.0,                       i have had dry skin around my eyes recently but i am hoping its just winter   i switched from cetaphil which is touted for oily skin  using this once a day is causing redness and burning  starting to dry other areas of my face      
48,5.0,                       i ve had issues with previous cleansers that dry out the skin  but this one keeps my skin feeling hydrated after washing it  and i follow up with the hydrating moisturizer      
49,1.0,                       something is wrong with this product because it smells exactly like warm beer  i know this can t be normal  other people in the  questions  section have said the same exact thing  and suggested that something may have fermented  these comments were over   months ago  so they should really look into what s going on      
50,1.0,                       for some reason this face wash broke my skin out in rashes  i had no idea why my face would keep getting a rash  but as soon as i stopped using this  it was gone  it may work wonders for others  but not for my skin      
51,1.0,                       this is not the real product  whatever amazon sold me has been causing a burning sensation my skin during use  not to a dangerous extent  and smells different  after reading reviews for this product from shoppers who seemingly have had the same experience  i see that the packaging does differ on this bottle from a previously purchased bottle from cvs  seems similar at first glance but many discrepancies if you look closely  wtf      
52,5.0,                       my dermatologist recommended this to me and i ve been using ever since i got that recommendation a few years ago  a little pricey and not my favorite scent  really there is no scent  but it does do its job and this is the exact bottle you d find in stores      
53,3.0,                       certainly doesn t irritate  but i never felt like i got fully clean  or like it fully rinsed off  if it got on my lips at all  it left a filmy  oily sensation that drove me up a wall  as a skincare junkie  i hate myself for saying it  but i preferred the glossier cleanser to this  hides head in hands  if you need something super gentle and aren t really looking to get  super clean   say  an am cleanse   this could do  the ingredients list is impeccable  but it just didn t do anything helpful for me      
54,5.0,                       i ve been using this cleanser for a few weeks now  because i have oily skin  i used to avoid overly hydrating skin care products  turns out that was a mistake     for me now that i m treating my skin in a more gentle manner  my oil production has significantly decreased  and my overall skin health is much much better  i didn t realize how dehydrated my skin actually was due to all the oil i was producing  i don t think my skin has ever been this healthy now that i m using the cerave cleanser and moisturizer  i m way less oily now      
55,2.0,                       i bought this because of all the great reviews  i want impressed though  it doesnt take off makeup very well  i even washed twice  making sure i really go over everything  there was still a lot left over  personally i want something that will take off my makeup and be good for my skin  when i wash without makeup  it feels nice  doesnt lather too much but its enough  if you use a separate product to remove your makeup  then this would be nice      
56,4.0,                       i didn t read the reviews closely enough before i purchased it  i use cerave face moisturizer and like it  this face wash feels like i m washing my face with the moisturizer  it feels like lotion as you wash  there is no lather  just lotion  after trying it out i read the comments more closely and i see that others have said the same thing  that s my fault  i ordered the foaming face wash by cerave and i like it much better  just be aware that it doesn t lather  foam or feel any different than washing your face with lotion before you buy      
57,5.0,                       i ve been using it for a month and my skin feels less dried out  i use it daily and enjoy it  there is no scent  it s smooth and doesn t foam  i will be repurchasing when i run out i used to use foaming cleansers and never realized how dry they made my skin  i thought that was just how it was supposed to be  this has made me see the truth  i could have always been this hydrated      
58,5.0,                       i wrote the review below upon receiving my first bottle  i did notice the review about a suspiciously untrademarked bottle but mine was fine  now i have my second bottle and it is suspect  left in pics   i just used this and my face is tingling unlike when i used my old bottle earlier today  the product felt thinner  which prompted me to inspect the bottle and i m not so sure anymore  this is why i barely order anything from amazon anymore    i ve been figuring out a routine to help my dry acne prone skin out over the past   months  and this cleanser has  turned out to be the final missing piece   it s perfect for daily morning night because it doesn t strip too much away   it is definitely not for removing significant makeup  but is a great follow up post makeup removal   this has helped clear any remaining dry spots and scars from my face   love it      
59,1.0,                       doesn t do anything at all  fraud product      
60,5.0,                       i m a    year old girl with pretty oily skin  i struggled with any form of acne you could think of  i tried numerous dermatologists  different face washes  toners  diets  nothing seemed to work  i m athletic and eat healthy so i knew there was something more than myself  i used to use neutrogena grapefruit face wash everyday day and night for almost two years  i then started looking into it and realized how harmful and harsh the products were in it  for how oily my skin was  i always thought  well why would i ever want to moistorize to add to the oil   yes  i saw a skin care guy who got blown up on tiktok named  skinbyhyram  and when i tell you this man saved my skin  i was amazed  i thought that i needed the harder chemicals out there to kill all my acne when really  i was killing my own skin  he recommended cerave face wash and the blue cerave moisturizer   the moisturizer is a must as well  i started doing this day and night and after a month  my skin was so clear  yes i get the occasional zit here and there but nothing nearly to waking up everyday to a few  the simpler you are your skin  the better it can heal it self   disclaimer  not all skins are the same so sometimes the chemicals is what you need but from personal experience  the harsher the chemical the worse my acne got  one last tip  change your pillowcases   so much dirt and oil are on them that you don t even know  i exchange or wash mine at least     times a week      
61,4.0,                       i purchased this product because i was tired of my face drying out after face washes  i compared this product with the alternative foaming facial cleanser prior to purchasing  i didn t purchase the foaming version because i heard that those actually cause your skin to become dry after wash pro  the facewash is easy on the skin and does not foam up at all  this is great for sensitive skins  but hard to get used to at first  the pumping feature is great because i can consistently control the amount of the product every time i use it  two pumps of the facewash are ideal for me no artificial fragrancecon  as i mentioned  this product does not foam up at all  and the consistency is sort of like gel lotion  this was hard to get used to at first because it felt kind of gross  if you cannot get over the this fact then do not purchase overall this is a great face wash  no smell  no foam  but cleans your skin in a gentle manner  highly recommend if you have dry or sensitive skin      
62,5.0,                       i love this cleanser and it was recommended to me by my dermatologist  she told me not to bother spending a lot of money on high priced creams when this has the right anti aging ingredients at a very affordable price  i keep one in the shower and one under the sink  it s creamy but light and not greasy  it rinses off easily      
63,1.0,                       not for sensitive skin   it s definitely not a everyday use type of item which is what i was looking for  it dried out my skin and it left it red and more sensitive  i stopped using it everyday and use it maybe   or twice a week and it still left my skin dry and sensitive i really wanted to like this item but it just didnt work for me i have more to dry skin  which this product says it s meant for but not true     
64,5.0,                       works great for cleansing with hydration  love how it feels and the fact it is unscented  will be purchasing it again        
65,5.0,                       ok so i have very sensitive  oily skin  i am in my mid    s and i m told i look about        i ve stayed away from the sun  i use retin a nightly  in the past couple of months i ve been experiencing dry skin  who s is uncommon for me  this was recommended by the dermatologist dr  dray  go look up her youtube channel she is great   this has been my morning face was for a month now and in a matter of just a few days it fixed my dry skin  it leaves my skin clear and baby soft  it s definitely gonna be my cold season go to face wash  no fragrance      
66,5.0,                       this product definitely does clean my skin and it has been overall a pleasure to use  i will likely just subscribe to this cleanser in the future  maybe there is a better one but  not at this price  ya yeet     
67,5.0,                       no smell so it should be good for your skin   you will see the result in around   weeks  you should use twice a day  morning and night   the product delivered on time in the next day  amazing product      
68,1.0,                       i wear a light tinted moisturizer instead of foundation  cerave does not even wash this product from my face  it is gentle  yes  and only lightly scented  but if it s called a cleanser  it should serve the purpose of washing my face  otherwise  why use it  do not recommend      
69,5.0,                       i highly recommend using an exfoliating silicon washcloth which seems to help it remove excess oil dirt after a long day outside or exposed to the elements just using my hands it doesn t feel as effective  however  i love how soft and buttery this feels  i would almost tend to not describe it as a wash because that brings to mind to me soapy  foamy washes anyways  great product my only wish is that the pumping mechanism was a bit more pronounced because it s relatively low to the bottle so you have to pump a few times to get the required amount      
70,5.0,                       i am very satisfied with this purchase  i use to do a      step face washing routine morning and night  i still have issues with acne and dry skin  i decided to switch just to cerave  sunscreen  and moisturizer  i ve noticed a considerable difference      
71,4.0,                       i struggle with my skin in the dry  cold of winter so i wanted to try something new i like that this is fragrance free and feels nice on my skin  it does seem to help a bit with the dryness  but i don t feel  clean  after washing my face  i think the texture of the cleanser makes me feel that way  since it feels more like i m trying to scrub my face with lotion i will keep this in rotation with additional exfoliation and see how things go  but for now  i m not sure it would be my go to      
72,5.0,                       very good for sensitive skin and fragrance free  i love that it moisturizes my skin while washing too  i haven t had any breakouts yet since using it      
73,5.0,                       this is the best moisturizer out there  the moisturizer is not greasy and is great also for hick make up removal      
74,5.0,                       i love this cleanser so much  it helped my acne a lot and i would definitely recommend and buy this product again      
75,1.0,                       when i received my cerave it was in a box with other items and it was spilled onto those other items luckily they were wrapped in plastic and protected however i lost over half of my facial cleanser  i m very disappointed and won t be ordering ever again      
76,5.0,                       this stuff is like magic  as a male  i ve never used a facial cleanser before  but i saw this mentioned on reddit so figured i d give it a shot it does tend to make my face a bit oily several hours after use  but aside from that  everyone keeps telling me i look younger after i began using it  several female friends have told me they re jealous of my skin  which is a fantastic compliment give it a shot  how it works for you  i use it just once per day after i shower and it seems to be doing the job      
77,4.0,                       long story short trying to focus on my face skin health  always used the same harsh acne washes  heard good things about cerave and decided to give it a try  i really like the feel of this stuff  it goes on super easy and washes off clean  while i think my skin feels clean afterwards it s so gentle i m just not sure  this is probably a good thing   have not used this long enough to determine if it s too gentle or the lack of anti acne ingredient will lead to worse skin or not  but in terms of usability it s great so far  living in a dry climate i feel safe using this  x a day and not worrying about drying out      
78,2.0,                       so for me i did not like the product it didn t help me at all  the only thing good about it is i have very sensitive skin to the point where most cleansers i use sting my face a lot  so i was happy it at least didn t sting my face the sent wasn t bad either  and i gess my face felt more mosterized but around the same time i started using face cream more often so idk which it was  but it didn t help with my acne but i hope it will work for others      
79,4.0,                       i like it so far  it does moisturize my skin very good  some people say it doesn t remove make up   well  first of all it s not make up remover  even though it actually works great for me  i don t wear much make up though  some foundation  mascara  eyeliner  remover them well  tested with white towel      
80,2.0,                       i m really not sure this is a real cerave product  the cleanser doesn t remove makeup and tre texture seems off  prob won t buy again from amazon     
81,1.0,                       product did not come with a seal  even then the pump was open and some product leaked in the box  there is no trademark sign on the side of the bottle  even though the seller is mentioned as cerave and on their website the picture shows a trademark on the side         
82,5.0,                       this moisturizer is great to use for sensitive skin  doesn t really have a scent and it goes on smooth  would recommend to      
83,1.0,                       i thought i bought moisturizer by accident but it has cleanser on the bottle  it doesn t really lather up so it feels like i m not getting clean but maybe that s the way its supposed to be  not sure  i gave it away because i just don t like it      
84,5.0,                       i have really dry skin  this is a better alternative for me than soap  i like it and will buy it again      
85,5.0,                       the product is as advertised  no mistakes  at first it felt odd not having a soap that lathers  it was like lotion on your face  however  look no further as this lotion is the best cleanser for moderate to dry skin  i highly recommend this if you have mild acne and the normal cheapo cleansers  neutrogena  clean n clear etc  dry your skin and dont improve your condition  usually the other cleansers would physically feel like i m treating my skin with chemicals  this doesn t      
86,5.0,                       does a good job of cleaning the face and leaving it feeling hydrated  there doesn t seem to be any particular fragrance  nor foaming foam  which some may find disconcerting  just smooth  clean skin  feel free to spend more money on products with perfumes and foaming agents if that makes you feel better  but this will do the job as well      
87,5.0,                       hands down  this is the best face wash for all skin types  i used to swear by dermologica  which i still think is a good product  but this face wash is less expensive and i just get more out of it  it doesn t strip my face of moisture  and gets off my tough makeup at the end of the day  i really like this product and know you will to      
88,5.0,                       i m on my second bottle  and can t live without this creamy  unscented cleanser  my skin has never felt or looked better     
89,5.0,                       this wash is definitely worth a try  i know you re going to see some reviews such as it not feeling like it s cleansing or leaving you too oily but understand this  hydrating facial washes are better for those who have dry dehydrated skin and those who live in dry heat environments  i just moved from virginia to california and needed a new wash because cetaphil wasn t making the cut for the sudden change  no  i didn t experience a burning sensation using this wash which was also noted in some reviews  and i m someone with very sensitive skin  the company selling this is directly cerave  you re getting it straight from the manufacturer so even if the bottling is off i would give them a little credit  this soap is a milky non lathering solution that looks like watery lotion  but leaves your face feeling soft and refreshed after a wash  do your research on what kind of facial cleanser your skin needs before buying  if you re looking for hydration then you re in the right place      
90,5.0,                       the consistency and feel of the cereve is much nicer than cetaphil  the cereve cleanses my face much better and removes my makeup  i recommend this product      
91,4.0,                       this stuff is so good to wash your face with  tried many others but this one is the best one i have found       
92,1.0,                       i would like to say off the bat that i used to love cerave as a brand  and their moisturizing cream and this hydrating facial wash were vital in my skincare routine  however  when i used this  thinking that it was the same hydrating facial cleanser that i bought  religiously  in the past  my skin afterward was very red and bumpy  i don t have sensitive skin  and this facial cleanser has worked for me in the past    but i tried it again thinking that maybe it was something i ate the first time around  and my face got the same bumps and redness again safe to say i won t be using it anymore  and the brand i so loved changed something in their product  on to finding my next face cleanser now  because this brand has officially dissuaded me into buying their products anymore      
93,4.0,                       so far so good  i have pretty sensitive skin and waste a lot of money on buying things that hurt my skin and have to give away or throw out  i easily get a rash from products thay do not agree witj my skin  i have used dermologica face cleanser and i love it  but it is so expensive  i would say this is comparable and     the cost  it is not drying  is either not scented or lighrly scented   which i perfer   is mositizong  feels good going on and my skin feels good  i have been using it for about a week  i read a few diffrent articles about good gentle face washes and this came up everytime  i will have to see how my skin looks in a few weeks to dertimibe how useful it is for how my skin looks      
94,5.0,                       story time    i m    years old and i ve always had dry skin  prone to stretch marks  slight translucent  and occasional karatosis pilaris  red  hard bumps  looks like mild acne on arms  chest  back  and butt  leg s    as a teen i never wore shorts because it was embarrassing not to have soft legs  they didn t look bad  they just were kinda matte even with lotion  recently i bought cerave body wash and lotion at the store  my skin looked better  felt better  was so soft and normal  my bumps are gone  after a few glasses of wine i got on amazon and ordered a bunch of cerave products to try them out  i got the bar soap  face wash  bumpy skin lotion  bumpy body wash  the dark blue container for extremely dry skin  the pump jar  the day and night cream  and the vitamin c serum  sober me was happy to see all of these products today  i took a shower and tried different ones and i love them all     no after shower itchy skin from hot water  everything is so soft  no itching or burning from these products  honestly i ve bought so much stuff to help me  even aveeno gave me dry skin  lotion  oil  vaseline  homemade natural stuff whipped up in my kitchen  nothing worked  just from what i got at the store my skin looked like everyone else s  but tonight it has that extra soft shine without being greasy  products just soaked right in and my skin feel s comfortable  some products go better on damp skin  the moisturizing face wash is great but i used it after using the bar soap to remove makeup  the moisturizing face wash doesn t foam up  so sometimes you ll need something extra  but it is super moisturizing  the bar soap is great you have to really work up a lather at first but it s so gentle  and moisturizing  i used it everywhere and when i got out of the shower i wasn t dry and itchy  and this is before lotioning   night cream over vita c serum feels so good  not greasy vita c serum is thin  night cream is not heavy  soaked in quick face is so soft  hang tried the day cream yet  but will tomorrow  go to the drug store and buy a small lotion  if you like it then i highly suggest trying other thing s  maybe before drinking a half bottle of moscato  since i bought so much stuff i m posting the same comment on the other things i bought      
95,5.0,                       i absolutely love this product  i spent so much money on expensive facewash and face creams and nothing worked like this  i always had breakouts on my chin and redness  no matter what products i used  it didn t fix my problem   i bought this cleanse   weeks ago and use every day  i noticed my redness and pimples clearing up in   days  it leaves my skin smooth  healthy and clear  i just order another bottle in case they sell out  cerave please never discontinue this product  i cant thank you enough for making me have confidence again         
96,5.0,                       i have extremely sensitive skin  and this product does not irritate it at all  it takes my sunscreen off  and when i wear makeup  mascara and eyeliner  it removes it pretty easily  makes my skin feel and look great too  i ve been using this product for a couple years now  and i highly recommend it      
97,5.0,                       this cerave is a rich lotion like cleanser  with ceramides          hyaluronic acid and niacinamide  the label says that it is great for normal to very dry skin and that the benefits are to cleanse  hydrate and help restore the protective skin barrier  i can t comment what results it will have to very dry skin but for normal to a little oily in the t zone  this cleanser is amazing and the creamy texture feels nice on the skin  it takes off all my makeup and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and not dry like other cleansers  i love that i can use it on my eyes to take off my mascara  i am hesitant to use other cleansers on my eyes but this one is creamy enough not to do damage to my lashes  i love it      
98,5.0,                       this saved my face  i have horrible perioral dermatitis and my skin flakes a lot  this product paired with the micellar cleansing water helped repair my skins barrier in a weeks time  i ve been struggling with my pod for years now  cannot recommend this enough      
99,1.0,                       the    oz version that i purchased recently is fake  the smell and consistency are different  also  the  reserved  symbol behind the brand name is missing on the side of the bottle  amazon needs to do better  this is the second fake beauty product that i ve received recently      
100,4.0,                       i didn t ever use face wash  i tended to break out because of them  this is gentle  and it is hydrating  i think it is a lot better than cetaphil  which broke my daughter s skin out      
101,5.0,                       it s a face wash  so i wash my face with it intermittently with   others i have  and yes i like it  it s very creamy and gentle but my face feels clean after but not dry      
102,5.0,                       i wash my face in it because it is mild   doesn t make me break out  makes the skin feel very soft  i use it twice a day   then put a moisturizer on  face feels great      
103,2.0,                       so i ve been reading a lot about this product and i decided to give it a try  i honestly don t feel that there was any difference on my skin  i can t even know if it s actually cleansing or not  it s more like a moisturizer     and it has not scent     
104,5.0,                       i gotta say  this is the best line for rosacea  i have tried all kinds of expensive things  but this is the best  non drying  non irritating and affordable  ceramides are very good for the skin and this is the only brand that includes them and is reasonably priced  love this cleanser  the daytime lotion as well as the night cream  thank you cerave      
105,3.0,                       honestly i m sure people do like this i m just not one of them  it makes me feel like my skin isn t getting clean  it s one of those cleansers that has no suds  it feels like i m cleaning with lotion for a moment i thought maybe they accidentally filled this bottle with lotion i don t want to hate on it but it s just not my thing      
106,1.0,                       at first it seems very good for dry skin  maybe it is if you don t wear makeup  i have to wash my face twice to get makeup off even scrubbing with a not so soft bristle facial brush  after that i still have to use toner to get the rest off  this is not waterproof hard to remove makeup either  this is the worst at cleaning your skin after two washings the facial brush still had so much makeup on it  i washed the brush with this cleanser two more times and it was still stained with make up  that never happened with other cleansers  so i went to the kitchen got out my dawn dish soap and cleaned the brush for the third time  this time it was clean with white bristles again  i believe this face wash is more like washing with moisturizing lotion  just doesn t clean your face      
107,4.0,                       super good gentle cleanser  although it is a little thinner than i expected  if you love milky cleansers that do not foam up then this is perfect for you      
108,1.0,                       says for sensitive skin yet made my skin have a burning feeling after using  also made my face red which stayed for quite some time after use  would not recommend       
109,5.0,                       there s isn t a bad thing i can say about this companies products  i ve used a variety of their lines for years with no complaints  i love how light and non harsh this wash is and how it does not over dry my skin  i use this twice a day as part of a routine and will keep it without a doubt as my go to double cleanse routine      
110,5.0,                       my skin is very dry and extremely sensitive   after using this face wash for just a few days i noticed my skin was so moisturized and felt so much better   i love this product   iv been using it for almost a year now    it has no smell which i love due to how sensitive my skin and eyes are to smelly products   i have yet to find a face wash i like more than this one   i tend to venture away to try and find something cheaper but i always go right back to this product   it s a little more than i like to spend but it s honestly worth the money   also this is more of a lotion type wash    it doesn t sud up       
111,5.0,                       by far my fave cleanser  i have rosacea and sensitive skin  i also have combination skin  this is the only cleanser that leaves my face feeling moisturized but not greasy and doesn t irritate my sensitive skin      
112,5.0,                       this cleanser is amazing  let me tell you why     no fragrance  but smells actually pretty good on it s own    never leaves my skin tight or dry    hyram approved   super affordable compared to other cleansers i ve tried    has hyaluronic acid  which draws the moisture from the air into your skin    the best for dry skin  but is great for any skin type xoxo a very happy skincare fanatic     
113,5.0,                       i have used this two times and i can already notice a difference in the moisture in my skin  my skin on my face is very dry and red  this product has already helped lessen the redness as well  this face cleanser is not a lathering type  it is more of a lotion moisturizer type  i really enjoy it though  it is also great for sensitive skin like mine  it has not caused any irritation  it is also fragrant free  or at least i couldn t smell really anything  i would highly recommend this face wash  remember though this is not a makeup remover  i would remove your makeup first then go back in and wash your face with this      
114,2.0,                       this is supposed to be a face wash but it acts more like a facial cream than a facial cleanser wash   there is something off with the consistency of the soap  it is not soapy enough and does not clean well  just kind of covers everything up  this is a good brand so maybe i got a bad batch or something  will be returning      
115,1.0,                       it doesn t have the trade mark sign like all other cerave bottles  it broke me out super bad  i don t think it s a legit product      
116,5.0,                       i have really dry skin and usually face washes dry out my skin to the point where it gets a bit flakey  haven t been using this cleanser for that long  but my boyfriend has noticed my face getting clearer of acne  i would recommend this product      
117,5.0,                       cleanses well but gently  love that this cleanser allows me to gently massage my face clean without creating friction or dragging on my face  what i didn t like  and wasn t expecting was the fact that this cleanser is non foaming  there is no lather  this isnt really a bad thing  but nowhere on the packing  or the item description did i see anything about this being a non foaming cleanser  despite this  it cleanses well  and does not over dry or irritate my skin  i have tried other cleansers that did both  i have oily skin  and wear sunscreen  daily  this cleanser gets my skin clean   i use this cleanser every other day  alternating with the cerave sa cleanser   which does foam   this cleanser allows me to give my skin a gentle break from active ingredients   which i use with the sa cleanser    i use this cleanser on my face and neck and follow with a toner  an unscented centella gel from purito  and follow up with my fab barriair cream to help maintain my skin barrier i bought this cleanser after a horrible bought of breakouts  from over cleansing and over exfoliating my skin  this cleanser along with the other steps above has helped me calm and heal my skin  the dark spots that resulted from my breakouts are still fading  but this cleanser is helping with my overall skin health      
118,5.0,                       i use this product after a really deep cleansing face wash just to get my skin more moisturized and it really makes a difference  i think this product is better for moisturizing better than getting a deep cleanse  it doesn t really cause any problems for my skin but my skin isn t really sensitive at all  the only thing i don t like about this product is the fact that it doesn t foam up  otherwise  it is a great product especially for dry skin      
119,5.0,                       my son and i are using  we both noticed how non drying it is  when we used other brands  even fancy ones from sept store  our skin felt dry before we even got out of shower  with this we both agreed not drying at all  will continue to purchase      
120,5.0,                       great as a face wash for dry and combination skin  doesnt leave the skin dry  no scent at all  very light and doesnt strip off the moisture from skin  i use a serum and a moisturizer afterwards to finish up but this moisturizer itself is a great addition to my routine will purchase again       
121,5.0,                       update  i have been using this for a month and my skin looks so good  i have dealt with acne for a while and every time i would clear up  within a couple days another flare up would occur  since using this daily  i have seen a big difference in my skin and my acne  i love this face wash  so refreshing and really works very refreshing  goes on gently but feels really good  only been using a couple days      
122,5.0,                       i was kind of hesitant at first because the texture is like lotion  but don t let it fool you  it s such a great face wash  i have struggled with my acne for years and have tried a billion different products and none of them worked like this one  it took about a month of consistent use but it made my skin look almost flawless  i m not wearing makeup in either pictures      
123,5.0,                       i have noticed in the reviews some people are concerned that this product is not legitimate i am here to tell you that it is      legitimate after l or al bought cerave in      they have announced on their official twitter page and website that their formulas and packaging have changed having worked in the pharmaceutical industry for over    years i can tell you formulas and product packaging change often do not worry this is legitimate product     
124,5.0,                       i have very sensitive skin  i have tried so many cleansers from different brand  none of them work for me  i have been using this cleanser for about   months now   i feel like this is literally made for my skin  it gives perfect hydration for my skin just after one wash  it doesn t leave my skin dry after wash just one pump is enough for one time use  but you need to use two pump if you put heavy makeup on your skin  good product with reasonable price  love it       
125,4.0,                       this is the second bottle of cera ve i have used and the first that i have ordered  i inherited the first from a girlfriend  i m new to hydrating face washes but i m sold on what it does to my skin  it not only delivers on the product description but it also informs me how well i shaved before applying it  i can feel all the spots i missed  i shave my entire head   cera ve has a new customer      
126,5.0,                       i just like how it feel so my skin  i ve been using it for maybe a half a year  it doesn t feel like it s drying out my skin      
127,4.0,                       big size  no perfume smell      
128,5.0,                       i love this face wash  it s a great product and really deep cleans      
129,5.0,                       i ve been using this gentle cleanser for quite some time  gets the job done  leaves skin soft and refreshed  definitely great for sensitive skin  nothing harsh  there s some scent but it s not overpowering or unpleasant  it s a nice clean smell      
130,5.0,                       this is an awesome cleanser filled with all food nourishing ingredients i see people writing doesn t clean well or remove make up   no it s not made to remove makeup   it s to clean daily grim off and replenish moisture   you have to remove makeup first   i use an oil make up remover  then i use this with my clarisonic   it works awesome   even if you can get a clarisonic on of those rubber battery operated face cleansers along with this will work wonders   you have to do this daily i love all cerave products      
131,2.0,                       i have combination skin in some parts it is oily and in others it is not and i feel that this product leaves my face quite clean without traces of makeup in general it works well  i have been using it for a little more than two months and i like it except for the fact that but it causes a lot of dryness in some parts of my face      
132,5.0,                       i have dry skin and to let you know when it says it s moisturizing it really is  my face feels soft after using and not all dry like my other facial cleansers  only downfall is that it doesn t remove any makeup from my face      
133,5.0,                       for me  this product isn t the best for removing my makeup  perhaps it s because of the type of makeup i use   but it is gentle on my skin which is important for my skin needs  i was pleasantly surprised how good my skin felt  particularly my face  after using this  my face felt noticeably fresher  softer and just overall  really good  i haven t gotten any negative reactions from using this and it seems to help the dry spots on my face  in fact  i ve had less peeling skin since using this  so far i am happy with this product      
134,3.0,                       gentle  non stripping  effective  my derm recommended while using trentoin  prescription retinol   the only issue i had with this is that it stings at times quite a bit upon application  it seems to depend on what cleanser i use prior to the cerave  because i usually double cleanse  first with an oil based cleanser  then with a basic cleanser after  it s enough to have made me not reach for it  when i first reviewed it  the bottle top was slightly unscrewed and had a very minor amount of product around the nozzle leaking out      
135,5.0,                       i followed a trend on tik tok   this product did not disappoint  i have used this line before  but not this product   it is awesome  my skin definitely feels more moisturized   clean  love it  definitely a must buy      
136,5.0,                       it love this product   it s so moisturizing and perfect for dry skin   since i have combination skin i like to mix it in with the cerave foaming facial cleanser  and i love the results i get with both of them   this is such a great price for   oz    i highly recommend this and i will repurchase      
137,5.0,                       this is the best product for your face and body  leaves your face smooth and moisturized  i am new to cerve products but am so glad i found them  recommended by dermatologists        
138,4.0,                       this is one of the only products that i have not encountered a problem with  usually for any skin care product it doesn t work well or it causes me to break out even more  this product works great for my sensitive skin and it moistens my skin to perfection  it is also fragrance free so it s not irritating in any way at all  it s just apart of my daily routine and i love it      
139,5.0,                       i have oily skin that i ve been fighting with since college when my hormones decided to rebel against me and i got horrible acne for the first time in my life  like most people  i tried to fight my oily skin with severely drying products that ultimately did nothing helpful for my face  fast forward to      with the bazillion articles about restoring moisture barriers and double cleansing and face oils   i now use this twice per day in the shower  per another article  i massage this into my face with my fingers for a full    seconds to let the ingredients do their work  then rinse and follow with a sulfur soap on my oily zones that tend to break out  so far  so good  this leaves my skin feeling really soft and hydrated  and seems to get rid of all traces of my tinted sunscreen and any eye makeup that i wear  it s a  cult favorite  and i m positive i m not the first person to become a convert with the hydrating cleanser trend      
140,5.0,                       this product is a gentle cleaner that doesn t strip my skin of moisture which is a plus at age     i use it overall  not just on my face      
141,5.0,                       takes a minute to get used to it not foaming up like most cleansers  but it leaves my skin feeling clean and soft  doesn t irritate my hypersensitive skin      
142,5.0,                       i got this recently because i developed skin sensitivity on my cheeks with an eczema appearing rash  only flaring up when irritated but could be controlled  so i knew i wanted a fragrance free cleanser  this is a moisturizing face cleanser and does not in the least make my cheeks appear red  nor irritate  i will continue to use regularly in my cleansing routine  even once this passes  i ve been satisfied with my cleansers but i think this also gives my skin a chance to destress and moisturize      
143,5.0,                       i got this so i can scrub the bacteria off my eyelids which was causing eye redness   my eye doctor said it is the most common problem he sees   it doesn t cause any burning of the eyes  while most soaps burn      
144,5.0,                       this product physically feels amazing as soon as you apply it  there is no fragrance  which is really good for facial wash  you can physically feel it absorb into your skin  and it feels great on the lips  just don t eat it haha   it removes makeup easily and overall a really great product      
145,5.0,                       i do not know what amazon sent me but i don t think this is actually cerave  i ve never used cerave before but my skin also isn t particularly sensitive and i can usually switch up my washes with no problem  after one wash  my skin was super red and bumpy on my chin  it s like the first few layers of my skin have been raised and inflamed  i thought maybe it was just an initial fluke reaction  but after a second wash  the inflammation is now all over my cheeks as well as my chin  my skin has never ever done this  it s been hours and my skin is still inflamed  it s not itchy  just red and hot and raised  such a waste of money  beware  buy your skincare in an actual store      
146,4.0,                       i haven t been using it for too long and i did breakout a little from this cleanser but i do with most new products  people seem to be concerned about the   symbol not being on the bottle  mine didn t come with the symbol but it s the same at my local store  it smells fragrance free and has a very different texture than most cleansers  it doesn t foam up at all but makes the skin soft  my only complaint is how it was packaged  it was packaged with no protection at all  no bubble wrap or anything  it still came in good condition but some people might not be as lucky      
147,5.0,                       this is my first time trying this cleanser and i really like it  it is not foaming and doesn t dry out my face  also no fragrance  which is a plus  i still need to apply moisturizer after cleansing  so i wouldn t say this is  moisturizing   i would just say it  isn t drying  and rinses clean i was previously using the cetaphil  gentle skin cleanser   not their  facial cleanser   which is a foaming wash   when i first used this cerave product  my initial thought was  wow this is the exact same as my cetaphil    however  upon further inspection i noted that they are not the same at all  the ingredients are quite different  both products are non foaming with no fragrance  both are gentle ish  they also look very similar  however  my cetaphil is a bit runnier and has a slight pearly sheen to it also  it s just a bit drying and leaves a slight tight feeling on my face  this cerave does not  neither product will remove makeup  at all  i remove makeup before any cleanser  but these above mentioned products will not even budge my makeup this cerave hydrating cleanser is a bit more money than my cetaphil gentle cleanser for less product  but i can always wait for a sale or find a coupon and save a few bucks  in fact  i used a    amazon coupon offer on this one  that said  a couple dollars more is worth it to me  i ve found my new cleanser      
148,1.0,                       very moisturizing product  for sure  but i don t really like the smell   clinical like  not a bad product if you are seeking a moisturizing product  very good for that purpose      
149,5.0,                       i did some research on this product before purchasing it  my first time experience with it was good  it doesn t have strong scent and doesn t make bubble  it s more like lotion  cream texture on my face that i was kind of worrying if it could remove oil from my face  it didn t fail me   i feel clean and refreshing after using it  i have combination skin but i would also suggest this product to anyone who have sensitive skin      
150,5.0,                       my go to cleanser   i have acne prone  dry skin and this is good for my skin  i ve been using it since july and i m currently using it and i just started accutane and it s not drying my face at all  i definitely reccomend if u have acne prone or dry skin        
151,2.0,                       i love and purchase various cerave products regularly  although i am a new fan of these amazing skin care products  i m not sure of this particular purchase  this was so watered down it almost was like using water  i later purchased the foaming facial wash and that item came exactly as i would expect  i m going to compare to see if they were separate sellers and let amazon know  i hear sometimes sellers will water down or change their products to something than what the bottle states  that is horrible to do to a brand name  i m not sure i will continue to buy my skin care  make up items or anything fluid which the product could be tampered with      
152,1.0,                       not sure what went wrong  i bought this with a daily moisturizer and night cream from the same brand  after one week my face has red  dry  flakey splotches all over  i had high hopes because of the reviews on all of these  afraid i won t be buying again      
153,3.0,                       my go to is the la roche posay gel and cream cleanser so i thought i would try this for a change and it was just ok  it is fragrance free and good for sensitive skin but that s about it  doesn t do a good job removing all the make up and doesn t leave skin as moisturized as the la roche ones do  most likely will not buy again      
154,5.0,                       i have extremely sensitive skin and am allergic to many skin care products  also  many products strip my skin and make it feel and look completely dried out  i was wondering if the cerimides in this product would help  it worked   i will never use another product again      
155,5.0,                       i have big pores and sometimes get pimples  i am so happy i brought this product  i have noticed after   uses that my pores shrunk my complexion is getting brighter and my skin is getting clearer  i thought that it would foam up like soap i didn t get discouraged so happy i kept using  i also use dickenson witch hazel after everyday  amazing      
156,2.0,                       not for sensitive skin   caused a rash on my forehead      
157,5.0,                       this doesn t dry out my skin like soap  and it doesn t clog my pores like other face cleansers i ve tried  i also like that it is unscented  so i don t have to worry about allergic reactions  this hits the sweet spot for me as far as quality and price  i ve tried similar but cheaper products by other brands and didn t like them  i ve tried more expensive ones and didn t think they were enough better than the cerave to warrant the higher price  nice product that i use every day      
158,5.0,                       if you re looking for something to clear acne fast you can stop here   i ve been struggling with acne for a long time and this cleared my skin in just days  i noticed a difference after one use  the pictures posted on reviews are real  this product will help you achieve flawless skin  i have sensitive skin and it s perfect for me  look no further       
159,5.0,                       this is my wife s favorite cleanser  i like it as well it definitely works very well even on my oily skin  always leaves my skin feeling very clean and fresh which is nice      
160,5.0,                       i just need a simple cleanser that doesn t burn or turn me red  i don t wear make up so i can t say how well it takes it off  i m sure that also depends on how much you cake on    as long as they don t change the formula i will use this until i die most likely      
161,5.0,                       i love cerave  works well for me  derm recommended  it is creamy like putting lotion on your face and doesn t leave your skin feeling chapped  not every cleanser will work for everyone  not good for removing makeup  i use my natural soap to completely remove that before using this to cleanse my skin  have been using for a long time and will use it going forward  this is the biggest bottle at the best value i ve found      
162,2.0,                       this cleanser wasn t good enough to remove my makeup  after washing my face with it i still have to use a makeup wipe to remove the foundation and mascara  the worst part about it is that it burns my face as i m using it      
163,3.0,                       i got this to replace another gentle cleanser  but as far as i can tell this doesn t do anything  literally i don t see it doing anything to clean my face  my skin has stayed dry  irritated  and broken out  this isn t doing anything to help one way or another      
164,2.0,                       i was really excited to try this   i have super dry skin around my nose area and i ve been looking for a skin care regime that can help improve the way my makeup breaks throughout the day   i ve been using the cerave moisturizing cream and have been please with it  so when i needed a new facial cleanser  i opted to try to same brand   while i feel my skin is improving  this cleaner does not break through the makeup like other cleaners i ve used in the passed   i ve been having to go back over my face with a makeup wipe to get the makeup off after  cleaning  my face   i won t be buying this product again      
165,5.0,                       i always felt if a product didn t lather  it wasn t cleansing  but i m very happy with this product  i have very dry skin  if i wash my face and don t moisturize immediately  my face feels very tight  uncomfortable  maybe even a little itchy  not with this stuff  i still follow up my wash with moisturizer  but i can tell my skin isn t dried out like before  i will continue to buy      
166,1.0,                       this face wash is awful  i have washed my face   times and it still doesn t take off my makeup  and i don t use very much makeup at all  i have used micelles water and cotton pads after washing my face with this cerave wash and the cotton pad is completely full of makeup  it leaves your skin feeling like it has a slimy film left on it  will never buy this stuff again      
167,4.0,                       best part for me is it feels like creamy lotion and no scent  face feels smooth and does not feel dry and cracking like with regular face cleansers  if you have sensitive skins it s worth a try  only   stars right now because have only used it a few times so waiting to see how it does after a month or so      
168,5.0,                       i have really sensitive skin  pretty severe eczema  and an autoimmune disorder that effects my skin so i have to be careful about what i use on my skin  i love this face wash  it doesn t dry out or sting my face or cause an eczema flare up  it doesn t have a strong smell or fragrance  it is so moisturizing  it also helps me keep my face free from acne which i also get sometime      
169,5.0,                       doesn t dry my skin out at all  i can totally feel a difference in how my skin feels when i use this compared to other washes  i have super sensitive eczema ridden skin  and my eczema is especially flared up around my eyes and this doesn t burn them or irritate them at all  i also struggle with acne and this has helped me with that as well  i wish i would ve found this sooner       
170,5.0,                       i m on a new medication that makes me skin especially sensitive  even  sensitive  products have causes reactions  this cleanser is perfect  moisturizes perfectly no film or greasy feeling  but feels clean  not tight and dry  its a pretty great value for this size as well     
171,5.0,                       great  hydrating face wash  i think it s better than the roch posay one  since this one feels like it really gets my skin clean      
172,5.0,                       despite all of the negative comments this product is really good  it does not leave my skin feeling tight or dry and i have really sensitive and very skin  i also have eczema and i am still able to use this product without it burning  maybe it s burning on some peoples skin because you might have to wash your hands first and then apply a little bit of this product to your face  honestly it s the same stuff that is in the store  i have really  really sensitive skin and i bought this product and i was able to use it  it s fine for me      
173,1.0,                       this product is  unfortunately  nearly unusable due to the extremely watery texture  i can barely get my hands up to my face without all of it running off between my fingers and over the sides of my palms  i believe i received a faulty product  because i know the texture should be thicker than this  i am pregnant and don t feel safe going to the post office to mail the product back  i am hoping for a replacement so i can use this face wash normally  there was no way to contact the seller so i am leaving this review and hoping they reach out to me      
174,5.0,                       i love this brand  i m a ginger with sensitive skin  i use retin a daily i wanted a gentle cleanser  this is perfect and will last a long time      
175,5.0,                       i use many cerave products daily and this is one of them  this is my morning cleanser  it is very hydrating  not harsh  no scent that i catch  i have acne prone skin and have no effects      
176,1.0,                       although i ve heard great things about this product this one is not for sensitive skin    i know they have one that is now but i wouldn t recommend this product  it burns my face and i break out into little red bumps until my skin is no longer irritated  try the sensitive skin one instead      
177,4.0,                       works as described  no skin reaction     
178,4.0,                       it s very gentle and hydrating  if your skin is oily  this is not the right choice  but for dry skin it s great      
179,5.0,                       i ve been using this cleanser for almost two months  it has no scent which is great  goes on my skin smooth  does not remove makeup though so use a makeup remover prior to  it s super hydrating  which is great for naturally dry skin  i ve seen a major difference in my skin health overall  make sure you use a moisturizer afterwards  i used to live by aveeno    but after using this    i won t go back  highly recommend      
180,3.0,                       this is a fine face wash if you don t wear makeup  if you wear any makeup at all it will not take it off  even washing my face  x and scrubbing at my skin there was still a good amount of concealer left  i don t even wear foundation just concealer      
181,1.0,                       i am giving this product   star because it really did not agree to me it rather left my face burning every time i washed with it i decided to purchase it because of all the positive reviews but i think if you have sensitive skin this may not be the best product for you      
182,5.0,                       this product is great for combination skin  i recommend it for oily skin types too if your skin is dehydrated  it s super gentle on your skin and makes your skin feel soft and ample  i felt the difference from the first wash and i haven t stopped using it since      
183,5.0,                       this facial cleanser was recommended by my dermatologist   it s a little expensive but you don t need to use much to wash your face  no fragrance so that makes it perfect      
184,5.0,                       i love cerave products  especially for my facial dermatitis  cerave keeps the  flare ups  under control  i use in my daily morning   nighttime routine  then  at night i also use the cerave nighttime moisturizer that i absolutely swear by  it does amazing with my dermatitis control  when you use the products together  it all works perfectly together  the only moisturizer i can t use is the spf sunscreen moisturizer  i have to use a mineral spf    i am allergic to some of the ingredients   also  very important to make sure to apply to damp skin  the reason why is because this moisturizing wash is thick and you want to work up a good lather to get a good wash to remove any extra dirt i find it easier to use the foam wash with my sonic facial brush to get any dirt and to also exfoliate  twice a wk   but i use the regular brush replacement for a gentler wash morning   nighttime   you don t want to damage your skin s moisture barrier  exfoliating every time you wash your face cerave is great for dermatitis  psoriasis  eczema or any types of skin complications     but always consult with a dermatologist first        
185,5.0,                       this was recommended to me by my dermatologist several years ago and i ve used it ever since  the price is excellent with this seller and delivery was as promised   will buy again  great deal with a great product      
186,5.0,                       i love this stuff  it feels like a lotion but washes off like a soap  it s not drying at all  i cleanse morning and night  i have oily skin so i follow up with a hydrating toner then the cerave salicylic acid lotion  i already see some sun damage correcting going on      
187,1.0,                       i purchased this based on my dermatologists recommendation however  it did nothing for me  this product didn t feel like it cleaned my face at all      
188,3.0,                       it s too thick on the skin  it doesn t feel like it s cleaning very well      
189,1.0,                       in my opinion  this is awful  it leaves that terrible sticky chemical feeling  it burns when i use it  do not let this anywhere near your eyes    you re better off only washing below your eyes  forget your forehead  unless you are looking to have blurry vision for a few minutes  my face wash that i normally use was on back order  so i made  to later find out  the poor decision to buy this because it had  good reviews  i m starting to wonder if they were paid for   if you want your face to suddenly break out and be full of regrets    buy this product if you re looking for something positive about this product    the only i have is that it doesn t really have a scent     
190,5.0,                       i ve only been using this for three days  morning and night  and i love it already  every other facewash i ve ever tried leaves my face feeling parched  if i didn t put lotion on instantly after washing  it would literally be flakey and dry  this hydrating cleanser leaves my face feeling soft and   plump   i also purchased the cerave moisturizing cream and have been applying it after washing my face  but honestly  i might not even need to use that every time because the cleanser leaves my face feeling so soft and moisturized  it also doesn t leave an oily feeling  it all soaks into my skin when i originally received the cleanser  the lid was not screwed on the bottle tightly and about half of the cleanser was out of the bottle  smooshed all over the inside of the bag it was in  i filled out the return damaged link on monday and the new  and intact  bottle was on my front step wednesday morning  i am very pleased  they also told me i didn t need to return the damaged product  so i ended up with about half a bottle for free      
191,5.0,                       this product is wonderful  after each use my face feels super clean and hydrated  i would recommend this to anyone  i am also acne prone and have had no issues with it causing any acne or aggravating existing acne  it actually seems to soothe my face      
192,5.0,                       i love this cleanser  it works great and my skin is so soft after using it      
193,1.0,                       for the price and the fact that this is a dermatologist recommended product i expected better for this product  i would use it on my dry skin at night and in the morning i would have skin flaking already  i scent is not the best and i feel like there are other drugstore brands that make my face feel cleaner  after a day of makeup this product didn t do a great job taking off all the makeup either   i had to try this several times to actually get the makeup off  i was not impressed   would not purchase again unless the company made some changes      
194,5.0,                       this face cleanser is a great value for the price  it s super hydrating and this size is hard to find in the store  my skin is super sensitive so this is a nice calming cleanser and removes eye make up easily      
195,5.0,                       i typically double cleanse my face every day but am always so pleased after i wash my face with this wash  it has a fresh scent that leaves my face feeling refreshed and moisturized  would recommend if looking for a new face wash      
196,1.0,                       so it burns my skin when i use it idk why but i doubt it supposed to  and i ve started to get more acne on my cheeks where i use it     
197,2.0,                       i got this because the youtube dermatologists recommended this  it does a good job of making the face look bright but i ve gotten hives from using it  after using it for a couple days straight  it stripped the moisture from my face and caused it to burn while using it  the lotion also made my skin burn and my normally clear face started to flake and have hives all over my cheeks  i also got redness from both products  so i m definitely having an allergic reaction of some sort  i m disappointed  i wanted this to work out       
198,5.0,                       i have sensitive skin  this is the best gentlest face cleanser i have ever used   and i have used them all   it took off all my makeup and didn t leave my face feeling dry  i love it and will never be without it     
199,5.0,                       this is a fantastic moisturizing face wash  stands shoulder to shoulder with more expensive brands  highly recommend      
200,5.0,                       great product  it feels almost like a moisturizer that you re trying to cleanse your face with  it doesn t foam up  or leave your face feeling dry when you rinse it  which some people aren t used to  took me time  because i m used to the soapy fragrant face cleansers that literally wash away all the good stuff leaving your face feeling dry  which i associated with  clean   thank god i m don t with that  no scent  moisturizing  and works great  will buy again      
201,5.0,                       my face is glowing     no makeup on my face only this product and rose oil  i use this once a day when i wake up in the morning  there s  really not a scent too it  i put warm water on my face then apply it to my skin in circular motion   then i rinse it off  my skin has never looked so clear      
202,5.0,                       literally love this cleanser it makes my skin feels so nice and it has a slightly odd scent but it s not too bad  doesn t do much for acne but is so hydrating      
203,3.0,                       the cleaner was not foaming at all  it was similar to a gel and while i wash washing it didn t feel like my skin was getting clean but after rinsing it was really hydrated and not oily      
204,3.0,                       i m not crazy about this product   it s really not anything like a face wash more like lotion   it does a fair job of removing makeup and is moisturizing i guess but it stings when it gets in my eyes and is kind of heavy   going back to clinique foaming face wash      
205,4.0,                       no real sent  great for everyday hydration and cleansing  it does moisturize skin  but i would suggest finding an everyday moisturizer to use along with it  it can leave skin a little dry  especially if you use too much  either way it cleans and refreshes skin  if i forget am too lazy to wash my face before bed  this in the morning is the next best thing      
206,5.0,                       i have combo dry oily skin and this cleanser really helps cleanse my skin day and night without drying it out like most foaming cleansers do  it is my go to and i always buy more whenever i run low  thanks cerave     
207,1.0,                       i used this face wash for exactly one week  and my face started by becoming extremely dry and my skin was peeling off  i started to see red rashes and bumps all over the cheeks and forehead  it became super rough and super itchy  it was extremely annoying because it burnt every time i applied moisturizer and i couldn t go anywhere due to the red and pink rashes all over my face  my skin on the face has become so rough and bumpy  it has been two weeks and i am still struggling with the dryness and skin peeling off i am not sure if i received a fake product or this is not meant for sensitive skin  the way it reacted on my skin  i wouldn t recommend this to anyone with any skin type  it deserves no stars at all      
208,5.0,                       i ve been looking for a product that actually helps with hydration on my face  it gets extremely dry especially during the winter  the first time i used this product i noticed a huge difference  my face has never felt so hydrated  definitely will continue to buy this product   highly recommend      
209,1.0,                       i honestly hated this product  thick lotion type of consistency  i didn t wash my face  the one thing it  was supposed to do  i had a hard time washing the product off my face as well  it made my skin itchy and gave me a huge break out  honestly it s not the brand it this product  the foaming cleanser work kind of on my skin  no i don t recommend it  i m going to stick to my cleanser from krave  works way better     
210,3.0,                       i received it yesterday  and i only got it because my dermatologist told me to use it  it s very moisturizing and cream based which i m not used to because i like to have that tight skin feeling after i wash my face so it s  clean  but lately my skin has been chapped and with   uses  i could immediately tell that it was hydrating  i am  however  giving it   stars because the bottle cover wouldn t open and then when it did  it was broken  so now i have to fix the pump every time i want to use it and that s annoying      
211,5.0,                       i immediately fell in love with this cleanser upon first use  the product itself is silky smooth  and it feels almost like washing with a thin lotion rather than a traditional sudsy cleanser  but my skin still feels very clean afterwards i ve used this as well as the cerave skin renewing night moisturizer twice a day for exactly a week today  and my skin is already noticeably brighter  far more moisturized  and soft to the touch while i am a skincare newbie myself  i ve done tons and tons of research to prepare for my skincare journey  and this brand came recommended by james welsh  a popular skincare youtuber that i actually genuinely trust  and i m certainly glad i listened  i can t imagine ever using a different product now      
212,5.0,                       this stuff has changed my skin  before i was using scrubs and a bunch of different face washes and i had the worst skin  all i did was change to this and my face has completely cleared up      
213,5.0,                       i have sensitive skin  especially since i use a retinol product at night and i found this cerave cleanser is  hydrating and feels wonderful on my skin   i like  that there is  no fragrance which can be very sensitizing with frequent use  and i love the fact that it has hyaluronic acid for moisture      
214,3.0,                       first let me say  this product does not claim to be a make up remover   having said that  most would think that a product that says it is a  facial cleanser  would mean it actually cleans your face   unfortunately  i cannot claim that this product cleaned my face i am a fan of cerave and have been using many products from this company for the past   months or so   however  this  facial cleanser  did not do a good job of cleaning off my liquid foundation  which means it could not have my skin   instead  i had to use a facial cloth to wipe off the left over make up and washed my face with another product i have regularly used clean   clear s daily pore face cleanser and it cleans just about all of my make up  if not all of it   i never wipe off my make up prior to washing my face and the c c cleanser works great because i do not want to receive any strikes on my account  i will not be returning this product   i will likely have my family use it until it is gone and will not reorder   good luck with whatever you choose to use      
215,5.0,                       i bought one of these to try out   i like it   i do not detect a scent   i like the pump top on the bottle   after trying one bottle  and running low  i chose the two bottles with a percent off of the price      
216,2.0,                       okay  it s says it s  cerave but when i got it  it came without the sign and it smelled unusual  it didn t smell like the one i usually have  guess i ll see the resultsedit im still not      sure this is a legitimate product but i know for a fact that it did work a little  over the weeks  i switched from the foaming cleanser to this cleanser day by day  i ve noticed that sometimes when my blackheads start to fade away  and i put this on the next day  the blackheads would start to appear again  another flaw is that it didn t have the reserved sign at one of the sides of the product  it only said cerave when it was supposed to say cerave with an r on the top  yes  it helped my skin just the tiniest bit  i m still not proud of this product since there are many flaws with it  this product only helped my skin get smoother  nothing else  i wouldn t even say smoother since it would dry my skin and after i put on moisterizer and it  goes away  then my skin would start to feel softer than before  i wouldn t recommend buying this product so if your debating on buying this  i wouldn t  you should check out a different brand that hyram recommends      
217,5.0,                       m skin is sensitive for all the acids i use   this product keeps the oil barrier without damage your skin     
218,5.0,                       great for eczema or sensitive skin   i use it when i have breakouts or if i have dry skin  it balances out my face  i have bought this for years and i bought this on amazon now two or three times      
219,5.0,                       my skin never looked so good  i would not be without this cleanser and would accept no substitute   it really does make a difference and when used with other cerave products  you will glow  i do      
220,5.0,                       i needed a face wash that was good for sensitive and dry skin  this wash is gentle and leaves my face feeling soft and clean  my dermatologist approved      
221,5.0,                       my face feels like a baby s butt  literally so soft  i also noticed that a lot of my dark spots from previous acne have lightened   i ve been trying to make them go away for six months  happy i found cerave  i use all of their products now      
222,5.0,                       just started taking face care seriously at the experienced age of     have always been blessed with a youthful appearance  but age and regular sun exposure have started to show their affects  after doing quite a bit of research  cerave s hydrating face wash seemed like a solid starting point without breaking the bank  have been pleasantly surprised with the results  even after just   short days of use  been using it morning and night  have had no irritation and have noticed a more even skin tone  this will definitely be part of my routine going forward  guess an old dog can learn new tricks on occasion lol      
223,5.0,                       i loveeeeeee this product  it s hydrated my face so well  i ve never had a face wash that worked better than this one in my life  it s helped clear up my skin significantly   so glad i made this purchase     
224,5.0,                       i use this as a part of a    step korean skin care regime  after i  use the face oil i use this  i have combination skin an it works well to get the oil off  there really isn t a strong smell and you don t need a lot to clean your face  the bottle lasts a long time      
225,5.0,                       this facewash is a lifesaver when it comes to dry skin  even for combination skin  i like to consider myself as having combo skin but with the winter weather  my dry spots are even more dry  untilllll i started using this facewash  it light and hydrating can t wait to try the face lotion next      
226,5.0,                       i love this face wash  i have been struggling with adult acne the last couple of years  and each time i think i can fix it with the classic chemicals and drying products  my face ends up in a flare after a bit  this is the second time in a year i ve been through that phase and gone back to this gentle and simple cleanser  i ve learned simple is best  especially if you have sensitive skin  each time now it has began to slowly start healing my skin again  it does take time but your skin will thank you  my face is certainly not all the way clear but it is slow progress  anywho  i will say that this does not take off my makeup whatsoever  i wear very light to no makeup  so i recommend pairing this with the makeup wipes and the moisturizer  overall this is a great product and comes through every time over all these other expensive and harsh acne treatment products      
227,1.0,                       honestly what can i say about a face wash that doesn t wash faces  a face wash that breaks you out  a face wash that leaves your face feeling oily and slippery  oh i know  it sucks  literally     bucks down the drain  don t waste your time or money on this product  i beg you      
228,5.0,                       this is the best facial cleanser on the market as far as i am concerned   removes makeup  leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean and there is no scent which i appreciate         
229,5.0,                       i have a very dry skin and used alot of cleansers of many brands but they make my skin worse   this cerave cleanser left my skin smooth and moistured with no residue at all   i bought my second bottle and recommend it for sure      
230,1.0,                       i am going to return  i was under the impression it would sud or foam with water   nope  it just feels like a layer of grease when applied to my face   i don t see how this could possibly clean skin  yuk      
231,1.0,                       this product did nothing for my current breakouts and instead added insult to injury    after using this for two weeks i have developed new very red pimples on my cheeks   i never have pimples there   i gave it two weeks and i am done with it   i hate to say it but there is a reason why it s so cheap compared to products like tata harper      
232,5.0,                       i have dry  extremely sensitive skin  i bought this cleanser on a whim  and it s the best one i ve ever used  i m shocked by all of the negative reviews to be specific  this cleanser does not lather like soap  it reminds me a lot of how primer from bare minerals feels  it s silky smooth  i use one pump  and rub it all over my face for about a minute  i ve never had an issue with it not removing my makeup  i mean  waterproof mascara needs a little extra help coming off  but regular foundation  eye shadow  etc comes off just fine  i used to not be able to wash my face multiple times a day for fear of my skin drying out  now i can wash my face as often as i want and i never dry out  i feel like this cleanser really does  restore the skin barrier  not every beauty product works for everyone  but i had to leave a positive review for this product i love so much  i look forward to washing my face now  and it s helped me to stick to my skin care routine      
233,1.0,                       i ve been seeing reviews about this product being fake from amazon so i guess they gave me a fake product instead of the real cera ve  i do not have sensitive skin and it burned after using it and made some burn marks and very raw red marks on my skin  also  it made my skin completely dry  so dry that my skin is flaking off and very rough to the touch  i used nothing but cera ve on my face for a couple of days and it did that  do not buy this product from amazon since there is a bunch of people  including me having bad experiences from this product      
234,4.0,                       this is a good product for sensitive skin  however it is not moisturizing  it leave the skin a bit dry but no very dry  it doesn t have a  scent which i prefer  i do wish it would lather     
235,5.0,                       this is a great face wash product  it gently cleans the face without strong odor  it does not moisture much but it s still good      
236,5.0,                       if i could give it    stars i would   i use this asmy am face fash and use the cerave foaming face wash for pm  this stuff is amazing leaves my face soft and very hydrated         
237,5.0,                       i saw this on a tik tok video and was in need of new cleanser  i had used a facial cleanser with beads in it  but that s apparently not good for your skin  so i tried this  it s very easy on the skin i ve had no breakouts  skin feels great and is very moisturized after use      
238,5.0,                       this cleanser works great for me  i m    and get horrible hormonal acne on my jaw line  i can t use face cleansers for acne because i have dry skin and acne cleansers dry my skin even more  i love using this cleanser  it cleans my face very well  i know some others have left reviews saying it doesn t clean well and doesn t get their makeup off  but it cleans for me  i use toner after washing my face and i have never had any remaining residue show up on my cotton pad  this also leaves my face feeling really soft  i have not had a problem with my face being dry since i started using this  and  it has helped to clear out my pores and lessen the hormonal acne  it took a little getting used to because it doesn t foam suds up  but i got used to that very quickly  i am very happy with this cleanser      
239,5.0,                       i have only been using this product for a little but of time  maybe a week consistently  and within this week i ve seen such a big difference in my face  there is a light blue version of this product but i personally would recommend the green one for sensitive skin  both cleansers work wonders on your face and you get a lot of product for what you pay for  there isn t a sent but you can feel a difference in your face     
240,5.0,                       this face wash has really helped clean up my skin  and the price  it is unbeatable  although marketed for dry skin  i have noticed by skin being dryer than normal  but it is fall winter so that can be it too  i just purchased the moisturizer to try      
241,2.0,                       really good for people with really dry skin  i made the mistake and bought this even though i have combination skin so my skin was so oily i could use it to fry chicken     
242,1.0,                       it s been cold out so skin gets a little dry especially in my face from the blistering wind  i ve been using this wash for a couple days and my face feels drier after using it  it didnt give me a clean feeling like soaps are suppose to   it s only drier where i only applied the cleanser because i used my body wash as a control on half my face and cleanser on the other  let s just say half my face feels like a soft sandpaper now and my skin is not sensitive and has never reacted like this to other facial soaps     
243,5.0,                       i have sensitive dry skin so it s hard to find products that don t break me out  i m also trying to eliminate any excess toxins and this product was recommended by ewg with a great health rating so i thought i d try it out  i ve only been using it for one week but have had zero breakouts and my skin is glowing  definitely adds more moisture to my skin and i love that it s scent free  this simple cleanser works well for me and is my new daily go to      
244,5.0,                       been suffering from hormonal acne for forever now  and by that i mean i get one or two pimples that ll leave an ugly scar whether i touch it or not  after two weeks of using this with the moisturizer and a basic face scrub every other day  my skin is so clear i can t believe it      
245,5.0,                       amazing cult following   gentle to my skin  moisturizers  removes makeup      
246,5.0,                       i ve been a fan of clinique mild facial soap for    years or more  i ordered this in a pinch because i was out of clinique and wanted to get something delivered in   days via prime  glad i tried it it cleans the skin well  at least for me  i wouldn t call it a moisturizing product  whichbis why i gave it   stars in that category  however it cleans well and doesnt leave my skin painfully tight afterwards  it doesnt burn my eyes either of it gets in them  plus  the bottle lasts a long time      
247,5.0,                       my skin is dry  and i like this cleanser because afterwards my skin does feel softer and it doesn t feel like it s been stripped of anything  my skin doesn t feel right after a wash  it has helped my skin and i ve gone through   bottles      
248,4.0,                       i love all of   and have been using your great skin care products for years  with confidence and satisfaction   the one thing that seems to be consistent  however  is that many of these dispensers never work  the cleansing lotion just received had the same  issue  and as before   i had to take  an old dispenser from a similar type bottle  another brand  and use it in the new cleansing lotion bottle   i wonder why it hasn t been addressed   thank you      
249,5.0,                       good product after face peels      
250,5.0,                       perfect for my eczema   and one bottle will probly last me forever  i have always had eczema  but just recently started developing eczema on my face  it has been a struggle to keep the embarrassing flakey red skin away  this paired with the cerave moisturizer has kept it down drastically   great products      
251,5.0,                       the only thing that has ever worked for my dry sensitive skin  i have been using this for   years now  it cured all my acne  all my pore problems  and kept my skin from ever getting too dry or irritated  try it and you will never go back to anything else      
252,1.0,                       after a month of using this product daily  i started breaking out really bad all over my face  i continued to use the face wash because my first impression was so good  and i wasn t convinced it was the soap  and not something else  causing the acne   it left my skin feeling clean without drying or leaving a residue  although  after one week i noticed a couple of pimples   which don t usually transpire on my face  it continued to worsen  abating only upon the cessation of this product     
253,1.0,                       i washed and rinsed my face and noticed i still had eye makeup and even foundation still on  i washed again  extra good  and still had makeup on  part of my face was bright red but that might have been from all the rubbing while washing  i threw this right in the trash  what a waste   i bought it because of great reviews  maybe i got a bad batch or something      
254,3.0,                       this is the only product my    year old dad will use  his dermatologist recommended for eczema  packaging was changed last year which caused him some concern   same product apparently  can t beat the price on amazon  however packaging during shipment has caused leakage  and cancellation of one shipment which meant i had to reorder  one of the more recent orders took almost   weeks to get  i just hope the product isn t discontinued or they don t start limiting the number of bottles you can order at one time like the moisturizer  kind of a pain  otherwise my dad very happy with the product i will consider starting the automatic ordering on a monthly basis when i can figure how much he uses      
255,5.0,                       after getting tons of nasty dry patches recently over the last year i finally switch to all cerave products for my skin routine  my skin looks so healthy and i m so happy  can t go wrong with any cerave products        
256,2.0,                       i need to preface this review by stating that i only bought this via amazon since my local target was out of stock in this product for weeks  i found it odd since i ve been buying it there for over a decade and never saw it out of stock  at first i chalked it up to covid related shortage  but all other skincare products were available  reading some reviews regarding possible knock off version being sold here has me thinking cera ve may have realized there s an issue and took this out of retail  this is purely speculative since i haven t visited other retail stores besides walgreens  it wasn t available there  either  my story  i have ridiculously sensitive skin with rosacea  any but the most gentle products will cause it to become a blotchy irritated mess  i ve used cera ve since it first came out when my dermatologist told me about this new brand offering a moisturizing lotion receiving rave reviews  while i really like the moisturizing ability of cera ve  i did find it to have a strong chemical scent and it could irritate my rosacea prone areas  upper cheeks and around the nose   however  i believe the formula was tweaked over time and relied on a regiment of using this cleanser and the moisturizing cream for years to great effect  combined with lifestyle changes  laser treatments  and medication  my rosacea became less of a concern however  the last few months have been a nightmare with my skin  starting in february  i noticed increased irritation and redness  then my skin started to flare up and get hot in ways i haven t experienced in years  i examined every possible cause  change in sunscreens  my favorite cotz sunscreen was discontinued  so i tried several replacements including cera ve s new tinted spf      i checked potential lifestyle changes  issues with medication  food  etc  i was getting neurotic and depressed as my skin was often uncomfortable  hurting even  and i didn t know why  was this my rosacea just getting worse about a week ago  my rosacea flared on my cheeks in the worse way  i was taking all my medications  using ice packs  washing my face and trying different skin care products in order to find the root cause  a few days later  i decided to just wash my face with this cleanser and apply the moisturizing cream  a few hours later  my cheeks were again burning  i washed my face and didn t apply anything in it  i felt better  but noticed the area around my nose felt so raw and sensitive the next day i began my research  cera ve was bought by l oreal a few years ago which coincided with the big increase in products offered with many of them either inappropriate for sensitive skin  salicylic acid  or basically the same cream you get in the big tub repackaged in a smaller tube with an added ingredient or two  worse  the product staples  this cleanser and the moisturizers  were reformulated in order to remove parabens well  i can firmly say that between this cleanser  the moisturizer  and tinted spf     which has salicylic acid in it   my skin actually became burnt and greatly irritated i bought cetaphil cleanser and vanicream moisturizer and  in a matter of days  my skin is doing much better  i literally have lines on my skin showing where the irritation is healing  if you ve ever had a chemical peel  it s the same feeling as it begins from the t zone and moves outward i contacted cera ve with my displeasure in these formulation changes and have not heard back  i ve noticed others with similar issues here and i don t believe it s a fake product issue  i believe cera ve has really lost their way and become a brand i cannot trust      
257,1.0,                       i ordered in september      the cerave hydrating facial cleanser   oz  today i m looking to reorder this product but i was curious if anyone else was having continued dry skin like i am and so i looked at a few reviews and i came across a review that someone mentioned of the ingredients on her bottle label that she ordered here didn t match what was listed as ingredients on the advertised amazons page   i went and grabbed my almost empty bottle and sure enough my bottle has those   ingredients  on the product that delivered instead of the product advertised  that came  from amazon  i never  nd guessed that what i received might not be what i ordered  least of all be a carcinogen       especially in women that have breast cancer  i have breast cancer and the labeling on the product advertised on the amazon site did not have these ingredients listed on the label  so i looked today at my bottle and it has those   ingredients  methylparaben  propylparaben  peg    stearate  dipotassium phosphate  on the app  think dirty   it shows these ingredients as  carcinogenicity tumor promoter  documented links to breast cancer  known human carcinogen  carcinogenic in lab studies  hormone disruptor and on and on  i m on meds to keep my breast cancer from coming back and yet these ingredients  these   ingredients that i ve been using since it delivered last september is possibly messing with that cancer prevention med  what the heck amazon   cerave  shame on you both  i m sooooo disgusted angry disappointed right now      
258,3.0,                       i decided to give this a try after using the cerave renewal cleanser since this appeared to be more hydrating   my complaint is that the hydrating facial wash doesn t do a good job of removing eye makeup   the renewal cleanser takes it right off but not the hydrating face wash      
259,4.0,                       here s my skin profile combination  acne prone skin  i use differin gel and cerave moisturizer nightly  other products i use regularly  salicylic acid pads  green tea toner  snail repair cream and various chemical and physical sunscreens  i do not wear make up this is a go to  it cleanses my skin nicely without leaving it feeling stripped  it does not feel irritating around the eyes  it does not lather  which is something that i enjoy  the consistency is like that of a very thinand runny lotion  it is fragrance free and it has no scent  i don t find it to be particularly hydrating per se  but it does not dry me out at all  i slightly prefer this to the cetaphil sensitive skin cleanser  which has a similar profile and consistency to this one  this leaves my skin feeling a bit more cleansed and nurtured  i use this when i want to  reset  my skin and drop down to the bare basics  in my opinion  i think this is suitable for many people who consider their skin to be oily i took off a star because this cleanser is really good for maintenance  but it doesn t really have any active ingredients to nurture or treat the skin  that s fine though  this product does what it says it will do  it cleanses the skin without irritating it and it is slightly hydrating  and that s it  it lacks a bit of pizazz but i still really enjoy this cleanser  this is a good amount for the price too      
260,1.0,                       i have bought cerave hydrating moisturizer for a couple years now and used to love it because it made my skin feel so soft   but the most recent bottle i purchased back in july stings and burns my face terribly   then i saw a report that the company had been bought by loreal recently and changed up the formula some  so it makes sense i guess   this product literally hurts my face now and i have discontinued using it      
261,5.0,                       i ve always had oily skin and it s been acne prone since my late    s  pregnancy    i m now     a few months ago my skin started breaking out horribly  but also was sensitive  dry  and even started getting flaky  it was itchy and red  i hadn t really changed my skin care and was using all non comedogenic products  so i m not sure what started it  anyway  i switched up all my skincare to scent free  sensitive skin products  and started moisturizing more despite it seeming counterintuitive with the acne  i use this cleanser plus a eucerin moisturizing cream morning and night  everything started clearing up  now i just get maybe one pimple every couple of weeks  which i spot treat with benzoyl peroxide cream  then moisturize as usual  i am so grateful that i found this  i will say that despite it seeming very rich  i do still need an additional moisturizer  or my skin feels tight  but it has worked so well for me      
262,4.0,                       this is a great product but my aesthetician noticed the first   ingredients contained glycerin and cetearyl alcohol which she does not recommend   she said the alcohol can dry out skin and glycerin can clog pores   i always thought cerave was recommended by dermatologists  but maybe there s another formula by the same brand that does not contain these ingredients      
263,5.0,                       soo soft and light on the skin  this is some of the best formula i have ever tried on my skin  it really does hydrate and you feel how hydrated your skin is after  a little goes a long way  and no residue left on skin  perfect for every day      
264,2.0,                       it is like cream  i had little bit eye liner after i used make up remover  but i thought it will gone when i wash my face with the products  but it did not  and i use it after i put my foundation on my face  cuz i use my finger to put foundation on  i still have the foundation on my finger s wrinkles  i know this is not for make up  but if it did not clean these spot  how it can clean pores  it might be good after facial wash  like using as conditioner for your face      
265,5.0,                       great product treatment for seborrheic dermatitis  although this product is not prescribed for treating seborrheic dermatitis  it has kept me clear for almost a month now      
266,5.0,                       my dermatologist recommended this product to me   i have very sensitive skin  and this cleanser did not irritate my skin in the least    it takes off my makeup with ease and cleanses without drying up my skin like the moisturizing soaps did  i am very happy with this cleanser      
267,5.0,                       i was breaking out and my face hurt from wearing a mask and goggles for    hour hospital shifts and none of my cleansers were helping  once i started using this and the moisturizer my skin cleared up completely      
268,5.0,                       i came across this cleanser from my favorite influencer jen reed at the sister studio and i love it  it s great for sensitive skin and combination skin  it s hydrating and non drying  there s no scent  which i love  since adding it to my routine my skin has been less dry and oily      
269,5.0,                       i have dry skin  used to use neutrogena face wash for sensitive skin and this is way better  i feel like you use less product and get better results  if you are wearing heavy eye makeup i do recommend using an oil cleansing method first  it helps  this so moisturizing and effective  i ll never use another brand again      
270,5.0,                       i don t know why it said there s scent but it s fragrance free  i have sensitive acne prone skin  i ve been using cerave face wash for a year and it works great  my face feels clean but not that tight tugged feeling  i don t feel like my skin was stripped of moisture like other cleansers  if you have dry skin then get this cleanser  if you have oily then get the foaming wash  i like how it s dermatologist tested and recommended at a great price too      
271,5.0,                       idk how to feel about it  i bought it because i ve seen a lot of reviews and videos of this cleanser  saying that it doesn t lather or remove makeup but that it cleans well and its gentle so i bought it and tested it on the back of my hand and after rinsing it off my hand felt and look like i had oil on it  you know when you have a surface with oil and you put water on it but the water just glides on the oily surface    thats just how it feels but at the same time even though my face doesn t feel clean when its wet  when my faces dries  it feels nice and clean i want to love it so much  i ve been using it in the morning to get a gentle cleanse and to take off all the creams that i put at night      
272,5.0,                       i am very pleased with this product  i own many different facial cleansers that are expensive  this was given a great review as being a great beauty product for the price in a magazine  i highly recommend it  i even bought it again      
273,5.0,                       super soft to the skin  leaves your skin feeling hydrated and soft and great pair with the ordinary serums  thank you amazon and thank you tiktok i have now clearer skin      
274,2.0,                       i have sensitive skin and typically use the foaming facial cleanser  but decided to try this hydrating version   that was a mistake  my biggest complaint is that it does not wash you face  i wear light makeup and i find this does not take it all off  i have to use additional products to remove my makeup which is probably removing any positive effects of this hydrating product  i m switching back to the foaming version      
275,5.0,                       i actually got this for my son who really does not take care of his skin  getting him to wash his face is a chore  this is not a  girlly  skin care product  it has no female scent and i noticed a big difference in his skin after he used it only one time     hopefully he will continue to use it  he is also using the cerave moisturizing lotion      
276,2.0,                       i was excited to try this  as i m always looking for affordable skin care  and this was recommended  but this does not take off makeup well  i washed my face twice  for at least    seconds both times  and once i put toner on you can see there was still makeup present  i m definitely disappointed and i thought i was going to find a new holy grail face wash      
277,5.0,                       this stuff is fabulous    i have sensitive dry peeling skin   i have used this for several months now and it is wonderful   i will purchase this over and over again      
278,5.0,                       i m super happy i can finally wash my face without the dry tight feeling afterwards  after having my first baby my skin was never the same  my normal cleanser was leaving my skin dry  flaky and worst of all itchy  i tried multiple different products from high end facial washer to natural to generic and nothing was working  everything was upsetting my newly sensitive skin  read reviews on this cleanser and decided what the heck  glad i did because after the first use my skin was feeling so much better and moisturized  after the second use my skin was no longer itchy  i would definitely recommend for sensitive skin      
279,5.0,                       it feels like i m putting more lotion instead of taking my lotion off  it s way too moisturizing for it to be a cleanser  it leaves my skin just as greasy as it was before  and i have very sensitive skin  i don t think it s worth all the talk about it      
280,5.0,                       i m on my fourth large bottle of this face wash  i didn t like it at first because i was used to a lather  i am    so my main concerns revolve around anti aging skincare  this has been amazing for my skin  i also love the fact it has ceramides to help my skin s natural barrier     
281,5.0,                       i have been using this product since i got which is about a week now and wow i love it  the smell is normal nothing fancy to it  and its a huge bottle and little goes a long way  i do have a pimple on my face and have been watching it go down over these few weeks  but eating healthy also helps keep those bad boys away too i do have sensitive skin and was worried it wasn t going to do much  but this product works much better than the high end facial wash i got from sephora  funny how that workswill buy again and again    try it out  u never know ur skin might love it  my skin loves it and glowes great      
282,1.0,                       fake product  burns like hell  dries skin horribly      
283,1.0,                       horrible  not like the other cerave cleansers i ve used  this doesn t clean at all and leaves my face with a gross lotion like coat  i really like the other cerave products and recommend them but this is a do not buy  at least until they change the formula to something that cleanses properly      
284,5.0,                       i live in an extremely dry climate and have struggled with adult acne  using harsh acne washes dried out my skin even further and i didn t realize i was making it worse  since switching to this moisturizing cleanser my skin tone and texture has improved dramatically and my dehydrated skin is no longer so thirsty  it easily takes off all my makeup and leaves my skin feeling soft afterwards  will be purchasing again      
285,5.0,                       i first tried this when i stayed at my sister s house for a weekend  she swears by it for her hormonal acne caused by pcos  we have very similar skin  although hers is a bit more severe  i often have trouble with cysts on my chin and neck  seriously  just within   days of use  this wash combatted a nasty breakout  boosted radiance  and made my face softer than it s ever been  which quickly prompted me to buy my own  i have been cyst free since using it  x daily for over a month now the texture is off putting at first  feels like lotion   but the absorption is amazing  you barely have to rinse it off  i hate messy  foamy washes that drip all over the counter or leave residue  this is very hydrating and light  great for my sensitive skin  i am curious to try other washes by cerave  but this will be my permanent go to from now on  nothing has worked better for me      
286,1.0,                       i will say for all commenting about how it doesn t remove your make up  do not rely on this for removing make up alone and give it a bad review  you should be applying a make up remover then go in and cleanse with this product  it s not a foaming cleanser because it is meant to be a hydrating the only bad thing i have to say is the product is it definitely looks like the person who shipped it out did not care what state the bottle would come in  all the product was spilled in the box when it arrived so i won t be purchasing this product online anymore      
287,5.0,                       i m new to using this brand  but i really do like it so far  it s not heavy and doesn t dry out my skin  so i hope to buy more with the moisturizer and toner      
288,5.0,                       this was recommended to me by a dermatologist friend with beautiful skin  she uses cerave cleanser once in the morning  once at night  with the regular cerave lotion  and i was so jealous of her skin and tired of buying expensive junk that promises the moon  so i figured i d give it a shot  i m very glad i did full disclosure  i m in my   s with combination skin  blotchiness issues  occasional spots of acne  and suffer from psoriasis on my face  nothing severe  but far from perfection  i ve tried plenty of products and price points this cleanser lotion combo works beautifully  my skin is cleansed and refreshed and looks great  never feels overdry  and i m not paying an arm and a leg for snail goop or milky jelly or whatever marketing bull i was buying before  it feels great to wash my face  too  not like i m doing a chemical peel or scrubbing a layer of skin off      
289,5.0,                       i love this stuff  i was debating between the foaming or hydrating cleanser and i m very happy with my purchase  it s very hydrating and gentle      
290,1.0,                       i thought i ordered a different product  but this one came  i have combination skin on my face  and sensitive skin too this distinctly says for dry skin  only thing i liked about it is that it has no scent  sorry     
291,1.0,                       gentle enough  but i have to wash my face at least   times  and some of my eye make up still around my eyes  i don t use waterproof makeup  pretty useless      
292,1.0,                       this is not actual cerave  the bottle that i received looked legit  but when i put the product on my face  it smelled off and stung  i compared the scent to a bottle i had bought from a store and it was definitely different  do not buy this      
293,5.0,                       i enjoy the slightly warming sensation as you rub the face wash in  there s not much of a scent to it which is preferable since most scents irritate me  after washing with it my face does feel very moisturized despite having very hard water where i live  i have noticed a bit more breakout  but that may have to do with the whole new skin regimen and my skin just adjusting      
294,5.0,                       love this cleanser  it gets the job done  my face is clean and clear   no harsh chemicals or any other nonsense  it does have ceramides  which work to repair the skin barrier   this can make it feel like i very light film is left on the face  i personally have never had a problem with it  and i don t even notice it at this point  but it is worth mentioning  i have had friends not like the feeling  worth a try in the smaller version  then move on to the   pack        
295,5.0,                       i ve been using this cleanser for a couple of years now  it s great stuff   removes my makeup and yet non drying  great   inexpensive product  i ve converted my sister   a friend to switching from their favorite product to this now favorite of theirs      
296,5.0,                       coming from some one who always felt like i needed to buy high end and expensive skin care products  i wish i would have tried this long ago  truly in my opinion  nothing beats this stuff  my acne prone skin loves this moisturizing cleanser   my skin has never looked healthier  i suffer from acne breaks outs with very dry surface skin  yet an oily t zone  i use this product with neutrogena oil free sensitive moisturizer and tretinoin  for acne  anti aging   my skin looks better than it ever has  and my routine is cheaper than it s ever been      
297,4.0,                       great product and not drying to the skin  best when used with silicone facial brush  see photo  for more clean and to exfoliate the face gently  best to apply moisturizer afterwards for soft and super hydrated skin    stars instead of   because i wish it could clean better but i understand the product is super gentle and wants to market it as such  to add soap to the ingredients will make it not super gentle  to solve this dilemma  messaging using silicone facial brush in circular  motion is the answer i m disappointed with the seller because the container was made of a folded carton with no tape to secure the products  see photo   needless to say the box was already opened when i received it  a simple tape would have secured the products but i guess that s too much work for the seller or the seller simply didn t care if the customers received the box opened or not  there s no excuse for such attitude especially if selling is your livelihood        
298,5.0,                       the older i get  the more i m focused on making sure the products i use on my skin are actually doing something beneficial  not just that they smell nice or feel luxurious  but that they re actually improving my skin  this cerave face wash absolutely fits the bill  it contains all the buzzwords you d want in a face wash  ceramides  hyaluronic acid  niacinamide  etc  my face is left feeling clean and moisturized  there s no drying or tight sensation  no residue left behind  just the perfect first step in my skincare routine      
299,5.0,                       this stuff is amazinggggg  i ve always had dry skin  especially on my mouth area and nose  i d have flakes and during the winter  it was the worst  but washing my face with this product has been making my life so much easier  it s thick and doesn t burn tingle sting at all  it s like you have nothing on your face  then after you wash it off  you skin definitely feels moisturized and smooth      
300,5.0,                       my skin is very prone to over drying after face washing  i ve used many products that claim to not have that tugging feeling after cleansing but have not found one that worked for me until i came across this  the pump bottle makes it easy to use each day  there is not a strong scent to this  which is a good thing in my book  very smooth feeling when washing my face  as if i m using lotion to wash my face  the best part is that this doesn t cause the tugging feeling  i am on my second bottle of this and i have no intention on switching products      
301,5.0,                       i can t get enough of this cleanser  i ve tried more expensive brands  and this is my holy grail  i use it as a second cleanser after removing my makeup sunscreen with an oil or balm cleanser  and then in the morning as my only cleanser  it s unscented and doesn t leave my face feeling dry  it s definitely not designed for taking off makeup  but you really should be using a makeup remover oil cleanser for that anyway      
302,5.0,                       i like the dewy moisture provided by this product   my skin stays soft after cleansing and fuller  presumably due to the hyaluronic acid ingredient   less wrinkles so common with aging skin      
303,5.0,                       this is great for dry skin issue s    like eczema or psoriasis   over the winter i developed eczema and i didn t know what to do about it   i asked my fb friend s and this was mentioned   i m happy to report back that i have found it to be gentle yet effective   it smells fresh and definitely does the job without making my face all greasy   i would recommend this lotion soap to anyone looking for something maintainable  that works very well for sensitive skin as well as dry skin   i d give it    stars   thanks for making this accessible      
304,3.0,                       it doesn t feel or seem like it cleans all that well  it makes my skin feel like its burning in some areas so proceed with caution if you have sensitive skin      
305,5.0,                       loved this product   i have normal to dry in the winter and normal to oily in the summer  in my t zone  and this has helped me build  a great moisture barrier and keep it intact just wish amazon would have packed it better to ship bc my pump was totally broken off upon opening package    so i have to dump it out into my hand instead of pump   still get the use of product    just less convenient      
306,5.0,                       perfect for sensitive skin  actually recommended by my dermatologist to continue use   it s so soothing   leaves your skin so soft   there s no scent so it s perfect for my skin   seller ships quickly      
307,3.0,                       didn t irritate my sensitive skin and had a light scent  but it felt like i was cleansing with lotion   i ultimately decided it was too heavy for me and ended out using it as shave gel instead  which turned out to be a nice re purpose      
308,5.0,                       it does kind of feel like lotion  but it seems to be working great  i have acne and sensitive skin  it makes my skin look good and seems to be helping with my acne problem  i haven t been using it very long  my face cleared up when i was consistent with my face routine  however if i miss a day a zit may still pop up  so it doesn t necessarily work miracles  but my skin looks healthier and glowing and it seems to be doing its job  i m using a retinal cream with it which i really like  just ordered a mud mask that i m going to start using twice a week  i m determined to get my skin looking it s best  i m tired of the breakouts and blackheads     
309,3.0,                       i tried this out for my face but it didn t work very well if at all but that doesn t mean it won t work for someone else  i personally don t recommend for oily skin     
310,2.0,                       not a fan  first time user  won t buy again  scent is light and nice  however  feels like i m cleansing with lotion  always have to use at least twice to wash off full face of makeup giving   stars for scent and scent alone      
311,5.0,                       i have sensitive skin i bought this doe this reason and it works   walmart is cheaper but to avoid crowds   the drive and covid convenient to order amazon  this product works great highly recommend     
312,5.0,                       okay so i wasn t sure what would really help me  my skin was so dry post partum about   month in  and i was dying cause in general my face only gets small blemishes and maybe even more oily than dry   so i tried this one for sensitive dry skin  and it helped immensely over time  they say not to use the foaming wash for dry skin so i got the creamier one   it feels like a lotion going on the skin damp and over just a few days to a week i felt little improvement  much more than any other cream   oil i tried  i knew the basics to help my skin would be what i wash it with  so i kept going every morning every night and air dry skin  soon no more itching  peeling skin on my face   now he s just normal and i can feel a different if i miss a day in washing my skin with this   so grateful i tried it   be patient and be consistent and this will help       
313,5.0,                       this product is immediate relief on flaky  dry or red skin  i ve never had a product that feels so soothing immediately upon application  it feels like a cooling milk cream  i use this as an initial wash then follow up with salicylic acne wash and this really helps add a layer of moisture i ve never had before  i really recommend this product to anyone who feels they have troubled skin as it is extremely mild and comforting on the skin      
314,1.0,                       i guess this product works for some people  but not for me  i wanted a different cleanser that would even my skin tone and help with dry winter skin  this was definitely not it  i went to having a very mild case of winter dry skin and acne to full blown teenager breakout within   days of using this product  beware      
315,5.0,                       i am currently on accutane and this is a life saver  it doesn t strip the skin and it feels so nice  i use a cleansing oil to take off my make up before this  this cleanser is used best when you don t have any make up on since it isn t meant to take off a full face      
316,5.0,                       pump broke first time i used it     
317,1.0,                       advertised as paraben free and there are parabens right on the label in the ingredients  what a waste of my time  now i have to return it      
318,2.0,                       i have been using this for a while and i have to use it with a silicone face scrubber or it does nothing  i wear make up some days and it wouldn t take it off on it s own  definitely have to wash twice with the silicone face scrubber to get it all off  it doesn t dry my face out so i do think it is moisturizing  no scent which is nice  i won t be buying it again because it doesn t leave my face feeling clean      
319,1.0,                       what a let down  it removes no make up whatsoever and doesn t clean your skin  i ve used the regular ceravae for years and thought i d try this one because my skin has been dry lately  it basically just pushed the make up around my face  but never washed it off  i don t contour or wear heavy eye make up  i wear the normal amount  this is a complete waste      
320,5.0,                       i loved this product  i have struggled with acne since puberty  yeah  so almost    years  recently it has gotten worse  probably because i work in a kitchen as a kitchen manager  but ever since hyram reviewed this product i decided to give this a go  i never really looked at cerave products before due to their products lower price and the simple packaging so other products attracted me because i was ignorant on what to look for but after learning a little more about how to find the right skin routine and products i immediately bought this  and after about a month of usage i noticed a huge difference  my skin is clearer and i my blackheads are less frequent  i love it      
321,5.0,                       i love it  i have sensitive skin and suffered from horrible acne in my teenage years  i ve tried a lot  but most of the face washes i tried were too harsh  leaving skin dry and flakey  especially in the winter months  this seems to be a perfect balance  keeping my skins moisturized without feeling greasy  yet not overdrying  pump and amount were perfect      
322,2.0,                       this product doesn t really do anything for me  my face didn t feel clean after using it  it made a lot of little bumps on my forehead appear  doesn t really have a scent  for reference i have sensitive skin     
323,5.0,                       i am    years old  i typically use all clarins products on my face  however  i use cere ve on my body so thought i would give the cleanser a try  i am very pleased with it  i also use retin a on my skin   times a week   so my skin gets quite dry and sensitive  i have had absolutely no problems with this cleanser    love it      
324,5.0,                       one day i looked at the cleanser i d used for years  normal to oily skin  and i realized that neither one fit my facial description anymore  i had matured  and so did my skin  i needed to treat it gently  and not strip it of any moisture it had  my facial skin needed to be pampered i read the rave reviews for cerave hydrating face wash and tried it  it went on without water and felt soft  soothing and terrific  i used a  wash clothe to gently remove it and all my makeup  my skin felt rehydrated after using it and i have definitely found my new facial cleanser      
325,5.0,                       best face wash for those who dont have severe acne  but still need need clean their face because they have oily skin if you dont need a fashwash with harsh acne medications  choose this every time      
326,2.0,                       i guess i m not a fan of cream face washes  hate the texture  it s awful  my face feels like there s a film on it and it never feels clean  will not be repurchasing  also  i ve been breaking out    i think it s because of this      
327,1.0,                       i liked this until i looked into the ingredients and found several ingredients which were high in toxicity  see pic of ingredients or go on the think dirty app threw it out due to untrustworthy ingredients      
328,5.0,                       i like this product because it doesn t make my face all stiff after washing  it actually does moisturize well  however  the scent is a little chemically and the texture is literally like washing your face with lotion  it s kinda weird but does the job      
329,5.0,                       i have extremely sensitive skin  most face washes are way to harsh and leave me with dryness and redness  this face wash has been my life saver  it s great for sensitive skin  hydrated me without feeling oily and has no scent which i love      
330,5.0,                       love the product   the packaging is horrible  however   needs to be packaged in a stiff box so it doesn t get squished   currently packaged in a book type cover   it squirted out everywhere the first time  i called and it was replaced  but the packaging was the same      
331,5.0,                       hi  this cleanser is amazing  i didn t think it would be so good  i have combination skin  and easily get acne coming and going  but i started using this and the cerave moisturizer and my skin has been so clear   my skin tone has evened up and even the random bumps on my nose smoothed out  my skin is clearer  smoother  and softer than ever before  thanks to cerave      
332,5.0,                       i ve had acne for    years  i recently decided to get treatment and the dermatologist recommended this  i use a topical prescription that can tend to be drying but this in combination with an oil free moisturizer has kept my skin hydrated and soft  it did not make me break out either      
333,5.0,                       my skin is pretty sensitive  for the longest time i just washed with water because of it  and even that was really drying  my dermatologist declared i had oily skin  and recommended the cerave cleanser for  normal to oily  skin  god my face just was so taut and dry and itchy after washing  it was the worst  i d slather in lotion after and that would seem to fix it but then i tried this stuff  its sooo niiiiice  no itching  no tautness  just a dab of lotion on my nose and i m good  i m even less oily over the course of the day listen to your skin  if your  gentle  cleanser makes you dread every face wash  maybe you don t have  oily  type skin note that this cleanser kinda feels like lotion  it does not foam like most soap  that doesn t mean it s not cleaning      
334,5.0,                       cerave is a well loved and trusted brand  this is my first ever facial cleanser  my skin is tolerant of most things so this left my face feeling very much refreshed and clean  it s a quick and vital step in my routine  and for the price is probably difficult to beat in terms of price performance ratio  for my skin not much could work better     
335,5.0,                       cerave hydrating facial cleanser brought back a healthy glow to my skin  since covid i wash my face many times a day  cerave helps keep my skin from drying out  i even think it reduced some fine lines from around my eyes  it s not greasy  it doesn t smell  it doesn t burn if you accidentally get some in your eyes  but do wash it out with lots of water anyway  i look forward to washing my face with cerave just before going to sleep      
336,1.0,                       the sole purpose of me buying this was for makeup and oil removal without stripping my skin of moisture  it actually doesn t strip anything not even what it s supposed to strip away  makeup was still left on my face even after washing it twice with this cleanser  this would be good for someone that doesn t wear makeup  but i would still not recommend using it then because it seems like it will leave buildup on your face with time  that will then cause allergies in the long run  might be better just to pick another cleanser that actually cleans instead of sitting on your face like a moisturizer      
337,1.0,                       the texture of this is like lotion  truthfully is fragrance free as advertised   my problem is that it doesn t cleanse well   after the first wash  i still visibly have makeup on my skin   after the second  i still have makeup on a cotton pad with toner applied   it takes three full washes to get all of the makeup off  and i am only wearing a light foundation with powder      
338,5.0,                       this cleanser  in conjunction with the renewing sa cream  has produced a night and day difference in my formerly combination  very sensitive skin  the cleanser does not overly dry the skin  but rather leaves it feeling healthy and balanced  i have not experienced any drying or acne issues as a result  definitely recommend to anyone looking for a more gentle cleanser  i have also tried the counterpart cetaphil cleanser  and found this vastly preferable      
339,4.0,                       it s a nice cleanser  it s perfect for winter or if you have dry skin  my skin is normal and come summer and humidity  this baby will get put away  literally feels like washing your face with lotion  if you re like me  order the smallest size  it probably won t be good when you pull it out of the cabinet come early november      
340,5.0,                       after   months of consistent use with my prescription my acne has cleared up and my face has restored its moisture  i use the moisturizing cream for dry skin too works really well  worth the money     
341,3.0,                       after using this  i felt like my skin didn t feel clean  it honestly felt like i was cleansing my face with lotion  it definitely moisturized  but after using this for a few weeks my face started breaking out again  which makes me feel like it wasn t good at cleansing  i typically use the foaming facial cleanser and now i just follow up with a moisturizer      
342,3.0,                       i used it one time  it didn t remove my makeup  why make something to cleanse sensitive skin  that doesn t to the job of cleansing  it might be gentle  but it doesn t cleanse well      
343,1.0,                       i used this product for about     weeks  my skin was fine prior to using this product but after the third week i had acne galore  as far as hydrating this product didn t do much of that  also  it didn t feel like my skin was clean because the texture of this product is like lotion  i am going to see if there is anyway i can get my money back     because naww   need less to say    i do not use this product anymore      
344,1.0,                       ouch  made me completely break out  i ve been using it for about a month and thought it was my skin getting used to it after the first pimple but it s getting worse by the day  it s been years since i ve had a horrible breakout and the only thing i ve changed is using this cleanser  i have huge acne on my chin and cheek and by my lips  never before  i m so irritated and they hurt  will not be using again  ugh  my family is shocked since i never break out      
345,2.0,                       i love cerave lotion  but i don t find this face wash to be moisturizing at all  my face is always dry after i wash  it doesn t lather that much  and if you wear makeup  you might need an additional wash to get everything off  it is good for sensitive skin though and doesn t make me break out      
346,1.0,                       i usually use cetaphil facial wash but this was on sale so i decided to give it a try  besides it was listed as amazon s choice  bad mistake  i washed my face as usual  then again with my clairasonic  facial brush  make up was all over my brush  i never had a problem like this with cetaphil  i then washed my face completely twice  then used my facial brush  same thing  make up all over my brush  i couldn t return it because i waited too long to try it  so it was wasted money   i wondered why it was listed as an amazon choice product  then went back and read the horrible reviews  i m now back to cetaphil facial wash and it s the best  just sorry i couldn t return it      
347,5.0,                       the cerave hydrating face wash is my new favorite  i have extremely sensitive skin  and had been using baby bath to wash my face for several years  but even as gentle as that was  it left my skin feeling dry and i always wondered whether it was efficiently removing my makeup  the cerave face wash leaves my face feeling clean  soft  moisturized and with no residue whatsoever  it is very gentle and has no detectable scent  i am so pleased and will continue to use this great product      
348,1.0,                       my eczema symptoms developed on my body  so i wanted to prevent anything happening on my face purchased this item due to highly rated reviews and wonderful reviews this item felt like i am washing my face with a lotion or moisturizer  some people may find it as moisturizing  but i felt like my face wasn t fully washed even after multiple rounds of wash i purchased bioderm wash for face   body and i love them  it foams and feels very clean after the wash      
349,1.0,                       this is not the real cleanser you buy at the drugstores  like another person mentioned it does not have the trademark symbol next to the name  this product does not cleanse your face right  it has a fragrance and it burns your face    do not buy this from amazon        
350,5.0,                       this cleanser came recommended much on youtube   i like the way it left my skin feeling clean but not stripped   will be branching out to try other of their products      
351,5.0,                       my dermatologist recommended the cerave body lotion so i thought i would try the face wash   so many in the stores sting my face  largely because of alcohol    this product does not   i even get it in my eyes occasionally and that doesn t hurt   it is a big bottle for the money and when it runs out i will be buying another      
352,1.0,                       i received the cleanser and moisturizer together and i believe i got duped  the packaging was tampered with and i am not certain i received the actual product  two thumbs down      
353,5.0,                       i ve been using this for months now and and love it  it is exactly what it says it is  a hydrating cleanser this product is not  a makeup remover  an oil remover  a heavy duty cleaning formula  for deep pore cleansing  exfoliating in any waythis product is  a hydrating cleanser  great for dry skin  super gentle  for after you ve already gotten stubborn makeup off  calming  good for irritated or freshly exfoliated skin     
354,5.0,                       no issues with my chemical sensitivity disorder  and scent  yes eve   unscented  items tend to have odors a d chemicals in them i react badly to   my skin feels so silky now  but never feels clogged  its downright soothing   a bit of a change to get away from use of products with sls in them but a healthy one      
355,5.0,                       i have dry eczema prone skin  i like using this because it rinses off easily unlike other cream cleansers  and it leaves my skin still feeling moisturized  however  i wouldn t go as far as to say that i feel comfortable washing my face more than once a day with this  i usually wash my face at night but when i exercise in the morning  i also have to wash my face  my face doesn t feel as moisturized when i wash it two times a day as opposed to once a day  but that is to be expected      
356,5.0,                       i ve been using cerave hydrating facial cleanser for a couple weeks  this product provided me with a chemical exfoliation while cleansing  the process is gentle but left my skin texture clean and noticeably smoother  in feel   i m pleased with the price  buck an ounce  and would buy this again      
357,2.0,                       it s decent in the summer  but in the winter it did me no favors  face feels and looks better just washing with water      
358,5.0,                       great for your skin  i suffer from skin that reacts to any minor issue  so i will have breakouts pretty regularly  i have studied and been taught practical solutions for this  have seen multiple dermatologists  use toner and oils  and have tried tons of face washes  this is the only one i truly trust was unable to find this anywhere locally  between target  walmart  cvs  everywhere  it was all sold out  this stuff is worth a try  and a good size for the price      
359,5.0,                       there is not a scent with this face wash which i love  i use it everyday and seems to work well on my skin      
360,1.0,                       seriously i don t care how many beauty bloggers swear by this   it contains acne causing ingredients  unless you have dry skin or are not prone to acne  steer clear  i never ever felt like my skin got clean      
361,1.0,                       i have combination skin  oily and dry   this is like lotion  is moisturizing but doesn t clean at all  within a week of using this my skin was like a mountain range  disgusting  as soon as i switched back to purpose cleanser my skin immediately started to look better   do not buy this if you are oily  dry or acne prone  actually dont buy this at all     
362,1.0,                       i would not recommend  i have extremely dry sensitive fair skin and this wash made my skin very irritated and red  i don t know what exactly caused it  if there s a specific chemical or just a general reaction from the face wash  but the redness took a few hours to clear up  will discontinue use  wish i could get a refund      
363,5.0,                       this is very gentle and it leaves the skin feeling fresh and clean  cerave is an excellent brand and this is another high quality product from them  it does not cause any dry skin or irritation      
364,5.0,                       i ve tried all kinds of fancy face washes from various skincare lines  but this one does the trick for the least amount of money   good for aging skin that can be prone to breakouts from many  aging skincare  products   simple  clean  moisturizing w o breakouts  and a great price to boot      
365,5.0,                       so if you don t like scent and have sensitive and dry skin this is for you  i love it  it s very moisturizing and soft on skin  i use it in the morning before work it s wakes the skin up     
366,1.0,                       i specifically bought this product to replace my cetaphil  after learning parabens are a no no  and this product is advertised as  fragrance free and paraben free   it in fact has both methylparaben and propylparaben   i m assuming this must be an older product  and cerave changed their formulation but this seller has old product  regardless  this is false advertising  no good  wish i could have given   stars      
367,5.0,                       my very favorite that i have to hunt down because my daughters love it and take it to their bathroom      
368,4.0,                       i like this but i m having a hard time getting passed the fact that it doesn t lather at all  it does make my skin feel moisturized and is very gentle  but it almost feels like i m washing my face with a moisturizer  i plan on trying the cerave foaming cleanser next      
369,5.0,                       this is my second time ordering this product and i love it  my skin is very prone to drying out so i like how this face wash does not further the process  i also enjoy the pump and the sheer amount of product in the bottle      
370,5.0,                       because of tik tok  i bought a few items from cerave and i love everything so far  this cleanser is super gentle for my sensitive acne prone skin and i haven t broken out from it  i have nothing bad to say about it    yet     if i do  i will come back and tell yall the tea later      
371,5.0,                       i absolutely love this face wash  it is the only face wash i have tried that does not leave my skin feeling dry and tight after washing it  it is super gentle and doesn t strip your face at all  however  because of the creamy texture  i find that i usually double cleanse to get all the impurities off  my go to face wash  love it      
372,3.0,                       nice and creamy and removes makeup well      
373,4.0,                       i have been suffering with very bad acne this past year and i have been struggling to find a product to properly clean my skin without stripping it  without breaking me out anymore than i already am and to help clear up  some of my acne  i bought this because everyone says their dermatologist recommends this brand   i have not been to one yet  going this weekend  finally   i picked the hydrating one over the original one because michigan winters are no joke and my skins super dry right now  it s definitely helped with my redness and helps prevent breakouts  it s helped clear up some of my acne but not all of it  hoping the dermatologist helps with that  it s not a miracle in a bottle but it doesn t break me out and it doesn t over dry me or give me that tight feeling  so  i am happy with this face wash   how it cleans my skin      
374,5.0,                       i have normal to dry skin  during the summer i get an oily t zone  and this is the only stuff that doesn t leave my face feeling kind of tight  i ve using moisturizing face washes before  some far more expensive  and wanted to like them a lot  but this stuff is the truth  i was worried about using this due to being prone to acne break outs and blackheads  but this doesn t bother it at all   there s no clogging pores and my skincare products sink right in  this has been upgraded to my permanent routine      
375,5.0,                       okay so  i m terrible with keeping up with skin care because i just get too depressed  i bought this because my skin was dry and rough and now  i ve been using it for almost a week  and i m already seeing improvements  my skin looks cleaner and feels a lot smoother  the best part is that there is no scent      
376,2.0,                       it doesn t lather up and leaves my face feeling like i just put lotion on it  not cleanser  my face just feels greasy moisturized than clean  similar to those  in shower lotion  products that didn t really take off  i wouldn t purchase again      
377,2.0,                       this supposedly gentle cleanser burned like crazy when i put it on  i did this on   separate occasions with no other product on my face and it happened all   times  i didn t want to break out so i washed it off immediately and gave it to my husband instead  not good for even mildly sensitive skin      
378,5.0,                       this is the only thing that has ever helped my acne    including hormonal acne   i have been put on many prescriptions  birth control  tried so many products but this is it  i still get breakouts during my cycle but this always clears them up right after and prevents more scarring  i ve never felt this confident in my life  i use this once in the morning  once at night  and a light moisturizer and my face is so smooth  hydrated  and healthy c   and my scarring is fiiinally fading after   years of cystic acne     
379,1.0,                       the product itself is outstanding   do not buy here because shipping had poor internal protection and resulted in the top part of pump breaking in transient presumably   if broken prior to shipment  shame on person doing the packaging   no reason for failing to place enough cushion inside shipping box   haste or lack of attention resulted in breakage      
380,5.0,                       on first use my skin felt amazing   oh this is good  is what i thought within seconds of using it  had some facial eczema or something near my nose and on my cheek  tried a few lotions and methods that haven t worked  ive been using this on my whole face then covering with vaseline over the trouble areas per some recommendations online  i vaseline twice a day and use this cleaner once  the combo finally has my face looking healed  still have a lil ways to go but the improvement is the best results ive gotten  will update once i know for sure  can t say it was just this cleaner but my skin feels great after using it and im very happy with the product
