0,4.0 ,                       these run small and shrink a bit when dried  i dried one on accident and won t make that mistake   i recommend buying a size up  husband has a more sturdy build b not huge  he s a large and they come up when he raises arms  they keep him dry so that s a great part      
1,2.0 ,                       fabric is good but the cut of the t shirt is weird  too tight around the neck and shoulders  not comfortable at all  they should re  look at the design again neck and shoulders      
2,4.0 ,                       these shirts seem to be relatively descent  but they are definitely not sized correctly  make sure you order a larger size than regular because they are much tighter than they should be even if you account for a good fit  i guess they could be useful as something to aspire to lose some weight  lol      
3,3.0 ,                       i really like that the shirts stretch  but they re wayyyyy too small    i looked for a notation that the shirts wouldrun small  etc   but didn t see one    i usually wear a xl  but figured i d order xxl for some extra room   but even the xxl size is wayyyy too small   the shirts seems to be about the size of a regular large  so make sureto account for this when you order      
4,5.0 ,                       my husband likes very soft light weight shirts and these are perfect   he doesn t sweat in them or get to hot perfect shirt     
5,1.0 ,                       ordered my shirts the size i wear in all my shirts i purchase  i received and opened the package of five to try on  the fit was to small  nice material and nice looking shirts just recommend ordering a size up from what you wearing      
6,5.0 ,                       at first i bought l so i had to return them and get xl  the color s of the   were exactly what you d see as described  very comfortable  but when you wash them and air dry them i don t know if it s the landry soaps that i m using or if it s the shirt s but there is like this spoiled smell like they have been siting out in a laundrybasket for like a week or    but other then that i have ordered several more of them  and i just ordered   more lol      
7,3.0 ,                       i normally wear a x large size shirt  so for comfort i order xx large shirts  t they fit like a large shirts i don t under stand how this could be xx large     
8,5.0 ,                       these shirts look great  alittle tight in the chest but looks and feels fantastic  well worth the price considering you d pay more for the same thing and get just   shirt      
9,4.0 ,                       this is my second order of these great wicking shirts  this order had one shirt undersized  it was labeled as xxl but was much smaller than all of the others in this order and my previous one  it s not worth the hassle of returning  but heads up to the manufacturer seller to be more careful on sizing  otherwise  it is a great shirt at a fantastic price      
10,1.0 ,                       material quality is very good  they weave a black strand in with base color  very high quality looking  also put a fabric strip on back of collar  keeps shirt from sagging from sweat etc  here s the kicker though  i have nike  uner armour  jockey brand micro fiber t style shirts  they are   xl or xl and fit comfortably  i bought real essentials   xxl and they super small  different countries hav  different size patterns for sizes  unfortunately  i returned all    shirts and cancelled shorts orders  it s difficult buying clothing online      
11,5.0 ,                       i had to remember that dry fit clings to every curve of your upper body   while i m in the process of losing weight  i have to be patient and know that by the time spring comes in       they will fit great   i am wearing them now only when i go out for my walk or sweat a lot   overall they are a great buy      
12,4.0 ,                       i like the material   it protects my skin because i wear them as under tops for   of them  it is a decent price      
13,2.0 ,                       casual wear around the house and workout i usually wear a xxl great styling and color may want to make shorts that match top too tight in the shoulders  fine in the waist could be just a little longersuggest either expand the shoulders or make a xxxlhave to send them back because there is no room to move in the shoulders     
14,1.0 ,                       fittings are ok  quality is on the lower end  i choose this product thinking to have   different color t shirts for every day workout  but received   grey t shirts and   red  that makes me to think why did i even buy this product  quality check could have been done before packing      
15,2.0 ,                       i didnt even get to try it yet   i checked the seems on one of the shirt and there was a hole in there so i returned the shirts   quality from a   to    i d give it a       
16,3.0 ,                       this is a thin nice shirt not flattering if you have a belly  i would go a size up if you dont want it to be close to body  i have no idea what the smell is on these shirts but it took   washes to get rid of the chemical smell       
17,4.0 ,                       had to send first order of   pack back because of size  according to size chart i should wear a large  received the order and  it barely came to belt line  tight across chest and arms  sent back and reordered extra large  received them and they fit perfect  since this is a amazon essential they should really update their size chart  i wear a    belt    chest and am  ft      if you notice percentage of right size is only    to    percent  this behoves amazon to start paying attention to their own web site      percent is not good      
18,5.0 ,                       very good t shirts  incredible quality for the price  based on the price  i was not expecting a pretty good t shirts  but they surprised me the t shirts also fit very well  based on comments i decided to buy xl instead of l  because the comments said they run somewhat large  but that s no totally true     
19,2.0 ,                       rookie error on my part in not noting the numerous issues folks have experienced with these t shirts  they are not only way smaller than expected but the quality is poor  the collar hem is unevenly sewn and has a permanent wrinkle on two of them  the bottom hems have come out of three of the shirts  giving a   star rating because the colors and material are as described  i would recommend another brand over these for the money      
20,1.0 ,                       ordered xl  as i usually wear a large  they came and fit like a small  returned xl  figured i d try xxl  they were smaller than a normal medium  three inches above the belly button  wtf  also noticed crappy material and missing stitches  these were recommended by amazon  cmon bezos  get your feces consolidated     
21,3.0 ,                       i really like the design of the shirt  with the different colors on the side highlighting the shirt and shaping the body  some are better than others however  out of the pack of   at least   of them had some defects  specifically on the shoulders  for some reason it seems that the sewing was a bit different on those leading to the material to rise more than normal instead of sitting over the body      
22,2.0 ,                       these shirts we supposed to be xxl size  which they may be in china  but not america  the shirts are different sizes and none of them fit me  hell i just gave them to a friend      
23,1.0 ,                         out of   shirts stitching on neckline is ripped loose super loose  all of the shirts have atleast part of the tag missing  very disappointed i didn t realize this until shirt shop already printed on them      
24,1.0 ,                       the shirts look like a person learning how to sew put them togeather none of the stiching lines up there is thread hanging off all over the place and unraveling  on the other hand they seenlm to fit a size small so order a size up if you dont want it to look painted to your body      
25,1.0 ,                       first time buying these  and a couple of the white shirts had dark stains on them  fresh out of the package  normally this doesn t bother me  because i m thinking  whatever it ll wash off     well  i only was able to clean one of the two shirts that had stains  i didn t catch the second stain until after the wash  attention supplier  quality check your product before sending it out  this is unprofessional      
26,2.0 ,                       not pleased  the fit leaves much to be desired   the large size fit fine in the chest and arms  but are too short in length to stay tucked in   i placed another order for xl  and the neck size is too large if the large size were just a little bit longer in length  they d be perfect      
27,4.0 ,                       i bought these for my son   they fit just as expected and look good on him   his only complaint is that they seem to be a bit hot to wear but then again we ve had    degree days for a couple weeks now      
28,5.0 ,                       had to return the xl because they were l  large   ordered xxl which fits like xls      
29,4.0 ,                       only issue this is a little smaller then the other   xl i have of the same shirt   i have   others      
30,1.0 ,                       i am willing to concede that sizes can vary from different manufacturers  but these t shirts are     too small  i wear either xl or xxl depending on the shirt and these xxl were skin tight and completely unwearable      
31,1.0 ,                       shirt started to fall apart after the first wear  fits small  not a good shirt      
32,1.0 ,                       packages mislabeled  says  large  on outer packaging but contains size small  ordered them three times  same mislabeling each time      
33,4.0 ,                       said he likes them  a little small for his taste  likes the fabric     when asked him about his opinion he said  i mean  it s a shirt      sooo  this is the best review i could get from him        
34,5.0 ,                       i thought they looked comfortable  liked the colors and felt they would be great for me   well  unless you are built like a man  don t order   my hips and stomach do not work in them  altho they are nice and long  just not wide enough   i will try to find a man that can wear them or send to the salvation army      
35,1.0 ,                       do not buy this product  sizes run way small  the xl was the size of a medium    and when you try to exchange it for the proper size  they only want to return the item and charge you    in return shipping and you have to drop it off at ups    absolutely ridiculous customer service    stay away from this product      
36,4.0 ,                       these shirts work well  for some reason though they seem to consistently unravel on the sleeves after a while  the excess isnt trimmed the shirts do seem to shrink  so be cautious of that  they are inexpensive enough that i have    and when they shrink from the dryer or the sleeves unravel  i discard them      
37,4.0 ,                       the shirts are nice looking and great color   i always wear a xl and these were a little on the tight side   not enough to send them back   if i reordered  i would get the next size up      
38,1.0 ,                       from the presentation to the unboxing to the actual product  this was a bad experience all around  the shirts were unceremoniously wrapped in a ball a stuffed into a tight bubble wrap bag  one of the shirts it was supposed to come with was missing  and the shirts that did make it were all different sizes even though they said medium  they fit like smalls and extra smalls  and on top of that they were unraveling  i returned then the next day for a full refund      
39,5.0 ,                       i got these for my man  he was excited to get them since he wasn t expecting them  they fit perfect and he loves them and i love the way they feel on him      
40,4.0 ,                       the product is of high quality material and while it would be a   star i took away one as the finish need some work  there are strings hanging off the shirt and while i can cut them off  it is a distraction from the finished product being excellent  i would still recommend it to anyone as the quality is good and the design quite nice      
41,4.0 ,                       standard active shirt  for the price as a group they re good   before ever wearing a few had some loose thread on the collar that i cut off   didn t realize they were   tone  the backs are black which i m ok with  they all have that digital looking pattern   even the ones in the pics that don t look like they do   the light blue was more of a baby blue  all good     
42,1.0 ,                       twice i ve tried two different orders of xl  the first was too small and returned   the second order had the off the five relatively sized xl   very disappointed with this product   going back to tj maxx where i usually get properly sized dry wick shirts      
43,5.0 ,                       great value  nice fit  i wear them for working out and they perform just as well as shirts that i ve paid     and more for  the test will be wearability  how many washes can they handle  so far the shirts are fine after a number of laundry cycles      
44,5.0 ,                       my son loves these  perfect fit length colors material  my son is picky about clothes and these were a hit      
45,3.0 ,                       while i will admit that they are nice shirts for the money  i purchased them specifically for gym use and my reason for docking rating is due to the limited wicking  if i by a dryfit shirt i want them to wick moisture off and my feeling is that they just don t breathe like a dryfit should      
46,5.0 ,                       my boyfriend loves these shirts   very comfortable for the florida heat and they look very nice   good material  well made  wash well   very pleased      
47,5.0 ,                       these are very comfortable  i did  move up to a xxl since the xl were just a little short but that but they weren t baggy  when i did this  not often i can find something like these that i feel fit great      fr   i will definitely get more of these as they are great for wearing about or at the gym      
48,2.0 ,                       these were just way too small for a men s  xl  i returned them  the material was great  but  you d have to run two sizes up  at least      
49,5.0 ,                       i bought these without reading thinking they were cotton tshirts for work for my husband  when they came i saw they weren t cotton but it turned out my husband likes them more then just regular cotton to work in      
50,1.0 ,                       items were returned due to  smaller than normal sizing but i was charged a  return fee  that i was not aware of or i would have never purchased in the first place      
51,4.0 ,                       the shirts seem nice  but can t seem to get the correct color package sent to me  i have  had two orders sent  the original order  and then a replacement because the first one was wrong   and neither had the shirt colors i selected  i ll just be getting a refund  as i am tired of the back and forth  i m sure the shirts themselves would ve been awesome had i been sent what i ordered      
52,1.0 ,                       was excited for these shirts  at   bucks a shirt it would have been a steal if they fit correctly  the shirt is way too small across the chest in xl  i normally have no problems with xl shirts fitting my chest   this shirt just squeezes the crap out of me and is very uncomfortable   shirts neck was also loose and the fabric was different then expected   returning        
53,5.0 ,                       decided to buy these for my husband and he  loves them  they are incredibly soft and do not wrinkle my husband has been able to wear them not only in the home but also out and about with me   they go good with any shorts or jeans will buy more in the coming months      
54,1.0 ,                       you ll need at least one size or even two sizes bigger than you think and there is no stretch in collar  sleeve ends or bottom of shirt  at all  very poor quality      
55,1.0 ,                       these shirts are garbage  not only are they undersized  but they re so thin they re a joke  cheaply made i wear an xxl  ordered an xxl     fit like a large sucks too because i forgot to take them back before the   vday return period  now i m stuck with     worth of crap      
56,5.0 ,                       on the advice of my dermatologist  i was looking for some upf spf protection undershirts to use with golf shirts that don t offer the uv protection already   i was pleased by the variety of colors and protection advertised on line   they arrived and look great  unfortunately there is no documentation or tag with the shirt that says they offer uv protection   that seems a bit odd to me   i gave them a   star rating anyway   they do look and fit nicely   i may adjust after i wear the a few times and see how they hold up   after a few washing you might find them a bit shrunk  i would suggest getting one size larger   it worked out better for me on my seconf batch      
57,5.0 ,                       the shirts got here one day early i was very happy got even more excited when the shirts fit perfectly  i love them keeps me cooler thank you so muchnoel      
58,5.0 ,                       great shirt  lite and airy  perfect fit       recommend buying  fit true size colors are great  washed well no shrinking  well worth the money     
59,3.0 ,                       good for the price    but i ordered xl and received a mixed lot of xl and xxl  i ordered them with the shorts and all the shorts came in the correct size  the quality is good for the price but i have not washed them yet      
60,5.0 ,                       the material is unbelievable  you hardly feel like you are wearing anything    it is warm but yet is it cool so when i m wearing one it feels just right  i just can t over emphasize the comfortable feeling        
61,2.0 ,                       shirts run small  not true to size  x  large   large   quality is poorly made    shirt torn after wearing twice  what should i expect  made in china     other shirts i bought made in bangladesh    much better quality     
62,2.0 ,                       loved the feel of the material  ordered xx large same as i always order from other retailers  could not even get over head the shirts were so tight   size stated is not what you get  very disappointed  returned same day received      
63,3.0 ,                       this looked like a great deal     wicking t shirts  that look good  bought men s large  as for years  but these are closer to a medium  they are tight across the chest  and the length is just a bit shorter than i had hoped  and the neck is too high   oh  and was small  my  big   head had a tight fit squeezing through  i will keep them but they will be used as an undershirt during the winter only  in the meantime  i continue to search for great looking  great fitting athletic t shirts  at a great price      
64,4.0 ,                       i ve purchased the white  dark blue  two black  and gray shirts for my husband as a christmas gift  i literally just got them in the mail and opened them  they all came in the right size    x  the shirts seem a little too sheer  especially the white one  but these can be used as under shirts or work out shirts  i think he ll like them      
65,5.0 ,                       my grandsons are staying with is during the coronavirus   stay home  as both my daughter and son in law are first responders   the boys spend a lot of time with us all year round and we like to keep clothes for them that stay at our house   i usually order shirts for them closer to summer but i needed them now    these are fantastic shirts    our grandsons love them    they are well made and they come out of the dryer without a wrinkle      
66,3.0 ,                       i wear an american large shirt  i ordered xxl because i wanted a loose oversized shirt  these xxl shirts fit perfectly but are not oversized  their sizes run small  so i d recommend you order three sizes bigger than you need  plus  some other reviewer said that they shrink  i haven t washed them yet   so we ll see the colors are beautiful  bright and vibrant  the fabric is that very thin breathable polyester  feels silky on skin  small hole in seam on shoulder  i will just sew and not return overall  i do wish the quality were better  but i just wanted some cool temperature  comfortable  sleeping shirts      
67,1.0 ,                       im so upset  i m a  x  and for workout clothes  i didn t expect these shirts to fit skin tight  i have other workout shirts that are the same type of fabric  i wish i can get a refund      
68,2.0 ,                       i didn t want a skin tight shirt so i ordered xl s  i m      and    lbs so i battle having a larger chest and back but short torso  the overall fit is good but the neck opening is  x too big  they almost allow tops my shoulders to be seen through the neck opening that s how large the opening is  probably be sending these back soon as obviously they won t shrink      
69,5.0 ,                       pro tip  if you re getting these to workout in  get them true to size as in your other workout shirts   they are snug without feeling uncomfortable   i got these for lounge shirts so i ordered a size up or two   they feel great for leisure wear too so long as you size up      
70,5.0 ,                       fabric is fantastic  only negative was the waist fitting  more snug to my waist than my comfort but i am currently in the process of weight loss      
71,3.0 ,                       as per other buyers comments  this is a small fit  so go up one size from your usual fit it s a cheap imported chinese product  so don t expect top quality   you ll find things like loose threads and long untrimmed stitching  these can be cut off overall  not bad at    a shirt      
72,1.0 ,                       husband complains that they are to tight around the neck  they are very thin material  not see through  my husband only uses them for work ordered a  xl     
73,1.0 ,                       shirts are well fitting and comfortable  however the stitching is poor  sleeve stitching was already coming apart about   inches very disappointed      
74,1.0 ,                       these are like under shirts  very thin  the white  one looked like i was in a wet t shirt contest  way to tight and fairly see through  chart says xl fits    to    inch waist  i almost got a large   i m a    waist and xl usually fits me slightly loose   this fit me like i was gonna race a bicycle     
75,2.0 ,                       out of   shirts in this order  only   were the right size  even though the tags all say they are medium   too bad  as i really liked the feel and the color options      
76,3.0 ,                       five shirts for     is a pretty good deal but you get what you pay for in this case  the sewing in the shirts is subpar  the shirts feel nice to wear and look good but don t expect them to last long  i d air dry and not machine dry too     
77,3.0 ,                       these are sized very inconsistently  out of a set of five  only three fit correctly  the other two were too tight  we purchased the large and then returned it for the xl  we had the same sizing inconsistencies with both sets  decent shirt for the price but they don t all fit      
78,2.0 ,                       i like how these shirts fit and feel with the exception that   of the shirts is sewn wrong  my favorite color  the light blue shirt does not fit correctly around the neck and shoulder area  is pulled to one side and i did not notice it when i first wore it  i put it on to exercise  never looked in the mirror and after it promptly went into the laundry  i didn t realize there was an issue until i put it on again weeks later and just couldn t get it to adjust like the others did  finally taking it off to examine and found the problem  too bad i didn t notice right away  quality control missed this one  it can be worn  but really looks dorky      
79,5.0 ,                       fits nice to my body not to tight and not too lose and i wear them for everything nice looking      
80,3.0 ,                       might work for someone who likes thing form fitting    x would suggest the buyer doesn t like form fitting   so  i am returning      
81,5.0 ,                       my husband has very broad shoulders and a very thin waist line so he needs  x shirts with a    waist and can t stand shirts that choke him or hug him too tightly  these fit just as expected  nice quality  material is soft and doesn t cause sweating      
82,1.0 ,                       i bought this product in an xxl and it would fit my    year old boy  if you order these and you plan on wearing them and you are a normal size man  you had better order a  xl if they have it  i think they re made specifically for a little people      
83,4.0 ,                       i had originally ordered xl because that is the size my husband normally wears in this type of shirt   when he tried them on they were tight and i had to exchange them for the xxl which is a perfect fit   he says they are very comfortable and they wash and dry nicely  would order again      
84,3.0 ,                       the picture does not accurately represent the colors you will receive in set    there is no light blue shirt in this pack   it is a medium blue  the red is a maroon  the medium blue pictured is a navy  otherwise seem to be decent shirts      
85,2.0 ,                       i thought these would be like the sport atire from say old navy  but the material these are made of are super thin and the same size in this product is a bit small compared to  say  old navy product   over all i guess if this is what your looking for  but it wasn t for me  and the fit was too small      
86,5.0 ,                       use for my employees my employees are very happy with the shirts when they swear they dry out very quickly were in florida  it gets hot you get sweaty this helps keep you a little cooler     
87,2.0 ,                         shirt has a black stain on it as if it was run over or stepped on    other shirts  necks were loose and frumpy  the last   shirts were fantastic  i was sorry i had to return the last    but yea          
88,4.0 ,                         out of the   shirts was a size smaller  it says  xl but fit like an xl the other   were okay  just a little bit tighter compared to a regular t shirt  material is super thin  almost see through but it dries real quick  i especially liked the collars  they remain tight  haven t stretch yet      
89,1.0 ,                       pedi   camisetas midium size  cuando las recibo  resulta que enviaron una xl  ahora tengo una camiseta que no ped  y no puedo devolverla      
90,3.0 ,                       all of my shirts  workout  sports  pullover  are a size l  using the size chart on the web page   l was selected  tried on one shirt  felt like a compression shirt only tighter  bag size said l  shirt said l  shirts were returned  a fluke   who knows      
91,5.0 ,                       just a little smaller than i expected   but i m going from  x to medium so i may have been expecting a little much   they are listed as athletic  they fit my grandson perfectly so all is good      
92,5.0 ,                       i am taken aback by the high quality to low cost ratio here  the shirts are perfectly stretchy and comfortable  additionally  great customer service from this seller  i originally ordered size small but then decided i wanted a medium  they are true to size  but i just wanted a bigger fit   i was able to exchange it no problem      
93,3.0 ,                       i wear a large to extra large in everything i own   i even listened to the recommendation and went with  xl  was still not even close  i would need a  xl to have a comfortable fit all the way around   material however seems of good quality      
94,1.0 ,                       shirts are very poorly tailored  ive tried on two of them so far  on one of them the width of the collar is very with about           difference from one spot to another  the other one was seemed way too tight in one of the shoulders  so it puffs up very high  i wouldn t recommend buying these shirts unless you want people to think you are making your own clothes     
95,2.0 ,                       these shirts are very cheap  uncut stitching threads several inches long on every shirt at almost every seam  the material is as thin as it xn be without being transparent  and is very delicate  not suitable for athletic use  these will be trashed after just a few uses  one of the shirts in the pack already had a hole ripped in the chest when i received them  and it was thrown into the trash it s a shame the quality is so poor  because these are attractive shirts otherwise  i will not be buying another pack      
96,2.0 ,                       i love the colors of the shirts  i was disappointed with both the guality and thickness of the material as well as the tightness of the shirts  i went by the size chart when ordering but the shirts did not fit and were too small      
97,5.0 ,                       i logged into amazon to buy a name brand dri fit workout shirt   one shirt cost              then i saw the amazon shirts    pack for           so  i got   shirts for    each   they fit great   get these shirts       
98,3.0 ,                       i ordered a  xl for my husband  and these shirts were extremely  uncomfortably tight  i would say they were two sizes too small  particularly for a big tall kind of guy      
99,4.0 ,                       shirt product is good only issue is the collar area is a bit big so it s not to clean looking to the neck its wider then i would want     
100,5.0 ,                       nice shirts but measure yourself and check their shirt size chart  because i m in between medium and large and had to get an xl which fits a little loose and is maybe an inch long  but overall i like the shirts      
101,3.0 ,                       the wrong size and color set was sent to me  but i don t have time to return it and i am only using them for the gym so i don t care how they look  they feel nice on the skin and keep you cool during the gym      
102,3.0 ,                       the shirts looked great in the bag when they arrived  but in the end we sent them back pros  true to color appearancecons  ran small  order a size larger   thin material  think undershirt not tshirt      
103,5.0 ,                       i thought these dri fit shirts were an excellent buy  they are made with very high quality material and stitching and the price was unbelievable will definitely recommend and buy more     
104,1.0 ,                       very poor quality seams and hemlines  some of the shirts were delivered with the waist hem already torn and frayed while others had really long loose threads and uncut threads hanging off in addition  the printed tag washes off on the first wash great fit  good material  but terrible construction  would never buy again      
105,5.0 ,                       the shirts were labeled  x but that was not accurate  they fit the size of a large     
106,4.0 ,                       these tops provide extra motivation as they fit at least one full american size smaller than anticipated  i went from expecting something a little loose to getting something that motivates me to drop ten pounds asap  the quality is basic and acceptable on one of the five shirts i ve inspected so far      
107,2.0 ,                       these shirts are a touch too small and they smell like gasoline   one wash and the smell is largely gone  but still there   also  made in china   won t ever order again      
108,1.0 ,                       i ve worn xl shirts for over    years  i have never had anything run this small in xl  make sure to read fine print on free returns too  you are responsible if an item does not fit unless you are a member of an additional subscription service outside with amazon  guess this is what happens when you try to save a few bucks on apparel  maybe my kids can wear them      
109,4.0 ,                       while definitely not the nicest workout shirts you can find  they more than do the job   i received some for christmas last year and they have been worked out in for   months with no issues   that being said  there are some issues with the quality with the cut  mostly with the arm holes  i have one where the arm holes are different sizes on each arm and some where the arm holes are way too small   overall  these are great workout shirts as long as long as you don t want a fancy name brand      
110,1.0 ,                       first order of   men s large shirts were all much too small  ordered another set  different style  all   shirts in xl fit completely differently  one was really tight  one was really big  another had a very tight neck hole and another had a baggy neck  only   in all    shirts fit  contacted customer service about returns but they state i have to pay for the shipping  not even worth my time to mess with going to the post office      
111,2.0 ,                       i have shirts similar to this that are the same size   these  x shirts were much tighter than any other brand i have   if one is buying these shirts i d advise buying at least one size larger if not two   while these type shirts are meant to be snug  these are almost constricting      
112,3.0 ,                       this product marks all of the boxes except one  i purchased  x shirts and there is no way that s the correct sizing  based on my estimation  their idea of a  x is equivalent to  a large at best  i will wear them underneath another shirt just for appearance sakes      
113,4.0 ,                       the shirts are inexpensive and you should expect quality on line with that  if you want a dri fit shirt you can wear to dinner  buy one that cost more than     mine made it through the wash ok  the red one i received is more of a  shallow  v neck rather than a crew neck      
114,4.0 ,                       shirts have shrunk just a bit in the wash   they re starting to get a little snug   typically i wear a large and had to order a x large      
115,1.0 ,                       ordered an xl for my husband who usually wears xl or xxl depending on cut  the shirt was too small in the body  oh  well  should have ordered and xxl   but  oh my goodness  the neck was really  really small  based on what i was seeing  the xxl would not have solved that problem  honestly  it was almost as if a child s xl neck had been cut on that men s xl shirt  we returned it      
116,3.0 ,                       my chest is between    to    inches  so according to the size chart  i bought xl the material is good and i really like the shirts  but they were just too tight on my chest and back i wished that they were fitting  but unfortunate   i will try it xxl update   few days later on they did not have xxl on the same   color shirts  but since i liked the material so much  i decided to order just all white color  xxl but when i got them  it was now too big   it seems like there are two or   size difference between xl and xxl the sizing is not really correct on these shirts   i am not so certain whether to buy another xl or xxl because i really hate returning them the factory should get the size thing right      
117,1.0 ,                       for a           lb guy i figured xl would be way too big  which is what i wanted  something a little baggier so i could move around and would stay tucked in to my work jeans  these fit like a medium on a skinny high school kid  size is nowhere close to how they should fit i do like the material tho     
118,1.0 ,                       el cuello demasiado angosto  entr  exageradamente forzado      
119,4.0 ,                       for the price it was good  however the fabric is very thin  but overall nice quality and feels comfortable      
120,4.0 ,                         of the   shirts are as good as expected  if all   had been like that  it would have gotten   stars  the  th  blue one  had some burring in the chest as if something sticky had been placed on it and then peeled off      
121,1.0 ,                       doesn t keep me dry at all unless it s only for the summer but it stays cold not happy in the colder months     
122,1.0 ,                       so i bought these shirts in xxl and when they came the first one  navy blue  i tried on was perfect  after i wore and washed it  the threads started to come apart  now that shirt is useless the second one i tried on  dark green  was all kinds of weird fitting  it felt a full size smaller than navy shirt and the left side was considerably shorter than the right  i couldn t even wear it  it just felt so uncomfortable  not the sleeves  it was the actual length of the shirt that was different on each side  so messed up i guess you get what you pay for  not going to order this again      
123,1.0 ,                       unfortunately these shirts suck for multiple reasons  the colors are awesome  price is great  but i wouldn t buy these again    the collar is huge  everytime you wear these shirts you ll be reminded that you can fit both of your fists between your collar and neck  pretty disappointing  seriously its that huge  whenever i put one on i fear i look like a slob    several issues with stitching brand new  i ve noticed several of the shirts stitch lines are not even  are wavy  are just look terrible    printed logo inside the back of the collar is printed horribly  not that anyone sees this but really shows the quality control on these  one logo would be printed straight  another crooked at a    degree angle  and another missing parts of the print      
124,5.0 ,                       i purchased these shirts to stay cool while at work  i m in construction and they do keep me cool  if i sweat the shirts don t stay wet and uncomfortable  they dry off almost instantly and remain comfortable  my only complaint is that the neck size is a lite too tight  i m a     neck and i have a big chest so i got the xxl size  i think i ll try the xxxl if it s available  definitely recommend these shirts  especially for the price  another note  don t let your cat with sharp nails sit on you while wearing these shirts  anything sharp  cat nails  metal studs  etc   will make a run in  or rip  the fabric     
125,3.0 ,                       the fabric is excellent  the     spandex is  a  real plus the shirts are slightly undersized  but that s ok the biggest problem i have is with the   finishing   there are loose threads and sloppy sewing on virtually every garment  when i tried to remove the excess thread from one shirt  i ended up cutting a hole in the shoulder  and had to discard the shirt i think that to carry the name amazon essentials  the quality control should be better      
126,4.0 ,                       i just received them  they are a great value  ok fit and ok quality they fit well  however i would have like just a tad more length  i m a big guy and sometimes these ride up so i like to tuck them in  at this length  it doesn t always stay tucked others have noted poor quality  i ve only seen a few stray strings  that is  they are well sown but the finishing step of snipping or tucking away things was not done  most likely they will last  perhaps they may still fray  fall apart  i will update in summary these shirts are ok      
127,5.0 ,                       great value and great quality runs a drop big so heads up  i usually order medium   but ordered small after seeing other reviews and fits perfectly   can t beat the price   i highly recommend if running   paddleball   etc      
128,1.0 ,                       terrible shirts  do not buy them i ordered for my bf knowing hes a large and they barley go down over his jeans   they are small and i should ve listened to the reviews   not sure if i will send back or not  dont buy it s always better to go clothes shopping in person       
129,5.0 ,                       this was a gift for my son in  law   he is a tall and big man   he absolutely loved these t s  he told me they are so soft  loved the color choice and comfortable   the best t shirt he has had in quite a long time   i will probably buy him the all white the next time   he loved every color  but also loved the light grey with a stripe on the side   i will continue to buy for him from this site   he is so happy he finally found something that fits him   so it made me his    mother in law   thank you for making special size clothing jan b     
130,3.0 ,                       the tees are good  no issue there  but i ordered a large  the tag says large  but the fit was actually a medium  i thought about keeping them  they were snug  not extremely tight  but i decided to return them  i didn t reorder x large  who know if they would be larger than xl  i don t know  at any rate  the large is actually medium      
131,3.0 ,                       love the cloth   however  this time there was a hole in one of the shirts in the arm   this is the  nd order for me with this item   not sure if quality control is very good      
132,5.0 ,                       as a weight lifter i was worried the size would be too baggy but it fit extremely well around every part of my body  complimenting my attributes     
133,1.0 ,                       i tried on the first shirt and my first thought was   wow  the chemical smell is sooooooo strong    the fit was much tighter than similar shirt of the same size   i put the smelly shirt back in the bag and immediately started the return process      
134,4.0 ,                       these were a little thinner material than other  dry fit t shirts i have purchased  and they run a little smaller than other t shirts i have purchased  but the fit and finish is good and the weight is good  as far as the weight  they are more like regular t shirts you would wear under a dress shirt  but that isn t a bad thing   i haven t owned them long enough to give my opinion on how they launder  etc  but so far so good      
135,1.0 ,                       the shirts are comfortable to wear but nearly all of them has ripped at the seems and now i have holes in several places on each shirt  i would recommend paying a little more for a higher quality      
136,2.0 ,                       i ordered   medium shirts and somehow i of them was a large  out of the   right sized shirts   of them had a super tight collar  i could barely fit the mf over my head  and the   other ones with good collars felt like the tag was printed on the wromg side  it felt like im wearing the shirt backwards  no worth it  i couldve went to burlington or marahals and spent the same price maybe a little more for wayyyy better quality  l will not ask for a refund  or try to return  im not wasting money and time to do all of that  really wish all these shirts fit right tho because they feel good and look good but you guys have to make sure are good before they go      
137,2.0 ,                       i returned these  after trying them on   the fit is great    except for the collar size which is enormous   it looked and felt ridiculous      
138,1.0 ,                       funny moment when hubby tried these on  ordered in his normal size    the just clung to him   everywhere also  when he was folding that walked passed a window   i could see light thru the shirt even though it was being held up doubled up material at the time we will not buy these again   can not recommend them      
139,3.0 ,                       nice looking shirts but run really small  i bought  xl for my son who is     lbs   they don t come close to fitting him  i m wearing them they fit like my large t shirts   i guess to fit him it would have to be a  xl      
140,1.0 ,                       two of the five have a large tag and fit like a small  fat man in a little shirt  i explained to them that these are for a vacation and i do not have time to return  and that i would have to give them to the wife and they did not offer to send two replacements      
141,2.0 ,                       runs extremely small needs to say that in description   deceiving photos too shirts are not of great quality   won t buy again       
142,1.0 ,                       ordered size  x for large son  they are marked  x but equivalent to a large  way too small     
143,5.0 ,                       i like to run a lot  so i bought some extra shirts  they re comfortable  but they are a bit thin and the neck is unusually wide  open    i guess if the wider neck hole makes them much easier to put on and allow them to breathe a bit more      
144,1.0 ,                       the material these shirts are made with is garbage don t waste your money  i asked for  x and the shirts were a  x in size even though they were marked  x  please don t waste your money     
145,3.0 ,                       the t shirts are the size but the quality is not very good  hey re a little thin     
146,5.0 ,                       i bought these shirts for my boyfriend for christmas  he liked them a lot  they re very similar to the nike shirts he wears to the gym except they re a million times cheaper  they did fit a little loose on him but we put them in the dryer so we re hoping they shrink just a little  i wouldn t recommend going down in size  he just likes to show off the guns lol other than that  the quality and material is nice and soft      
147,3.0 ,                       i like the colors  of the package of   shirts  three are tight in the chest and arms  the length was a little short  i normally wear a large shirt  after reading the reviews  about them being a little small  i planned to get extra large  i realized a few days into the order  i ordered a large but they were already on the way  i think the extra large would have fit perfectly      
148,3.0 ,                       fit is great  but one of the shirts had a split at the shoulder seam so their quality control is not the best      
149,1.0 ,                       great fabric  bought size small men for my son he s    and around   feet  inches  the neck of the shirt do not fit well  it looks like is stretch out  way too low in the front part almost like a vneck  he liked the fabric but will not wear it to go outside  just for sleeping      
150,4.0 ,                       great shirts for the money  just be sure to order two sizes larger than what you normally buy  runs rediculously small      
151,5.0 ,                       great shirt  if you are a little on the heavy side and wear a medium  i would recommend a large  this is still a great product for the price      
152,2.0 ,                       a medium is more like a large or xl depending on the color in the pack  also on amazon the colors look like a fuzzy old tv  which i wanted  in person they have dark stripes or lines instead of a spotty or  fuzzy tv  look  these are useless to me and i dont have time to return them and get what i need for my budgeted trip in   days      
153,1.0 ,                       i bought these shirts intending to wear them to the gym to work out  i am a big guy so i ordered my normal size  xxl  these shirts  however were way too small  the company does not offer any larger size  so that ends my dealing with this company i am learning the hard way that dry fit moisture wicking active athletic performance is a catch phrase for polyester material      
154,5.0 ,                       i bought these for dad s day   he says they are a little tight at the neck  but a little tug to stretch it fixes that   the value is excellent too   i would recommend this product      
155,4.0 ,                       this was a gift for my son who normally wears  x  he liked the feel of the shirt but the size ran small  he tried all of them but all were small so my husband who normally wears lg x lg tried them   decided to keep them     
156,2.0 ,                       shirt colors not at all like picture   the non black color block has so much black woven in it that you almost need a magnifying glass to see any other color   did not even give to husband to try on      
157,5.0 ,                       bought as a gift for my dad  he usually wears an clean i bought a  xl and it fits good     
158,5.0 ,                       these are great  the fabric is soft right out of the package without being too sheer  the fits are uniform and the colors are all great  super good deal for summer      
159,5.0 ,                       i ll be honest  i woke up and found that after    months of quarantine  a number of my go to lounging light work shirts were a little more snug than i d prefer i needed to build up a nice stock of lightweight workout shirts  but didn t want to spend     per shirt and took a gamble on these first off  yes  the material is pretty thin  you can pull it over your head and still see through pretty well   it is also pretty soft  has a nice  flattering design  and has similar stretch feel to some other lightweight moisture wicking shirts  so it s a bit of a tradeoff  but if you get over the psychological hurdle of  shirt thin  shirt cheap  then you ll probably enjoy this set  who needs a heavier workout shirt when you re cleaning the car or jogging  anyway these are definitely the kind of shirts you beat up by tossing them in a gym bag or wearing them when washing a car  but that s kind of what i was looking for anyway      
160,2.0 ,                       out of   shirts   fits ok    are to small  also each color is different material similar but in a way different didnt like product      
161,5.0 ,                       i bought these for for my lanky almost    year old boy  we both loved everything about the shirts and they fit tremendously well  smooth fabric and extremely breathable      
162,2.0 ,                       these shirts do fit as expected  however  the stitching of the shirts was poorly done   on three of the   shirts the necklines are all wonky  see picture  and l wasn t able to fix them with an iron   there were several long tails of threads caught under the stitching  making for wonky seams   i was able to fix the majority of them myself   however  on brand new shirts  l shouldn t have had to      
163,1.0 ,                       the shirts arrived and looked like i expected  the also seemed to be the size i expected as well   what i didn t expect was that they would reek of chemical fumes   it literally smelled like they had been dipped in gasoline   i tried washing them but smell remained  if anything  getting them wet made the smell worse   i guess i shouldn t be surprised       for   shirts   you can expect to get what you pay for   amazon made returning the shirts very easy      
164,4.0 ,                       they re good  i ve had mine for a good while now  about a year  and i ve noticed the stitching falling off  but the shirt is still holding  i m not sure if it s extra slack or one day my shirt if going to fall apart  the neck hole is real snug over the collar bones that s great  it s a good length  top down but sometimes i feel a gentle breeze when stretch my hamstrings  i ve used them heavily for gym sessions and wash after wash they keep their color      
165,1.0 ,                         of the   shirts had gray ink on the back   it appears that the machine that printed the tag on the inside of the shirt was dirty and the ink rubbed off on the shirts   since it was only   of   i cant justify sending them back   these were not  st quality   seconds at best   dissatisfied      
166,2.0 ,                       the shirts fit as expected and were good material for exercising  but the neck is very tight and doesnt look right  slightly disappointed by that aspect  the rest was exactly what i expected for the price      
167,2.0 ,                       i first bought  x because reviews said these run small  the  x was way too small for me and i am      and    lbs  i then bought  x and they fit although still just a bit snug but the correct length  these are the smallest shirts i ve ever seen  most  x shirts would make a good size tent for me and   or my friends  not sure how or why they would size them this way      
168,5.0 ,                       these shirts did come as shown   i ordered the five pack dark solid short sleeve shirts with the patches of color under the armpit and down the sides  they all have been worn and washed at least four times now and there are zero stains and zero color fading  very good for men who sweat and want relief quickly  worth the money for a five pack  matching shorts may be next      
169,5.0 ,                       these shirts are well constructed they fit better then the shirts i ve had in the past  if you decide to buy this shirt you will not go wrong i guarantee it     
170,2.0 ,                       these shirts are unbelievably shiny  not in the typical way some athletic shirts can be  i mean dazzlingly  blindingly  shiny  the kind of shiny that could be in a seinfeld episode  or in saturday night fever  everyone will notice one thing about you if you wear these  your shirt is really  really shiny  if they can only see the collar of this shirt because you wear them as undershirts  they ll notice your undershirt is really really shiny      
171,3.0 ,                       i like the material for its breathability  my work tends to get hot and bothersome  with these shirts i don t have to worry about heat due to their make up  what i don t like is that they fit a bit snug  i based my size on similar shirts that i bought on amazon  but it seems the size chart for these shirts were different from the previous shirts i bought      
172,4.0 ,                       these were a lot of workout shirts for the money  i ve used a couple of them a couple times  and they seem good quality for the money  my only negative is that the neck is a little high  i wanted the for to be a little snug  and the xl is just that  i typically wear xl  so these are great      
173,3.0 ,                       the price of the shirts is good so there is much to be expected  three issues that i find is that the material is not stretchy whatsoever  the neck is too tight  the waist of the shirt is too big  the product when received doesn t really look like the images above  i would say buy it at your own discretion      
174,3.0 ,                       i wear shirts that are xl and xxl and purchased these in xxl and they are smaller than any xl that i own  usually i buy xxl in t shirts to be a little big and these were skin tight  quality of the shirt was fine but not the fit      
175,5.0 ,                       i bought these shirts for my husband and grandson for christmas  the xl fit my husband good  but my grandson needed xxl  so far they seem to like them  usually my husband wears a l  he is about       and     lbs  he doesn t want his shirts to fit tight  so i got him the xl      
176,2.0 ,                       alright  so i bought these thinking  the bad reviews couldn t be that correct      i was wrong  i understand that you re essentially paying    shirt  but these are some poorly made shirts  i m         lbs and bought the xl to be safe  which was the right choice  because of some reviews  each color fit incredibly different   and awkwardly  some were way too small  bordering on a medium  and some were huge  they are all very shiny  so if you re into that  golf shirt  sheen  you ll like these  one of the shirts came with a stain on it  so that was pretty cool  that being said  i wore them while in bangkok  and they did a decent job keeping me cool  i sent them all to the second hand store as soon as i got home  save your money  buy something else      
177,4.0 ,                       an xl runs a bit small but still fit  i ordered big hoping it would be a little big on me and instead it was just right little snug great quality though      
178,3.0 ,                       i like the quality of the shirt  my only qualm is with the stitching for the neck area  the shirt droops at the back of my neck and is up higher in the front  it feels like i have the shirt on backwards  i don t  i checked  although i like it for the most part  i wouldn t buy more of these because of that      
179,1.0 ,                       hi  i like the product and the quality but  i am a little concerned as i bougth it as  sun upf     protection  fabric  and no where on the t shirt i found a  printed confirmation of that not even a  carton tag  so my doubt  is this  what i needed and payed for i put one star because of what i describe above  if you are looking for a good t shirt is a good product     
180,4.0 ,                       nice shirts for the price   i ordered these for my husband   he has a little bit of a belly and generally wears a large to xtra large   i ordered the xtra large   they did not fit him well so gave them to my son who usually wears a med to large and they fit him perfectly   nice quality for the price  just wish they would have fit a little better   i would recommend going a size up      
181,5.0 ,                       bought this for both general wear and workouts   gotta say  it feels amazing   very lightweight and breathable   it almost feels as if i m not wearing anything or thin silk  fabric is on point for the size  i m a medium to large and after reading reviews i went for the large and it fits to about a medium  so a size larger should do it for most folks   the wear and tear is yet to be seen and even though i feel like these will only last about     months its well worth the buy   will absolutely be buying more      
182,1.0 ,                       the size and cut of these shirts are all over the place   each one fit differently even though they were all marked as large   out of the five shirts one was pretty good and one was good   the other three i threw away   one was a medium even though it said large   one had a stretched out neck and an odd sleeve cut   the other was somewhere between a medium and a large which made it too small for me   there wasn t a single shirt that was the same size as another shirt      
183,5.0 ,                       these shirts are very comfortable  i wear them around the house  sometimes i even sleep in them  the chemical small that others mentioned does go away even before they are washed  good purchase      
184,4.0 ,                       good value  but the material is a little rigid  making it a little uncomfortable in the gym   works fine  but not as comfortable as other workout shirts      
185,2.0 ,                       i have a     chest  the extra large is way too big  i was swimming in it  it looked like i was wearing my father s shirt      
186,4.0 ,                       i realized that at    a shirt i would not be getting the same quality as the     shirt i recently bought   considering that i am still very pleased with the quality and fit of the shirts   i was a little disappointed to find that one of the shirts fit much snugger that the others   the shirts are well made and with good fabric  so i think they are a good value for the money      
187,3.0 ,                       shirts are fine so far  i bought them for my son but when i received them it was the worst chemical smell  i imagine lithe smell will come out in a couple washes but it was overpowering      
188,3.0 ,                       i had to return the xl because it was too small even though my husband wears xl in all other brands  so i ordered size xxl but one shirt was labeled xl  also one shirt looked like it had been worn  the label was coming off and the collar looked stretched      
189,4.0 ,                       i bought these for my husband because he just goes through these so quickly between the gym and basketball games   he actually really likes that they are so thin  but they may be a concern to others   overall i would buy again   they d held up well and he has no complains      
190,4.0 ,                       if you like a cling fit  very stretchy very lightweight then this shirt my be for you  it is not what i was looking for except being inexpensive  the neck fit is good  by the time you gt to the chest  i would say you will need at least   sizes larger than you regularly wear  this is called a  men s dry fit moisture wicking active athletic performance crew t shirt  and that is what it is  it seems to actually fit the description but i was looking for a casual loose fitting garment  just remember to buy   sizes big if you want a normal fit  the stretch to the fabric is relaxed and the shirt is not too tight but it is form fitting      
191,5.0 ,                       bought these for my grandson who takes a large for every shirt he wears   ordered a large and they were too small  sent them back and ordered an extra large   he says they fit ok     
192,4.0 ,                       proswicks sweat  good for biking which is why i bought them for  good all year round consmore expensive than cotton  i remember when cotton was much more expensive than polyester  now that more people are biking or running  polyester is more in demand and now more expensive   shirts came defective in first package  i processed to return them and ordered a  nd set right away    shirts came defective in  nd set  so i kept   and shipped back    i ordered a  rd set which came wo defect      
193,4.0 ,                       when a person orders size xxl  the presumption should be that they are big  i love the cloth  but the shirts are pretty tight  form fitting       
194,1.0 ,                       my husband bought two packs of these shirts and had to send both of them back   the size was no where near the size he wears  they were way too small      
195,5.0 ,                       excellent wear  style and fit for fast growing hard working teen boys      
196,2.0 ,                       i liked the feel of this shirt but the crew neck was too tight and uncomfortable  so i returned the five of them  too bad  because otherwise they seemed just fine  and a bargain as well      
197,3.0 ,                       for a size large the shirts run small  shirt length is a bit short and it is right across chest and waist  material is comfortable and stretches nicely but if you are a large order and extra large      
198,1.0 ,                       i absolutely hate shirts with stretched out collars   my neck is not big  i am rather skinny   so i like my collars to be a bit more narrow    this goes down to my collar bone and looks like a bed shirt  id return these if i thought it was worth the time  ill just wear em and move on  i dont recommenced  these for anyone that also doesnt like stretched out collars    because this is bad     
199,1.0 ,                       i couldn t be more disappointed with these shirts  the shirts came in poor condition as they had loose threads all over them  in addition  they were by far the smallest large shirts i have ever seen  and to top it off this company sent me the incorrect colors  neon colors rather than the colors i ordered  i d highly recommend looking elsewhere for your workout clothes      
200,2.0 ,                       the shirts are a bit tight around the neck  and the fabric is not uniformly connected at the seams  some parts are looser than others  if that makes sense   one of the shirts has extra fabric on the shoulder so it looks like i m wearing shoulder pads they actually feel like you are wearing them slightly backwards the entire time  but if you flip them around  then they really pull at your neck  all around  not a comfortable or uniform fit      
201,1.0 ,                       shirts are very poorly made  just doesnt have a good fit and will not last at all  i wear xl comfortably in most athletic shirts but this is uncomfy and tight  i ordered xxl and still bad  im             
202,4.0 ,                       ok shirt for workouts  they fit slightly tight in the chest  for a bigger guy   x  probably should go up a size      
203,1.0 ,                       lots of missing and frayed stitching  look like they will fall apart after a few washes  material is soft and what you expect with     spandex      
204,2.0 ,                       my husband has been trimming up and now wears an xl   i ordered him the xxl to give him the little extra room he likes when exercising   well  the xxl was too tight in the chest   and the collar and arm holes were also a bit small   turns out it fits me perfectly and i normally wear a women s xxl   it even tapers at the waist the way women s shirts do   the collar and arms also fit me perfectly   the fabric is soft  lightweight  and has a decent stretch  i now have some nice shirts and he s looking for ones that actually fit a man s body   i would suggest ordering up a size or two   if you are lean lanky these shirts will fit well   but if you have any bulk at all  expect it to hug and fit tightly in those areas      
205,3.0 ,                       honestly  these are good shirts and a great value  just know that if you are an l   then go xl  if you are xl go xxl  etc   i purchased the xl size based upon the measurements provided  tried them on when they arrived and while they seem slightly snug  i didn t think about returning them  then  i washed them and dried them and while i know i didn t over dry and heat them   the did shrink to a point that i can t really wear them now however  if you just order a size larger than you really need you should be set      
206,3.0 ,                       these shirts are not great  they fit way too small  i normally wear a large and when i got mine they fit like a small my uncle ordered this in  xl and when he got his they fit like a large  so basically buy two sizes bigger than you normally would the quality is so so  won t be buying these again      
207,4.0 ,                       i was skeptical about these at first  because of the lower price as opposed to some of the more expensive brands  i honestly debated trying them  i have to say that i am very happy with what i received at this price point   it was well worth the investment to give them a try and i couldn t be happier about the fit  very comfortable  time will tell their ability to withstand daily wear and washing  but am a fan at this point      
208,5.0 ,                       these shirts ended up being a bit too big  got then for someone else so i knew that was a possibility  but the seller was quick to help us with the return and refund  they went above and beyond to communicate with us during the return process  the quality was great  no complaints at all  i just had to order a different size     
209,3.0 ,                       the shirt is of good quality but the size large i compared to the amazon essentials i much to tight   this is perhaps a chinese large          
210,5.0 ,                       these shirts were very high quality and durable  they have been laundered and have held up for several wearings by my son that does landscaping for a living      
211,1.0 ,                       the first shirt i took out of the package    the  tagless imprint  was peeling and looked like it had been placed incorrectly the first time  and they hit it with the heat transfer a  nd time my husband wears a small typically  i ordered medium   these looked more like they were a boy s medium than a man s medium   they were smaller than my husband s small shirts sorry  they are being returned for a more mainstream brand that is more true to size      
212,4.0 ,                       too tight across chest causing the material to pull at armpits  pulling sleeves up and tighter on biceps  leaving ring mark   suggest larger size  s   not available for me  i wear a   x in the same type under armor  these were   x      
213,3.0 ,                       i normally where a size xl but for these shirts i ordered  a xxl ant they fit like a xlfit good just order one sice bigger     
214,3.0 ,                       for the price can t really beat what you get for   shirts  all the shirts pretty much fit differently although they are great colors and are comfortable  three out of the five had string already pulling out but just cut them out so we ll see what happens when i wash them  as far as during and after exercising in them  i noticed the sweat pretty much collected and did not really breathe as well as other brands that i have worn  and have worn them after a workout while doing chores around the house they didn t dry that quickly      
215,5.0 ,                       order one size larger than the size you need   runs small i order xl for my husband and it was tight but other than that great product     
216,5.0 ,                       nice shirts and i like the colors only thing for me is the fit  little tighter than expected but not uncomfortablei would buy them again     
217,4.0 ,                       i got these for my son  ordered his usual size and they are quite tight  order atleast one size up  possibly two if you are a bigger person  but other than that they are very nice     
218,1.0 ,                       i like the shirts but it was made for a young person  i normally take an xl        chest  i ordered the  xl and i looked like i was poured into the shirt      
219,4.0 ,                       these are just fine  and if they don t last after too many washings  that s still ok  at roughly    a shirt  they fit well and look very nice  a bit too long  but can t bitch because of the price  if i were paying     each  it would be a different story  but i will be re ordering      
220,5.0 ,                       these shirts are very comfortable   they are a lot like the under armour tech workout t shirts at a way cheaper price   work great for exercising or as an undershirt      
221,2.0 ,                       shirts are very thin and the wrong size  ordered extra large shirts and shorts  the shirts are a tight large and the shorts were also tro be xl and they might be a medium  both were a waste of money and time      
222,5.0 ,                       husband loved the color selection and easy wear   hubby did mention for larger frame man that the shirts are a little thin and must wear a muscle shirt underneath but other than that very nice and good price for   shirts      
223,3.0 ,                       i wanted to purchase some tee shirts that fit comfortably   i intentionally purchased xl so it would be a lose fit   i normally wear medium to large in most shirts comfortably but i wanted something that fit loosely   this is clearly a chinese xl   it fit more like a medium large would for a standard american size   i would advise going up at least one size if not two   otherwise it seems like a good price   the shirts are very thin but would be comfortable in hot weather   to clarify   i am a size    waist         so an xl would normally hang loosely off my body   this xl was quite snug   i returned these and am debating trying to guess the correct size   either an xxl or god forbid a xxxl      
224,3.0 ,                       i bought a  x set and it was so small it fit more like a  xl barely a  xl  the shirts are great  good quality but the sizing is very small  i m buying a  x to see if that will fit my hubby  who is a  xl      
225,2.0 ,                       the shirts are very nice   i received the shirt took them out of the package and they have a bad smell so i took them washed and dried and they still had the smell   i let them hang in the closet for a couple of day and the smell remained  i washed and dried them again hung them in the closet again and to this day they still have the smell  it doesn t want to leave so i guess i m going to pack them up and return them      
226,3.0 ,                       after gaining my normal holiday weight  i needed some temporary shirts to get me through my weight loss   i do this every year   they fit my needs   however  the material is very thin and fragile   one tug on the collar and you will hear the crisp sound of threads breaking   not fashionable  but i am old and don t give a rat   if you want better quality  i would suggest spending at least a twenty note for each shirt   this was a bargain for me and again    temporary   i m cool      
227,5.0 ,                       the weather has been near freezing this week  but the shirts have kept me dry from sweat on my morning hikes   staying dry and staying warm at    degrees is important as we near winter december as of this review    the shirts have the same characteristics of my nike or under armor shirts at about a third the price   can t comment on hot weather      
228,3.0 ,                       runs small  super thin  not the same quality moisture wicking  super short length also  i can fit most brand large shirts but they re tight and too short  these even in an close were way too tight and way too short      
229,3.0 ,                       everything is fine except the content at amzon is incorrect at amazon stated    polyester   spandex but tee label is     polyester hope vendor correct it soonest     
230,4.0 ,                       i really like them they have a cool design on the shirts instead of one solid color    order a size up though cause there kinda small    good material we will see how it holds up to the test of time ill update my review if i have any problems i ordered xxl i m    they come down and kinda cover the top of my pockets     
231,1.0 ,                       when i wore the first shirt i liked it  as i went through the other shirts i was amazed how the shirt sizes varied even though they all had the same size written on them  if all the shirts were like the first one they would be great shirts      
232,1.0 ,                       absolute trash  the material is way too thin and the quality is awful  for the price they re a rip off  especially considering you can get a quality shirt  that actually repels water  and that fits from kirkland for for a dollar more      
233,5.0 ,                       these are so worth the    they stay dry  fit right  surely legit  just remember  these are workout shirts  if u just wear them around  they evaporate sweat and will snell pretty quickly due to the tech  this is quite normal      
234,5.0 ,                       i purchased these as well as the   pack of dry fit shorts   so far they are great  they fit as expected  are comfortable and have held up well to running and workouts in the gym   no fraying  fading or shrinking after being laundered   i d definitely recommend      
235,1.0 ,                       must be a design problem or they were previously used  the collars in all of them were all stretched out and ugly  i returned it      
236,5.0 ,                       i bought these for my son  he loves wearing these under sweatshirts or flannels   they fit perfect       
237,1.0 ,                       shirts sewing was pretty bad  i had to take all five to a seamstress to get the stitching fixed on all of them  shirt inner text started peeling on   of the five shirts after the first wash before i even wore them  these shirts do not breath at all so sweat drips out of the shirt instead of evaporate through  i ve had to start using them at  am when the temperature is about    f so they trap all the heat in  never buying anything from the essentials brand again  the only reason i didn t return them is because i would have had to pay for the return shipping      
238,4.0 ,                       i ordered the xl size so they would not be snug on me but they are  your sizing chart seem to be off to me  i have other types of shirts that are only a large and they are not as snug on me as your shirts are      
239,5.0 ,                       the colors were a little darker than they appear in the photos  this is only a gripe because i was trying to get lighter colors     
240,5.0 ,                       very comfortable and breathable  great material  moisture wicking and would definitely recommend buying      
241,1.0 ,                       fits way too small   i even ordered a size larger than i normally do for my son who is           
242,1.0 ,                       compre el paquete con large y vienen de todas las tallas   large  medium  xlno deja respirar el cuerpo y generan mal olor en axilas   para nada dry fit para usarlos en invierno y calentar el cuerpo si sirven pero solo puedo usar dos del paquete de   ya que tres son muy grandes      
243,4.0 ,                       highly recommend   order one size bigger than you re used to i ordered two sets   white and color   good quality  smooth  material  the xl size had to be returned however because they were short on the shoulder point  tight under the arm and around the waist  i have worn xl my entire adult life and my weight does not fluctuate more than   lbs  i reordered the  xl and it fits the way i expect  i would highly recommend these if you want the silky  microfiber material      
244,2.0 ,                       cheap material  i doubt it will last longer than a few weeks at best  spend the extra cash and get a better known brand      
245,5.0 ,                       orderd  xl they are true to size  no color fading when washed or shrinking   very comfortable   worked as expecting wicking moisture away while working out  they look good for everyday wear also      
246,3.0 ,                       these fit weird  almost like the arms are not really in the right spot   i had to check the first time thinking maybe i had the shirt on backwards  no   just the way it is they run small  very thin material  but i only intended to use them for my indoor exercise bike so they are  adequate    definitely not under armour though   they are cheap  get what you pay for  set expectations accordingly      
247,2.0 ,                       i love the shirts  medium fits very well but one thing i just can t get over is the fact that after a few weeks of wearing them  the armpit on all shirts start to rip  i m a small guy so i bought a medium and it fits incredibly well on me  not tight at all and a bit loose if anything but you wouldn t think that all of the shirts armpit area would rip so easily      
248,5.0 ,                       these run marginally on the small size   they are average workmanship  quality and materials   they are bargain brand colored t shirts      they will pack down to half the size of cotton and will wick moisture away      
249,5.0 ,                       i was surprised at the fit  they do not ride up as the day wears on  they stay just like they are very happy to stay where i put them  i find these shirts to be warm enough when the temperature drops after sundown  and also comfortable as the day warms up mid day  this was a very pleasant surprise  i love these shirts and am thinking about ordered another color set      
250,1.0 ,                       poorly sewn  neck sewn off center and bunched up on one side  as so it won t lay flat on you when you wear it  trash     
251,5.0 ,                       my man looks great in these  got them for him for our trip to hawaii to go hiking and just wear but he wears them before we went and wears them at our adult kickball league because they are so comfy     
252,3.0 ,                       shirts had a manufacturing smell to it  washed and dried the shirts as i normally do with any new clothes before wearing  purchased these for my husband  and they shrunk about two sizes down  my husband can t wear them  very unfortunate     
253,2.0 ,                       got these thinking they were a good deal      shirt  one of the shirts came already torn  failed to get a picture before i threw it away   another has now ripped after one wash  shown in the pictures  i am also usually a large in workout shirts   ft tall    lbs  and the larges were tight on me around the chest  not an issue if you like tighter shirts but i was not expecting them to be this tight on the plus side the fabric itself is comfortable when working out  running and lifting weights  and is pretty good at sweat wicking  overall i wouldn t buy again since they are falling apart so quickly came torn      
254,2.0 ,                       all of the shirts are labeled xl just like i ordered  but none of them are bigger than l and   might even be a m  this was my second order  the first order was perfect and i  love the shirts  the second order was not usable      
255,5.0 ,                       this is a great product  this shirt fits nicely to my body  it feelings like a shirt but also has some great compress shirt qualities too  its feel great and not to tight like many other active athletic performance shirts  so you get the best of tw worlds  tight muscle look but also t shirt feel      
256,3.0 ,                       these shirts run small  got xl for my husband but gave them to my son who normally wears a large  they are thin  but that s good for our hot summers      
257,3.0 ,                       my husband is well built  and most shirts look great on him this shirt has a small bottom and if your waist isn t tiny  it won t fit properly i ve tried to give them away  but once they try them on  they all decline        
258,5.0 ,                       very comfy  yes i did see a few loose strings and the neck hole is tight  but its what i was looking for   i liked this purchase ad wear it to the gym everytime i go  hasn t shredded or fallen apart in wash so its not so bad      
259,4.0 ,                       shirts look nice and feel nice   material is thin   my only issue is they are a bit small   i wear an xl to xxl   so i ordered  xl to have it loose   but even at  xl it fits tight   i recommend going up a size  especially after washing they might shrink  overall they are ok for working out   they feel silky   if it wasn t for the smaller sizing  i would give it   stars   but for the price they are fine  just go up a size or   if you want a looser fit      
260,1.0 ,                       do not buy this shirt especially if you don t want a thin flimsy material t shirt if i saw this shirt inperson in a store i would never have bought this waste of money dont buy     
261,5.0 ,                       highly recommend   great loose fitting shirts and very cool to the feel       
262,4.0 ,                       these are lightweight and comfortable   they do fit a bit tight through the chests so i ended up ordering a x large instead of my usual large   returned my original order no questions ask      
263,2.0 ,                       had to return  not due to quality but to fit   these run small so order accordingly   tightness looseness of shirt is fine or as expected   when i raised my arms the shirt comes up above my waist   i got the  x and i am not fat   i m      and     with     waist   looking for these in a tall cut      
264,5.0 ,                       needed some new workout shirts that feel great and don t cost too much   these were it exactly      
265,4.0 ,                       it might have been my mistake  but i didn t gather from the description of these shirts that they would fit as snug as they do  normally i wear a medium in standard wicking workout shirts  but these are more of an in between standard fit and compression fit  they are snug  i had to send the mediums back and get large  medium looked a little scandalous on me    other than that the shirts are value priced and produced  the material and construction are about what you should expect from something priced as low as these  i m just gonna abuse them in the gym anyway  so i ll buy more when these are no longer useful      
266,3.0 ,                       these shirts keep you cool   however they tend to lose strings   meaning using a lighter or cutting off string  im a little worried these might not last long  but they are very comfortable  also the neck seems small  it s not tight on my     neck but it is tight fitting over my head  if your very fit this shirt will make you look very cut  i like it but worry about longevity      
267,5.0 ,                       i wear these too work and sweat alot   the shirt never stick to me when i sweat and i love that   very comfortable and have bought them multiple times     
268,3.0 ,                       the fit was a little tight across the shoulders and the material was different than i expected  i do like the colors and shine of the material but  i won t buy them again      
269,4.0 ,                       bought an xxl bc that is what my husband wears  way too tight  my son whom wears a large tried them on  other than that he neck being to big the rest fit      
270,5.0 ,                       overall  i m very pleased with these shirts  i bought them to use for the gym and as undershirts  so far they are working out good  i noticed that each shirt size seems to very slightly as if perhaps they were made by different individuals  some are slightly longer than the other  however this isn t a deal breaker for me as the variation is very minor  overall  i feel like i got a great product for the price  would definitely re order      
271,5.0 ,                       my teen son needed some quick easy tees for a trip   this material doesn t wrinkle as easily as reg jersey tees and they look nicer than cotton tees   colors are great and have stood up to wear and wash      
272,4.0 ,                       slightly larger than expected in all dimensions but a nice product  i ordered a medium and i would call this medium large if  such a thing existed   had there been an xs option than i would have ordered the medium with more confidence but they only have small which probably would have been better  quality is excellent      
273,4.0 ,                       first i ll say the cons  the xl shirts i received run a bit tight on me      chest   i also received a different set of colors than what i choose  didn t want a green shirt but working out isn t a fashion show for me so no big deal   these are the reasons why i didn t   star this product however  having said all of this  i ve worked out with these shirts and they are quite comfortable  i m glad i purchased them      
274,1.0 ,                       when your one job is to sew two pieces of cloth together  machine aided  and you can t get that right poor quality  poor production  save your money and time on these shirts and look elsewhere      
275,1.0 ,                       poor quality  one of the shirts was a v neck  all were various sizes  all had multiple threads coming undone and after   wash   they still have a bad  factory mechanical  smell  you get what you pay for  definitely not nike or under armour quality  don t waste your money      
276,4.0 ,                       nice shirts in every way  but owning similar shirts of other brands  i must say these are sized small   all my other  xl shirts fit fine  but these are tight   should have ordered a size larger than i usually order      
277,5.0 ,                       great shirts  slighty slim fit but that s just i was looking for  excellent fit and finish   ordering the long sleeves for winter base layer      
278,3.0 ,                       i wear xl   this was almost too tight to wear  especially around the neck and shoulders   but it was a bargain so i will wear them      
279,5.0 ,                       items fit just as the size ordered   purchased my regular size and extremely pleased they fit without issue   highly recommend      
280,1.0 ,                       the shirts shrunk       polyester shouldnt shrink  its not a natural fiber  none of my other athletic shirts shrunk  theyre also dried on low heat and cold water  i have no idea how they changed sizes but they did      
281,5.0 ,                       very light and comfortable t shirts  this is my second time ordering shirts from this company  great value     
282,1.0 ,                       poor craftsmanship  first wash the seams came unstitched  would not waste money on these unless you have a sewing machine to redo all the seams  some came apart down the side some under the arm  all of them at the waist      
283,4.0 ,                       the shirts are very soft  and fit about as expected  the collar seems like it will sag after a few washes   we ll see  well made   great bargain  if the collar remains intact   i d buy more  check back with this review in a few weeks      
284,5.0 ,                       these shirts are a great buy and i was worried about them until they came   they all fit good and look nice on   the material doesn t wrinkle   very impressed with the product      
285,2.0 ,                       wore a couple of these shirts   to   times and they started to come apart at the seams  nice looking and comfortable shirts but the quality is terrible  i would not recommend buying these  i love the feel and fit  it s a shame they are so cheaply made      
286,5.0 ,                       oh very groovy  already packed for christmas gifts     be just as great when the next order of tee shirts come    thanks tricia        
287,5.0 ,                       especially like the idea that this will help keep us warm in the winter it s a very soft fabric and it s very comfortable it s breathable and it fits as expected     
288,5.0 ,                       have been very skeptical on all purchases lately especially when it comes to close   these shirts though really boosted my online shopping morale   very happy with the texture  length and color   they are slightly long which is actually kind of nice   much rather have long than too short and constantly pulling down   these are great shirts to wear around the house doing projects and working out   and they are nice enough to wear out and about if the covid stay at home orders ever go away   only had these shirts for   week so can t see much on wear and tear yet      
289,1.0 ,                       thanks amazon for issuing a return refund on this item item is a paper thin  shiny material with poor stitching  even at under    a shirt  this is not a good buy      
290,4.0 ,                         out of the   shirts fit just fine  they are comfortable and great for running  one of the shirts fits a little weird though  it s a little tighter around the neck and shorter at the back  it kind of feels like i m wearing it backwards but i m not  i even tried turning it around but that was about the same      
291,5.0 ,                       bought these for my husband for christmas  i can t wait for him to open them  they left so soft and i m sure he s gonna love that  will have to do an update after christmas if there are any issues      
292,5.0 ,                       i wish i could write something positive to aid the seller but i can t  the shirts are fit to size whatsoever  i wear a  x in all my workout clothes and have a lot of room to spare  i ordered these in a  x and they are horribly way too small   they fit more like an xl   since they don t have larger sizes which i m afraid to try  lol  i m not going to hassle in reboxing and mailing them back out to hope i get a refund  i m just going to give them away  waste of money    sorry     
293,3.0 ,                       i like the shirts but they are running small  my husband always wears extra large but these are to tight on him  you better order a size up      
294,2.0 ,                       returned  none of them fit right  plus the material was way too  shimmery   looked like something zoolander would wear      
295,2.0 ,                       i read a lot of reviews  and chose to take a chance  i really liked the look of these shirts  as many others have said  the colors are much different in person  it s because they used the flash to take their product pictures  i used the flash on my phone and it makes the colors pop  however  they are definitely the darker shade  they definitely run small  as well  i comfortably wear a men s size large tshirt  normally  i got the xl  and as others said  they are more like a medium  two of them do fit slightly smaller  also    out of the   have a subtle v neck collar  rather than crew neck  overall  pretty regretful of my decision on this purchase  i like the feel and style of the shirts  and i can deal with them being smaller than marked  the inconsistencies make it hard to really be very happy  i m keeping them  mainly due to laziness towards the return process      
296,1.0 ,                       these shirts are very cheaply made  as i should have guessed at this price point  but if you don t mind a weirdly fitting and easily torn first time i put one on it ripped around the neck hole  shirt then maybe these are for you      
297,3.0 ,                       if you have a little bit of a belly  i don t think these are the shirts that fit well  i know for me they are a little too tight around the belly and i bought the  x size  great shirts though  they are perfect for working out and are so light to wear compared to cotton  hey  no big belly they would be great shirts      
298,5.0 ,                       it fits well because its somewhat stretchy  its soft and very comfortable  its a light shirt   good for working out or running  very quick drying  worth the price  the colors are nice too      
299,1.0 ,                       these shirts look and feel great  but the size is horribly incorrect  i wear a large  so thats what i bought  too small so i reordered in an x large  too small  there is no difference in size between large and x large at all  gonna have to try a different brand i guess        
300,5.0 ,                       this was a gift to my son and he absolutely loved the shirts for working out and thanked me over and over again   i was happy that the material  fit  and comfort were great      
301,1.0 ,                       the order was weeks late then when i finally received it they were plain tank tops  nothing like the picture besides the fabric  different type of shirt and design and color   don t order unless you re looking to be disappointed      
302,4.0 ,                       seem like they re nice and comfortable other than they are more of a slender cut   not a  steal  but i would say that they re reasonably priced      
303,5.0 ,                       product does run slightly smaller than the under armour ones i bought years ago   i wear a  x now and while the  x fits me i would go up one size to  x just to have a little more looseness  but i am washing them with fabric softner and they should stretch a little more over time   a slight smell  but after   washes it goes away   soft and great and moisture wicking and the crew neck stay to shape      
304,1.0 ,                       look great and seem good quality until you put them on    seem to be made crooked and are impossible to get to center on the body  and what s with the huge neck hole  who are these made for  if you have a neck like the trunk of an old oak tree you may like these shirts  if you have a normal human sized neck look elsewhere      
305,5.0 ,                       i ordered size large and i received size large   the shirts fit me just as i expected them to  they were not too tight  they were comfortable to work out in but not so big that they were moving too much during the workout   i ve only worn   so far but the others look exactly the same other than the color      
306,3.0 ,                       the first pack was missing a shirt  only four   i sent them back and reordered   the second pack has all five shirts  but the light blue one is a royal blue   not as pictured   otherwise  the fabric and cut is fine   it s still a good buy   don t know yet about the wicking claims as they haven t been worn yet      
307,5.0 ,                       this purchase was a super bargain and i m extremely satisfied with this transaction  the item i received  pack of   athletic shirts  was the correct size and colors i ordered  this may seem insignificant  but i can t tell you how many times in the past i did not receive the actual item i ordered in other similar transactions from other sellers  for that reason  i wanted to go on record to let you know that what you see in the pictures is what i received  the quality in terms of look and feel  and the material stitching are substandard when compared to recognized name brands like nike  under armour  etc   however that was something to be expected  considering how ridiculously affordable the   pack is          relative to the better known alternatives  i wore two different shirts to the gym last week and was very satisfied each time with the performance from a breathability standpoint  the freedom of movement that was relatively unrestricted but still provided some support  and the overall aesthetic  the sizing for me is on point  i ordered size small and they fit snug enough so that you can see the shape and contour of my body without being too tight and creepy  be sure you do not expect the same quality material and feel from nike or adidas brand  otherwise you will be disappointed  i like the fact that these shirts i purchased are easy to mix and match with my regular gym wear because the colors are a conservative standard set which are unobtrusive and without any tags or conspicuous branding  i will basically wear them to the gym  as an athletic top when i go running  and occassionaly as a casual top  while they are still new  with jeans and sneakers      
308,5.0 ,                       these shirts fit great  the fabric looks very expensive  looks great   very comfortable  great performance out in the heat   i am really surprised at the low price that i like these shirts better than all my current cotton shirts and better than all but one  very expensive   like    times the cost of this shirt  dry fit shirt   great shirt at an incredible price  what is not to like      
309,4.0 ,                       well  after reading the reviews after i bought it i was extremely skeptical that maybe it could not even be worn   but when i received my package  yes it s not the highest quality but it definitely is good for what was paid  my boyfriend likes it  it was only to be worn as lounge wear at home anyway so   good buy  worth it for the money      
310,3.0 ,                       my son loves these shirts  unfortunately one of them had holes under the arms  not sure of it was before washing or after  by the end of the day the entire sleeve was gone  they fit good otherwise and he has room to grow still      
311,2.0 ,                       my husband normally wears and xl   when it arrived  it was very snug we sold it to a friend that it fit and reordered a  xl when it arrived  it seemed to fit almost the same as the xl we do like the material it is made from but you may want to order one if not two sizes larger than you normally wear very disappointed compared to other brands that we have purchased      
312,5.0 ,                       i wear these type wicking shirts all the time and really like these  great price and fit pretty much as expected  originally ordered the large  but as they are an athletic fit  the large was a little tight across the shoulders and through the mid section  overall  very happy with the return process and the fit of the xl      
313,5.0 ,                       these shirts are awesome  the fit is great  i did order one size up as i like a looser fit  light weight and durable  color combos are great  length of the shirt is about average  might be a little hard to keep tucked in if you like that style      
314,4.0 ,                       i bought these for work shirts  i like the way men s shirts fit because they are a little bigger without looking sloppy  overall these are great for the money  one of the shirts did not have the sleeve hemmed but it s not a huge deal for me  the quality is to be expected for the price but i would buy again      
315,2.0 ,                       the fabric is nice  but clearly smaller than regular sizing  my  xl tsla polo shirts fit perfect  but these are snug  it s not super snug from stomach to chest  but the neck is really small  one shirt felt like i had it on backwards  one i couldn t get my head through the neck opening  returning these  will try another brand      
316,5.0 ,                       i normally wear a size l in dri fit shirts  i ended up needing to get an xxl to get a tiny bit more space for my chest   arms      
317,5.0 ,                       i bought this for my husband to work  workout  casually  just about anything wear  he absolutely loves them  they re comfy  light enough to wear as an undershirt and look good enough to wear for casual or sleep wear  he s     slim soldier build     lbs  hopefully that description will help someone  i will be ordering more      
318,3.0 ,                       i won t be as harsh about these shirts as some of the reviews are but if buying these i would buy them a size larger than what i would normally purchase other than that i have no complaints about these shirts      
319,5.0 ,                       fit perfect around neck with the stretchable band   made it very comfortable to wear as my work undershirt   days a week  looks sharp  like the underarmor feel but cheaper  gotta love it     
320,4.0 ,                       some of the shirts are not the same style and you might receive one or two shirts that are actually bigger than the size you ordered for     
321,1.0 ,                       i should have read the reviews before buying   horrible  see through  cheaply made  and one shirt had ink all over it   i should have opened the package and checked them but when i got them  i wrapped them up and gave as a gift  the receiver opened them and i was mortified i gave such an awful  hideous  cheap  terrible gift  do not waste your money            awful awful awful     
322,4.0 ,                       i m a athletic slim build  not sure who designed these and for what body type  but i purchased medium and the shoulders great  but i would have to put on    more pounds on my stomach to have a snug fit like i like  bad purchase      
323,4.0 ,                       these are pretty comfortable   i m not a fan of the material but they do what they are supposed to  for the price they can t really be beat   the neck is slightly too tight but they drape nicely if that makes sense and they stayed cool and dry all through my run      
324,5.0 ,                       bought them for my grandson for a birthday present he absolutely loves the dry fit he bowls a lot and he sweats and he says the absolutely love it because it keeps them cool     
325,4.0 ,                       the material feels so comfortable and my husband loves it   it s very humid here in hawaii and he loves not having sweat soaked shirts   his only complaint is is a little on the small side for x large   normally x large shirts are on the loose side for him   these shirts get clingy  around the chest when exercising      
326,4.0 ,                       i ordered a size small than my other gym shirts due to weight loss  however  these are like   sizes smaller  i m personally not a fan of fitted gym shirts  other than that they are good shirts  i ll save them for down the road       
327,1.0 ,                       horrible quality  uneven sewing  i can t believe they try to sell these  these are something that looked like practice pieces from a sewing class  they were truly awful      
328,4.0 ,                       really nice shirt  but tight  ordered  xl and they re snug   more of an athletic or compression fit than mentioned   should have gone up a size   my wife now has adopted them instead of returning them other than fit  nice quality and feel   look nice too      
329,3.0 ,                       it is a thin material  thinner than expected  the neck hole is bigger than i like it  if i would have bought an extra large it would have been too big and the big is a wee bit small  however  overall not bad      
330,3.0 ,                       i ordered the shirts for working in hot texas weather  the fit was a bit tighter than a large under armour brand for my husband  he is slim build muscular  we hand  them down to our son      
331,2.0 ,                       good dry fit shirt except for the fact that i am a definite xxl shirt guy and these feel tight as a large   can t wear them so order   sizes up     
332,5.0 ,                       if you wear a t shirt under shirt  switch to these  i wear polo shirts at work but go from hot outside to ac cold inside  so sweat can be an issue  i switched from cotton tees to the dry moisture wic tees  the difference is incredible  the fit is so comfortable  when it s hot outside and i m sweating i m cool but don t feel soggy like i did with the cotton tees  when i go back inside i feel comfortable not sticky from dried sweat  i m definitely buying more      
333,1.0 ,                       i wear large in pretty much every type of shirt i buy  i was reading reviews said to buy big so i bought an xl an it was way too tight need like a  x     
334,3.0 ,                       i was hoping these t shirts were of better quality  but  after   washes  the material around the neck is starting to hang down limply      
335,4.0 ,                       the colors are not as vibrant as pictured  the teal was super dark compared to what the picture shows  they absolutly fit smaller i sized up   and it was perfect for me as i didnt want a tight fit  they are also pretty thin  on the upside  they arent as crappy quality as some of the comments mention  mine handled being washed and never unraveled      
336,4.0 ,                       these actually aren t all that bad  they re comfortable and look great  they are objectively cheap and while i ordered all black i got multiple different colors i think people should avoid the varient with the patches under the arm pits because it offers more fail points girlfriend loves them      
337,1.0 ,                       total and utter garbage    shirt has a hole in it  others have seams coming apart and yet another has a collar that s completely twisted  junk      
338,4.0 ,                       the material is light weight and breathable  at first it seems a little see through  but it really isn t  it is a bit shorter than i would like for my fiancee who is      but it doesn t seem to bother him      
339,5.0 ,                       easy wash and wear  great for hot summer days  gym work out  very comfortable  maintains shape  awesome value  colours      
340,3.0 ,                       the shirt itself can withstand sweat sticking but the quality itself is cheap but for the price that is to be expected  for instance i  ripped a few threads on the collar when i was trying to take it off quickly  if you workout a lot at the gym don t expect some it to be a nike workout alternative replacement  for me as an avid gym rat i m not gonna reorder these again      
341,5.0 ,                       if you dislike being to hot due to cotton t shirts like me then i highly suggest trying these   i m buying more as they allow the heat to disperse much better then cotton      
342,4.0 ,                       these shirts were alright  i would recommend going a size up from usual  i had to go up to a  xl and they were still a little tight for me  but thats is just my personal prefetence  i did however believe i received a used shirt since the tagless imprint was washed out  i did have to throw the white shirt away since after throwing it in the washer it started to unravel the stitching  so i am down to four shirts  it s fine though i guess  i wasn t expecting them to last too much  overall  the feel is nice  the length is below my waist  and they re comfortable sleeping shirts as well      
343,1.0 ,                       i purchased  one   pack of the men s dry fit moisture wicking active athletic performance crew t shirt   the fit of the shirt is perfect   the problem is they have a strong chemical odor even after washing   they also  bled  the black color onto the other laundry but that was my fault for washing them with other items   the main  serious problem  however  is the chemical  petroleum like odor   they are unwearable  i am concerned about the health impact of the shirt touching my skin for an extended time      
344,1.0 ,                       these are horribly cut  reviews said  run small   and advised ordering a size up  i was seeking an xl  so ordered xxl  these did not fit  anywhere  they were even restrictive at the shoulder  the sleeves were restrictive  i would wager these were between a medium and a large      
345,1.0 ,                       p sima calidad  la talla no es la que dice ser  todas las franelas son de tama o diferente  la costura es mediocre y mal hecha  los shorts son peque os y la tela casi transparente de muy baja calidad  y para completar para devolver el art culo tuve que pagar casi   dolares     
346,5.0 ,                       t shirt and boxers line dried in   hours after a washing machine spin   my husband will be wringing them out in a hotel bathroom   that takes   hours   completely dry overnight  perfect   he picked the neon colored boxers    i don t know   no disco places around here      
347,3.0 ,                       neck is really loose  looks like it s blown out  xl fits like a l  not long enough even in xl      
348,5.0 ,                       disappointed ordered these same shirts about    months ago and loved them     bought ten more recently  same size  same shirts  and the neck openings are almost as large as the waste   very disappointed      
349,3.0 ,                       i bought the xl for my husband and when he tried one of the t shirts they did not fit his shoulders  chest a would not pull all the way down      
350,5.0 ,                       slightly tight around the next  wish it was a little bigger of a neck circle  just a bit  but quality and inexpensive and nice colors  light for workouts  happy  bought again already      
351,5.0 ,                       though travel is restricted at this point  it is our passion  we buy clothes that are light weight  easily washed and dry quickly   these meet those criteria  fit well and have stylish accents      
352,4.0 ,                       i expected a looser fit with my usual xl size so these are a little tight  they feel good and polyester  spandex should not shrink much   one seam on one shirt was left with some loose threads but they clipped off without any damage to the seam and i think they will hold up ok in the wash   net       shirt is a great price      
353,4.0 ,                       i would have given   stars if not for the neck being slightly tighter than expected  it does stretch out during the day but first thing in the morning they are not quite but almost choking  i ve never had a  x be a little tight in the neck after being washed for the first time  other than the neck they fit nicely       
354,4.0 ,                       set six shows a dark blue and a light blue  instead of a light blue i got a black with the neck stitching coming off thus making the neck loose and not even  light blue was the one i was looking forward to the most and they trade it for a defective black one      
355,2.0 ,                       due to the design where two colors sewn together  my body feels the hard sewing on the inside that i wasn t comfortable wearing it      
356,1.0 ,                       shirts looked like rejects  all were different sizes  some had stains and some had stitching glitches  they were cheap and i got what i paid for  probably should have ordered xxl  but i ve never worn anything but l and xl  but that wouldn t have made up for the mis manufacturing and stains      
357,5.0 ,                       over the holiday  i ordered medium  large and xtra large the shirts tend to run smaller then the size it comes in but  each time i had to return and reorder there was no problem sending it back or getting a new order  i am very happy with the shirts and will continue to purchase from this company  once the right size came everyone was very happy  thank you for making my shopping easy  madeline travers  ernest palmer     
358,2.0 ,                       the material is nice as well as the style and colors   liked the   pack   however  be aware before you buy   these are very slim fitting   might be okay for the tall guys  but definitely not for the big guys   bought these as a gift for my husband and they were way too small in his regular size      
359,4.0 ,                       i likked the variety of   shirt packages  settled on one to take on my first post covid trip  held up well after the initial wash      
360,4.0 ,                       purchased these in place of    degrees crew shirts  the shirts fit well  aside from being a little too short        fit body here   it would be nice if they added another     inches so my lower back boxer briefs aren t exposed while exercising  as the    degrees shirts cover       
361,5.0 ,                       i cut lawns for a livin and i needed something cool to work in  i live in sc and if you from here  you already know its thick  hot and humid   as of right now these shirts are amazing  i wear car heart pants and they are thick and usually drenched in sweat  the shirt gets wet but drys fairly quickly and if you get a breeze it sends a nice chill to the body  im ordering more  the just look great too      
362,4.0 ,                       these are good shirts but are cut smaller than the stated size  noticeably so  order at least one size larger      
363,4.0 ,                       these shirts fit as advertised and look great  i put my foundation logo on them and as people donate a certain amount they get a shirt  the comments have been great and people like these shirts well      
364,1.0 ,                       fits   sizes too small  sizes even vary in the same pack  i wear an xl so i bought a  xl and it is too tight all over  if you have shoulders forget about it  they fell apart within   months of wear  terrible      
365,4.0 ,                       ordered the   pack and the interior package appeared to have been resealed  in a this had been previously returned fashion  one of the   shirts did not have the original tag on it  also supporting the   this had been opened and returned previously  one of the   shirts had a rip down the side near the bottom  that said they fit well and are great for workouts  i don t want to send all of the shirts back but don t know how to just get a replacement shirt for the one that was ripped  would have been   stars if shirt was not ripped      
366,1.0 ,                       i wouldn t recommend this product to anyone  the quality is horrible and the fit is horrible  its made out of a weird thin bouncy elastic material  doesn t even feel like cloth  not sweat wicking either  i regret ordering them  i wish amazon would only allow quality products  these shirts feel like they came from wish      
367,2.0 ,                       i wear a  x  so i ordered the  x   they re too small tight around my big fat belly   all my other  x s fit me    i m a man and my belly is too big   if you have flat abs then they should be ok   the sizing that is   just be aware   they run small around the tummy   very disappointed because they were a bargain  but i am returning all   of these   lars     
368,3.0 ,                       a good athletic shirt for the price   comfortable and light weight material but not too thin   there was a small amount of bunching at the bottom of the seam of the front and back panels on a couple of the shirts   nothing too major   the stitching is ok  a little uneven around the collar and sleeves   again  nothing major   the quality meets expectations for the price   used for daily   mi  run and work outs   decent athletic shirt for the price      
369,4.0 ,                       these shirts fit well  but they look light they might not hold up in the long haul  the fabric that has a strong heather pattern to it seems to have the pattern aligned in the wrong way   at something of a diagonal instead of horizontal  on the other had  the price is reasonable      
370,2.0 ,                       i returned these   the collars on one was creased and all were somewhat  baconie   they would look bad wearing underneath a shirt to work      
371,1.0 ,                       lower quality products used   pre wash  were smaller than anticipated      
372,5.0 ,                       i really like these shirts and will buy more later   i seen some reviews saying it was poorly made  i have to disagree        
373,1.0 ,                       this would be a nice gift to send someone if your aiming for an april fools gift immediately after opening and pulling first shirt out i put them back in and requested a refund the shirt was quite literally   backsides seamed as   shirt so no matter how you put it on it would be backwards bith sides had the back tag on them      
374,1.0 ,                       i always  and i do mean always buy based upon reviews  i did read all the negative reviews about these shirts but because i needed them at an affordable price  i ordered them anyway  huge mistake  these shirt are awful  i didn t find them to be significantly different in size from each other as some of the reviews said  but honestly  i didn t hold them all up to each other either  but i have a long list of complaints on these shirts without adding that to the list      they are way  way smaller than they should be  i ordered my usual size and no joke  no exaggeration  they are at least   full sizes too small    all of my other dry fit shirts are cool and comfortable  these  however  are the hottest most uncomfortable shirts i have ever had the misfortune of trying on and i even tried them on  inside  in a comfortable environment rather than somewhere hot  like my place of employment where i had intended to wear these things     i have read a lot of reviews on other products that mention a chemical smell but i haven t actually experienced this myself  ever  even on those items until now  these shirts have the strongest  horrible chemical smell  i can t imagine even washing them would take away from that awful odor   i tried them on  without first washing them so i could return them if needed  and now i have a rash that i am afraid to even imagine what it could be from so  listen to the reviews  do not buy these shirts  trust me on this  it isn t going to save you any money  they stink  they are hot and uncomfortable and unless you order a minimum of   sizes up  they aren t even going to fit  save yourself time  energy and effort and just pay more and get another brand and pay a little more   i only gave one star because it won t permit me to give less than one star      
375,5.0 ,                       made to fit    you know   a human body  as opposed to some of the brand name shirts out there that are like tents   kinda nice     shows off physique  inexpensive   quality   did bleed a tiny bit of color when washed with whites  my bad       
376,3.0 ,                       my husband and i have two furry dogs and i was looking for something that would keep the hair at a minium when hes lounging around the house  my husband has a little bit of a belly and he said the shirts are just to uncomfortable and tight in the mid section  i am returning the shirts as he won t wear them  he likes the fabric tho  nice silky feeling      
377,5.0 ,                       nice and thin   cool to wear anywhere   i prefer around the house thou because the colors are nice but i dont differentiate the colors of my pants jean s that way so most of them i wear where that doesn t concern  me   other then that quality and texture is great      
378,5.0 ,                       these shirts are great  i like how they are tighter on me so they will not get snagged on gym equipment like i ve had with other shirts  i would highly recommend getting these if you want a good workout shirt i have went with the small size      
379,4.0 ,                       pros  the fit is perfect  the material is great  they feel great while working out con  hopefully this doesn t happen again but   of the shirts was actually an xl even tho i bought l  once i put it on i had to do a double take  it was very baggy  also  one of the shirts began falling apart at the seem in the armpit      
380,2.0 ,                       i wear a large in everything else  ordered these shirts in a large and the fit is barely adequate but more on the tight side  not pleased and would not order again      
381,3.0 ,                       i ordered a size larger than i typically wear  the shirts are still to snug  i still like the material though and will keep the shirts      
382,1.0 ,                       this shirt is way too tight in the shoulders  a little too tight in the chest  the sleeves are too short  as far as length  it sits right at my belt  the bottom of the shirts are wider than the rest of the shirt  they kind of  bell  out  like they are made for women s hips  unfortunately  i do not have wide hips  i only tried on   of them and they somehow are both different sizes despite them both being tagged xl      
383,5.0 ,                       normal sizing i would say  i m         lbs  bought mediums to wear under my button up work shirt  good fit  soft fabric  keeps me dry and cool  would buy again     
384,3.0 ,                       i ordered xl size shirts that normally fit loose on me but these shirts were so small i didn t complete trying the first one on  they must be a medium or smaller size  i am returning them      
385,2.0 ,                       very cheap price but very poor quality  bought a pack of   shirts and   shirts got small holes in the seams after two washes  another shirt has the stitching coming undone  at the price point i expected this and bought them for the gym and doing yard work only  don t expect these to be a quality item that will last years      
386,2.0 ,                       all of these shirts say large  yet they are all one size larger than the other set that i ordered  one of the shirts hangs   inches lower than the original ones i ordered     so with all saying large  they all appear to be xl and xxl      
387,1.0 ,                       had to wash at least    times to try and get the formaldehyde out  still smells like it   and excess dye was constantly getting into the test rag  always wash strongly colored stuff the first time with a test rag to see if it leeches    otherwise decent athletic gear  but not worth the effort of washing out a toxic chemical      
388,4.0 ,                       the shirts feels nice and fit really nice on me    i was looking for some tshits to do my daily running   i m doing my first try  i havent wash them yet   but when i opened the box and i was verifying each shirt i noticed one came with a hole in one of the sleeves  i m really dissapointed  expecially when this was the color that i wanted most      
389,1.0 ,                       i am         lbs   x always fits  this was way to tight  get a bigger size  update  i order the  x and it was still to small   these shirts are not made to size at all      
390,5.0 ,                       i did not have high hopes  but i ve worn two from the package and i m favorably impressed  good fit  good weight  and texture  for a small price      
391,1.0 ,                       very disappointed in the fit of these shirts  they are entirely too tight vs the correlated size that was ordered  i would estimate the size to be two sizes smaller than what was labeled on them  i would not recommend purchasing them      
392,1.0 ,                       if something is too good to be true it probably is  i bought these because they were cheap and i got the variety pack with five different colors  this included five different styles five different fits in five different fabric weights if something is too good to be true it probably is  i bought these because they were cheap and i got the variety pack with five different colors  this included five different styles  five different fits and five different fabric weights  some of them are so big they re hanging off me and two of them are so small they should ve been mediums and not extra larges      
393,2.0 ,                       the shirts are nice looking and soft but about two sizes too small for a normal man   we ordered larges and they were not wearable   must return them      
394,3.0 ,                       colors and material excellent with a comfortable fit  neck opening a bit small  i suspect these are factory rejects as   of the   did not lay smoothly when worn  the right side of one of the shirts showed a clumped up fit on the right front shoulder area  three pieces fit and looked perfect  the other two i would only wear as an undershirt      
395,5.0 ,                       very comfortable shirt  i bought the  xl after reviews said it ran small  and it does  their  xl is the same size as most of my xl  other than that  these are great shirts for the money      
396,5.0 ,                       i bought these for my husband who wears them to the gym   he says they wick well and he really likes the feel of the shirt   just recently purchased  so unable to tell how they will hold up wash after wash   so far  very happy with the purchase      
397,3.0 ,                       the shirts are good light weight  soft and fit great  even one size smaller and one size larger are not too bad but when you buy a pack of mediums you re not really expecting to have just   mediums and two other sizes to test out but at least it was just one size up and one size down  it is somewhat nice to see how they fit differently since i lost weight  might buy again if i want to chance rolling the dice on how many wearable sizes i will receive     
398,2.0 ,                       multiple shirts have holes in them from only wearing them a few months  bad quality  i m not buying this again      
399,4.0 ,                       overall i thought the t shirts were awesome with one exception that the neck was too big for me maybe because it s a workout shirt it should be big but i would certainly give it four stars overall     
400,1.0 ,                       ordered a  xl but it runs very small  med to large is how it fit   everything else was ok  but didn t get a chance to really pay attention once i tried it on      
401,4.0 ,                       got these for the gym and they are doing the job well  i got the medium size and they fit snug in the places you want them to for the gym and they are very soft  perfect for sleeping in and to wear under work shirts when it gets hot  the fit is very good  the neck fit is great i didn t have the experience another commenter had   the quality is very good especially for the price  but the colors aren t quite like the picture  this is the only reason i didn t rate these   star  not a huge deal  but i did want the turquoise powder blue color  got a dark greenish shirt instead  for nfl fans  if you wanted the chargers powder blue color  you ll get an eagles old seahawks green color can t beat the price and these are definitely worth the price  i ordered the solid colors  less stitching less loose threads  for sure not nike pro quality and fit  but for sure not nike prices  perfect for a penny pincher like me i will get these again    star for price and quality  just a little ding for the colors shown not being accurate      
402,5.0 ,                       use as an undershirt for moisture wicking   can be used as gym shirt or even going out casually   shirt doesnt drycas quick as i d like  i do like the fit and comfort though   overall it s a good workout shirt   fits loosely  which i like right now  to hide lower belly pudge      
403,1.0 ,                       well after waiting  forever  for the shirts to arrive  even tho the advertise as prime  i wore one today   there is absolutely nothing  performance  about these   you will stay wet all day   then i decided to wash them   big mistake     they are falling apart   i used the delicate cycle and just threw   away without drying   if i would have dried them in the dryer they would all have been stuck in the lint trap   yes folks they are that bad   i can honestly say that this is the worst purchase i have ever made on amazon      
404,1.0 ,                       i bought the exact same size for my son last year and they fit perfect  this year it was like they were youth  xl  so small  not impressed with how the sizing changed  very unhappy  waste of money  make sure you order   or   times the size you actually need now that the sizing has changed from last year     
405,2.0 ,                       these shirts look great out of the box but after just a few washings the seam at the bottom becomes very rippled     
406,1.0 ,                       i ordered these shirts and although they looked nice in the picture  they run super small  i tried to return them and i m still waiting to get my money  i will never buy from this seller again   these negative  reviews are correct      
407,4.0 ,                       nothing wrong with the product  for me it wasn t cut large enough as previous shirts i wear as  xl  material   colors were great   just didn t fit as expected  nevertheless my son benefited from the purchase      
408,2.0 ,                       t shirt quality is average  but sizes are way off  i take a xl but some reviews said not true to size  i ordered  x and it was skin tight  no movement at all felt like i was wearing saran wrap  granded i m no buff guy and have a beer belly but all my other xl s feel fine  spend the extra money for a name brand that is true to size      
409,4.0 ,                       runs small    not as moisture proof as competitor product under armor but value is amazing worth it     
410,1.0 ,                       i ordered these shirts with very low expectations  just needing a few shirts to workout in  i order the five pack of short sleeves  the only thing they got right is assorted colors  i got five different colors  the first one i tried on was a silver grey color  and along with having the bacon neck fresh out of the package  it also had some dirt marks on the left sleeve   cool right  this led me to further inspect the rest of the shirts  two of the shirts in my pack are sleeveless       odd  and one is an xl  out of the four larges  none are actually the same size  they re itchy  they re awful  i won t even wear these  they re going in the trash or to folks who don t care  even my low expectations were not met  please don t buy these as this company obviously just doesn t care  look past the     best seller  tag from amazon and get something different      
411,5.0 ,                       this was a brilliant move  i originally bought the    degrees undershirts like these but they are selling them five in a pack anymore so i had to settle for these  well  these have not let me down  this was a great investment      
412,3.0 ,                       for starters the colors aren t as bright as what s pictured   i also found these ran on the small side   when i order an extra large  i expect them to fit a little loose   these are tight fitting on me  a pudgy guy   ok   alright   a fat guy   but i m workin  on it   that s why i bought these workout shirts   initially these things smelled pretty bad   just a bad new shirt smell  but after washing them a few times that smell has gone away   it definitely took more than one wash though   i m cheap  so for    each they aren t bad   don t expect under armour quality      
413,5.0 ,                       very pleased with these t s had my suspicions about the quality for such a low price  but very pleased now that i ve tried them  seem to be very well made and time will tell about long term use      
414,1.0 ,                       i wanted to use this for work t shirts but what did i get some too small  t shirts  that don t fit and i have no use for i ordered  la extra large  and i got  small  i m very unhappy  sorry  and thank you     
415,5.0 ,                       these are the best shirts i have purchased on amazon  my husband absolutely loves them and the fit is just perfect  the quality and materials of the shirts are solid  have not had any issues with shrinkage after being laundered  i don t think you can go wrong purchasing these      
416,3.0 ,                       fairly good value but they are oddly short  like the shirts aren t quite long enough        
417,1.0 ,                       the material is good for light weight and quick dry but the design is awful and cheap feeling  sleeves are too short and yet too loose  waist is tight for the size  and so on  probably good for people with super average bodies or those that like super tight fits  the quality is not redeemable though      
418,2.0 ,                       shirts are obviously made of different fabric based on what color packs you order  one set was very soft and worked well to wick moisture away but the other set was like wearing sandpaper  even after washing multiple times i still can t stand the fabric against my skin  the quality is not good on either as both have had the stitching start to come out after only a few weeks      
419,5.0 ,                       typically wear large   they were tight  returned for xl  now very large  too loose but better than having it hug my body     
420,1.0 ,                       not true to size and you shouldn t have to pay to exchange the shirt when it s false advertisement if it says it s true to size it should be true to size or they should pay for the size to be exchange or a refund this is bs on amazon s part on letting them charge to return something don t buy from this company     
421,4.0 ,                       these are solid shirts for a workout  will say go a size up if you don t like snug   these are a tad snug but nothing i ll complain about since i m only wearing them in the gym      
422,4.0 ,                       love the material   dry so fast and no ironing one shirt did loosen under the arm as previous commented   just sew it back closed     
423,2.0 ,                       pros     great price   cool lookingcons       sizes smaller then actually advertised   raised crew neck fits like a turtleneck   cheap material  not breathable  you will sweat and start smiling after awhile no matter what deodorant you use        
424,5.0 ,                       i wear an xl tee   i ordered  xl tees so i would have a loose fit   based on the pix in the advertisement  these are fitted tees   be sure and order bigger unless you want a tight fit      
425,2.0 ,                       five shirts in the package   they said they were all  large    one of five shirts fit nicely   one i couldn t get my head through  and ended up cutting the lining in front so i could get the shirt on   once i got that shirt on  it fit in the body and is very comfortable   one was obviously the next size smaller  and is a throwaway too small  even though it reads the correct size    the other two shirts ran small   i can get them on  but they are uncomfortable   materials are good  and the two shirts that fit i really like  even though i had to cut the one   i expected them all to be the same   quality control people  do some quality control      
426,1.0 ,                       impossible to exaggerate how horribly cheap these shirts are  irregular construction  varying sizes  paper thin  poorly stitched  not one survived the first wash without falling apart  total and complete garbage      
427,5.0 ,                       my husband loved the shirts but i had to order two sets  the first one was  x and was too small  i gave them to a neighbor  had to reorder a  x and it fit perfectly  definitely recommend getting a size larger because of the material      
428,4.0 ,                       great sporty shirt  great colors and fabric  only complaint is that the shirt feels like it s about     size too small  i recommend ordering one size larger than usual      
429,5.0 ,                       fantastic value  very comfortable  neck hole is bigger than i think it should be  but i bought them for having rotator cuff surgery  so  they were great for getting on and off  very stretchy      
430,2.0 ,                       poor stitching around neck and not very good quality  one of the   shirts had such a small neck opening i could not get it over my head  the rest fit ok       
431,4.0 ,                       there wasn t anything wrong with the shirts other than they ran smaller than expected the seamed well made  but had to return because of the size difference     
432,1.0 ,                       my husband normally wears and xl t shirt which is slightly loose on him  so i ordered him xl sizes and they were so tight i you could see the outline of his areolas  they were way too small      
433,4.0 ,                       great fit and feel  however  color shirts must be hand washed separately as the dye has a tendency to run      
434,5.0 ,                       good quality  as i have worn these every day essentially for the past few months  no issues with them  and they have held up well   they do fit a little snug  but that could be due to the growth during the lockdown this year  too      
435,4.0 ,                       i like the t shirts  but the stitching and cut of the inside seams is ragged and uneven  i am worried that the stitching is going to come unraveled because there where a lot of strings i had cut off  otherwise  i love them so far  they have gone through the walk ok      
436,3.0 ,                       they are ok but i dont expect them to last very long  its       so i got these for hanging out at home  generally they are comfortable  the material is nice   it has a good feel and stretch  but the seams have some loose strings  especially at the end of the seam where tied off   fit is a bit snug for large but probably normal for this style  saying that  i didnt mind much that   of the   was a size bigger than ordered      
437,5.0 ,                       honestly was not expecting much from these just wanted something quick and easy to work out in  now i find myself wearing the shirts everyday whether it be a work shirt  i work as a swim lesson coordinator   working out or lounging around my house  i like them so much i am going to buy   more packs      
438,3.0 ,                       very nice but i have to return   the xl did not even fit my husbands arms or shoulders   he has always worn an xl      
439,4.0 ,                       my son needed moisture wicking t shirts to wear under his moisture wicking uniform shirts and these were perfect    he not only wears them to work but out as well    he loves these shirts        
440,2.0 ,                       feel good looks good  but they have a weird smell even after washing them  i expected them to be a little longer for a workout shirt   i use mine for undershirt for uniform  and i can tuck it but worry when i bend over  love its crew neck but its so high it feels like a choke      
441,1.0 ,                       poorly constructed   each one of the five fits differently     collars are stretched out  one had a gap in the sleeve seem that is open  poorly sewn   two are small around   two are too short this quality is shameful and a full refund would be appropriate     
442,4.0 ,                       neck too big opening  material thin   still they work well and no complaints aside of this      
443,3.0 ,                       soft  wares well  great for hiking  bought an xl but fits like a medium  bought for a   foot    lb man but fits on my         lb boyfriend instead      
444,5.0 ,                       bought for my son   he really liked the quality and fit   will probably purchase another pack      
445,2.0 ,                       these shirts are cheaply made  i bought them for a    year old who is growing fast  i wouldn t recommend them for someone who wants them long term  but for a growing  messy kid  they re ok also  one of the seams on one of them is coming loose      
446,5.0 ,                       based on reviews i bought them a size over as the general complaint was that they were a neat cut   it turned out to be a good move as i normally wear an xl and the xxl was the correct fit      
447,3.0 ,                         pack of shirts  i ordered xxls  am a tad under      tall and     pounds  these fit all right each is sized fits slightly differently  i e   the neck openings on a couple are tighter than the others  and at least one of them seems to  pull  a bit to the left   sewn  or the material is cut  slightly off center  one of them has about a one inch section of the left sleeve that was simply unsewn  that is  there a hole along the seam for a five pack of t shirts for lounging around the house and or running  etc        i can live with slight imperfections  including maybe sewing up an imperfect seam      
448,1.0 ,                       i am very disappointed in this product  every shirt that came in this package was a different size  now let me be clear  out of   shirts   were tagged medium  as i wanted  and one was tagged large   i don t know why they sent that  the package said   medium   to further my disappointment all    medium  shirts fit drastically different  i cannot use a single shirt  now this next issue may be my fault for not checking what material they use  but it was not comfortable in the slightest way      
449,1.0 ,                       brought these shirts on vacation without trying them on  which is my fault  however  every shirt i own is xl or xxl if its cotton and going to shrink   two of the six shirts shrunk and a third one had a hole in the seem   the ones at did  fit   it was like they where    two short across the shoulders and the seem was way up above your shoulder and the sleeves were way to tight   looked like i was wearing spandex  which is not what i wanted   bottom line  they shrink when they shouldn t  sized wrong and fall apart in the wash   i just threw them away in mexico   total crap    i gave them one star becasue there isn t an option for zero stars   do not buy        
450,5.0 ,                       very soft  fits a little loose so definitely not a tight fit  i bought these for my boyfriends birthday  he s       and    lbs  i got him a medium  they are a little loose on his torso but fit his arms  chest and shoulders perfectly  at    each you can t go wrong  will probably get him other colors later on     
451,2.0 ,                       i wear a mens xl       with just a little tummy  these are way too small for me  i felt like an overstuffed sausage in these  luckily  my wife  who wears a mens medium  tried them on and said they would be great for protecting her shoulders while gardening      
452,1.0 ,                       after the first wash some of the stitching started to unravel at the bottom of the shirts   it s not worth buying cheap products if they don t even last a year   next time i will read some reviews before buying      
453,2.0 ,                       nice shirts  feel good and fit well  however  the collar neckline sits too low   personal preference     
454,4.0 ,                       my shirts     great fit size color all but one i order the five pack got four xl got one double xl huh pretty sure they all was supposed to be one size bud  the bang eney drink must have kicked in about the last shirt they was grabbing       awwwwww f    this order awwwwww slam dunks my order on table       stuffs it in a bag like he destuffing a turkey  then slaps the label sticker on the bag like its the first time she says smack my butt daddy  and boom kobeeeeee this b     down the line  i am assuming that how i got one shirt in the wrong size      
455,4.0 ,                       i wasn t looking for a tight fit so i ordered a large           lbs  and it s a very comfortable fit  not tight in the armpits  long enough to tuck in or let hang  very comfy      
456,5.0 ,                       these are an extraordinary buy  the fabric is soft and laundry friendly  the colors are bright and the fit is perfect  these will be my summer go to here in florida      
457,5.0 ,                       i needed something affordable for a growing teenage boy   he loves the fit and feel of them and i love that they are holding up to an active summer and wash well     
458,2.0 ,                       these shirts are like lootboxes these days  you hope you get something good  but get more trash before finding that one good item  the   pack came in  all correct sizes  however the neck hole sizes vary  the shirts run a tad shorter than i d like  and the stitching is   horrible  coming undone on some shirts and needs snipping off and i feel as though these won t stand the test of time  they look great  feel great  but the varying quality    it aint great      
459,1.0 ,                       after the first was one of the shirts had pulls in the material and another lost stitching at the sleeve so the sleeve is now falling off the shirt  inexpensive shirts but you get what you pay for  very disappointed  i have other russel shirts similar to these which i have worn for several years  what happened to quality  sizing is different that former shirts also  fit tighter than my first ones      
460,2.0 ,                       so half of the shirts fit and the others don t   very confusing  they say they are same size but they are not   the ones that do fit are wonderful   i am a lg xl in shirts normally  these xl were pretty tight      
461,5.0 ,                       just what i wanted   a collection of ts that fits my needs of doing long  and short  hikes i will start wearing one of these shirts and at some point mid to     of the way switch to the  extra one  i packed in backpack moisture wicking works wonderfully     
462,5.0 ,                       i love the feel of the material  i m required to wear black t shirts under my work uniform  very comfortable in the summer  i ve bought   packages  seem to hold up well after repeat washes  highly recommend      
463,1.0 ,                       this item was given just this past weekend as a gift  the shirts are super lightweight soft and comfy perfect for wearing during hot  busy  physical days  unfortunately as we were taking all of the shirts out we noticed that the dark blue had some sort of mirrored stain on the back as seen in photos  because this was given as a gift we missed the return window by   days  make sure if you order these shirts that you take a close look at the fronts and the backs as our seemingly came pre stained      
464,5.0 ,                       these were nice but they don t stretch  they were too small in the back chest  and shoulders  they fit super tight around the arms  they couldn t be used for the gym or running  this is an xl in the picture   he s    appx     lbs  oh  and  the return was credited the same day  it was great      
465,3.0 ,                       these shirts are good looking and we like the material but the necks are all weird and not even      
466,3.0 ,                       feel like im a monster in the shirts i bought  very form fitting  i have a dad bod  should have bought a big larger size      
467,4.0 ,                       i am impressed at how good looking and fitting they are but do not wash them the first couple of times with white clothes  even in cold water  as at least the red and blue will tint the rest of the wash      
468,5.0 ,                       good product this item works as it should and is well made   i would buy again if needed      
469,2.0 ,                       does not fit correctly  sizing in incorrect  other than that they look like well made shirts  would probably be comfortable if the sizing was correct  if you order you may want to get a larger size      
470,1.0 ,                       the material is fine the craftsmanship is not   shirts are falling apart  poorly sewn and incompletely sewn  don t buy  u get what u pay for     
471,5.0 ,                       my son absolutely loves these shirtsupdate  they are starting to fall apart a little bit but for the price it s totally worth it     
472,1.0 ,                       these shirts suck   each shirt in the   pack  all the same size  fit way differently   the neck opening is way too small  the shoulders are really high  to the point where there is a loose fabric on the top of my shoulders when i wear it   save your money and don t buy them      
473,2.0 ,                       material feels nice and comfortable but after only one wash i had found weak spots in some seems as well as loose threads      
474,5.0 ,                       i think these are a great deal  very lightweight  other reviews almost steered me away  glad i purchased  the smell is gone after you wash them      
475,2.0 ,                       i ordered   shirts and the price was on the cheaper side   however  of the   shirts  one had a collar that would fit an nfl lineman  one shirt would not fit my    yr  one shirt fit but was way short and the two shirts i wear  are nice wicking material and good for work around the house and playing sports three shirts are  now in the good will basket hoping someone can wear them and appreciate them      
476,1.0 ,                       horrible   the smell is horrendous   washed them one time   the neck hole is tiny   the cut is not properly fitting for any human being   the print is half washed away   strings everywhere and already falling apart   did i mention  i never even wore them once   sent them back   the potent chemical smell means something is very  very wrong with these shirts      
477,5.0 ,                       love these shirts  i need to get another set  they fit great and wash perfect  i am a real  consumer  great company     
478,5.0 ,                       i wear these type of shirts as a base layer everyday  they keep you warm but don t get sweaty  i had a brand i always used that was ok but these are much better      
479,3.0 ,                       large definitely is a medium  large t shirts are a little big on me and these fit like a medium t s i own that shrunk in the dryer material is thin and would be ideal in the summer  wish i ordered xl   and i ve never worn that size      
480,4.0 ,                       unless you like to wear your sisters shirt  ordered by the measurement chart which was one size to small  wear them around the house  if you order  order one size larger to insure they fit      
481,4.0 ,                       material is a little thin  but for the price you can t beat them   a few strings that needed to be cut  and have not shrunk much after a couple washings   i would order these again      
482,5.0 ,                       these are very comfortable and fit snug   which is good for working out maybe a little too tight for wearing anywhere else   unless you re really cut   i am not      
483,4.0 ,                       i ordered these for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves them for the gym  the material is great for working out and super comfortable  the only problem we really had with the shirts was the stitching  after about     washes the thread seemed to come off from the bottom of the shirt and took all the stitching off  other than that the shirts are actually great  wouldn t really want to leave a bad review        
484,1.0 ,                       these t shirts are just a tad smaller than t shirts of the same type and size i already own  and they are of terribly poor quality one literally broke when i put it on  by tearing in the side  they feel like paper and have no give  meaning the moment any tension occurs  the seams begin to tear and rip      
485,5.0 ,                       runs real small i have never had this size be tight  quality is ok  but they are basically no good as they are tight on me      
486,1.0 ,                       i liked the shirts with regard to material and fit   i was quite disappointed with the color grouping i received  however   they were not the five color grouping i had originally selected on my order form     close but no cigar   i decided to keep the five shirts i was sent since returning them was more of an inconvenience to me than keeping them      
487,5.0 ,                       i love these   have purchased before this order   i seem to have expanded so i wish i had ordered the next size up  but that is my fault     i am going to order again  but xxl ps  i did order the larger size and love them too      
488,1.0 ,                       neck collar sits like it s been way stretched out  like a cheap old t shirt except it s brand new  shirt is fine otherwise but the collar line is garbage and looks terrible  i m only wearing to work out in basement but would not wear out or to a gym it s that bad      
489,4.0 ,                       the shirts are very nice  my only negative comment would be that the colors are much darker than shown in photo  i would have preferred the colors as shown      
490,1.0 ,                       these shirts are way to small for  xl   i wore these shirts a couple of times and the stich is coming loose and the armpits already have holes in them   not worth any amount of money      
491,1.0 ,                       falling apart as i took them out of the package  color all black  not anything like picture at all  looks like a little kid sewed these very badly  i don t understand how such a aweful product can be sold in this country  i would not buy this product     
492,5.0 ,                       these shirts are great   just not for someone with a little extra weight  tight around the stomach area but you don t sweat in them and my husband loves to wear them   he just need to loose a few pounds to look great in them      
493,5.0 ,                       enjoy the quality and price of this shirt   wear this shirt as a tshirt under something else or as is  my only complaint is the words wear off inside so can always tell front to back until you put it on backwards   then hello turn it around  great quality for price     
494,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       these are junk  i bought them for gym but not even good enough to work in the yard  did not make it through the  st wash without unraveling   not even good enough for rags because they are not cotton  do not waste your money      
495,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       pictured are two xl shirts from the same pack of    the only difference being the color  as you can see the blue one is dramatically smaller  if you can see in the picture  both are actually labeled as xl  this is after one wear each  no washing ever  only   days or so after i received them  so just be aware you might receive a similar faulty batch      
496,2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       you definitely get what you pay for with these  i wanted to like these very badly because of the material and how comfortable they are  i bought   packs  the solid colors and the other various non solid color ones  first impression was wow these feel great  then i tried on another and was like  hmmm this one has a tight collar and i find myself trying to pull it down  some of the arm holes were even different sizes  some collars were  bacony  already and i could tell that after a few washes this would become very problematic  especially if you are constantly pulling down to relieve a tight collar  i had to be careful when taking off or putting on hangers and while taking the shirts off because it felt like i would stretch the collar permanently or rip a seam when taking it off  one of the shirts was drastically too small  i bought a size large and it fit like a medium  overall      th of them were too small  around      of them felt like they had too tight a collar  the shoulder stitches are off and don t fit snug around the shoulders  all of them had shoulder seams that stuck up and bothered me  and i have built shoulders traps   one of them even had what appeared to be dirt on them final decision was made after trying on all shirts multiple times and determining that after a few washes these would be useless  for   bucks each i did not feel that they would even be worth the few wears you would get before having to toss them  made in egypt  save your time and money and try something else      
497,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       extremely disappointed in this product  i bought these thinking they would be a good summer work shirt for my job  construction   i ve had dry fit shirts before and they have worked great in the past so when i saw this product with the     best seller  tag on amazon  i decided to purchase when first opening the package i experienced a chemically smell  looking passed that  chaulking it up as a  new shirt smell   i tried one of the shirts on  i originally purchased an xl because i like a more loose fit  but these are very tight  not much stretch in the fabric  the neck is extremely tight and uncomfortable  the fabric is somewhat itchy and seems to cause you to sweat more just by putting it on  checking the fabric by pulling the shirt down i discovered the front half of the shirt seems to be a different fabric than the back half seeing that the front half is more stretchy than the back half   taking the shirt off led me to inspect the stitching on the inside of the shirt  lots of extra thread and misstitches  not to mention how tight the neck is  i could barely get my head and beard through all and all  i would not recommend these shirts to anyone  especially someone that is relatively fit and bearded  will most likely end up giving these to the girlfriend to sleep in      
498,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       purchased xl  in case these shirts run small  i normally fit in large  but could barely fit my head into this shirt  picture included comparing a normal large shirt with this men s xl undershirt  shoulders are about    smaller than my large shirt      
499,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       at first we were sent wrong size in one of the five shirts but i thought not too big of a deal was just a little big  but then only after a week wearing the shirts they are now tearing apart at the inseams  armpit and sides on all shirts are tearing apart  this is not good quality at all  never had this happen before and have purchased long sleeves in this material for my husband here at amazon but not this brand or company here  not worth the     we paid  i can t send back used items that are falling apart due to poor workmanship and quality  and it will only let me put in defected item but then i have to return it says  that s rediculous  can t they see with the fotos the poor quality for just a week after being worn  i m not wasting time on sending these back  why would they want worn shirts back that were clearly made with poor quality and defects  this is my first complaint ever with amazon and i have purchased many items over the years  so you know it is bad      
500,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       wow  i m impressed from the start  this product is perfect fit  not to thin not to thick but stylish in various colors you can mix and match    i would recommend to anyone that s lookin for a decent cheap athletic shirt is a   pack at     isn t bad  i wear it during martial arts training  basketball  blx bike rides  just wearing about the house yard work etc    i love this product a lot this runs a lil big  glad i ordered a small size normally i like to where a medium but this brand fits like a medium but i order small  i m         lbs  shirt length is   inches below the belt line and above your  you know what     loli definitely recommend this brand considering only wear during indoors and summer time not a bad investment for     high recommended        
501,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       these shrunk up at least one size after washing    purchased   sets  very upset  never got to wear them     
502,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       really nice cotton  only disappointment is that i ordered xl thinking they would shrink they do not shrink  but keeping cuz they are comfy     
503,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       great shirts  i took a picture with all five shirts are stacked on top of each other and they are all the same size  i ordered size medium  i did that because there seem to be a lot of reviews about mismatched sizes  the colors are good  they feel really nice  bought five different sets  happy with all my purchases
