0,1.0,                       been drinking sparkling water every day for the last   years  we traditionally purchase it at the local wholesale store  the one that starts with a  c    kind of rhymes with  yo yo   but gave this one a try back when it went on sale a few weeks back for like     case   bought  x of them  aside from upsetting our ups delivery man due to him having to carry those heavy things   also having ordered  x cases of that  bubly  flavored sparkling water in cans which were also on sale  we ve decided to not go this route again largely because they were flat   all of them   just now opened   trashed one of the last   bottles in the last case   i just can t figure it out  even the ones that had some carbonation right after opening seemed to go flat within the first   minutes  massively disappointing   also bizarre as we switch between pellegrino   perrier every week or so      
1,1.0,                       ordered    cases of this water  it s all vaguely flat  for comparison  we bought another bottle at the store  it was not flat  must have been poorly stored or something  pretty tough to return water        
2,5.0,                       we were buying the glass bottle version at the big box store  but it is so heavy to tote home   i convinced my husband to try these  and see how great it is to have the case delivered to our door by amazon   yeah  we re both happy  and we don t have to lug the case of glass bottles home   win win update   according to the customer q a section the manufacturer says this water is     to     or so   it says they  add carbon dioxide for the carbonation  which becomes carbonic acid when dissolved in water   if      is correct  that makes this very acidic  which is not healthy at all  especially if you are eating acidic foods like we all do  like meats for instance   major bummer   my husband loves this water and drinks it all day long   i m going to try to encourage him to add an alkalizer to the water  something like  ph  max   or  alkazone   both of which are available on amazon  and are unflavored drops you can use to alkalize the water   i m not sure how well that addition will go with him or the water  don t even know yet if it will make the water go flat   but i m going to see if he will try it      
3,5.0,                       oh my gawd  this is my very favorite of all the mineral waters   so much better than perrier   i read somewhere in a newspaper health article that pellegrino undergoes huge pressure for centuries  moving very slowly from one cavern to another   i may describe it poorly  but it is really good for you  i take it to help my bones among other things  and it tastes great i haven t spent a great deal of time trying to understand the issues  but there s pretty strong research that it s better for your health to eat alkaline foods    or rather foods that are alkalizing   the calcium and magnesium make this an alkaline food      
4,5.0,                       i love this stuff    has the purrfect amount   strength of bubbles   and the large bottle stays bubbly through the   servings i drink over a day or     no more zypherhills  or arrowhead or whoever  depending on where you live    and if you catch the price at         which i always do    the cost cannot be beat   oh  and  delivery to my front door for prime free    it s the ultimate   i wish prime included vacuuming at my house      
5,5.0,                       i drink all kinds of carbonated beverages   didn t realize i actually love pellegreno   the carbonation is different than traditonal factory soda pop type it s a tad less strong  carbonation  but it is just right and does not disapte the moment you unseal the large bottle      
6,5.0,                       quick   day prime delivery  could use some cushioning inside the large shipping box for less movement of actual product box inside the large box it came in to prevent what i ve read a few reviewers say regarding damaged box or broken bottles  i have added   photos  the product date is good         and nothing is damage or missing in my delivery  so i m happy  the price with taxes that i paid is       a bottle  thank you amazon      
7,3.0,                       update           i decided to give it another try and this time around the taste was excellent as expected and i am glad i gave this product a second shot this time around the taste is much rich and it feels like it s completely different product that the one i previewed before   when i received the box    x      and saw the expiration date of late       i was happy but as soon as i tried the  st then the  nd that turned to disappointment   the whole case is bad it tastes almost like you had the bottles opened in the sun for a long period then resealed  no gas no carbonation no taste only a weird tasting drink avoid at all costs even for free do not drink this liquid      
8,1.0,                       we usually buy this water from the local store   it comes in glass bottles and it is excellent  taste and gas   the amazon water arrived ok  but when i opened the bottle  about   or   bubbles raised to the surface and that was it   since i do not know what caused the gas to dissipate from the bottle  i do not want to drink it   i do not recommend buying mineral water in plastic bottles anyway      
9,1.0,                       i tried this product for the first time in feb        i only had a few bottles over the course of about a week  i wasn t very impressed as it tasted flat and bitter  one night  i had a bit before sleep and i woke up at  am with nausea and a racing heart  i thought i was having a heart attack or panic attack  i ended up sick on and off for months  and am still getting over it as of october        it s slow progress but i am feeling better now  it is possible i have been dealing with the  longhaul  form of coronavirus and that it was not the water  but personally  i m not taking my chances again and i would advise prospective buyers to be very cautious  as a first time drinker of mineral water  i was not familiar with the product  if you are familiar with it  you might be able to recognize any problems with it there are other   star reviewers who mentioned issues with their water  look for the reviews from circa june july       one such reviewer mentioned having called the company and them saying amazon possibly stored it incorrectly and caused plastic to leech into the water  i wonder if i ingested plastic that evening  it may have damaged my organs and for months my body had to repair itself  still getting over it  when i examined my unopened bottles a few months later i noticed a pool of white looking sludge sitting on the bottom  i wasn t sure if that was the  minerals  or what  could that have been the plastic  like  does the co  cause the plastic to erode melt over time or something  also  the bottles had a date of      on them  wish i noticed that before i drank it several months back am i being unfair to only suspect this water  i don t think it is unfair to give a   star review for suspecting this water  because  even if i didn t get sick from this water  i still didn t like it  flat and bitter  also  the date on the bottle said       so if they were expired that certainly doesn t help  my theory is that i probably did have corona in late feb early march  but it was this water that stressed out my body to cause corona to become a  longhaul  form of inflammation that lasted for months and months      
10,1.0,                       original review is below   originally gave this   stars   not now  ordered march         and paid        for          oz  bottles of mineral water  now just   weeks later the price has increased over        what is this about what was once a great deal   weeks ago  now  march   rd  will cost               tax            i will not be buying this again   i can t believe they  amazon   pulled a stunt like this i like the taste of pellegrino sparkling natural mineral water   and this deal is fabulous   how can you beat          oz  bottles of one of the purest  most healthy waters on the planet   for around            circa march      i will definitely purchase again      
11,1.0,                       there was something wrong with this water  i have been drinking pellegrino water for    years  my ancestors are from the part of italy that the water comes from  there was something wrong with this water  it gave me a bad stomach ache and it had an alkaline taste as well as a certain sharpness  perhaps foolishly  i tried different bottles in the package over a two week period  and each time i drank some of the water  the stomachache returned  when i bought pellegrino again at the supermarket  i did not have this stomach ache  i called pellegrino  and they told me that the problem was due to the amazon  pellegrino water being stored in correctly  they said that improper storage causes the plastic to leach into the water and create the conditions i described  beware         
12,5.0,                       some people argue that water has no taste  well  those people s taste buds are shot  water tastes differently  according to the mineral content of different water brands san pellegrino is one of my favorites  but not the favorite   i have developed a preference of san pellegrino over perrier  which i used to be a fan of at one time   these two are the most known brands sparkling water in the us  i ve tried store brands in the us  but just save your money and drink filtered tap water instead for those who like san pellegrino  try gerolsteiner from germany  or apollinaris  my favorite is rosport blue   sparkling water from the great small country of luxembourg  the carbonation is not as strong  smaller bubbles    if that makes sense   unfortunately  those are harder to find  gerolsteiner  apollinaris  if not impossible  rosport       
13,2.0,                       as others have written  i too have received almost  flat  water  i know plastic bottles will not hold on to the carbonation as long as glass bottles will   whether it s a soft drink or water   maybe those of us whose water doesn t sparkle very much got bottles that had been sitting in storage too long  i won t be buying these again   the price is not a bargain if the water is almost flat when received  i ll go back to the glass bottles from the grocery store   when i buy glass  i can open it  drink a small amount if that s all i want  seal the bottle back up  and it s still sparkling for a few days      
14,1.0,                       these are flat      i m sorry irritated i didn t read the reviews    i m only on here now to see if i was crazy or what  i literally had to check to see if they were sealed        they taste like tap water      what a joke        i literally drink this brand and perrier for a living  never have i ever tasted this  it s non returnable so i hope i can just prevent someone else experiencing this  i don t know what they are selling but s  pellegrino is not it         
15,5.0,                       first of all i want to say the following to all the   star reviewers that are unfairly venting their frustrations out  you are not being fair if the product lost its fizz or sustained damage in transport as the latter has nothing to do with the quality of product itself but more so with the knuckleheads who do the deliveries i ordered my first case here which is considerably cheaper        than in my local grocery store safeway in san francisco i like the pellegrino because it s a pleasant sparkling water  compared to others with a subtle faint hint of sweetness  with not to aggressive or harsh neither to weak carbonization  a very low sodium very drinkable natural sparkling mineral water  the dissolved mineral contents is     mg l  the full analysis as well as the story about pellegrino you can read at their name sake website      
16,4.0,                       again  i feel bad for my mailman  i m really sorry  bro  i bet you hate me when you smile at me through the door everything was perfect with the contents  but the box arrived broken and disheveled  that s what i get for making my mailman deliver a box of water to my doorstep instead of carting it up the stairs my damn self      
17,1.0,                       i have always ordered the      fl oz bottles of pellegrino and love them but decided to try the smaller ones but that turned out to be a huge mistake i received the product and when i opened the box  there was a very strong odor of rubber  i assumed that it was the packaging and that it would go away but it didn t  i decided to pour it into a glass instead but realized that the odor was in the water as well i hope nobody else goes through the same thing because it leaves a smell on your hands from even touching the bottles and drinking it made me feel disgusted      
18,5.0,                       san pellegrino for a while now has been a really liked brand of seltzer water for people  companies  and restaurants alike  this is a brand that you frequently see being served to you if you go to fancy places and ask for bottled seltzer water  the taste is well appreciated by many butt here is where i disagree  i really think that there are other brands out there that would be much more preferable to san pellegrino  i think that the taste of san pellegrino is a bit off and taste too filled with minerals or something  i still have a few bottles left of the case i bought just sitting here in the home      
19,5.0,                       really like this sparkling water   it is a crisp  unsweetened mineral water which quenches my thirst here in hot texas   so nice to get away from sugar and artificial sweeteners  plastic bottles are big      
20,3.0,                       the water tastes fine  with adequate sparkle  and i like these small  lightweight plastic bottles for carrying around or lifting to drink from at night   they are also easier to position in a crowded fridge i have ordered this water many times in the last couple years  my main criticism is that the tops are getting increasingly difficult to open   i typically have to get a tool   a rubber dish glove  or something that will give me better grip and traction   to get the bottles to open  and then i still strain and grunt  even a big strong man has trouble  it takes away some of the pleasure of the refreshment when it is a battle to get into it   i have not had this problem with other sparkling waters  i am now negatively conditioned to associate opening a bottle with hand pain and struggle      
21,5.0,                       this water is what healthy people should be drinking  supplements can be dissolved in this water thanks to carbonation  which makes minerals available to cells  water analysis is available from the manufacturer online  and isn t polluted with fluoride like most bottled waters  we do wish it was still available in glass bottles  but the plastic is bpa free  anyone working in a water treatment plant knows how toxic  purified  water can be  and manufactures don t have to supply information on where their water is bottled  no toilet paper fragments  discarded medications  chemicals or toxic heavy metals in this water  very pleased with this product  and glad italy has good free flowing water to share  that won t be the case forever      
22,5.0,                       i love san pellegrino sparkling water   i drank lots of sparkling water when i lived in italy    years ago   i started drinking sparkling mineral water again a few years ago for the mineral replacement  to help prevent migraines   i also like that i feel like i m drinking champagne at work  if i bring a pellegrino   lol anyway  i have ordered this case a few times now  because it s a good price and i hate going to the grocery store and seeing all the shelves cleared out   so thank you for having this available the only thing is the labels are sometimes sticky  which isn t a big deal bc i m only interested what s inside    but perhaps that s why they are at a good deal   anyway  will probably buy more      
23,5.0,                       i have been drinking san pellegrino for years and as i get older it s been harder dragging it home from the store  the price on amazon didn t vary very much from what i was paying in the store so it has been ordering it from amazon lately  i haven t been disappointed  it is the exact same quality i expect  i love the larger bottle and it stays bubbly after i reclose it  this is the second or third time that i ve ordered it and the first time that i had any problem with the packaging  the outer box came slightly damaged and because of that the inner packaging also was slightly damaged  luckily it didn t affect any of the product and i can t blame san pellegrino  it s entirely the shippers fault      
24,3.0,                       many years ago  i would pellegrino water as a special treat   open the bottle and a grand taste that was refreshing  i didn t always buy it as i felt to drink it steadily would stop the enjoyment a once in awhile experience  it and a drink called lilette  from france were to be enjoyed as a special drink  today i bought a    pack of    oz bottles and refrigerated a few to be ready for my meal  well  talk about what s happening in his new world where the customer is  no longer  right  products being offered now have less and cost double  and worst of all it s not the same as the orignal  on tasting what my expectations to be  i was completely broken hearted    nothing  nothing no taste        
25,5.0,                       in my mind san pelligrino is the  just right  option out of what i consider the  big    of sparkling water  san pelligrino  topo chico  and perrier  perrier isn t effervescent enough and topo chico seems to be almost like minor assault to me  san pelligrino on the other hand is just the right effervescence for me  they come in a variety of flavors but artificially acquired fruit flavors always seems to be just a little bit disconcerting to me  i prefer the plain one and would recommend to anyone who is underwhelmed by perrier or overwhelmed by topo chico      
26,5.0,                       i absolutely love this water  and i m subscribed  too however   of concern to me that on this lashipp that was the bottle that i ve uploaded a picture of first time ever  i ve a bottle     filled  at best  still sealed and not leaking  odd just wanted someone to know        
27,5.0,                       the best sparkling water europe has to offer   delivered to my verandah free of charge and    dollars cheaper than sam s club  i am old and not as sturdy as i used to be so i love being pampered by amazon and total wine and more  they bring my single malt scotch and other beverages to make me forget how old i am  to my verandah  life is good      
28,1.0,                       product  arrived in good condition with intact packaging   nothing seemed awry until i popped open my first bottle   it didn t fizz when the seal on the cap was broken   product is flat   i wish i could return it to amazon  but i already threw away the packaging      
29,1.0,                       i thought that all the reviews about these being slightly on the flat side were just people ordering from non amazon fulfilled sources  i was wrong  i ordered   boxes of these things  and they were much flatter than you d buy in the store  how much more flat i ll explain it this way  you know how you usually have to be careful opening pellegrino  and other carbonated beverages  because they can overflow  no worries on these  you can give them a quick open  they ll fizz a little  but won t even come remotely near the top  this has been the case on most of my bottles thus far honestly  i d say if you must order through amazon  and you really mind the potential flatness    get  la croix  it comes in a can  so it s going to keep it s carbonation  it has the same zero sugar zero anything properties of pellegrino  and hey have nice essence versions      
30,5.0,                       i m from germany and was raised on sparkling mineral water  i m so glad i can get the san pellegrino mineral water at amazon because i would miss sparkling mineral water dearly  i drink it as is or mix it with juice or with powdered drink mixes  it is wonderful  healthy  and refreshing      
31,5.0,                       we ve been buying this mineral water for a while now and we love it  i am from germany and we trink a lot of mineral water there so i can tell pretty well when a mineral water is of great quality  this one really is  it is also always delivered very quickly and packaged very well  we will stick with this one for sure  great taste  great quality      
32,5.0,                       i am addicted to these now  don t know why  i am trying new things because of the you know what  i tried hard seltzer and loved it but wanted to be able to drink it all day  so i bought this on a whim  didn t expect them to be so huge but also didn t expect to go through one in like   minutes some days  it has health benefits too  some calcium and it fills you up so you eat less  i ve lost    pounds due to this and a combination of other things such as buffets being closed  exercising more etc      
33,1.0,                       updated my review and changed my star   so i have been buying peligrino from amazon since last year   and i have always paid lessaround        now it s over        plus  there is zero reason for this and you should adjust the prices  i only drink pellegrino  was super excited to see that you can write cases of water delivered to your door    i felt the taste was off different from the store bought  so far one was flat  updated   i ve ordered severaltimes and thank you for delivering today       
34,5.0,                       after living in europe for   years where mineral water is more available than sunlight  this is the closest product i ve been able to find within a somewhat decent price point  perrier gets a higher rating because people don t even enjoy the mineral taste  this won t be as bubbly as perrier either  but if you re looking to actually drink your water in relatively short order like me  this isn t a problem  not to mention  this has way more minerals than perrier  which does a body good      
35,1.0,                       this is not a negative review but a caution  despite complaints to amazon  product continues to arrive in a single box when ordered by   units  it is extremely heavy and bulky to anyone handling and a risk to bodily harm  i personally now am discontinuing future shipments      
36,5.0,                       kind of disappointed  i love s pellegrino sparkling mineral water  but this time it came in as is in the original manufacturer box and the box was falling apart  the manufacturer box has perforation at the bottom seems  so i don t think it s wise to mail it out without placing it in another box  i could not even lift it off the ground by the door as the bottom of the box was breaking  i wish it was packed in another box      
37,2.0,                       purchased   cases as a deal of the day   great price  but the reviews were so so  predominately related to lack of carbonation  i have finished     bottles and indeed the first case and the bottles from the second case are flat   barely any bubbles    something is wrong     if you are a fan of pellegrino  would purchase elsewhere until they figure out what is wrong      
38,5.0,                       i love everything about s pellegrino but the price fluctuates strangely on amazon  one day it will be a decent price and then the next it will be twenty bucks more  i just don t understand that  i m always on the lookout for the price i can live with      
39,5.0,                       i get those delivered monthly  thanks to amazon and the ups guy who climbs up the stairs to my second story apartment to deliver the heavy box   i use them everywhere  i take them to my personal training sessions   my medically trained personal trainer said that i do not need electrolyte drinks unless there is extreme exertion  and in one hour of training  there is not such exertion  so mineral water is just fine  and it tastes better   i take it to the korean spa i go to because i need to replenish the fluids lost during the time in hot sauna  steam room  etc   and these bottles are plastic  so they are allowed  unlike glass bottles  i always have a stash in the car  both to sip when i am driving and to have on me if i stop by for cheap eat in food such as chipotle   this way i do not have to buy juice from them  which saves money and reduces my sugar intake  the taste is just right  and the packaging is just right last but not least   it tastes great flat  if i leave an unfinished bottle on my dinner table overnight  next morning it is flat  but still very tasty also  it tastes great both cold and at room temperature love the product and love the convenience of the regular delivery      
40,5.0,                       i tried different mineral waters  this one is the best  il has peasant flavor  co  and lots of minerals  it helps me a lot to stay hydrated during my    hour work shift  besides  the price is very reasonable  unfortunately  most people prefer drinking soda in this country   this mineral water is much healthier choice      
41,5.0,                       i had to stop the auto shipment on this because we have too much in reserve   so much that i started bringing a case to very small gatherings just to give away   having the bottles on hand for impromptu visits  dinner parties  and social gatherings met the need  but now with social distancing  we have a serious backlog   if the need ever arises again  that this is a household must have  i ll gladly purchase again      
42,5.0,                       san pellegrino has been my favorite mineral water for     years  i rarely buy it because it s expensive  so i was thrilled to find this at such a good price  i originally bought the    oz bottles  but i didn t like having that much plastic  i know  this bottle is plastic  too  but slightly less than two small bottles      
43,5.0,                       if you wait long enough you can catch these on super sale and rock them for around    cents a throw  with that in mind this is the best sparkling water for the money period  throw in som truelime and truelemon for zero carb zero sugar sprite and you re rocking the diet  enjoy      
44,5.0,                       i really like the sparkling water  the carbonation is not too strong like some others  it is just perfect  it has a smooth clean taste to it and i will continue to order it  i highly recommend the sparkling water      
45,5.0,                       these were actually a very good product and price that i paid was actually not that bad they are the sodas but they re like so good i ve been trying to get away from soda and trying to get away from like the top sodas mainly because it s causing my tongue to numb but other than that these were really really cool they tasted good they were super bubbly and if you add juice to them very good i will be definitely buying these again thank you for having these in stock very cool     
46,5.0,                       we use to buy      cases monthly from sam s wholesale  not any longer when we inquired about why there was no san pellegrino at the front desk they directed us to a manager the local sam s wholesale club manager said   we will no longer be carrying the san pellegrino product due to the need for floor space for the more popular  healthier  flavored  waters    sports drinks   healthy    ah  you mean sugary drinks  with the auto delivery by amazon it comes right to our front door no hassle  no lifting   loading in   out of cart  car then into house  we are able to have it delivered on or before set delivery date  if we still have some we can even put a hold on it till the next delivery date  amazon is flexible  we have found the less we need to go to the store the less we spend on impulse buys also  we buy what is needed   that s it      
47,5.0,                       by far my favorite carbonated water  the carbonation is very slight with a slight mineral taste  if you light lots of carbonation  this is not the drink for you  hard to describe the taste but it s just not as pronounce as perrier and of course nothing like the flavored water  it s not cheap  but the price isn t bad for a pack of        
48,5.0,                       the only complaint i have is the packaging  in this day of trying to be aware of waste  why package one perfectly fine box into another  can t you just put an amazon label on the pelegrino box other than that  i love this product  it s delicious and forced me drink water which i never did before         
49,1.0,                       i ve ordered   cases of this water within the last couple months  i noticed my skin started to get itchy  especially in the afternoon after i got home from work and i could not figure out what was causing it  then i realized the only change i ve made in my drinking and eating habits was drinking a lot of this mineral water in the afternoon  i looked online and there are other people that have used the same reaction with this specific brand  anyways after i stopped drinking this the itching went away  it wasn t just a little itching either  i was itching from head to toe and would literally scratch myself for hours and i was going crazy  i m glad i figured it out but now i have all this mineral water i m not using      
50,5.0,                       i have been enjoying pellegrino sparkling mineral water since the      s i generally drink   large size glass  not plastic  bottles per day every day     days hassle free delivery was such a pleasure and i would continue buying if the cases were the lass bottles as the plastic bottles are unhealthy unless bha free which isn t stated       
51,5.0,                       this is one of our favorite sparking waters  which we have with all meals i do wish the glass bottles were delivered  but alas  it does not appear to be possible at this time      
52,5.0,                       if your mouth is so numb you can t taste the difference between socal tap water  filtered water and natural spring water  get a soda  if you can tell the difference  this water is about as good as you re going to get unless you go to frisco and get you some hetch hetchy water from a drowned natural wonder      
53,1.0,                       i have been ordering this product for months  this particular batch was dangerous  something caustic was inside of this sealed bottle was poisonous  buyer beware        
54,3.0,                       i am sure the water is good  but most bottles had leak because the box was placed upside down in the packing box one bottle was completely empty and all the rest had some leakage   i tested a few of these and the water was still effervescent  so i believe it is drinkable   i will not be ordering again      
55,5.0,                       i love s  pellegrino  just the right amount of bubbles and crispiness  flavor wise is not bitter like most sparkling waters  price is excellent as well and to get it delivered it at my door step is a plus      
56,5.0,                       great great great price  it helps me to stop drinking soda  after substitute coke with this for a while  now coke is away toooo sweet for me  i love how it helps me to be healthier also  it brings your dinner to another level especially when you have guests coming  just add some lime if you have it  woohoo  now you are in a   stars hotel restaurant         
57,5.0,                       arrived intact due to excellent packaging  not fizzy explosive when we opened despite shipping  the kids love it when i add flavored organic stevia to an entire bottle   chocolate  cola  cream  orange   lemon or root beer to name a few      mom gets kudos for  healthy soda         
58,5.0,                       got this on scheduled deliveries as an alternative to my first love  coke  very good carbonation  was hesitant due to the plastic containers but my county stopped recycling glass but still recycles plastic  so at least they re recyclable and helps me stay hydrated     
59,2.0,                       i drink this product all the time but in glass bottles  this taste pretty awful almost like a weak alka seltzer  fizzes for a while but not as  effervescent as the glass bottles  i really disked these plastic bottles   if you like partially flat sparkling water then this will be a great choice      
60,5.0,                       i come home from the gym thirsty for something with flavor but i don t want to drink soda because of the calories  s pellegrino really helps because i can chug a whole bottle and not worry about the calories  i has a very good flavor and the fizziness isn t so strong that you can t chug a bottle      
61,5.0,                       i love this water and buy it all the time  today s shipment  however  came all banged up  packaging was a total disaster  looked like it had survived a war  i hope i can disinfect it before opening it addendum  finally opened the disgusting box   bottles were undamaged  but there were only    of them  not         
62,5.0,                       very happy with this product   i have been a subscribe   save customer for this product for almost a year  it saves me almost    a case  x   compared to sam s club pricing i havent experienced the  flat  water that i have seen in some of the reviews  it is the same quality every time  and the same as i can buy at the grocery store       
63,4.0,                       it s true what they say  pellegrino does have the correct amount of carbonation  it is not so much that it stings your nose  but it is not so little that it tastes flat  the taste is pretty good thanks to the minerals in the water  pellegrino is my first choice for sparkling water when i go out to eat      
64,5.0,                       arrived safely in a large box surrounded with paper wrap in another box  all bottles sealed  of course  delicious  cheers  will definitely purchase again btw  enjoy chilled  i put a bottle in the freezer  long enough to get the plastic bottle cold   the bubbles are smaller  compared to drinking the pellegrino at room temp and the taste is crisp and refreshing  wayyy better than drinking it drinking it at room temp  enjoy      
65,1.0,                       had a terrible gasoline odor  first i thought its a packing box  but then each bottle had a strong odor and weird taste very unusual  because  consuming this brand for years just was getting at the grocery stores      
66,5.0,                       i ve always preferred this to that french sparkling water  the taste is crisper  cleaner and goes better with lunch or dinner  moreover it is more sensibly packaged in a box versus the mess i got with the french alternative s shrink wrapping      
67,5.0,                       i love st pellegrino but is to expensive nowi bought a    case on august for    and i went back to order today and it s     the price doubled  i don t know who raises the prices but it is happening to frecuente with many products     
68,1.0,                       plastic bottles    ugggh  for a natural product  the plastic bottle completely detracts from the   experience  of drinking pellegrino  many people are opting for less plastic  not more  this very disappointing  plus  the flavor is just  meh  and flat in plastic container  canceling subscription now      
69,5.0,                       i have dabbled in everything from lacroix to perrier  and this takes the cake  i set up a subscription for every month or so and it is such a pleasant surprise to have this arrive  the bonus is that you don t have to lug it from the store when you have prime  do yourself a favor and order a case      
70,5.0,                       usually the product arrives in a case packed in a box  this time the packaging was a garbage bag in a box and there were only    not twelve  of course this lowers the value for money since it was the same price  what happened      
71,2.0,                       arrived on time checkexactly as described checkbut the carbonation is half of what it normally is  i regularly drink pellegrino so i have a clear understanding of what to expect is plastic different  would transporting and constant shaking or moving affect this  i have never experienced this  i dont want to return a box of water minus   bottles      what or who should i contact      
72,1.0,                       this can be an expensive product  thought i was getting a good deal     no fizz  just like regular bottled water  with no  sparkling   opened   bottles so far and i m beginning to wonder if the rest will be like this  going back to costco      
73,5.0,                       it is a good deal  since in closest walgreen s i recently paid over    or    for bottle  saved that way around         bottles would cost me around    dollars with taxes and bottle deposits  delivery by ups was just   day delayed but for our reality in ny today it s ok  update after reading other reviews  water itself is absolutely fine  not flat      
74,3.0,                       the box was busted up and the product was flat  i have never been able to guzzle pellegrino water or any seltzer type water  you can tell this product has been sitting around for a very long time before being sold      
75,5.0,                       this has a clean taste to it with just the right amount of carbonation for me  i often use it to add a bit  zing  to a glass of lemonade or juice  i am very pleased with it even though it is a bit on the expensive side      
76,4.0,                       i must say that i love the product  wee buy a    bottle case a month but it has not been the first time that packaging comes broken  outside and inside last delivery it came with almost   bottles dirty and inside box broken     
77,5.0,                       i keep a stack of these loaded in my fridge at all times   it s a great alternative when you are tired of plain old water   no added ingredients  no sugar but still tastes sweet and carbonated   definitely buy      
78,5.0,                       thank you for the excellent service and fast shipping  i love the water and drink a lot of it  you ship it safe and i have never had any problems or a flat bottle water  i will be a customer for life with amazon  many thanks al b     
79,2.0,                       we didn t think this product would go flat like soda but evidently it does   this is just regular plain water with no sparkle   maybe that was why it was cheaper than regular price   too cumbersome to return as we took apart and put away before opening one of the bottles   continued use shows that all of them are flat   check your product before tossing the container      
80,1.0,                       my bottles smell like gasoline and the water has a weird taste which gives me a slight headache when i drink it   tried a few bottles and they are the same   weird b c i have been drinking this water for years and it is my absolute favorite   earlier orders were fine but this one was bad      
81,5.0,                       i love this sparkling water   i had subscribed  in amazon pantry  and was receiving   cases monthly  but for some unknown reason it stopped   now i search for it on amazon and the price has doubled   i so to sams club and they are always out of stock   i guess i m going to have to find me a new favorite beverage        
82,1.0,                       every single bottle in the case is flat and does not taste like pellegrino   i ve drank it for many years  have it every day and this is not pellegrino        
83,2.0,                       the flavor wasn t the same  i don t understand why  it tasted diluted  probably old not sure but it wasn t the same as to when i go and buy directly from store  i didn t even bother returning because of the whole covid    pandemic     
84,5.0,                       love it they delivered with enough expiring dates to drinks     when they delivered the boxes was ripped  guess because of rain  other wise there is no complaints at all  satisfied     
85,5.0,                       this is the perfect substitute for an after dinner alcoholic drink  it s fresh  it cleanses your palate  it has a zing of taste  and it quenches a bit of thirst  we don t drink alcohol so this is the perfect beverage for us to grab for special occasions      
86,1.0,                       product is great but it continues to be packaged poorly   packer continues to rip boxes  boxing is needed for proper storage   this forces bottles to be individually removed for safe transportation   as is this is an accident waiting to happen   this is  th shipment received in same manner     
87,5.0,                       my mom tried this on a cruise and fell in love with it  so i ordered her a case   she says it s the best bubbly water and loves it   great to have this shipped direct to home    not in love w the plastic bottles  but the price is great  for when i purchased it  might have gone up by now        
88,3.0,                       in a world full of artificial sweeteners and energy drinks  san pellegrino is so fresh and a guilt free drink to enjoy  i would give this item a five star review but i would contend that it is a bit overpriced  at the grocery  i can get a one liter bottle for      so i would hope amazon will come out with a larger size  in addition  because of the dangers associated with plastic  i would love if they offered a glass option  that being said  my pellegrino arrived safely and right at my door and the bottles were convenient to pack on the go and fit in the fridge      
89,1.0,                       the  inner  plastic layer melted and bent   which worries me if it made my water unsafe to drink  it tastes different and do not have the same quality as the glass ones  i don t recommend this at all      
90,4.0,                       its good stuff  but the plastic bottles dont hold the flavor as well  next time i m only buying the glass bottles  i was shocked at how different it tastes from plastic  almost thought it was in my head but there s definitely a difference      
91,5.0,                       i get this every month because i love this water so much  it has a mineral taste to it that some people don t like  so if you haven t tried san pellegrino before  try some before you buy a whole case  i find it very refreshing when it s chilled      
92,1.0,                       i m not happy with the quality of this water  i don t like it      
93,5.0,                       i love this sparkling water  it is refreshing and soothing   pellegrino is  of course my  choice and my favorite of  all the sparkling waters  just the right amount of bubbles      
94,5.0,                       brings back fond memories of europe  soothes an upset stomach  compliments any meal  yummy to drink room temperature or chilled      
95,5.0,                       my favorite bottled water by far  the price has gone up this year  but it s still just over a dollar per bottled  seller was prompt with shipping and delivery  will be buying more      
96,1.0,                         of our boxes of water are missing and the ones that did arrive   of the box had the plastic inner liner spectated from the rest of the bottle  not sure if it s safe to drink      
97,5.0,                       i have to say this is the most refreshing and best tasting mineral water  i am glad to find this on line at a very good price during the covid pandemic  my local stores haven t had it in stock for weeks      
98,5.0,                       i love sparkling water for when i get bored of flat water  have nice guests over  also for when i ever have a stomach ache these are just good to stock up on  they last forever and getting the large pack really comes in handy for when they re needed i can now ask my guests  if they d prefer sparkling or flat water  so fancy        
99,3.0,                       got a open   pk with a pre drunk open bottle      one of bottle missing in a unwrappedmanufacturing   i know it gets hot edit warehouse but i still find this unacceptable yet great water at a great price      
100,3.0,                       nice product but downgraded due to the fluctuating pricing    one week it is      another week is      and now this week  may   th   it is nearly     great value at      not so much at          
101,5.0,                       i used to drink way too much soda  i liked the carbonation more than anything  i switched to pelligrino and love it  i drink it by itself sometimes but i also add sugar free flavored syrups to it   so good   vanilla makes it taste like cream soda  it s also good with just a little lime      
102,4.0,                       i ve been drinking these for about   months and i am overall satisfied  the only complaint i really have is that the carbonation does not last very long  so if you are enjoying the water over a period of more than    or so minutes it starts to taste pretty bad until it becomes intolerable  it d be nice to have a smaller bottle size as an option      
103,5.0,                       this is my favorite sparkling water  thirst quenching and it s tastes great  and zero calories  you ll love it      
104,5.0,                       i love the taste of pellegrino water   it s convenient to get it a case at a time   the price is right  and it s delivered to my doorstep   what could be better      
105,5.0,                       not only flavor but the style of carbonation  small intense bubbles  not large gentle bubbles as found in soda water  make this a daily staple in our household      
106,3.0,                       a great tasting products as i have ordered many cased in the past  however   the price has gone up       in less than a year  am not sure what s going on with sparkling water market but all brands seem to have risen by a large   this past year             
107,5.0,                       i am so impressed by the speed of delivery and price in comparison to our grocery here in the mountains   where prices have risen like crazy these past weeks   i will definitely order again      
108,5.0,                       so glad i decided to purchase a case of these  i live on the  rd floor apartment building and carrying these up stairs isn t easy  all bottles were carbonated and none were flat  very easy to unpack the box it comes in and the best price i ve seen these per bottle  this will be a weekly purchase now      
109,3.0,                       i always drink s  pellegrino but into this box there were a strange bottle  the first on the left with less water compared to the others  with a bottle cap that seems damaged        
110,5.0,                       i really love the flavor and fizz of this product  i feel like sparkling water is an acquired taste  and this certainly has been the best quality of plain sparkling water that i have tried  i love it      
111,5.0,                       i drink it by the gallon   probably  x a day   it is satisfying and consistently delicious add some fresh lime juice      
112,5.0,                       pelegrino it s really good sparkling water and i typically don t purchase it because it s usually more expensive than some of the others but they had a super deal on here and i will enjoy every last drop      
113,5.0,                       refreshing and delicious   i much prefer this over perrier   i m not fond of the plastic bottles  however   everything in glass tastes better and colder      
114,5.0,                       in the heat of the summer  i chug this stuff  the mineral water somehow does what gaterade is supposed to do without suger etc   good for your guts  less salty tasting than perrier  superior      
115,2.0,                       the whole reason i got this was because i thought the   liter bottles were made of glass  not plastic like at my local sam s  who is always sold out of these which i why i tried ordering them on amazon   this detail needs to be written in the description but i dont see it anywhere      
116,1.0,                       bought this before but this batch tastes bad   i ended up throwing it out   i guess i need to buy this from a local store  disappointing     
117,2.0,                       i specifically ordered these because they appeared to be glass  they are plastic   which i hate drinking sparkling water from it changes the taste  ugh     
118,5.0,                       i have been receiving this water for quite awhile and this is the very first time the packaging fits the bulk and weight   thank you for a job well done   the ups man at one time complained to amazon about the poor packaging now for the next thing   ups delivered my water to my apt door  i live on the  th floor  the usps will not take the elevator to deliver my water to me snow  sleet and rain and all bad weather but not the elevator   the boxes are heavy and i am    years old and loved having it delivered to my door      
119,5.0,                       i buy a case of these every other month to treat myself  i used to wait tables  and so the taste of pelligrino really has a hypnotic effect on me  i buy these for when i m stressed out and i forget to drink water  sometimes buying yourself fancy mineral water reminds yourself that you re worth it         
120,5.0,                       italians know their food  and i found no water to accompany a meal better than s pellegrino sparkling natural mineral water   i ve been a fan for several years and feel guilty not having shared sooner my delight with this product      
121,5.0,                       i ve never had any issues with quality of this sparkling water  nor shipping  it surprises me how quickly it arrives and always in perfect condition      
122,5.0,                       arrived today luckily a neighbor brought it up to me on a dolly very heavy     liter bottles    but worth  so worth the trouble      
123,5.0,                       we love this and even have it on auto delivery  i have price checked this in several places including costo and this price is by far the best  we look forward to our delivery each month      
124,5.0,                       i always keep a stock of pellegrina in the house   convenient to buy in bulk   i think it s the best tasting fizzy water   i mix with cordials to make interesting sodas like bottle green s lemongrass and ginger cordial from the uk   better than soda      
125,1.0,                       have been drinking this water for years and years  this is now the second case where half of the bottles are semi flat  some have a bad soap like smell  a sickly taste  and the rest have absolutely no carbonation whatsoever      
126,5.0,                       best sparkling water in the world     
127,5.0,                       i was getting the glass bottle at a local store but the cost was more than double and a smaller amount of product   i use very little plastic so i m not overly concerned about that vs  paying a major premium for glass      
128,5.0,                       i started drinking this in the    s growing up in germany  i have been drinking this every since  love the taste and love just the right amount the bubbles it has  not over powering like some      
129,5.0,                       it is good to be able to get pellegrino in bulk like this   however this last batch was in a box that was falling apart and taped back together   all prior orders were ok      
130,1.0,                       there were   cases of large bottles of the water in a huge box   the individual boxes were damaged inside and the bottles were sideways in the boxes  the large box was too big for the two cases so they were moving around inside   i do not know who is doing the delivery but they need a talking to   we were lucky the bottles did not seem damaged            we ve kept this up during the pandemic  hoping it would improve  it has not  we are ending the deliveries now       
131,3.0,                       i am doing keto and wanted to try using carbonated water to make drinks more interesting so i tried this one for     i got a lot of water but it didn t taste very good that was the bad side to it it has good carbonation though and i did like that if it just didn t taste bad i would like it a lot more in probably give it five stars     
132,5.0,                       if you drink pellegrino this is a deal  it s cheaper than costco even on sale and with prime it s delivered to your door free  it seems strange to buy bottled water online but it works     
133,5.0,                       i am trying to cut down on my soda addiction and this is helping me tremendously   bubbly water that tastes great   i would recommend      
134,2.0,                       no bubbles whatsoever  very disappointed to say the least      
135,1.0,                       the description  and what i thought i was paying for   says       fl oz   that s a big difference  amazon needs to make sure they are describing what they are selling      
136,5.0,                       what s not to love  great  great  refreshing cheap but delish  glass of ice  splash of lime  fill with cold perigrino and your in heaven dont need scotch      
137,5.0,                       love this stuff and like to have a case of it around  only drawback is the delivery guy has to lug it upstairs to my front door  which doesn t seem fair to him  but it saves me from having to lug it and i m getting too old for that      
138,5.0,                       we like this so much better than carbonated water  it may be a little more expensive  but we like the benefits of the minerals      
139,4.0,                       i guess i didnt pay enough attention when i first ordered this to see that these arent the grab n go size bottles they re the big ones  its great having them shipped to my door and not having to lug them all home myself though  now i order these large bottle all of the time     
140,4.0,                       although i miss appolonia and some of the other mineral waters that have become difficult to find here  pellegrino is a reasonable substitute  i ve been drinking it for a few years  i do wish it had a lower sodium content  otherwise it s fine      
141,5.0,                       first off  let me say that i m a huge fan of pellegrino  i had been purchasing it by the    pk at my local grocer for years  via amazon i save a significant by purchasing the    pk and it arrives at my front door in a day or two   i typically get        pk s at a time and will continue to do so as long as the price remains as it is  the bottle size        oz is perfect      
142,5.0,                       this is by far the best sparkling water  smooth going down  satisfying going down  no aftertaste  no sugar addiction  a great product for a fair price  about the same price as big box but delivered  perfect      
143,5.0,                       i really like it   sometimes just water gets boring     this isn t overly carbonated  and isn t flavored  it is very refreshing   in the summer i chill it  but room temp is fine   it s increased my husband s water intake  which is a plus   we ll choose this instead of sodas when we re thirsty      
144,5.0,                       i love pellegrino mineral water and drink a liter a day   however  i m not crazy about the plastic bottles   i realize glass would affect shipping   weight and breakage   one of my cases came broken  so if the bottles were glass  it would have been a disaster if you d go back to ups though  that wouldn t have happened      
145,3.0,                       basically it was bottled water without any fizz    very dissapointed   i ve had this water in restaurants and it was not flat   waste of money      
146,1.0,                       the numerous reviews about the s  pellegrino purchased from amazon being  flat  is sad  but absolutely true  keep making your purchase of this product from the big box membership store  and lugging it all the way back home  it s worth it      
147,5.0,                       there were some concerns when i read about this water containing uranium which is toxic to the human body but there are minuscule amounts you d have to drink     bottles a day to even notice any impact  has an excellent taste and has the right amount of gas      
148,4.0,                       i have had this bottle for a month now  and the carbonation is still in the bottle  very tasty and healthy to drink for a family dinner  the taste is like normal water  but this water obtains a lot of good minerals that regular water does not have  the carbonation in this water keeps the minerals inside the bottle which is good      
149,5.0,                       great deal  i had missed drinking sparkling water at every meal like i did at home in europe  and sparkling water in the us can be super expensive  this is a great price for a great brand and the bottles are the right size to slip into your bag      
150,1.0,                       this sparkling water is my favorite  however  the whole box of this water from amazon does not have any sparkles at all  it tastes like water  don t buy here      
151,5.0,                       half years ago  when i feel thirsty  i will go straight to soda or coffee  now i realized health is the most important  but i don t like flat water  then pellegrino save me  it has strong bubbles and tastes good      
152,3.0,                       the fizz is not as strong as it once was  could be the plastic bottles or held to long and fizz evaporated      
153,5.0,                       we love the san pelligrino water  it s tasty and has just enough carbonation   i also like the plastic biyyles over the glass and it s offered at a great price      
154,5.0,                       i thought these were glass bottles   they re plastic   it s ok but i prefer glass and thought that s what i ordered    still happy to have it      
155,5.0,                       we buy cases upon cases of this to ensure we always have plenty on hand   it s the perfect beverage whether iced with fresh lemon or lime or straight out of the bottle      
156,5.0,                       great buy for the cost  better than the prices at the big box stores  very refreshing and better than soda      
157,3.0,                       i usually get this in the glass bottles but thought i would try these  the fizz is a little flat  the taste not as bright  i m going back to glass      
158,3.0,                       this shipment was flat and in plastic bottles  arrived in good time but very little flavor  get glass bottles      
159,3.0,                       i order this water     times a month  over the past   months  nearly half of them have had issues with being flat or near flat  something has seriously gone wrong with qc on this product      
160,5.0,                       bottle broken packaging damaged  return not possible     
161,5.0,                       we enjoy san pelligrino sparkling water  and it was so convenient to order from amazon  it was delivered in a couple of days      
162,5.0,                       the taste is awesome   it has to be good when my  yr old will ask for it when she wants water pleasantly refreshing    i prefer having plastic bottles over glass    don t have to worry that the lil one will drop it while drinking      
163,5.0,                       i mix   bottle of this great mineral water with one can grapefruit flavored water  perfect      
164,5.0,                       these arrived unscathed  fresh  and to my door  can t beat that winning combo      
165,5.0,                       it is an excellent thirst quencher and healthy  good value from a fresh water lake in italy     
166,5.0,                       i like buying my pellegrino from amazon because it saves me from having to haul it home myself   purchasing it from amazon saves me time and it is the best value for the bottle  i recommend to all my friends that they get their sparkling water like this      
167,3.0,                       water is great  but the packing was horrible  all the bottles were loose and rolling around on top of other purchases in same box  i bought this a  nd time and it was packaged much better with no problems      
168,5.0,                       it s great having this classic at your fingertips  good plain or as an accompnimen screw top plastic bottles are convenient      
169,5.0,                       our local  well known  grocery store it s      higher per bottle  only if they go on sale for    a bottle does it ever beat this price and it s delivered right to our door  love san pel  tastes so good      
170,5.0,                       package was intact  water tastes the same as store bought  the last case of perrier that i ordered from amazon seems to be knockoff  glad i give s p  a chance      
171,5.0,                       i bought these when they were only about    bucks  it s such a great deal when their on sale  s pellegrino is the most delicious sparkling water      
172,5.0,                       fantastic carbonated water   crisp and refreshing  great tasting   i used to buy perrier but they re almost addicting so i read the ingredients of perrier and they include  natural flavors    it s probably nicotine or crack   san pellegrino is where it s at      crisp  clean and refreshing   exactly what i m looking for      
173,5.0,                       if you like carbonated mineral water that is bubbly and has a sharp feeling in the mouth  you may like pellegrino  i also like gerolsteiner      
174,5.0,                       i got these at an amazing price  san pellegrino s are the best  especially if you are on a diet or doing low sugar  they have a great natural flavor      
175,5.0,                       i like the flavor of this product very much  the larger bottles are great for keeping in the fridge and having a cold drink of water anytime you like i have been on the auto renew program now for three deliveries  the shipper ships very promptly  my only drawback is the carrier  my package will show up late by a day or two and usually heavily damaged      
176,5.0,                       i like the size  and is really affordable out of all the sparkling waters the s  pellegrino is my favorite     
177,5.0,                       excellent   very tasty  actually contains the minerals and good value thru amazon      
178,5.0,                       i didn t realize i could buy this by the case from prime pantry  i m always waiting for a sale  no fancy flavor or after taste  i keep this in the frig all summer  more satisfying that plain water in the summer      
179,5.0,                       great price  along with a great refreshing pure water drink   stay hydrated      
180,5.0,                       i get it delivered monthly to my home for cheaper than the supermarket  what a deal      
181,5.0,                       easy to order  arrived quickly  great price   though i can t in good conscience order again  amazon service was a  and i think this is the  tastiest  sparkling water on the market today      
182,5.0,                       we used to buy the larger bottle  but now this is good size to share with my husband for dinner time we love its flavor and the size of this item is perfect for us      
183,4.0,                       i found myself buying a cup of this for only    at a star wars concert i went to one night  it made me a fan of the drink  bought this case a week afterwards  went through it faster than i should have  but i just liked it so much  it s a nice classy drink to have  only problem was the case i got it in  the side was smashed in a bit  so when i opened up the packaging box  all bottles     all accounted for  just fell outside sideways  awkwardly      
184,5.0,                       the best sparkling water hands down     
185,5.0,                       the only one that is comparable is the french  badoit  which is not available on amazon     
186,5.0,                       san pellegrino has long been one of my favorite sparkling waters   i love its medium minerality and soft bubbles      
187,5.0,                       this is the best mineral water in my opinion  it goes great with dinner if you want slight carbonation and a little more zest than plain water      
188,5.0,                       was surprised by the plastic bottles but am happy for the bubbles      
189,5.0,                       we usually purchase this water at stores  during these trying times it s great to buy it at amazon      
190,4.0,                       love our monthly shipment but what i despise is that the box is packed in a box and then another box       boxes  what a waste      
191,5.0,                       i hate most mineral waters but his one i love  it s not as mineraly tasting as some others and has a good bit of fizz  love that i don t have to lug cases of this home with me      
192,5.0,                       excellent for those of us not drinking wine or going af  i drink mine with a chunk of organic lemon in it for flavor  delicious      
193,5.0,                       i really do love this water  so clean  crisp  and the taste absolutely a treat      
194,5.0,                       i love this stuff  goes well on my keto way of eating and satisfies my thirst  best on the market      
195,5.0,                       arrived on time  great packaging  reliability of product quality     
196,5.0,                       delicious and crisp and refreshing great flavor for mineral water      
197,5.0,                       i am very happy with this purchase as expected  i was missing my trusty la croix  since it s apparently no longer available in prime pantry and my many searches took me to this pack of pellegrino  all in all  it s great that these are available with prime shipping and that there are so many bottles  there was even a coupon when i purchased mine  do i miss the single serving cans  i do  but again what a deal  i will re purchase as long as the price is reasonable      
198,4.0,                       i drink this when my stomach is upset  i works great for me      
199,2.0,                       love pellegrino but not in plastic bottles  it retaines the gas and i far too fizzy   no regular pelegrino drinker that are used to the great taste from glass bottles won t even drink out of their plastic bottles     
200,1.0,                       ordered delivered feb           taste flat without gas as they were produced in june       don t buy the bigger bottle  version as they are less popular  very disappointed  hope i can get a refund or something      
201,5.0,                       what can i say  i love the water  every time we offer san pellegrino at home we have many takers the big bottles are great for parties and multiple guests  and the small bottles are great for a quick and refreshing individual drink      
202,3.0,                       i always have drank perrier and will continue as this mineral water is less carbonated and tasteless in my opinion      
203,2.0,                       boxes broken three bottles were broken boxes wrapped in plastic bags water leaking out     
204,1.0,                       i drink pelegrino all the time  usually from a glass bottle  but a plastic bottle is no excuse for the sparkling water being completely flat  which ruins the flavour  seems i m not the first one to experience this  maybe its a bad batch or something  but amazon should really sort this out  batch code is either          or nv           
205,5.0,                       i enjoy the product but have not usually purchased more than one or two bottles at a time due to its weight    glass  but with home delivery in a case its great  now i get it delivered right to my front door and can have it when i want      
206,5.0,                       big bottles  tastes great will buy again helps with my soda fix     
207,5.0,                       love pellegrino  and found this to be an excellent price for home delivery      
208,5.0,                       very good flavor  better than perier  and just the right amount of fizz      
209,5.0,                       i love this   i add it to my coffee when making iced coffee     
210,5.0,                       needed this for a dinner party  wish that the glass prices were the same as this price  but it worked      
211,3.0,                       just depend on reviews and made orders  and i did drink   that is not what i expect sparkling water overall  i didn t drink all      
212,2.0,                       a couple of bottles i received were damaged ie  leaking and or empty      
213,5.0,                       good value for money  it s cheaper here on amazon comparing with my local grocery store  great packaging when it arrived      
214,4.0,                       i really like this sparkling water because it s tasty and has some mineral content   makes me feel good about drinking water and getting my nutrients at the same time with no added chemicals      
215,5.0,                       everyone says i need to drink more water  so if i have to drink water  san pellegrino is the way to go  i love this water  the taste and flavor are wonderful  it is far better than that french brand  i found that i can cheat a little by adding a couple of squirts of my favorite flavor of sugar free crystal light liquid concentrate you can also find these large bottles at bj s and the regular size bottles at kroger for a much better price      
216,1.0,                       for some reason all of this order was flat  no bubbles  something mush have happened to it i won t order this on line any more      
217,5.0,                       super fizzy   litre size   what s not to love   screw top so you can reseal it   plastic bottles      
218,5.0,                       love the product   just wish amazon had not packed both        boxes into one bigger box   at least it was near the door and i could push the box inside before opening it      
219,5.0,                       what can i say  it s really d  n good sparkling water  goes perfect with dinner and it s also great on it s own  light  crisp taste lends itself to a variety of meals  and mineral water is already amazing  the only way to improve it is to add carbonation      
220,5.0,                       just received my s pellegrino sparkling mineral water    bottlesdelivery was great   value excellent    perfect size bottles

223,5.0,                       didn t like that the package was left in a parcel locker   not at my front door as used to be before  had to carry this heavy box      
224,5.0,                       best price i ve found for individual bottles      
225,5.0,                       i hate this product so much that i keep buying and drinking it  damn you pellegrino for being so tasty and keeping me hydrated at the same time  i could bathe in this if i could      
226,3.0,                       good price but taste comes little flat     
227,5.0,                       it s pellegrino  what else do you have to ask      
228,5.0,                       game changer  mineral water has increased my health in such a way that keeps me hydrated with the right electrolytes and taste so amazing  i m always excited to drink pellegrino when i wake up  my new routine      
229,5.0,                       good value   often hard to find locally       
230,3.0,                       entire order was flat and tasteless   may hav been die to proper storage but should not be happening with such frequency on amazon     
231,5.0,                       i quit drinking sugary soda years ago and perrier has been the best supplement for soda      
232,5.0,                       very refreshing  price is ok  deliveredto my door    not something i could easily carry   i order this monthly and always have one chilled to offer friends just dropping by and i love it     
233,5.0,                       great delivery nothing broken thank you     
234,4.0,                       didn t like the plastic bottles  i must not have read it thoroughly      
235,3.0,                       the quality is fine   just too expensive   it s only    cents a bottle  same size  but different brand and just as good  at the grocery store      
236,3.0,                       i drink s  pellegrino all the time but most of these bottles came out flat  carbonation is mostly gone   i also thought the bottle would be glass but they were plastic      
237,5.0,                       i love pelligrino because of the small bubbles  i drink more water so it s a win win     
238,5.0,                       nice to have bubbly water on hand   this is a good deal      
239,5.0,                       i love this stuff but when i went to buy more they nearly doubled in price     no thank you         
240,5.0,                       love this product  great value   it was becoming increasingly hard to find this at my local grocery   love having it in my pantry      
241,5.0,                       i love pelligrino  however  because the box is so heavy i requested it to be delivered to my door rather than the package lockers  it was not   i cannot carry such a heavy box  i will not be ordering it from amazon in the future       
242,5.0,                       quality you can expect  delivered to your door the large bottles are even more convenient

244,5.0,                       why serve common tap water at a gathering when you can substitute the flavor and sparkling presentation of san pellegrino      
245,5.0,                       packaged beautifully and safely it is a great tasting mineral water     
246,4.0,                       well  i have been drinking this for a long time  for the first time  i felt really strong bubble into my mouth  but it is okay when you get used to it  anyway  i like it      
247,5.0,                       i love san pellegrino  i m not reviewing the product necessarily because everyone has a different opinion about taste  smell  etc  and i buy and drink s  pellegrino anyway  but given that water is heavy to carry  i love the fact that i can order    large bottles of it and have it delivered quickly  saves me so many trips to the store      
248,4.0,                       nice if you like your water bubbly   helpful in hot weather  if you re building an emergency water supply or mixing drinks at your hhome bar      
249,5.0,                       i enjoy san pellegrino  especially when i m trying to avoid wine  or at least not drink too much when i m with friends  it makes drinking water a little more special and reminds me of being in italy  where i drank a lot of it

264,1.0,                       the product was not the problem   it was the damage to the packaging which resulted in bottles rolling all over the floor

276,5.0,                       pellegrino  what can you say mix with orange juice  lemon juice  chocolate syrup

279,5.0,                       so convenient   and the price is so good i stopped drinking seltzer and began ordering the healthier  pellegrino      
280,5.0,                       great seller  buying again  one case lasts forever bc i use one bottle to mix with my wine or occasionally grapefruit water or juice  love to add a little sparkle to break up my water intake      
281,5.0,                    me encanta   los encontr  y nos los dejare         
282,1.0,                       picture says it all  the last couple packages i ve gotten for these kinds of items have been completely mishandled  what s going on amazon      
283,4.0,                       is ok will buy sgain     
284,5.0,                       best sparkling water     
285,5.0,                       nothing better when you re hot and thirsty than a cold san pellegrino and the bottles are a good size and fit easily in my frig     
286,5.0,                       yay  convenient  yummy delivery  i do wish they used glass instead of plastic bottles  but perhaps it would be harder to find it for delivery that way      
287,5.0,                       drink for the sodium bicarbonate content post mountain bike workouts and lactic acid build up  seems to help however not a double blind placebo controlled study  price check here vs costco     
288,5.0,                       what taste great      
289,5.0,                       the best mineral water as far as i m concerned  glass bottles are the best but this is a good alternative for shipping a full case      
290,5.0,                       i love this drink  it replaces my addiction to diet coke that took me    months to break  the only problem is i prefer the glass bottles at the grocery store  this one is plastic      
291,5.0,                       i ve been ordering a case a week for a few weeks now with my ebt card  but suddenly i can t use my card to purchase anymore  not sure why      
292,1.0,                       this does not come in a case as pictured   what i received was loose bottles in a shipping box and they were clearly old and beat up and past date   don t waste your money      
293,5.0,                       tastes just like expected  nice bubbles and good flavor      
294,5.0,                       love s  pellegrino as a product because it has a crisp fresh taste

296,5.0,                       i love everything about this water   the taste is fabulous     
297,5.0,                       i ve tried several mineral waters and for me  this one is the winner      
298,4.0,                       the marginal trade down is taste is mostly made up for by the reduced weight and increase volume      
299,5.0,                       i ve been purchasing san pellegrino mineral water for the past few years  it is the my favorite sparking water brand  through subscribe and save  this can be delivered to you house at the convenience for a click and at a great value      
300,1.0,                       less water than pictured  i bought   cases and there is more water in the bottles of one case than the other     
301,5.0,                       good purchase     
302,4.0,                       gently carbonated  not intensely carbonated like i prefer      
303,5.0,                       everything is good     
304,3.0,                       taste like seltzer  plastic bottle  not a bad value     
305,5.0,                       i prefer glass bottles but these are lighter and less fragile for shipping   pellegrino is always good      
306,5.0,                       worth the money the water is good      
307,5.0,                       due to having dysautonomia  i m required to drink a gallon of water a day  this is next to impossible  having this water makes it a bit easier and the fact that it arrives right at my doorstep is wonderful      
308,2.0,                       i would never have purchased this if i read the fine print and saw that the bottles were plastic       i always buy my s pellegrino in glass and never even saw it in plastic   disappointed     and won t buy this again        
309,3.0,                       many of the bottles were flat  even though they all had the same expiration date  will not buy again      
310,1.0,                       it does not taste like pellegrini water  product arrived with the box completely damage     
311,5.0,                       thank you      
312,5.0,                       not a bad buy considering you don t have to shlep these home from the store  the little extra price is definitely worth it especially since the nearest big box store that carry this stuff in this quantity is a good distance from me      
313,1.0,                       nestle   need i say more     
314,2.0,                       i m not sure why but every single bottle was flat  no bubbles  no effervescence  no nothing  i even checked to make sure i didn t order flat water by mistake  guess i just got a bad batch  wasted money  good luck      
315,5.0,                       love pellegrino and the price was great  compared to some of the stores i shop at you cant beat this price

320,5.0,                       was a great deal when i initially ordered it at       but not at       a case      
321,5.0,                       san pellegrino is my favorite sparkling beverage  it is a refreshing treat these hot summer days  it is also wonderfully convenient that amazon delivers within    hours so that i am never without      
322,5.0,                       we use them as mixers in our home bar  also an excellent drink for the designated driver in the crowd      
323,5.0,                       who doesn t like pellegrino water  i store a few in my car in case i get thirsty and it comes in handy on road trips

325,5.0,                       price is much lower per bottle than buying singly      
326,5.0,                       i was so surprised when the box arrived and there were    liter bottles  expected the smaller  great price  well packaged  and definitely will buy again      
327,4.0,                       didn t expect it to be plastic bottles  but it was in the description  and it makes sense to ship plastic i guess  other than that  just like the store bought glass bottles      
328,5.0,                       our favorite for satisfying mineral water

330,5.0,                       the case arrived in perfect conditions  on time  the plastic bottles are definitely more practical than the glass ones  perfect if you don t have time to go for grocery shopping and you have guests coming in few days

337,5.0,                       i like this water better than perrier or lacroix as it just has a really clean  fresh taste and the bubbles are small and light  extremely refreshing  the only issue i have with it is bottled in plastic instead of glass      
338,1.0,                       the box arrived   day ago   it was open and torn with bottles spilling out   today  the box was torn exposing the bottles

354,3.0,                       i thought these were glass but they were plastic  trying to cut down on plastic      
355,4.0,                       thiese are not bad but i like the perrier better  and the perrier can often be found for a lower price

399,3.0,                       i didnt realize these are plastic bottles not glass  they dont hold carbonation well not sure why  within the hour contents seem flat      
400,5.0,                       water must have been sitting around for awhile as the water was somewhat flat   didn t have the normal fizz   not horrible but not as good as it could be      
401,1.0,                       they re all flat

404,5.0,                       this is really the best tasting sparkling water and amazon has the best price around for it     
405,5.0,                       love it with scotch and irish whisky     
406,4.0,                       taste good  i mix it with the citrus varieties sometimes if i want something less sweet     
407,5.0,                       best way to receive water   i am    years old and driving to market is a pain   this water is very refreshing and tasty     
408,3.0,                       now these are cheaper in the local kroger  but i still enjoyed the purchase     
409,5.0,                       shipped to my home at a better price than the stores   tastes great      
410,5.0,                       i havent bought any other brand since purchasing     
411,5.0,                       i love the taste i love the fizz i like the size i like the fact that it s in a plastic bottle very convenient take with you anywhere     
412,5.0,                       despite originally scoffing at the idea of paying a premium on    water    i must say that i ve now been converted  san pellegrino is the only constant beverage in my refrigerator  whether on its own or to spritz up some juice  i don t think i ve tasted anything so thirst quenching before  the question  do you want some s p    is asked multiple times a day in my house  the answer is always  yes  the original packaging has normally fallen apart by the time it reaches me  though amazon s additional box and stuffing keeps the loose bottles sufficiently in place unfortunately   as mentioned by other reviewers   the recent     price increase has made it cheaper to purchase individual bottles at the cvs around the corner  so unless the prime deal returns to        i ll be going elsewhere to get my fix        
413,5.0,                       classic in plastic i wish i could install a tap of this in my home  outstanding price and delivered to my front door  who could ask for more       
414,5.0,                       good value and easy delivery     
415,5.0,                       i like to keep san pellegrino mineral water as a staple in our home  it s always delivered in a timely manner  i love this product      
416,5.0,                       love it           
417,1.0,                       when i received the product it was   month old  which is too old for carbonated water the product had no gas  not sure if it because it was too old or because the package was dropped during handling nevertheless  product is worthless and now i have to waste my time on returning the product  total waste of time and money  it is totally unacceptable to ship   month old sparkling water      
418,5.0,                       this water is very good     
419,5.0,                       i indulged myself and got some water delivered these bottles are the smaller measurement of plastic bottles and plastic lids i was very happy they arrived within a box and weren t damaged i probably wont be buying this again unless for some reason there is no mineral water where i m residing      
420,5.0,                       great value  yummy too      
421,5.0,                       addicted to pellegrino this is the beat deal around      
422,5.0,                       great value for the price     
423,5.0,                       torn up about the environmental impact of getting water from europe  but this is so crisp and good      
424,5.0,                       new fav   smaller bubbles  but nice taste  wish the price was a little better and could get the smaller bottles via prime  shipping is funny  they put into another box with barely anything to keep it from shifting  delivered usps also  which means a visit to the post office for me      
425,5.0,                       i don t like water   have tried all brands but they don t compare to pellogrino   i now can get my water intake without dreading it      
426,1.0,                       unfortunately this dose not reflect the product its self cause i always get these   this packaged came damaged with a bottle hanging out of the box   the box that the waters come in was all busted open inside the amazon box     plastic even broke open causing the entire box to be wet which is what i think made it break to begin in   not very happy with the handling of this shipment      
427,1.0,                       all    bottles are flat      
428,5.0,                       after giving up soda s  ice tea and any sugary drink  i tried and am now hooked on mypellegrino sparkling water both my hubby and i drink pellegrino  so when i saw it offered here on amazon  along with it being free shipping for prime members  it really made it a home run for us  i ordered     cases great price  excellent product          
429,5.0,                       good pricebetter when cooled

432,3.0,                       needs to be in glass bottles  doesn t taste same in plastic and looks like bottled in cali not italy     
433,3.0,                       not good for me     
434,5.0,                       best  lightly carbonated water on the market  anywhere   period       
435,5.0,                       pellegrino always edges out perrier due to its lasting carbonation factor  which perrier doesn t have  a couple of german sparklers are almost as good as pellegrino      
436,5.0,                       the real deal

444,4.0,                       perfect for a sparkling water either as a refreshment or during dinner    i always add a fresh slice of lemon or lime     which enlivens the flavor     it helps with digestion     
445,5.0,                       we like that it is in lightweight plastic bottles   also the taste is eat

455,4.0,                       we really enjoy san pellegrino water  and we have ordered it several times from amazon  but there were some issues with this particular shipment  the labels on half the bottles were either askew or had come off altogether  they would not be acceptable to place on the table if we had friends over for dinner  the actual san  pellegrino box inside the larger shipping box was damaged badly in both cases  i suggest you consider a better way to package this product before shipping      
456,5.0,                       i got free shipping with my prime   saved me money and didn t gave to lug this from the grocery store in and out if my car  rather delivered right to my front door   this was fresh and packaged perfectly   very happy starting to order more things like this from amazon now  grocery shopping has just gotten easier      
457,2.0,                       please help  this is the third shipment i have received and have been satisfied   however  this recent  shipment is concerning  there is a specific odor either from the plastic of the water  or both   i would like the case replaced  there is no easy way to get in touch with amazon or the shipper  please advise

466,5.0,                       this is a staple in our house   my husband asked if it was expensive  not nearly so expensive as the wine  i said  and for every glass i wine i found myself drinking a couple of glasses of san pelligrino   makes me a cheap date  i guess      
467,5.0,                       the box was broken and all the bottles of pellegrino were out of the original box      
468,5.0,                       i am a big fan of san pellegrino  the case of pellegrino was convenient and less expensive  besides it s difficult to find this size bottle here

480,1.0,                       water was completely flat when it arrived   might be better to buy mineral water elsewhere      
481,5.0,                       great for those that live in areas of hard water and want to taste the minerals in the water   it s delicious and so much better than diet pop

497,5.0,                       probably   one in the market

516,1.0,                       very disappointed   this pellegrino water is flat  i read reviews after i opened the  st bottle and noticed many other reviewers had the same issue  this is very dishonest of the seller and amazon  i feel like they put it  on sale  to unload it      
517,3.0,                       box packaging came destroyed and bottles loose inside delivery boxes  glad this was just water

525,1.0,                       i am a healthy female adult  the fact that i can t open the plastic bottles without assistance is ridiculous  i want a replacement with bottle caps that work

527,5.0,                       i enjoyed the refreshing beverage which provided a viable option to juices      
528,5.0,                       it is water  it is sparkling  it has not made me sparkle yet  but i m still drinking it delivered perfect condition  andi didn t have to haul it in and out of my car      
529,5.0,                       this is such a refreshing treat   it seems to quench my thirst after a hard workout better than anything else   i consider it a worthy indulgence and enjoy the convenience of having it delivered

534,5.0,                       i like the natural   refreshing taste  i bought these for the holidays my guest enjoyed them      
535,5.0,                       i drink nothing but pellegrino for my water supply      
536,5.0,                       best value for these      
537,5.0,                       my favourite sparkling water and a great price  thank you amazon      
538,5.0,                       i love the taste       
539,1.0,                       i was expecting glass bottles  it s plastic the bubbles flats right away after u open the bottle  also came n broken box   dented bottles     
540,5.0,                       we love san pellegrino   they have not lost their quality as they have become more popular and increased production   the small bottles are perfect because once it is opened you need to drink it all or it loses its flavor      
541,5.0,                       i m trying to give up soda and find that sparkling water feels like a treat   the best thing about buying it through amazon  though  is that someone delivers it to my porch   the cases are heavy and i ve found amazon delivery to be super helpful      
542,5.0,                       much better than carrying a case home and the one liter plastic bottles add water while reducing weight      
543,5.0,                       received on time and nice     
544,1.0,                       i got the case right off the ups truck along with other boxes  after ups took off i noticed some ice on the box  the bottles were either  frozen or  split open  not good         
545,5.0,                       so convenient to be able to get these in a case  my family drinks this stuff like tap water      
546,3.0,                       i found that the taste that i bought online this time was quite strong  and i was a little uncomfortable with it   it tastes a little different from what i bought at the supermarket      
547,5.0,                       had a problem with one shipment but i m happy with the way they handled  it  have it on auto ship      
548,4.0,                       love the product  but when this came it was just short of its expiration date  and since it takes a while for water to expire  this means it was sitting in a warehouse for a long time       
549,5.0,                       great product     
550,5.0,                       like it     
551,5.0,                       great for lovers of sparkling ster      
552,3.0,                         bottles missing   package was over taped   now i know why   i opened it to find only    of the    bottles in the box      
553,1.0,                       when i opened the shipping box  i discovered the case of peligrino had been cut off at one end  the bottles were tossed inside and the case only included    bottles      
554,5.0,                       great product love the plastic recyclable bottles     
555,5.0,                       taste     
556,5.0,                       i can t get enough of pellegrino  so the   stars   but  the auto ship cancels often and is not reliable      
557,4.0,                       this was delivered all wrapped in saran wrap  no carton   i was   bottles short      
558,1.0,                       taste like regular water not fizzy mineral water     
559,5.0,                       love it     
560,3.0,                       truly taste bad in a plastic container   taste better in glass     
561,5.0,                       love this product     
562,3.0,                       not as good in plastic bottles as it is in glass bottles      
563,5.0,                       you might as well drink something awesome      
564,2.0,                       came in opened boxes     
565,1.0,                       every bottle purchased was flat      
566,5.0,                       very nice     
567,5.0,                       great product great water     
568,5.0,                       i love the taste  it s great for soda lovers that s on a diet  same carbonate feeling  but without add on sugars and calories      
569,5.0,                       great price for an online purchase of bottled water  which i m sure is expensive to ship      
570,4.0,                       it s nice to have this size of our favorite sparkling water available  even though it s more expensive than the bigger bottles   these bottles are plastic  and they re very hard to twist open   i guess that s to keep them  con gaz   but it s a real pain      
571,1.0,                       flat  i should have read the reviews         
572,5.0,                              
573,5.0,                       daily water     
574,5.0,                       as long xpected     
575,5.0,                       liked the water better than other price great price     
576,5.0,                       the best thirst quencher     
577,5.0,                       i love my peligrino     
578,5.0,                       my favorite bottled sparking water  great price  fast shipping  nothing broken or leaking    cheaper than local grocery stores  such a deal      
579,5.0,                       good value     
580,5.0,                       after traveling in europe  i had to have it back home  too      
581,5.0,                       love this water  has high calcium and magnesium levels compared to other mineral waters and isn t too salty  and  what makes it even better  buying it on amazon for    a liter bottle and getting it delivered for free instead of trying to hulk this box of water from the store      
582,3.0,                       it s okay     
583,1.0,                       these were flat  i just needed to get to them and found them all flat with no fizzy  very disappointing and really way to much trouble to return due to weight etc         
584,5.0,                       i like the clean fresh taste      
585,2.0,                       the water is very good   however  the value for money is not good because three bottles were empty upon arrival due to improper packaging      
586,5.0,                       great tadte     
587,5.0,                       does its job     
588,5.0,                       the water is great  the water in our area is contaminated by a chemical commonly referred to as c   used by dupont in the manufacturing of teflon and similar products  so  we purchase and drink quality bottled water      
589,5.0,                       great quality and to this day the best mineral water i have ever tasted      
590,5.0,                       very pleased     
591,5.0,                       got a great deal on this case at time of purchase  everything arrived well packaged and no leaks  plus san pellegrino tastes great      
592,5.0,                       great product      
593,5.0,                       it is sparkling water  what is not to like      
594,5.0,                       great and a   day delivery on water  ty     
595,5.0,                       better than perrier in my opinion     
596,1.0,                       i ve been ordering this on subscribe for over a year  never a problem   this time it was ripped inside the brown package and there were only   bottles  not         
597,3.0,                       we love the product  no problems with that  i hesitate to give lower stars because i don t want it to reflect the product  however  the shipment arrived all beat up  really  i m surprised that none of the bottles were broken  the box was torn and mashed up  even funnier  it was ordered as a gift  haha      
598,5.0,                       really like the brand and the taste     
599,1.0,                       extremely disappointed that i received a shipment with several open bottles  one bottle in particular had leaked about     of its contents and soaked the box      
600,5.0,                       lovely water  just wish it wasn t so expensive      
601,5.0,                       i love it  subscribed      
602,5.0,                       bought for a friend  he s very happy   loves this brand of mineral water      
603,2.0,                       this is my second box purchased  the water was flat  my first order was fine but it looks like it s a persistent issue  based on other reviews  and you take a chance  disappointed      
604,3.0,                       as you would expect in terms of the product  good water  one bottle exploded when it was being delivered and we lost that one and the rest of it was soggy and destroyed on the outside      
605,3.0,                       damaged box   it s ok  but one bottle is missed  i get only    bottles instead    as described      
606,4.0,                       good value for the money     
607,5.0,                       great water  very good value  will buy again  wish you had lime flavored mineral water

610,5.0,                       i like this  i will be getting a flavored one next time      
611,1.0,                       bought a box of     opened   so far and all of them were flat upon opening or flat the next morning when opened the night before      
612,5.0,                       i hate plastic  i ordered glass and got plastic   other than that  all is well        
613,5.0,                       it s a great convenience to get this product at a great price and delivery     
614,5.0,                       good buy  shipped directly to my home      
615,5.0,                       this stuff is wonderful   i have been eating paleo and doing a whole   eating plan  so beverage choices are limited   all i can get locally is perrier sparkling water and the san pellegrino is so much better and more affordable   no artificial crap      
616,1.0,                       i drink a bottle of sparkling water a day  i haven t ordered pellegrino for   months because i order multiple cases at a time and the last time both cases were completely flat  i completely forgot about that until i opened the cases i just got  now i have two dozen   oz of flat sparkling water      
617,5.0,                       ok     
618,5.0,                       good stuff      
619,5.0,                       wife loves these and i don t like carrying them around the store so i have them delivered      
620,5.0,                       i love this water but wish the price was a bit more affordable      
621,5.0,                       just what i need for my gut      
622,5.0,                       came in a double box with plastic bottles   although the bottles were not glass  the order was as expected      
623,1.0,                       no sparkle  overpriced bottle water   content flat  no fizzle   old product or heat  will not buy again      
624,1.0,                       flat out f the bottle  just out of the return window  wasted money on   cases     
625,5.0,                       like it     
626,5.0,                       great price and fast delivery   cheaper than buying replacement c   for the selzer machine and tastes better      
627,5.0,                       love this water   perfect everything   came on time with no issues      
628,5.0,                       our favorite mineral water   beats lugging it home from the store      
629,5.0,                       thanx very much     
630,5.0,                       i love that it isnt so fizzy  but yet there is still carbonation  so much better than other waters that are too fizzy with a funny taste      
631,4.0,                       i have ordered this    pack from amazon a few times now  the price is good and it s great to not have to lug bottles or boxes home from the store  the bottles fit perfectly in my wine racks  making them easy to store  the water itself is the same quality product i drank while living in ireland and travelling in europe  while it s good straight  or with a twist of lemon   i usually mix it with juice to lighten things up    enjoy   one word of caution  make sure the delivery driver has good access  my first box came sooner then expected   which was great   but they dropped it over the fence  damaging one bottle  i drank that bottle first  lol      
632,5.0,                       the amount in the bottle is just enough      
633,1.0,                       sadly  the water is flat as many other said they also experienced  figured it was worth the try for the price  now i have a lot of oversized paper weights      
634,1.0,                       the original box was badly torn and mineral water bottles were all over the place  none were broken though     
635,4.0,                       i enjoy san pellegrino sparkling water and decided to try the smaller plastic bottle for convenience   however the water seems to lose its carbonation very quickly  perhaps even before opening the bottle   i won t be ordering more for that reason      
636,5.0,                       buying these in bulk on amazon is a great option for a family that drinks a lot of sparkling water and has storage in their home  having them delivered takes away the fuss of lugging them home from the store  love the plastic bottles as they are safer in a home with lots of kids      
637,5.0,                       great productnice to have around the table as you have a nice dinner

646,3.0,                       the product was delivered in a torn box and the bottles were scattered on the floor     
647,1.0,                       when i opened the box that was left outside my door  i noticed that it was dripping in water  five out of    bottles were cut and half empty or completely empty  terrible experience      
648,2.0,                       two bottles was flat  once open it fizziness does not last more than a few hours      
649,3.0,                       well  this is a strange one  box came  sealed  two of the bottles were empty  one bone dry  the other with a little water left in it  box was dry so it didn t leak out    the other ten seem fine

726,4.0,                       my local stores have the smaller glass bottles   these are he bigger plastic version  i don t see any great difference in quality so i will get it here on prime and not need to lug it from store and get more for     thanks prime
