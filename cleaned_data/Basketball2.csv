0,1.0,                       ball delivered quickly however the ball will not hold air and has a leak somewhere     
1,5.0,                       i love it     
2,5.0,                       the ball simply feels like a real basketball  weight  diameter  bounce     
3,5.0,                       i usually go cheap on my bassketballs  but i decided to get something with more professional materials this time around  this is a great ball that functions well both indoor and outdoor      
4,2.0,                       really bad grip even for an outdoor ball  kept slipping out my hands     
5,5.0,                       great deal  my nephew loved this      
6,5.0,                       excellent basketball with superb grip     
7,5.0,                       in fact  the picture of this ball contains a small mistake the word  infusion  is not printed on the ball at all and actually the  nd picture which contains  nba zi o  is the correct one note that there are   levels for this type of spaling basketballs     professional game ball  the official game ball of nba     maximum performance  ultimate composite leather cover for the highly competitive player     advanced performance  premium composite leather cover for the serious player     performance  durable outdoor cover for players of all levels and this item belongs to the  maximum performance  i bought a ball which belongs to  advanced performance  level at the dick s and it was the same price as this one  which is a better and higher quality ball thus  i returned my ball to the dick s and ordered this one in addition this ball is more suitable for indoor play if you use it as an outdoor basketball you will need a new one soon      
8,5.0,                       it came quickly and in perfect condition  it is exactly as the description says  would definitely recommend this to a friend      
9,4.0,                       good quality      
10,5.0,                       exactly what i was expecting     
11,1.0,                       the ball can not hold its air for more than a day  if i leave it for   days  i need to re pump it  i has been gradually worse to the point where its unusable  it was also delivered a week after amazon s expected delivery date  in addition  the item is cheaper on the maker s website      
12,5.0,                       all right      
13,1.0,                       ordered    both arrived warped with a slight bulge by the inflation point  useless     
14,1.0,                       the ball constantly goes flat    i pumped it up with air and played basketball for maybe    minutes and the air was already out of it  every time i play it is flat and requires air  defective ball      
15,4.0,                       pressure stated on ball to inflate to seems low  pumped it up more and it s great but hopefully it won t pop       
16,3.0,                       i needed a new ball to play with at the park and i saw that the reviews on this product was promising  not a lot of people reviewed the ball being used for outside play  so i thought i had to share  after maybe around a month and a half of running   s and other pick up games at the park  i noticed that the outer layer of the ball started to peel off  the durability of the ball drops a butt ton if you use it outside but i am sure it will last longer inside      
17,5.0,                       perfect        
18,5.0,                       good ball for outdoors and indoors  good material     
19,5.0,                       the quality is good   the weight  size and feel is that of a professional basketball   the ball is reasonably priced      
20,5.0,                       nice grip     
21,1.0,                       i bought this ball to replace my old one  but i ended up going back to my old one   first of all  it is ridiculously expensive and it is hard to bounce  i do not recommend this boo i do not recommend this ball       
22,5.0,                       this ball helped me in so many ways i never thought it would  not only was i a better baller after using this nba certified product  but i have been able to limit voicing my political views to others and have not looked back   this basketball gives me the feeling of greats   that should never voice their political opinions  like jordan  james  and magic  every time i dribble this unique sphere  all i can think about is the hardwood court  the roaring fans  and nothing else not having anything to do with sports  the best part of this whole thing is that i can play both inside and outside with this ball  so i never have to worry about thinking of anything else but dribbling a basketball  this ball is the perfect product gift  especially if you re the kind of person that doesn t like to share political views or know someone like that  i recommend this product for everyone including all those short sighted newscasters      
23,3.0,                       would give it more stars if it was the orange rubber part all over      
24,1.0,                       only used it exactly   times  for an hour each   and the ball already started falling apart  see photos  terrible quality      
25,5.0,                       great ball  got a lot of use in my driveway      
26,3.0,                       very good ball  but if you leave to use one week boot the air     
27,5.0,                       good quality     
28,5.0,                       good good good     
29,5.0,                       i love the feel of this basketball  i use it indoors at the gym only  even though i could use it outdoors        
30,2.0,                       not official size  it s small      
31,5.0,                       as a christmas gift for  my husband   he likes it very much     
32,5.0,                       i ve had this basketball for over a year now and it is still in great condition and its been used outdoors  very happy with it      
33,5.0,                       great ball     
34,2.0,                       started losing air after a couple of months and started peeling     
35,5.0,                       my son loves his new basketball  it arrived promptly  actually pretty fast and fully inflated  great purchase at a good price  thank you      
36,5.0,                       tested it out the day we got it  aka yesterday    we have a dirt driveway and it still has a good dribble bounce where some balls in the past haven t      
37,1.0,                       came in almost totally flat   stuffed in a plain cardboard box  completely unusable  returning       
38,5.0,                       really nice basketball     
39,5.0,                       great ball   just right for my    year old that needed a new ball to take to practice   delivered on time  no issues   might have found it cheaper had i checked all the stores at christmas  but the convenience of ordering with prime made it an easy choice      
40,5.0,                       great ball for the kids   good price      
41,3.0,                       good for child     
42,5.0,                       was a gift for a graduate      
43,4.0,                       decent ball for outside  will see how long it lasts  but for new you can use right away  bounces even and not heavy  got it for my outdoor court at home     
44,4.0,                       worth      
45,4.0,                       elasticity of this basketball is not that good      
46,5.0,                       these are really good basketballs   very grippy      
47,5.0,                       a gift for my adult son who travels and likes to play at outdoor courts  sometimes he gets invited to a pick up game inside a gym so this duel use b ball serves him well      
48,5.0,                       happy with this  came fully inflated and just needed a few extra pumps before it was ready      
49,5.0,                       very very impressed with this basketball it is absolutely what i was looking for definitely would buy again     
50,1.0,                       air valve garbage design can inflate         the ball size  is small  and not as advertised as official nba rock bc i can palm it   more like a lady ball size       
51,5.0,                       nice      
52,4.0,                       seemed to be a good value  nice part that it can be used both inside and outside  hope it lasts      
53,4.0,                       pretty good basketball   i wished it would last a bit longer   we play ball outdoors and this basketball seems to lose it s grip fairly quickly   i play ball once a week and this is usually the game ball  so it gets some fair usage   but it also should be noted that this ball is selected to be the game ball every week  because it is the best one there      
54,4.0,                       this ball has o warpage and bounces straight up off the dribble   many budget balls are slightly warped and do no bounce straight up   spins well on the fingers and shoots well     no unexplainable misses only issue is that the labels and lettering are oily     any modern basketball should be tacky  not oily   had to wash the ball three times with soap and water to remove the oil from the lettering obviously this ball is not worthy of being selected as an  amazon s choice    and even more obvious is that no one at amazon has ever played basketball      
55,5.0,                       was a gift and well loved       
56,5.0,                       hours of fun in the sun  great ball  my son and i really enjoy playing with this      
57,5.0,                       best ball ever      
58,5.0,                       best outdoor basketball i ve ever used  i used to buy the nba street spalding basketball  but i after using this one i switched  the material is far superior than other outdoor basketballs  i burn through the grip on basketballs very fast because i use them almost everyday  this one lasts the longest and feels great      
59,1.0,                       the pump insert point broke   the little rubber piece fell into the basketball the  nd time i ever used the ball  barely even used the ball and it s totally useless already     
60,5.0,                       beautiful basketball thank you

62,5.0,                       good product     
63,1.0,                       purposely didn t buy the correlated pump as ad says it ships fully inflated  mine arrive at best     full   now sitting useless til a pump arrives        
64,5.0,                       this ball is the perfect one  and for the price  cant beat it      
65,5.0,                       i purchased for playing on outdoor courts  it feels like an authentic indoor nba basketball  i ve compared with other outdoor balls at walmart and this one by far was the best quality  although it is about     more than the cheaper brands  but you get what you pay for and the quality exceeds the extra amount you invest      
66,5.0,                       solid  great grip and bounce     
67,5.0,                       great buy     
68,5.0,                       this basketball is great        
69,5.0,                       excellent        
70,5.0,                       perfect ball      
71,3.0,                       this basketball has really good grip but its really hard to bounce  i tried pumping air into it but that did barley any thing  over all this basketball is ok      
72,5.0,                       i like the product with very good quality      
73,5.0,                       nice ball with a great feel      
74,1.0,                       when first purchased the ball has great grip and holds air well  but the grip and outside of the ball began to fall apart within   weeks of playing rec ball with it  for a ball listed as indoor outdoor it sure cant handle the grind very well  would not recommend      
75,5.0,                       this is a great basketball for street basketball games   the grip and the bounce is just right for street balling   the build quality is superb and the air lasts a very long time   i ve been using it couple weeks now and its held up multiple pickup games and abuse   great b ball      
76,4.0,                       i brought it for my daughter cause she plays basketball in middle school and she loves using this basketball for practice it s ver flexible durable ball     
77,1.0,                       not impressed the ball when shot has a wobble in it and it feels like cheep imitation leather   not very grippy don t buy      
78,5.0,                       great ball  indoor or out  lots of grip and feels good      
79,4.0,                       this basketball is for my    year old grandson to use in his driveway   basketball is a secondary sport for him so this will have limited use   it is well balanced and maintains its surface well so far   this is a perfect choice for him      
80,5.0,                       its a good quality ball     
81,5.0,                       he wanted it for his birthday and he loves it saying that it work great indoors and outdoors it great     
82,5.0,                       love the ball      
83,4.0,                       first of all  i must say that i m a  repeat buyer  of this basketball  i play outdoors     times a week  and my basketball is always picked as a game ball among others  it feels  bounces  and weighs very good  breaking in period is not that long either  until then it is pretty slippery though  i usually need to replace my basketball in every few months  but it s totally worth it for under      every serious basketball player knows that  the ball is the most important element  and you can t compromise on it  i ve tried several other spalding balls  including very expensive ones  shelf life is pretty much same with all  therefore i ve started to buy this one     years ago  after     of them  i still come back and buy this one  amazon is the only retailer who sells this  no other major sporting goods store have it  instead they have overpriced other models  i m not sure why  or you can get a beginners ball at this price  couple of times ball didn t arrive exactly round  bouncing and rotating slightly off  but amazon was very helpful to replace it free of charge  i m just about to order a new one  and i thought i d share my thoughts on this spalding zi o basketball      
84,3.0,                       but i paid way too much  should have gone to big five  my bad      
85,2.0,                       great ball at first but after a week of playing outside it lost its grip   not the best not the worst     
86,5.0,                       excellent product   exactly what i expected in this price range      
87,5.0,                       great bball     
88,5.0,                       this ball has a good handfeeling when its new  let s wait and see how it works in the ourdoor court      
89,5.0,                       good basketball comes ready to play      
90,5.0,                       nothing much to say except an excellent ball      
91,5.0,                       i liked the ball and it was good for the price      
92,5.0,                       i ve put a hundred hours plus on this ball all on outdoor concrete playground courts you can see the wear on it  but no tear the printed logo is worn down and half as bright but still      readable  the pebbles are worn down but not smooth and not a nick  scratch or peel in sight you want a tuff skin ball  get this one  it s outlasted   similar balls and it s just getting broken in like a comfortable pair of jeans this is the ball i made     s in a row with i ll buy another one  but probably not till          
93,5.0,                       good product  good shipping time   ball was a little overpumped when it arrived  had to let out some air to get to the right level     
94,5.0,                       great quality     
95,5.0,                       great produce received fast with no problems      
96,5.0,                       good quality ball  great for indoor and outdoor balling      
97,2.0,                       ball feels like a brick   no bounce   was inflated to   psi on delivery   i took it down to     still hard as a rock      
98,5.0,                       i use this basketball all the time  it has great quality and it s a good deal for the price      
99,5.0,                       we have our own goal at home   shoot around quite often  sunshine or rain this ball hangs with us as long as we want  works even on grass      
100,5.0,                       if you dream you are jordan this ball will help you to improve your performance  i play out door so i but   balls to have a backup but after a year it looks like new  and i use it   hour   times a week      
101,1.0,                       on the outside  everything looks great  the ball seems sturdy and pumped well  but as soon as i bounced it on the indoor court  there was virtually no bounce  after pumping it until i could barely put more air in  it was playable but lacked good bounce  now i have used this ball around    times and even when the ball is pumped until it cannot be pumped anymore  a regular dribble will only bring the ball up just above my knees  very disappointed      
102,5.0,                       i liked the weight of the ball and the grip  ball does tend to wear down over time but a very great ball overall     
103,5.0,                       great     
104,5.0,                       very good ball for the money  it s an outdoor ball so i expect it to get roughed up      
105,1.0,                       i have used this ball over past few years buying new ones as they wear on the outdoor court and noticed a trend of degrading quality  with my latest purchase feeling like a kids plastic ball  item arrived in a box with no official packaging by the way  not that i mind that much grip is non existent when it picks up a little dust from the outdoor court  and the surface is very hard and uncomfortable  the bounce lost its  heft  and i feel ripped off for paying over    dollars for it  i suspect this will be the unfortunate circumstance for most import goods in the future  they do not want to increase price too much so they cut corners in materials  very disappointed  spalding      
106,5.0,                       it s are very great buy     
107,5.0,                       i ve been using this for a couple years now and it s still holding up like it did when i first bought it      
108,3.0,                       it s your average basketball  nothing special about it  doesn t stay tacky  looses grip      
109,5.0,                       great basket ball good grip  iv had many basketballs and this is kinda heavy overall i like  it i recommend if you are going to buy a basketball get this one      
110,5.0,                       it is great i can now keep fit with out bothering my friends  i love having my own stuff and its good having my friends ask me for my time now thanks  its really strong and i m never had and spalding ball before       
111,4.0,                       the ball is good and performs better than others in this price range  i would recommend spending the extra cash on a nicer ball though  i will keep this for outdoor use      
112,5.0,                       great product      
113,5.0,                       loved it  good size and is very durable     
114,5.0,                       great quality basketball   love the feel of it when playing outdoors      
115,4.0,                       a little to hard when pumped right amount     
116,2.0,                       good ball but packaged poorly lead to the delivery of a  unshaped ball that i cannot use to play a game      
117,5.0,                       i love basketball  i play outdoors usually at least twice a week  i purchased this ball a couple monthes ago and i ve been bouncing and shooting it a lot and it s a great ball  even playing outdoors this ball lasts and lasts      
118,5.0,                       great basketball for outdoor and inddor play     
119,2.0,                       the ball has a decent feel to it  but the bounce is not good at all  i will keep the ball for shooting  i m not sure if all    dollar balls feel this way  but i m already planning on just getting a        game ball      
120,5.0,                       my    year old loves this ball  he uses it both indoor and outdoor and he says the grip is fantastic  i purchased during a lightning deal so well worth it      
121,5.0,                       best ball for outdoors     
122,2.0,                       amazon should be ashamed of their self for this   i bought this basketball thinking i was getting a good performing basketball as far as feel and style of ball  this ball is badly advertised and me as a hooper i m very dissatisfied for buying this particular ball knowing i can t give it back   basketballers beware      
123,5.0,                       it s a great basketball  i m using it outside on a dirt clay court  it s perfect for me      
124,5.0,                       very good     
125,5.0,                       good     
126,1.0,                       this ball does not last for long at all  i had it for about   days and probably played with it for   hours and it is already grip less   do not buy        
127,5.0,                       wears well good quality     
128,4.0,                       given as a gift

131,2.0,                       way too expensive     
132,5.0,                       fast shipping  great all around ball  i have this ball for a few weeks now and keeps its grip really well outdoors  thanks     
133,3.0,                       i would happily pay       for an outdoor ball that had a better grip      
134,5.0,                       liked this ball so much when we ordered it a few months ago that we bought another one for a friend recently great quality ball      
135,5.0,                       the way i ball i should ahve played for vanderbilt     
136,2.0,                       my basketball arrived in a nondescript square box without any additional packaging  which i m happy about for environmental reasons   the ball had a great  slightly tacky feel at first  but as others have commented  the surface is a dust magnet when used outdoors   you feel the difference immediately with every bounce outside  but it hasn t gotten to a point where it feels slippery because of the dust where i have issue with the ball is that it just doesn t hold air for very long   i had to pump up the ball when it first arrived  but i expected i would need to add some anyway   however  it lost significant pressure after about a week to the point where i couldn t even dribble it because it s too flat   after pumping the ball up  it went flat again by the time i used it the next week   i ve been playing basketball for decades and have never had a ball lose so much air in such a short period of time      
137,5.0,                       indeed  great ball     
138,5.0,                       came fast and just as described  my son loves it      
139,5.0,                       just as decribed     
140,3.0,                       too small     
141,5.0,                       got this as a lightening deal after thanksgiving our mainstay has always been  the rock  balls but this ball has the same feel for less than half the price  given the deal i got  my only regret is i didn t buy half a dozen not sure how it will hold up over the long haul our rock balls from anaconda last about   month with heavy outside use before the outside really starts showing wear and the dimpling smooths  will report back on this pretty new addition      
142,5.0,                       so i recently heard of a new sport which involves tossing a rubberized ball into a hoop net combination   while i don t think this sport will ever take off quite like tennis  i do think it s a great opportunity for affluent suburban young people to socialize and get in some good cardio at their local private athletic club or in their private gated cul de sac i understand you can purchase a  hoop  and have it professionally installed at your estate by professional contractors   this is the way to go   if you haven t yet tried  basket balls   you are missing out      
143,1.0,                       i bought this to replace my    year old son s worn out basketball  the deflated ball arrived in an unlabeled box with no packaging   kind of suspect in my opinion  on arrival day  wednesday  sept             i pumped it to   lbs and initially it looked ok  my son was excited to try his new ball  so after a week of sitting at his quarantine computer for school work  we planned to shoot baskets on saturday afternoon  unfortunately  the ball was already flat  i pumped it up again saturday night and it was already flat by sunday morning  shame on the seller and amazon for selling defective products like this  i ve bought dozens of basketballs in my life and this is the first time this ever happened  very disappointing for me and especially my son  next ball  i will risk covid and go into a real store to buy a real basketball  amazon  you are now losing more and more of my business by selling these defective products      
144,5.0,                       it has an amazing good grip have not used it outside but love it  i feel like it will have good grip but it really good       recommended            
145,1.0,                       i  honestly didn t like this ball  it got cracks in the leather and also the lines had glue from where it was manufactured and losing air  now it garbage  all the ilusion i waited for was a big disappointment      
146,5.0,                       it s good quality  great for indoor use   i don t want to use it outdoors because i want to keep it nice   it s sleek  not too bumpy at the seams      
147,5.0,                       this product is well designed and i like the look  very happy with this product      
148,5.0,                       i play backyard basketball quite frequently and this is the best ball i have used in a while  my last ball was the under armour     which is also very nice but i believe this ball edges it out  good grip and just feels perfect coming off the finger tips     
149,1.0,                       was a birthday gift for my    year old to go with a new hoop  ball would not hold air more than an hour or so at a time      
150,4.0,                       my nephew loved it      
151,5.0,                       great     
152,5.0,                       thanks     
153,2.0,                       i received the basketball and it looked felt great  i pumped it up and then went on practice  however the ball was lopsided  it did not bounce normally and felt awkward  i am sure if i received a normal basketball i would give this a   star review if anyone knows a way to fix this please share      
154,2.0,                       the exterior of the new spalding balls get roughed up quickly when used on an outdoor court i had an older zi o from the late   s and used it fairly often    until buying two new balls this year  spalding zi o and a spalding tacksoft   the zi o ball has panels that are starting to peel slightly  not peeling severely but the black underneath the orange panels is visible on two panels  after about   months of rare use  and the tacksoft looks like i ve been playing with it for multiple years  after about   months of heavy use both the zi o and the tacksoft seem like good bargains for indoor balls and have great grips  but they aren t made for outdoor use cause the grip wears quickly on both balls  spalding needs to step its game up      
155,1.0,                       the ball doesn t hold air   unfortunately  there is only a    day return window and i missed it by one day      
156,5.0,                       great item     
157,3.0,                       gets dirty and stains fast  feels nice  holds air well      
158,5.0,                       the best ball of

164,2.0,                       very hard for ball to keep air

166,5.0,                       great feel     
167,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          there is something in the basketball  as long as it shakes it will make a noise     
168,4.0,                       would have been nice if it had arrived inflated but otherwise great for both outdoor and indoor play      
169,4.0,                       nice grip     
170,5.0,                       good feel      
171,5.0,                       great ball  my son loves it      
172,5.0,                       nice     
173,5.0,                       grip is awesome  feels like a pro ball  i got this from other reviews and it fit the bill  when we play it is the first ball everyone chooses and has held up well  i usually play     times a week      
174,5.0,                       very good     
175,5.0,                       fast delivery and      authentic ball      
176,5.0,                       no review needed   great basketball      
177,4.0,                       the color is a little more like dark magenta purple red then brown but its still perfect      
178,4.0,                       good ball for indoor and outdoor      
179,1.0,                       i certainly underestimated the durability of the ball   i have had much better luck with much cheaper alternatives   even the grip hasn t held up as well as expected for the price i paid      
180,5.0,                       great ball  which i got at a great price just before christmas      
181,3.0,                       ball is ok     
182,5.0,                       very happy with this as an outdoor ball   almost comparable to high end indoor balls but is holding up reasonably well outside      
183,3.0,                       i just bought the zi o in a brick and mortar store  i didn t buy from amazon because there are two different balls pictured on this page  and i didn t want to end up receiving the wrong ball from amazon  if you look at the two pictures on top of this page  one has a ball with  infusion  on it  while the other shows a ball with zi o on it amazon should clear this ambiguity  so customers know exactly which ball they re ordering  it s already hard enough to decide between different brands and models of basketballs  we don t need amazon making things even trickier by showing pictures of different balls under the same name      
184,5.0,                       gift for dad     
185,5.0,                       one of the basketballs available for less than

187,1.0,                       it doesn t keep air      
188,5.0,                       it s a basketball  it bounces and fits through the hoops  it arrived fully inflated and works just fine  i use it outdoors to augment my running and zumba workout routines      
189,5.0,                       great indoor basketball     
190,2.0,                       i went through a couple of these trying to get one that didn t go flat quickly   no luck   the ball feels nice  and plays nice  but you have to pump it up every few days at best   i advise you to look elsewhere      
191,4.0,                       good     
192,5.0,                       super fast  superb   very reliable   great transaction   honest seller highly recommended

211,4.0,                       if you play outdoors it will last you a good   months     
212,1.0,                       this basketball has less bounce than any i ve ever used  would not recommend      
213,1.0,                       i ve had the ball for under two months  used it only a few times because it won t hold air for more than a day or two   every time i want to use it i need to re inflate it      
214,5.0,                       awesome day     
215,5.0,                       love it     
216,1.0,                       the ball had a lump in it when we got it  now it throws funny      
217,4.0,                       good product so far  good price     
218,1.0,                       does not bounce     literally      
219,5.0,                       what can you say  it s a ball  a good one  i just wish i was better using it  hehe     
220,3.0,                       too hard for indoor games      
221,5.0,                       my son is hard on basketballs   this is a good sturdy ball     
222,4.0,                       everywhere i go to play ball i have to bring my own   there s something about getting used to a ball and then not having it with you   i needed a great ball to bring around with me and this is the one i found   it has incredible grip and feel to it   the weight is perfect   i usually only ball indoors or on concrete and not on grass or the ground because it does pickup trash and dirt and does not do well when you dribble it   other than that  i have to say this is a great ball to play with      
223,4.0,                       the ball has a nice feel when playing in doors and outdoors  we ve had it a month and it still has good texture for grip on the ball  we will need to see how it holds up over a few months  so far  it seems like a good ball for the price      
224,5.0,                       worth the price      
225,1.0,                    donde se infla la pelota tiene un borde        
226,5.0,                       love it     
227,2.0,                       had it for about   years  and lately the leather cover is peeling off and doesn t hold air like it used to when new  majority of use was indoors  so i know i haven t been rough with it  i don t know that the average life span of a basketball should be  but i d consider paying a little more and getting one of better quality      
228,1.0,                       i m a pretty avid basketball player   i rarely play outdoors   but  i just moved to another so i had to look for some local games at the park   i decided to get my own outdoor ball so i can warm up before i fail at giving a solid impression   but  this ball just doesn t seem to bounce right  either it doesn t seem to hold the air  or it bounces like a lopsided ball   without telling my friends  he mentioned this to me   buy at your own risk   if i were you  i would just go to a sports store and try it out   i went to a sports authority nearby to test out the other out door balls and they work much better   and  they re just as cheap   surprising   sometimes amazon isn t the cheapest      
229,5.0,                       pros   very high quality composite leather  great feel on the fingertips as the ball is released from the hand  keeps form well  after months of use  the ball still doesn t need to be inflatedcons   none that i can think off so if you need a  new basketball  i recommend this one      
230,5.0,                       purchased as a gift looks just a basketball feels like one and i am sure it will give many years of great service a great pick     
231,3.0,                       girls basketball     
232,5.0,                       great christmas gift     
233,4.0,                       this outdoor and indoor ball is really good  it is better indoor much but it can be played outdoor as well  i have only played indoor because of the covid situation   it is a perfect gift if you are trying to give it to someone      
234,4.0,                       very good     
235,1.0,                       the ball  has a whole in it  unsatisfactory     
236,5.0,                       for my dog   holds up well outside     
237,5.0,                       the review of the basket ball is truly a good ball     
238,5.0,                       great item and came quickly     
239,5.0,                       exactly what he wanted       
240,5.0,                       great ball  kids liked it     
241,5.0,                       my friend loved it as a gift     
242,5.0,                       received  my basketball within the shipping time frame  was happy about that  once i got the package it was ready to use  it could of used a little more air but nothing serious  i filled it up a little more and now i enjoy playing basket ball at my gym with my friends  it is amazing to own this ball      
243,3.0,                       this ball is kind of hard to play     
244,3.0,                       ball collects a lot of dust playing outside  other balls on the same court don t collect that amount of dust  one of the seams is coming apart after just a few months shooting around outside      
245,5.0,                       good outdoor basketball and well made      
246,1.0,                       basketballs  structurally  have few absolute requirements  the primary function of that structure is to secure air so that the ball can be used  the ball arrived  i excitedly pulled it from the packaging and pumped it up  it worked great   for that initial    minute shoot around  the next day  it was flat  i pumped it up again  it worked fine again  until it sat overnight  it simply won t hold air like it s supposed to  i m extremely disappointed  and since i excitedly destroyed the packaging and threw it away  i can t send it back  this was a complete waste of money   who wants a ball that needs pumped up every time you want to use it  a basketball that can t hold air is worthless to me  i rarely issue bad reviews  but this one merits it      
247,5.0,                       nice and firm     
248,5.0,                       purchased for grandson and he was thrilled with it  loves it      
249,4.0,                       i have been able to use it on both indoor and outdoor courts      
250,3.0,                       good buy    son loved it   happy purchase           
251,5.0,                       very good quality     
252,1.0,                       ball was getting eggs after one use     
253,2.0,                       when i noticed that a new spalding basketball doesn t compare to my older one   seems to be made of cheaper material  i brought it back to the vendor and told him i wanted one not made in china      
254,3.0,                       you have to keep filling it with air every time you use it   it s a really hassle   my son needed it for a camp we used it   day   so i felt like i shouldn t return it      
255,5.0,                       great backyard ball      
256,1.0,                       this seller sold me a flat basket ball   the worst part is that this is the type of ball that isn t refillable      
257,5.0,                       my son and my husband love this basketball   they said that i finally got them a really good basketball   they think it is the best one that we have ever owned   i do not fully understand what makes it better  however  it does bounce well and it feels better in my hands than any other basketball that i have purchased      
258,5.0,                       nice basketball with perfect performance both indoor and outdoor  i will definitely recommend this ball  the only problem is  the price decreased by   dollars just   days after i purchased it      
259,5.0,                       came aired up and ready to go   this ball seems to hold up best for us for outdoor use   we have to replace it every couple years  but for an outdoor ball  that s pretty good      
260,1.0,                       don t buy     
261,5.0,                       i wanted a moderately priced ball to play outdoors at a nearby park during a brief    week stint in nyc so i scoured amazon and was able to purchase this item for around     xx   to my surprise  the ball could actually work better as an indoor ball   it s no wilson evolution  but it is closer to a tf      than one might imagine i used it outdoors a few times and given that the court was a bit dirty  the ball caught a coat of dust and became a bit slippery at times   i m looking forward to playing indoors again where i think the ball will excel for the price and the quality of the ball  i definitely think this is a great purchase      
262,1.0,                       i ve bough two of these balls  both of them went flat after a few months due to small holes developing in the ball  is my guess since no matter how much air i pump in them they stay flat      
263,1.0,                       looked like it was ready to use but had a hole somewhere as it would not bounce  was not able to stay inflated  wish i would have returned it but considered it a loss  my grandson was very disappointed because he also received an outdoor hoop for his birthday and then the ball wouldn t work  probably too late for refund  my fault for not acting sooner    star for sad birthday boy though      
264,5.0,                       good quality     
265,5.0,                       bought   of these  use them     times a week  still in great condition  holds air well and still have their grip  only used indoors  would buy again      
266,4.0,                       my husband needed a basketball to assist him in teaching future basketball stars how to use the    perfect shot   that he has invented to help players increase their ability to shoot free throws      
267,5.0,                       perfect for new basketball player   its round  it bounces  it says cool basketball stuff on it seriously   i have no idea what to say about this other than my    year  old says  its awesome  and i could write his name on it in sharpie      
268,3.0,                       the basketball looks really good  but the quality is bad  i pumped it   after the second day the ball was soft  i returned it      
269,5.0,                       everything went very smooth      
270,5.0,                       i love it     
271,1.0,                       similar to other reviews  the composite cover does not last playing on an outdoor surface   after having this for a year  the cover is shredded      
272,5.0,                       great indoor outdoor basketball for the price was looking to replace a stolen basketball for my son  he said he didn t want one from the national retail chain check  that everyone knows it will be nameless   he said he wanted one for indoor  outdoor use check  and it s a plus because of i ve heard of spalding it s been around for years check  it also has nba on it and it has a high rating out if a lot of reviews check   so if you re a mom like me and you are looking to buy your kids a basketball    bottom line don t look any further  this is the ball for you  plus my son tried it and really liked it   he said it was fire      
273,5.0,                       great all around ball  got me back into the sport      
274,5.0,                       good balls     
275,2.0,                       too expensive     
276,5.0,                        th grader semi pro all star likes this one       
277,4.0,                       good ball     
278,3.0,                       this ball may be good for indoors  but it is not good for abrasive concrete driveways   it was nice and tacky for a couple of weeks  but then it became quite slick in the hands   the cheap ball from walmart held up better      
279,5.0,                       birthday present     
280,5.0,                       super fun present   came ready to play   packaged well and arrived very timely      
281,5.0,                       iove it     
282,5.0,                       i had previously used the spalding soft tac ball   both are synthetic  but the other felt a bit more rubberized   time will tell how this one holds up      
283,5.0,                       my daughter loved this gift and it was great quality  and full size  i would definatly buy this product again      
284,5.0,                       had this ball for a solid eight years now  pretty close to a game replica ball on an indoor court  but has the durability for outdoors  i ve put it pretty seriously through its paces outdoors  and while it held up for a couple years  it did eventually wear down overall  i would say this ball is a great pick if you want a great indoor ball that you can occasionally take outdoors  but i would go for something with more rubber in it if i played outdoors every day  the zi o is about as good as you can ask for in terms of outdoor durability from a leather ball  but the simple fact is that a leather ball will never be invincible outside      
285,2.0,                       the ball doesn t bounce right  even aired up hard as a rock  it bounces unevenly and not very well  it feels great  but plan on returning     
286,5.0,                       very nice basketball  correct size and durability is long enough      
287,5.0,                       great quality for both indoor and outdoor use   it met my expectations as i was giving it for a gift   it was a hit      
288,5.0,                       this is the best basketball i ve ever used considering how much it costs  i ve used it for   months now and it is still very reliable and i m still able to palm it as easily as i did on day    i would recommend people to store it indoors like what i did as that will help preserve its lifespan      
289,5.0,                       good ball for indoor     
290,5.0,                       it s the ball      
291,5.0,                       this is a great basketball  we use it outdoor in the street and it is awesome  i did not realize there was a big difference in basketballs until i used this one  it bounces smoothly and with little effort  the feel of the ball is soft and smooth but nubby at the same time  our last ball  cheap from a big box store  was bright orange  hard and we really needed to use effort to bounce it  this was a great upgrade  well worth it      
292,5.0,                       nephew loves it      
293,1.0,                       ball won t hold air  need to return      
294,5.0,                       i had purchase two of these baskeballs because the first one had popped when it bounced on top of a metal fense with arrows on top  that didn t stop me from buying the second ball because this was a quality product for a great price  the grip is great and doesn t lose air as fast as my other basketballs  it took about a week for each ball to ship to my house with it s original boxing  an outstanding product like this was going for ten to twenty dollars more at the local stores around my house  i would definitely buy this product again if anything were to happen to the one i have now      
295,5.0,                       professional high quality look and feel      
296,1.0,                       seemed cheap  did not dribble well  felt off  like a cheap replica of a basketball  wouldn t have bought it if i had seen it in person      
297,5.0,                       my son loves it     
298,5.0,                       very happy with purchase      
299,1.0,                       these zi o s have been the worst basketballs i ve purchased over the past few years  at one time  they were decent  the last   out of   that i purchased at big    the balls had that weird dead feeling bounce at proper inflation and when you fill it with a little more air  it doesn t bounce straight up  it goes a tiny bit off  been playing bball for over    years so you can feel it when there s something wrong with it  several of them also lost a tiny bit of air so you have to always pump it up a little bit  even after a few days  i ve switched to other spalding models or to the wilson jet pro and avoid the zi o s like the plague      
300,1.0,                       the ball wouldn t hold air after only a few uses outside      
301,5.0,                       it is exactly what he wanted      
302,5.0,                       our grandson was very excited to receive a new basketball for christmas very good quality      
303,5.0,                       great     
304,1.0,                       the initial red flag was the ball came without any sort of original packaging  just a basketball in a cardboard box  the ball came deflated  but was hard as a rock and would not bounce  i didn t even bother with it  returned it and will be looking for a different ball  the customer review that says this is  the goat  of outdoor basketballs is laughable      
305,4.0,                       this ball is great and has a nice feel  it s no evolution  which is my all time favorite ball and the game ball by unanimous decision whenever playing pick up at the gym  but still  it gets the job done and has a nice feel whether playing indoors or outdoors      
306,5.0,                       great basketball for the price  i got it for my son and he is very happy with it      
307,4.0,                       good     
308,5.0,                       awesome ball for outdoor courts  probably great indoors too  but haven t tried   it has a nice feel to it when dribbling and shooting      
309,5.0,                       it did a great job of bouncing and everyone had fun playing basketball for our family gathering  it looks like it will get lots of use      
310,5.0,                       excelente     
311,5.0,                       i used it outdoors a few times and given that the court was a bit dirty  the ball caught a coat of dust and became a bit slippery at times  i m looking forward to playing indoors again where i think the ball will excel      
312,5.0,                       i used a few times already  excellent grip and it feels excellent when you shoot it      
313,5.0,                       grand son loved it   years old     
314,5.0,                       very happy with the quality and price of this basketball      
315,5.0,                       my grandsons play all the time very durable     
316,5.0,                       good grip and came in the original packaging      
317,5.0,                         stars for the price  it shipped fully inflated  best grip of all the balls used at my nearby court  it does wear somewhat quickly  but that s the pitfall of the low price      
318,5.0,                       my son loves his basketball     
319,5.0,                       see ball  bounce ball  play ball with ball  see kid happy with new balls    they love it so much it keeps getting stolen so this is like the  rd one i bought because his friends love it so much they keep borrowing his balls   order more than one  as someone might try and steal your balls too  it s just that great     
320,5.0,                       perfect outdoor ball     
321,5.0,                       bought it for my    year old  he likes it  and his coach usually picks his ball to use for the team scrimmages now  ball has help up well after a month or so of use so far      
322,1.0,                       no air  took it to put air  and one day later the air is out  doesn t work      
323,2.0,                       bought as a replacement for my old indoor outdoor ball which had become pretty worn down and lost most of its grip  or so i thought   until i got this one  initially i thought that it just needed to be broken in a little but after a month of daily play i can say that this ball just doesn t want to grip  there is something just sort of   off about it  the material it s made out of  the way it bounces  etc  similar to other negative reviews on here  mine is consistently in need of air and by now i ve pretty much relegated this one to my trunk and gone back to old faithful      
324,5.0,                       my grandson loves it      
325,1.0,                       i bought   of these balls for a summer program   basketball was one of a host of activities we do with our middle school students so use was maybe only   hours a week tops    weeks in i notice staff was pumping up one of the new balls and thought little of it although i personally inflated the balls upon delivery     weeks in i reached for the ball and was surprised that it was so flat it would not bounce  there did not appear to be anything wrong with the valve   i pumped it up and kept it in my office for the week to see if there was a change in air pressure   at the end of the week the ball was dead and would only bounce a few inches from the floor with effort   logged on to amazon to initiate return only to find that i was not outside of the return window of time big waste   disappointment for a cash strapped non profit academic program      
326,5.0,                       quality     
327,5.0,                       love it      
328,4.0,                       this is our second zi o  we still have the first one      years  it s a bit worn  these are great basketballs for outdoor  or indoor i guess  they hold air forever  have great bounce   there may be even better basketballs  at least i know of one that i can depend on  if ever i need to buy a replacement     
329,4.0,                       it s a basketball  what can i say      
330,5.0,                       bouncy     
331,5.0,                       great product   exactly as is states and the ball has good grip      
332,3.0,                       solid outdoor bball but not indoor quality grip      
333,5.0,                       great ball      
334,1.0,                       it instantly becomes trash when it touches an outdoor court full of dust      
335,5.0,                       i ve had this basketball for sometime now and i use it outside all of the time   it is held up to the outdoor court and the weather conditions   good basketball      
336,1.0,                       the hardest ball i have ever shot with  no feeling  no touch  no bounce  no life in ball  flat the next morning      
337,5.0,                       lasted this long outside everyday with crazy kids  ball looks totally different but as expected  five four three two one      
338,1.0,                       this ball is real lousy  after a few uses  the surface coat will fall off  don t waste time on this      
339,2.0,                       pumped up past   lbs of pressure which is the recommended maximum pressure and the ball barely bounces to my waist when dropping it from eye level  it s not impossible to play with but it s more than enough to throw off my dribbling  i would recommend buying a different product      
340,5.0,                       i bought this ball for my son who loves basketball   he has some he uses inside and some he uses outside      
341,2.0,                       it takes a lot more force to dribble the ball than it should   i don t think it came under inflated  just a dud      
342,3.0,                       just go to your local sporting goods store and grab  feel  bounce the ball yourself to get a feel for it  thats the whole point right   the feel of your ball   id go for a ball made in the usa first but thats just me  i ended up getting a nike indoor ball  love it i use sports authority  because they are   minutes from my apartment aint nothin like having all the balls in front of your face and you can grab and feel em all you want      lmao      
343,5.0,                       great ball  nice grip  official size  no signs of any defect      
344,5.0,                       bought this for my boyfriend who s thousands of miles away from my atm  he loves it  the shipment was fast  super fast  thanks      
345,5.0,                       my big bro has a few  regulation  size basketballs and this is the only one he likes      
346,2.0,                       some of the seams are uneven and the ball is not quite round   the embossed areas for branding are very smooth and difficult to handle if they come up in your hand when shooting or dribbling   i have had     balls superior to this one   pretty disappointing for a     ball      
347,5.0,                       good     
348,5.0,                       this is a great basketball overall  the grip feels natural and the ball maintains it s air pressure very well  i compared a lot of basketballs before purchasing  and this one is definitely the best value  very happy     
349,5.0,                       awesome product      
350,4.0,                       this is a great ball mostly for indoor  outdoor however wears off a bit after a while  still usable and playable      
351,5.0,                       it is a good basketball for both outdoor and indoor      
352,5.0,                       great feel  no defects and reasonable price   i can t yet speak to its durability  but so far so good      
353,5.0,                       very nice good quality     
354,5.0,                       come on  it s a basketball  what s not to love  i got this for my daughter for christmas and we have been doing drills and shooting hoops every since  great family time

360,5.0,                       my boys plays with it all the time and said that it s a very good ball  has lasted for a while now as he plays on concrete with it and very little wear   tear so far on the ball      
361,1.0,                       was suppose to get it inflated  came half inflated  that should ve been my tell something is wrong  there is an air leak  i have to inflate it everytime i use it  and yeah  got it with the spalding airbumb  which broke in first use    so  here you go      
362,5.0,                       loved it     
363,5.0,                       i bought this ball for my daughter and she loves it     
364,3.0,                       good     
365,1.0,                       i generally like spalding but i don t recommend this ball  i have to pump air into every day because it goes flat      
366,4.0,                       a basketball     
367,5.0,                       if outdoor hooping is your thing this ball does the job   i bought the franklin air pump with it and haven t had one problem  added a little air and it gets a nice bounce and grip where it feels like a professional ball  i haven t heard any complaints from the guys so i assume it passes inspection  i ve used it for over    hours and it still looks brand new      
368,1.0,                       first time writing a product review  i pumped it one time and it won t hold air  this product is terrible  i wouldn t buy a basketball from amazon again  it s better to buy at a brick and mortar store to return it easily if it messes up      
369,5.0,                       this made a great gift  not to mention but good on the wallet also  it is of good quality material      
370,5.0,                       my son loves his new basketball  it arrived promptly  actually pretty fast and fully inflated  great purchase at a good price  thank you

373,5.0,                       great ball     
374,5.0,                       grandson very  pleased      
375,5.0,                       bought for sons rec league     
376,5.0,                       my grandson loved it    so it must be good      
377,5.0,                       just as decribed  came inflated        
378,5.0,                       as described      
379,1.0,                       after   hours of use on an indoor hardwood court it will no longer hold air  do not buy      
380,4.0,                    la pelota es muy inflable y bueno calidad   en persona el color es un naranja oscuro que me gusta   la pelota hace un sonido barato cuando toca el suelo   juego con la pelota por dentro y por la fuera y so sostiene bien  le doy cuatro estrellas         
381,5.0,                       grandson has enjoyed playing with this ball and it is still in excellent condition after seven months of use      
382,5.0,                       great basketball for older kids and adults      
383,5.0,                       excellent     
384,5.0,                       ball has a good feel and nice casing   holding up well      
385,4.0,                       well    for the price  you really can t beat it it s well made and will probably last a fairly long time  especially indoors   my only complaint is that it feels slightly heavier than other balls on the court  it s definitely the  official  nba size    but i m a bit skeptical about it being the proper weight  either way  i m happy with the purchase  it feels great in my hands and is much better than just about any ball at a comparable price overall  i d say it s a good buy  aj     
386,5.0,                       my son thought he lost this ball a few days ago  he was so upset  he said it was the best ball he s ever had  he s had it since christmas and said it had been his favorite basketball  he s had many   because it hadn t lost any of its grip yet which impressed him compared to other balls  luckily we found the ball and he has it back but i will definitely purchase this again when the time comes  i trust my basketball loving son s opinion      
387,2.0,                       quality below average      
388,5.0,                       outdoor and indoor just like it says   it s a great ball  i bought one for a friend and before i gifted him another friend saw it and went crazy over it  i wound up buying   all total   love it   got one for myself      
389,4.0,                       very nice basketball the leather is soft very good for indoor or outdoors too     
390,4.0,                       great outdoor basketball   have had for about   month   leather is good   ball bounces good   i use on driveway so it seems quality   would recommend      
391,4.0,                       so far so good  an excellent outdoor ball that is a good value  have used it for a few weeks and it looks like it will hold up  feels good in the hand      
392,4.0,                       i dont think i have ever gone wrong with spalding products   you pay  a little more but they seem to hold up better   we have had this ball for a long time and it is showing very little wear      
393,5.0,                       very nice     
394,2.0,                       i do like this ball  however  the ball is stamped on the inlet for the air so it makes weird bounces sometimes when playing  maybe a bad batch or qa        
395,5.0,                       i bought this for my nephews in an attempt to get them more interested in sports and less interested in sitting in front of a gaming system  my plan worked for a while  my nephews play on an outdoor asphalt court and have been using this basketball since christmas  so far it s holding up well and appears to be a good quality ball  i believe we only paid about     for it during a lightning sale we received exactly what is pictured and couldn t ask for more out of a basketball      
396,5.0,                       enjoyed shooting hoops with my older granddaughter christmas morning   she loved it     
397,5.0,                       an excellent basketball for outdoor use      
398,5.0,                       original great quality     
399,5.0,                       great ball     
400,1.0,                       i brought it all the way here in the philippines  and the problem is  the ball has a hole        
401,5.0,                       great ball   the appearance and durability described for this product was accurate      
402,5.0,                       great basketball     
403,5.0,                       excellent      
404,1.0,                       came deflated  not bouncy at all  worse than supermarket s    ball      
405,5.0,                       this was a gift for my    year old nephew for christmas   the basketball had great reviews so we will see if it holds up to its review after we use it      
406,1.0,                       the ball doesn t bounce well  even after filling it up with as much air as it will take      
407,5.0,                       works as expected     
408,5.0,                       all perfect     
409,3.0,                       came a little flat just not a lot of bounce      
410,3.0,                       all the reviews i read rating this ball top outdoor seem unreal   right out of the box the grip was slippery  i got smaller hands for being     and just hard to get good handles and shot is off with slippery grip      
411,5.0,                       we bought these for our church youth group   they were easy to inflate and have a good  gripping  surface   durable to a lot of indoor use      
412,5.0,                       possibly the best ball you can get in this price range  our kids like it  nice tacky feel to it and better quality than the cheaper balls in the box stores  its used     indoors and i am dubious that it would hold up well outdoors  despite the indoor outdoor name      
413,1.0,                       lob sided so i returned it      
414,3.0,                       very small basketball  good for children teens  any adult would find this too small      
415,5.0,                       my son goes through basketballs pretty fast  i was looking for a replacement and stumbled across this one  he loves it so far      
416,5.0,                       i am a high level basketball coach and trainer and these basketballs are the real deal top of the line  your players will love these basketballs      
417,3.0,                       a little plastic feel to it      
418,5.0,                       great basketball      
419,1.0,                       it arrived flat  no bounce at all  very disappointed      
420,5.0,                       really great ball  nice feeling on both indoor and outdoor court  will recommend     
421,5.0,                       love it  great leather quality      can t go wrong     this is a very high quality for price    gotta have a bb around     
422,5.0,                       pumped this baby up and it has a great bounce   i just got is so that is all i can say right now

426,5.0,                       great ball  usually use it for outdoor games  recommend it to anyone who enjoys playing basketball with a ball  yeah      
427,4.0,                       this was a birthday gift for my nephew who is also big into lacrose  football and basketball   this ball is perfect for playing on cement outdoor courts and asphalt   the bounce and the lifespan of this ball are much better than average      
428,1.0,                       i got size   ice skates instead and when i returned them i had to pay       for a box      
429,2.0,                       this is really not an outdoor ball and i actually thought it was leather when i purchased it and it isn t it s rubber that of course was my fault but it s really not an outdoor ball at all      
430,5.0,                       great basketball for outdoor and indoor use

434,5.0,                       bought this for my    yo son who plays both indoors and outside  he needed a ball for when he s at the gym because he said the balls there  are a joke   i had no idea what to buy so i picked this one because i heard of spalding and it looked pretty compared to every other one  i did good because my son really likes it and he said his friends preferred using this ball over theirs  he s only used it indoors except for bouncing the ball while walking to the gym  he said it grips well and  no self esteem issues here  he said it makes him even more awesome than normal lol  he did have to add air once   he said it was ok right out the box but a bit more air would make it perform better  i m just happy it s one less thing for him to complain about and so far it seems to hold up well      
435,1.0,                       ordered this basketball because of the great reviews  the first one i received would not bounce right  my friends and i would dribble the ball straight down and it would go off to a completely different direction coming back up like it was lopsided which wasn t the case  ordered a second one and had the same issue    the quality of the black lines along the ball is horrible  the lines aren t flush and are poorly made  i believe they are the culprit of the bad bounce  would not recommend      
436,5.0,                       good quality      
437,5.0,                       great quality   good ball

441,5.0,                       good ball  good price  very satisfied      
442,1.0,                       ball inflates but quickly deflates over time  avoid buying this      
443,5.0,                       i wanted a basketball to replace a    basketball that starting bulging within just a month s worth of use on an outdoor court  this one is better in every way  highly recommended      
444,5.0,                       great     
445,5.0,                       great ball

449,5.0,                       nice ball i wanna play with my friends right now      
450,5.0,                       we bought this as a  first ball  for my son who was wanting to shoot in the driveway   holding up well and held air well through the colder months      
451,5.0,                       just what my grandson wanted      
452,2.0,                       i have always been a fan of spalding basketballs  especially in synthetic leather  i bought my first one about   yrs  ago  so i was really disappointed with the quality of this ball  it has a great feel out of the box  and plays well especially outdoors  unfortunately  in   months the outer cover started to crumble  this ball would have lasted longer if it was made out of rubber  that s a sad commentary  hopefully it was a  bad  one      
453,5.0,                       living in afghanistan   i have a small court outside for recreation  i knew this kind of ball was perfect for such a place  it isn t cheap rubber but at the same time not pure leather which is better for indoors  it keeps its tread well even on harsh concrete      
454,5.0,                       i love this basketball  looks good  bounce good  doesn t get dirty  doesn t lose air  we use it on an outside court but storage it inside the house     
455,5.0,                       grandkids have fun with the ball      
456,5.0,                       grandson loved this     
457,5.0,                       a solid  worthy outdoor ball  much more durable than cheaper few use balls  it does need to be broken in a bit and much like all balls  suffers when the ground s wet  but over all a worthwhile purchase      
458,5.0,                       perfect     
459,5.0,                       item was what we needed   arrived on time      
460,1.0,                       if i can choose zero star  i d definitely choose it  the ball arrived looks like no problem  however  after i inflated the ball for the first time  it didn t even look like a round ball  somewhere arise up  i totally wasted    dollars on it  never purchase this  ever      
461,5.0,                       great ball for the price      
462,5.0,                       great for my neighbors kids to use

465,5.0,                       best ball     
466,5.0,                       everyone loves this ball  whenever i come out to play with the guys at work  it s always chosen as the game ball  even if there are     other balls  this one gets picked all the time it s kept the air for over   months now  i still haven t had to pump it again      
467,1.0,                       ball had hole in it    will not keep air in it      
468,5.0,                       glad i made the purchase   it s a great value   i made a hit with my   year old grandson at christmas    grampa  you da man       
469,5.0,                       my    year old grandson loves it

471,5.0,                       the quality is great making it very durable  i bought this ball to just shoot around during quarantine very impressed by the grip and bounce  initially i thought it was a bit pricey but you are getting your money s worth      
472,5.0,                       it was a great gift for my grandson and he loved it      
473,5.0,                       my fianc  loved this ball  great quality and it s so nice that it comes with a pump so that he can refill it when he needs      
474,5.0,                       my son loves it     
475,2.0,                       this ball is inferior to an outdoor dedicated ball because it wears out very quickly it is a poor indoor ball because it is too hard  does not break in well  and is very slippery when hands get sweaty by attempting to do both  it does nether well  however  as far as indoor outdoor balls go  this is one of the better ones  compared to the other spalding models and it is superior to any of the indoor outdoor wilson models      
476,4.0,                       bought for gift to nephew and he loves it      
477,5.0,                       the basketball was exactly what i expected  quality was very good  great grip  no blemishes or defects  i did order through the amazon fulfillment center after reading reviews suggesting quality issues through other sources  i am using the ball regularly outdoors on concrete  still early but the grip and finish are holding up well      
478,5.0,                       the basketball came quick and on time  great buy  would definitely buy again  exactly what my son wanted      
479,5.0,                       awsome ball cuz i got it on the lightning deal  p glad to have my own ball to take to the gym     
480,5.0,                       hold and dnt let it out your site so good mines got stolen and i only looked away for a second still looking for this kid today if u know where he is or if he is watching contact me     
481,2.0,                       honestly i m disappointed that i didn t buy this locally or least look there first   once this ball got dirty it was no better than any other ball out there   most of it s grip is gone within a week of using it      
482,5.0,                       got as a gift for my    yr old nephew who goes to the park to play basket ball all the time      very pleased with this  well mad looks good  he loves it and it has held up well out lasting other balls that he has gotten   bought at achristmas and still going strong and looks nice in july  uses all the time      
483,5.0,                       great quality for indoor and outdoor  if you want a high quality basketball for a cheap price than this is it      
484,1.0,                       not good at all feels like throwing a somewhat heavy paper napkin can t get accuracy with this ball  save some money and buy a better ball      
485,1.0,                       really disappointed  the ball had a bump when i received it      
486,5.0,                       this basketball arrived on time and in perfect condition  the packing slip said it was a woman s pink and mauve ball  so i called customer service for the seller s  they were very nice and helpful  before processing the exchange  i figured i should at least open the box and make sure what was inside was the same as what was on the packing slip  to my surprise  it was the regular ball that i had ordered  not what the packing slip said  the customer service person was nice about the whole situation      
487,5.0,                       nice  simple and good looking basket ball from spalding   we were looking for just a simple ball  nothing too fancy to bring to the local park for some hoops   this is the one   great grip  does not scuff to easily and has a nice color for contrast on the court      
488,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          a great basketball with soft and squishy feeling  it has a nice texture color  black gold   not real leather composite  it can be used outside but  rough surface can damage the ball instantly  dust can stick on it very easily and the ball isn t that grippy so suggest to put little bit of water in your hand and dry a little bit to get a better grip  nice color   good looking  ok bouncing  good feeling when shooting  it is a really nice ball and giving   stars because of how they deliver the ball and negative parts of it      
489,1.0,                       this is my first time buying a basketball so maybe i should have expected this for      but the ball loses air a lot  even on consecutive days i find myself having to repump and the ball is half flat after a week  do not buy      
490,5.0,                       product as described  packaging great  extra fast delivery  loved the delivery pic  very happy customer      
491,5.0,                       great basket ball      
492,1.0,                       summary  stay away  look elsewhere when i first got this ball  i was extremely excited about it but i was very mistaken  the ball has always bounced hard and never broke in but instead  as seen in pic    completely lost the  leather  and grip  the ball has picked up dust from the first dribble and has always been slippery  even if i cleaned it   everyone on the court disliked the ball and i definitely wouldn t recommend it  look for another one      
493,5.0,                       great quality     
494,5.0,                       my husband wanted this ball and so far he has no complaint so i rated it highly  would definitely recommend to any basketball enthusiasts      
495,5.0,large     x     and soft       cotton tennis towels  pack of    white  pink    springcreek gear
496,5.0,                       great basketball      
497,5.0,                       great     
498,4.0,                       sticky but not as much grip as expected      
499,5.0,                       this basketball lives up to the quality that i have come to expect from spalding  it seems very durable and would be good for both indoor and outdoor use  it s also a great value for someone looking for a quality basketball without wanting to pay for a more expensive ball      
500,5.0,                       great       
501,4.0,                       good quality  but not the best      
502,5.0,                       liked     
503,5.0,                       not that way you sicko      but it bounces nicely when properly filled with air also  i can make a lot of baskets with this and it is named after my favorite all time movie character  spalding  judge smale s grandson in caddyshack      
504,5.0,                       it was the perfect basketball for my grandson who plays on a team  he is picky and he loves it      
505,1.0,                       would not recommend this ball or ordering from amazon  would not hold air and went flat immediately  happened to a friend also who bought the same ball for his son off of this site  be careful before purchasing      
506,5.0,                       great quality  just have to break it in      
507,1.0,                       been buying this same ball regularly for a while now  this last one feels like a knockoff  maybe it is a different manufacturer or the same one decided to lower the quality  made of plastic that provides no grip  and the size is also slightly smaller than official  waste of money      
508,5.0,                       not much to say other than it s a nice basketball and i have absolutely no complaints about it   i d definitely buy another      
509,5.0,                       very good     
510,5.0,                       excellent product     
511,4.0,                       does what is needed   well built   holds air   shoots pure      
512,4.0,                       basketballs last a long time and are not expensive   why would you want to save     and get a cheap ball when you can get this great basketball   lots of feel  limited  slippage   and true bounces   i should have purchased two of these so that everyone isn t fighting over  the good ball  when going for rebounds    if you don t know what i mean than you might as well purchase a cheap ball      
513,1.0,                       really disappointed  every time i put air in the ball it would be deflated by the end of the day  i only dribbled indoors so i wasn t sure if this ball was defected or not  but i d like to try another one that maybe lasts longer then a few hours      
514,5.0,                       i ordered   by accident  my grandson friend immediately purchased the  nd one  they really like this brand     
515,5.0,                       nice ball  worth the money     
516,1.0,                       the air keep going out of the ball you guys gave me a ball with a slow leak  i m just now trying the ball out      
517,5.0,                       good     
518,5.0,                       i bought it for my friend in china      
519,5.0,                       great      
520,2.0,                       bought two  one arrived flat  aired it up and keeps going flat every couple hours  returning      
521,3.0,                       you get what you pay for i guess  not a great outdoor ball      
522,5.0,                       i liked it  felt quality     
523,5.0,                       we ve been playing regularly in our dead end with a small group since covid and this ball has held up and was great out of the box   it s not as soft as some of the other balls but it feels more durable and hasn t lost much grip in the month of use we ve had it for so far      
524,5.0,                       i bought this for my grandson a year ago  he practices on his cement driveway and this ball holds up well  very good quality  would recommemd     
525,5.0,                       my son will not put it down  great product      
526,3.0,                       beautiful ball in color and feel  but the air input nipple is clearly raised a full      around the needle input  this is a disaster for reliable dribbling  i am convinced the online marketplace are seconds and rejects  would be easy to see and feel this raised area in a physical retail store  and likely rejected by the retail mgr to avoid returns      
527,5.0,                       great feel  seems durable  everyone uses it for pickup games  spend a little more on ur basketball its worth it     
528,4.0,                       good basketball  can t beat it for the money  only complaint is that it tends to get slick when playing outside      
529,5.0,                       good  grip for outdoor use  it bounces true   i m  pretty happy with it      
530,3.0,                       too bouncy     
531,5.0,                       ballz     
532,5.0,                       great ball     
533,3.0,                       nice ball however i have to re inflate every week or so   not sure if that is normal or not  i don t think it is      
534,4.0,                       good ball that i use both indoor and outdoor  with any ball and outdoor use  the material will start to wear away and fade  their are better balls out there  but at this price this one has served me well without complaints      
535,2.0,                       first one i got didn t hold air   second one is better so far     
536,5.0,                       great ball for the money      
537,4.0,                       gift     
538,5.0,                       quality articles  with all the features you mentioned  recommend the article for all those that starts in basketball  either large or small      
539,5.0,                       it handles well  has good bounce to it and is what i have been looking for which is a professional ball with good control  it is described as being regulation weight and that is what it feels like  definitely not lower end  it is an above average ball      
540,1.0,                       the ball leaks and i need to pump it every week      
541,3.0,                       the way it was packaged   appeared used     
542,5.0,                       i like this ball a lot  i ve been using it for a few weeks now  it comes inflated  but you may need to put more air in it for optimal bounce  no big deal  the grip on the ball is great initially  but it wears off real quick  like one use quick  but it still feels nice  i ve been using it on a well paved outdoor court  i haven t had any issues with loss of air thus far      
543,5.0,                       quality ball  would definitely recommend to others      
544,5.0,                       i use basketball for my dog to play with  lasted a long time even with max roughhousing with it      
545,1.0,                       a piece of junk  not worth   cent      
546,5.0,                       my grandson loved it      
547,5.0,                       whatever prior problems with the photo must have been fixed because we received the exact ball in the photo  were also pleased that it did not require any air before use  good ball for the money      
548,5.0,                       must be good  it got stolen after just a few uses      
549,5.0,                       awesome quality     
550,5.0,                       good quality basket balls   fast service      
551,2.0,                       played basketball on outdoor court for about   hrs  came back next day and the ball was noticeably lopsided  i am looking into a different ball soon  we use someone else s ball  unless mine is the only one available      
552,5.0,                       this is the exact basketball i am looking for very suitable for both outdoor and indoor courts the shipping is fast and has the return label      
553,5.0,                       unfortunately my happiness lasted for   weeks only   im very disappointed as l bought this ball and shipped it to costa rica  so total waste of          it wont stay inflated      
554,5.0,                       scores and dribbles     
555,5.0,                       i played basketball with my friends for a long time very elastic  very fun     
556,5.0,                       i m far from being any good at basketball  but i like the feel of this ball  it s got decent grip  bounces appropriately    it just doesn t go in the basket much when i throw it  not sure why      
557,5.0,                       grandson loves it takes it every where he goes  just ordered his dad one cuz he takes it when he plays and son gets mad      
558,4.0,                       i had initially bought an indoor ball  but didn t want to ruin it by mainly playing out side  i purchased this ball for the reason to play outdoors  it s been more than a month and i ve been using it twice a week   the texture doesn t feel too cheap  rubbery or plastic y  the channels are great for grip and clutch shooting  the weight feels okay the only con is that on certain dusty outdoor courts it will make the ball slippery   overall i d say this is a great ball to practice and play pick up games with      
559,2.0,                       i bought product as gift for my brother  he played with it for   weeks until ball started to lose grip  even after he as careful as he could  the ball still lost its entire grip in a month  in addition to its grip the ball started to lose air  we have had to pump it every time we play      
560,5.0,                       my grandson had worn out an outdoor basketball  so was thrilled to get this one for christmas  i understand that it works just fine          
561,5.0,                       great grip  functions indoor and outdoor really well     
562,5.0,                       my daughtee is very happy with it     
563,2.0,                       it arrived fine  fully inflated and ready to go     days later  and i need to fill it every day before i use it   sure it has a better feel than a cheaper rubber ball would  but they re all kinda crappy anyway so why spend the money      
564,5.0,                       great     
565,3.0,                       let s say the good part this ball  really nice touch  great grip feel  probably the best outdoor basketball i ever played bad part  don t last long  i mean  i play several times each week  on a nice ground  after   weeks  it was no longer a ball shape  you can feel that  and if you spin it  you can see that easily then i contacted the wilson customer service  they fast gave me another  which is a zi o variation  darker color tho  still after   months  i love wilson indoor basketball  i really do  i bought   in last   years  i lost   of them in gym   those outdoor ball could have been the best  however the quality control needs to be improved      
566,1.0,                       after a few days the new ball partially deflated   defective      
567,5.0,                       my kids are having a great time with it  glad we purchased a good one this time  it is well made and should last for years to come      
568,5.0,                       was such an easy way to do my christmas shopping  arrived fast and was packaged nicely  also got this item at a great price       
569,5.0,                       for an outdoor ball  considering the price  it cannot be beat  perfect      
570,4.0,                       good ball  would be nicer if it had a more durable cover     
571,5.0,                       good weight and grip     
572,5.0,                       great

576,2.0,                       we purchased this spalding basketball for our son in december of        it was a great basketball at first but the composite cover doesn t hold up well to the elements over time   it might be better if it was stored indoors but we don t do that   i m attaching a photo with this ball and a nike indoor outdoor basketball that is about   years older than the spalding and both have been stored outside in the same place   you be the judge      
577,5.0,                       great ball for outdoor games and likely indoor      
578,5.0,                       this basketball has awesome quality and it is easy to grip and handle  i highly suggest you purchase this basketball      
579,4.0,                       decent     
580,1.0,                       ball was supposed to arrive inflated for use   but was only partially inflated  i inflated it  but every morning it was deflated again  would not hold air  after a few days i returned it      
581,4.0,                       it s a nice basket ball for    dollars  except that it leaks gas gradually  if you buy this one  i suggest you have to buy a air inflat      
582,5.0,                       this ball is very well made  has a nice grip and good bounce  right out the box   need to get out more   this is a nice ball

585,5.0,                       great  true weight of the ball  durable      
586,5.0,                       excelente     
587,1.0,                       it is weird   it is out of round and bounces randomly   it also loses air every   days   its junk buy something else  i purchased a smaller  kid s ball  that was the same brand model   it is a different color  better textured material and is otherwise fantastic   it leads me to believe that this may be a fake knockoff      
588,5.0,                       good outdoor or practice balls      
589,5.0,                       my daughter is having so much fun playing with her basketball  i ve thoroughly checked this product over and it s very good for both indoor and outdoor use      
590,5.0,                       thanks     
591,5.0,                       this is the second one i ve bought for my son  he wore the heck out it and needed a new one  this was a great choice for my teenage son      
592,5.0,                       the ball is great  it has a good grip and is perfect for playing street ball  our ball came with a pump  which wasn t expected  the pump it arrived with wasn t very good quality  as the needle was lose  i can t complain since i wasn t buying the pump i was buying the ball  just make sure when you buy it  you have a way to air it up  as it did arrive not fully pumped  this is typical for any ball you purchase so i expected it  overall  the ball was a great deal and my son continues to get daily use out of it  while it holds up on our streets gravel      
593,5.0,                       was a great gift and price  came on time and fast      
594,5.0,                       great durability      
595,4.0,                       the grip on this ball is excellent and i can trust that it wont pop while i m playing  had one of my man of the math performances with this ball  shot   three pointers      
596,5.0,                       nice ball for beginner  granddaughter is happy with it      
597,5.0,                       over all a good basketball  this was bought for our son who uses it indoors  with the proper inflation number  this ball has good grip and bounces as expected      
598,5.0,                       nice ball for the playground   has the same quality feel and craftsmanship as the balls i played with in high school      
599,4.0,                       this is a great ball  i ve had four or five in the last years and it s good for playing indoor and outdoor  it feels great and has a very good grip  i use it on pavement allmost every weekend through the year and it last about one or one and a half year  great value for the money  don t let it stay wet  dry it out quickly and clean it up from dirty water or mud  or the  skin  will start to lift off      
600,5.0,                       this was a household christmas gift to grandma and grandpa  my son was thrilled for the upgrade  thank you great and speedy service  happy new year     
601,5.0,                       this was bought for a teenager and he loved it   nice quality  has already been used by a group of his friends and got the   star raitng     
602,1.0,                       i have purchased this ball before  a few years ago  and have tried several different ones throughout the years  this ball used to be a good top of the line outdoor ball  from day one the panels started coming up at the seams  i tried to ignore it for the most part  also has a fake feel to the skin itself  channels are not too deep  and the grip itself gets slippery pretty easy  i have played for about    years  and have a pretty good feel for the game  primarily run pg and sg on the court so the feel of the ball is important to me as it is for many other players  i did not attempt to return this ball  i put a blade in it to end the misery  and so noone else would have to use such a crap ball should note that the previous ball i purchased was great  it lasted a long time and had a good feel  it s possible this one was a bad batch  but seemed to be doomed either way      
603,5.0,                       great basketball  my husband had to add a little more air out of the box   it was good to go      
604,5.0,                       nice ball   gonna last a long time   still not all that easy to get it in the hoop   i guess i should have asked for instructions         
605,1.0,                       this specific basketball was new but warped     
606,4.0,                       sufficient for outdoor courts     
607,3.0,                       not the greatest rock   seems somewhat cheaply made   the synthetic panels don t quite meet evenly  the air valve is a bit raised  creating a bit of a lump  the logo is kinda crooked   the ball works but is more of a chinese made knock off than nba game ball     
608,5.0,                       great quality        
609,5.0,                       what can be said my grandson is enjoying it very much      
610,4.0,                       the ball wore out kinda quickly   we used it  x in a pickup league   lasted well for about   months was unplayable in about      months   we ended up switching to a nike ball that seems to be holding up much better      
611,3.0,                       great ball but it s slightly heavy grip is fantastic  but collects lots of dirt material seems to be very durable came completely inflated i would not recommend for people who actually play competitive ball  just spend a bit more  and buy an evolution      
612,5.0,                       you all did better with the balls     
613,4.0,                       love it      
614,5.0,                       great feel and excellent quality for a ball that can be used indoor or outdoor      
615,5.0,                       the grip is amazing and i can shoot this ball better than any other  but i haven t used it in a actual regulation game i was playing pick up ball not too long ago and people started complaining about how slippery the ball was if your hands are sweaty the ball does lose a noticeably amount of grip besides that i do love this basketball      
616,5.0,                       nice durable basketball     
617,5.0,                       great ball has great air and control best in indoor court having a really great time with the ball thankyiu     
618,4.0,                       have only gotten the chance to use it twice  maybe it needs some more breaking in but the grip could be better  overall good for the price  although if you can spare about another    bucks i would get a wilson evolution if you plan on mostly playing indoors like me since the cold weather here in chicago is starting to settle in      
619,5.0,                       if this won t make you a baller  switch to ping pong     
620,4.0,                       got this basketball to use at the school and park   great quality and lasts long   i would recommend this for anyone would just want to play recreational basketball   i believe this ball can also be great for serious games      
621,5.0,                       i bought this ball for my daughter for indoor and outdoor use   works great and is made of excellent quality      
622,4.0,                       this is a good basketball so far as durability goes   because it is an outdoor indoor ball however  it does have that synthetic leather feel to it   if your looking for a solely indoor ball with authentic soft leather  i recommend you look somewhere else  if you just want something to shoot around with and a casual basis and want something that will last a long time  look no further      
623,4.0,                       quality control could be better on seam   able to see white cushion material on one of the seams   otherwise my son enjoys this product greatly      
624,5.0,                       best basketball we bought for our grandson      
625,3.0,                       the ball has started peeling after   months of minimal use   it also doesn t bounce as well as expected      
626,1.0,                       received a dirty  used ball      
627,5.0,                       love it  just like the pros      
628,4.0,                       great ball i only use indoors but nice bounce and grip  also ship rather quickly      
629,5.0,                       pretty good     
630,5.0,                       bought this for my    year old   he loves it and he and his older brother shoot hoops with it a lot      
631,2.0,                       needs air who expected this     
632,3.0,                       i didn t notice it at first but when i went out to use the ball i found out is was slightly lopsided  you can t see it just by looking at it but when i spin it on my finger it wobbled vigorously  other than that its a very nice ball  i just happened to get a bad one      
633,3.0,                       decent basketball  the cover began to peel after a couple months   disappointing durability     
634,4.0,                       i like the control and the feeling of this ball there is not much time since i  ve got it  i hope it will last too much it delivered to me fast thanks      
635,4.0,                       its getting lots of use and holding up great     
636,1.0,                       very low quality          
637,5.0,                       great product   arrived quickly   as advertised   thanks       
638,2.0,                       the ball came promptly in the mail and so we blew it up  bounced okay  but sounds weird vs a normal basketball should sound  after about   weeks or so  we noticed the skin started to come off the creases  a very poor glue job  a poor glue used  not really sure  normally  i have used a wilson basketball  i actually just thew my two away i have used for the past    years  yes     years and this new spalding lasted     weeks with issues showing  not sure if i got a dud or if this is the actual quality  consider this when purchasing  thank you      
639,5.0,                       nice product     
640,5.0,                       great ball but delivered flat     
641,1.0,                       ball felt pretty good out of the box   unfortunately  it didn t even last a week   it s already got a leak in it   i wouldn t pay   dollars for this ball   not durable enough for outdoors   not good enough for indoors   don t waste your money      
642,5.0,                       i personally like the grip  official size      
643,2.0,                       this ball has no bounce  disappointed for the price      
644,3.0,                       it s super grippy and perfect for grabbing and dribbling  the leather soft  which is great  but not so durable      
645,5.0,                       good product  good for both indoor and outdoor  it looks nice on the exterior  i recommend this if your looking for a good bball      
646,1.0,                       this product is clearly fake since the ball can t keep air and deflates by the next day  it bounces oddly and the panels immediately start to peel off as the ball is deflated  lastly you can also tell it s fake since the upc code is stamped onto the surface  real balls have them stickered  amazon needs to do some quality control with their vendors and partners that sell this garbage      
647,1.0,                       correct me if i m wrong   but balls are supposed to bounce  this ball doesn t hold air  company wanted to open a case     take pictures  explain what happened to my purchase  seems they just want me to go away  so i will  buyer beware      
648,5.0,                       replacement ball for my son and he is impressed with the feel        
649,1.0,                       the size is smaller than what i expected  the weight of the ball is too light than the usual basketball      
650,5.0,                       arrived earlier than anticipated   great quality      
651,5.0,                       i just got my ball through the mail  and let me tell you  it s exactly what i was expecting for the price  i play a lot of basketball indoors  but with the summer in the horizon  gyms tend to get really packed  thus  forcing me to play on an outside court  this ball seems to be durable and able to take the punishment that a cement court has to offer      
652,5.0,                       great quality      
653,5.0,                       good basketball     
654,1.0,                       came in deflated and didn t bounce  bad quality  and overall not good      
655,5.0,                       was totally shocked how nice this basketball was  this was a great buy because of the product and price  fast shipping even with the busy holiday shipping going on  thanks for another perfect amazon experience      
656,3.0,                       slight quality issues as one piece of the ball appears to be coming unglued a little on the edge   will keep an eye on it      
657,4.0,                       good ball     
658,5.0,                       this was a gift to my husband and he loves it  very good purchase      
659,4.0,                       i use it on pavement allmost every weekend through the year and it last about one or one and a half year  great value for the money   if your looking for a solely indoor ball with authentic soft leather  i recommend you look somewhere else      
660,4.0,                       it s round   it bounces good   occasionally it goes through the hoop   would rate it higher if it went through every time   i use it outside only and i don t play often so i m probably not a good judge of durability   i can palm it   i m not a man designed to play basket ball so this is why i rated it   for gripability     
661,5.0,                       gave this to my    year old grandson for his birthday  well made  good buy      
662,5.0,                       i love the product it meet my expectation thanks to the seller      
663,5.0,                       have had this basketball for quite a few months now  and love it  feels good in hands  good grip  and very durable  i play both indoors and outdoors  and the ball plays well on both courts  of course it is much better suited for indoor use  but what basketball isn t  if you primarily play outside  this is a good choice due to price  and quality of the synthetic leather used  in all the months i ve been playing  it s still looking almost brand new  where as other balls i ve used in the past quickly took on tears  this is a good pick for both types of play  outside or in  and certainly a good deal for the price  i would recommend this ball for it s quality  price  and how it plays well on any type of surface  unless you primarily play indoors  in which you should consider a full leather basketball  this is the best deal      
664,5.0,                       my great nephew loves this ball  it has a great grip and can be played inside or outside   the quality is good and love the look and feel      
665,5.0,                       fun playing      
666,5.0,                       good quality   just as seller described   thanks for being top of the line      
667,5.0,                       my husband loves this bb   rec d timely      
668,5.0,                       great value   as always  well made ball      
669,5.0,                       the surface is pretty hard and stiff  some will pretty those balls with a softer touch  but i find this basketball suitable for me      
670,3.0,                       the ball seems okay to me  it bounces okay unlike others who complained about it  handling of the ball feels okay too  the reason for the   stars is because the ball collects a lot of dirt and it transfers to your hands  also  the black strips on the ball feels a little sticky  i hope the sticky feel goes away after playing more with the ball  i m still not happy with the fact that my hands are full of dirt after playing and i mean black dirty palm hands      
671,5.0,                       came in time works both inside and out     
672,3.0,                       based on the reviews outside of amazon and some of the ones here  this was supposed to be the best outdoor basketball  i go to the courts early in the morning to shoot around for exercise and i use the ball weekly for about a hour  in two months  it has lost a lot of its grip  i constantly have to wash the ball because it sticks to all dirt and dust  it s also heavier when compared to other basketballs i ve tried  if you re a serious baller  i would look elsewhere  this summer  i ll try another ball out in hopes it performs better than this one      
673,2.0,                       several of the panels seem to be pulling away from the seams   haven t even dribbled the ball yet  but seems like poor workmanship to say the least      
674,5.0,                       grip is nice     
675,5.0,                       great quality  as expected      
676,5.0,                       good quality     
677,2.0,                       when i first got this ball  it felt smooth  and made with high quality products  i started using it and i didn t like the feel of it  and i was shooting very poorly  i didn t think much of it though  but on the second day i started using the ball  and it started to peel  needless to say i will not be getting this ball again      
678,5.0,                       great indoor outdoor ballit really feels perfect in your hand while dribbling and the grip definitely helps when pulling up for a jump shot or quickly moving the ball with your hands  it s weight is dead on  doesn t lose air quickly and has no marks after playing    hours or so in the street  then playing a few hours in the gym  not   day  the lifespan of the ball so far      
679,1.0,                       after inflating  ball will slowly lose air to the point of becoming unplayable within   hours     
680,5.0,                       ever since i was a little baby  i always be dribblin in fac   i was de baddest dribbler in the whole neighborhoodthen one day  my mama bought me this basketballand i love this basketballbut seriously  great quality  weight  durability      
681,4.0,                       a little smaller than expected     
682,5.0,                       my son uses it all the time  loves it  great value for the price     
683,4.0,                       great feel and texture  gets flat a little too easy or maybe i am storing it incorrectly  indoor or outdoor use      
684,3.0,                       the basketball that amazon has pictured is a higher quality ball then the one you get   i ordered the ball thinking i got the zi o excel basketball   this basketball is the zi o basketball   the excel and this ball are definitely two different balls   this ball is a little harder and not as fine quality   amazon needs to stop having things like this happen where it puts pictures of wrong merchandise on its website      
685,5.0,                       that s a great basketball  the delivery was faster and the ball is ready to play      
686,5.0,                       this ball feels great   the grips are spectacular and this ball is holding up better on the cement than all others      
687,5.0,                       i ve used the ball for several weeks now and it has performed well  the surface has a good grip to it which makes it easy to handle  the ball is light with a nice bounce so you don t have to put too much effort into dribbling  all around this is an excellent basketball for both indoor and outdoor play  it isn t always the first one picked but has never been the last option      
688,4.0,                       this is a great indoor basketball based on its price  good touch  and nice looking  if you re looking for something better  however  go for the wilson evolution  which is simply the best i ve ever used      
689,5.0,                       my son and his friends love this ball   they play with it in the gym and on concrete   great grip  good feel and holding up well so far      
690,5.0,                       good basketball for the price      
691,5.0,                       feels great  good ball for any occasion     
692,5.0,                       i wanted an outdoor basketball for casual use  after does some research this ball was one of the top  it feels good in my hands which was my top requirement  good deal and i would buy it again      
693,3.0,                       it came flat  so now i have to go purchase an air pump      
694,5.0,                       as expected      
695,5.0,                       my grandson loves it  his last spalding professionsl level basket ball disappered when his friend left it outside the church door so he doesn t lend this one out unless he is right there on the playground      
696,4.0,                       needs better grip   i play mostly outdoors and if you are playing outdoors its grip is amazing until about after a week or two of good use its grip fades away      
697,3.0,                       ball gets very slick outdoors  it does not bother me but i probably would not recommend this for anything but practicing ball handling with      
698,5.0,                       looks professional but did not have the chance of testing it yet on a real  playground      
699,4.0,                       what may baby girl asked me for and she loves it      
700,5.0,                       i played it with couple of times already and i am loving it  so are my friends  build quality and material is very good      
701,5.0,                       great feel     
702,5.0,                       everything about this basketball is just the embodiment of perfect  it super durable and can be used for months upon months  probably years  overall  i could gladly say that i m happy with my purchase     
703,5.0,                       this is a good quality indoor outdoor basketball   it holds up quite well   i have not had any issues with it whatsoever

705,5.0,                       this is a great ball  fantastic grip  not too smooth like lots of outdoor balls  and great overall feel      
706,5.0,                       very happy with this product     
707,5.0,                       great basketball  i still use it   years later   in decent condition   i play basketball     times a week  outdoor   it s what i was looking for  would definitely recommend to others playing outdoor      
708,1.0,                       we continually have to air it back up each day we use it   we can air it up and play for a day but by the next afternoon it is flat again      
709,5.0,                       like     
710,5.0,                       great for indoor and outdoor  it feels great for playing specially outdoor  no regret at all about this purchase      
711,5.0,                       great basketball  highly recommended      
712,5.0,                       great rock     
713,5.0,                       very good     
714,4.0,                       ball is good but came not fully pumped up   is that normal      
715,5.0,                       the boll is original and it s very nice      
716,5.0,                       everything was great     
717,5.0,                       great gift     
718,4.0,                       when i received the basketball  there was a crack along the black line  i felt it would become more obvious before i played for a long time  so i thought i could change it  and when i changed it again  i was very satisfied     
719,5.0,                       great basketball  my son loves it and uses it indoors and outdoors      
720,4.0,                       more of a indoor ball     
721,1.0,                       a majority of the shots i take with this ball fail to go in the hoop      
722,1.0,                       came deflated  won t hold air      
723,5.0,                       great for outdoor courts      
724,1.0,                       small that i hope     
725,4.0,                       ball is a good quality ball  but it was just a ball in a cardboard box  not like what you see on the shelf at the store in the display packaging      
726,5.0,                       the ball is great  good grip  good quality     
727,5.0,                       this ball finds itself outside most of the time  in the elements  has held up well  really a good purchase for outdoor play      
728,1.0,                       showed up  took it out of the box  and it was warped to all hell   returned it immediately  didn t bother getting a replacement  so i can t speak to the quality on a non defective unit      
729,3.0,                       ball worked great until a few days passed stored it inside then leather actually startedto peel off of ball      not very pleased          
730,5.0,                       love playing with it every single day       
731,4.0,                       this is  the  ball for indoor outdoor   everyone at the park has one   it s a great ball   durable  grippy  but not  sticky  like a rubber ball  won t make you shank your jumpers on a hard rim    not overly slippery like leather gets outdoors   will last you for years if you take care of it      
732,5.0,                       play ball      
733,5.0,                    excelente bal n  muy bueno  peso  control        
734,5.0,                       great ball for the money  has held up well through indoor and outdoor play      
735,5.0,                       had no problems with this ball   i use indoor not outdoor so     
736,1.0,                       the ball was very basic    not worth the price  does not keep pressure     
737,4.0,                       not bad for what i paid     
738,5.0,                       children request     
739,3.0,                       nice grip  but ball has an echo when bounced      
740,5.0,                       my favorite outdoor ball by far      
741,4.0,                       fairly good as far as indoor outdoor basketballs go      
742,3.0,                       seems to  very slowly  leak air and doesn t have a great grip     
743,5.0,                       great ball  i have used it indoor   outdoor   it always ends up being used as the game ball      
744,2.0,                       i ordered two of these balls and both were slightly under regulation size  everyone in our league noticed it      
745,5.0,                       spaulding basketballs are the way to go this is easy to handle and was given as a gift  it has lasted through some tough gridiron battles      
746,5.0,                       got it for my little bro his first basketball    he might be the next durant one day     
747,4.0,                       i haven t played basketball in a while but came across a random ball while moving and it sparked the desire to play again  turns put the ball was busted so i went online to amazon in search of a new one and decided on this gem  feels great in my hands but i felt like it could use a bit more bounce as i had to hit the pavement pretty hard for it to respond with the quickness i desired  after adding air  i must say that i am ready to hit the courts for a one on one game of hoops  oh wait  its covid season  oh well  looks like i m going to be spending a lot of time perfecting my jump shot for now at least      
748,2.0,                       way too heavy  plus  the grip is disappointing and i can t pump it up so now i m stuck with a deflated ball      
749,5.0,                       nephew loved it  just as expected     
750,5.0,                       this was a gift for a neighbor boy who is about    years old  the boy loves to play basketball and shoots baskets in his driveway about every day  his old ball wore out  we found it in our yard almost deflated and so used that the paint on the logo was about gone  he was thrilled to get a new ball      
751,5.0,                       perfect      
752,5.0,                       came inflated     
753,5.0,                       quick  easy  amazing shopping experience   love it   my son is happy with it as well      
754,5.0,                       a basket  is supposed to bounce  the ball can do that  what else is there to tell     
755,3.0,                       spalding has a few different zi o balls for outdoor use   i bought this zi o  the zi o excel and the under armor       the spalding excel zi o is far and away the best ball and keeps its grip    stars    the standard zi o has no more grip after   weeks play but a smooth surface which is fine if you like that   the under armour     seems too heavy in general but kept its grip   if you are looking at spalding make sure you are getting the excel zi o      
756,5.0,                       good feel   good bounce   indoor or outdoor   the previous one i had lasted for many years with hard use      
757,2.0,                       only had the ball a little over half a year and it won t inflate beyond a certain point   it is playable but definitely under the preferred inflation   ball is stored in house year round   has not been overused   seems like insufficient closure at the inflation point after the needle is removed      
758,1.0,                       they shouldn t advertise as an outdoor ball  mine is already toasted and only a couple months of use      
759,5.0,                       good     
760,5.0,                       durable and has very good grip  perfect for swishers      
761,1.0,                       leaks         
762,1.0,                       synthetic leather is peeling off the ball in less than   months with minimal use      
763,5.0,                       best ball i could have purchased  plays super well on indoor courts     
764,4.0,                       the ball is mostly good but the finish is kind of smooth and slippery   i like balls that have more of a leathery feel      
765,5.0,                       very good quality      
766,1.0,                       the ball was damaged and the leather is peeling off  the ball has bealry been used due to the manufacturers flaw  i wouldn t recommend this ball      
767,1.0,                       my player puts up at least     shots per day out in the driveway  so you can imagine how exciting a new ball is  actually did research and this came up very high quality  my son gave it back to me after a day and said   i m sorry  mom  but this ball has really no grip at all  would you please return it       
768,3.0,                       good look and feel but quality a little suspect  seams not lined up straight and flush and also ball slightly out of round     
769,5.0,                       as described     
770,1.0,                       arrived flat  loses air and goes flat after a few minutes  only used once      
771,5.0,                       nice material for outdoor     
772,2.0,                       ball is no good   ball is flat everytime i going to use it   i bought it to use it indoor but ball feel small and no one like it at the gym so i bring it to play outdoor but ball grip was gone after first use  now i m in search for another ball and this one goes to the kids to play at the park don t recommend this basketball     
773,1.0,                       ball didnt come inflated and also wont hold air in for more than a day  very disappointed      
774,1.0,                       deflation   i don t know what s going on  maybe it s a disqualification one that sent to me  i even can hear the air squeeze out from the air holes  bad luck for me      
775,5.0,                       good one      
776,5.0,                       this is a classic and spalding still makes two of the best all purpose balls  the funny thing is depending on personal preference  you might like their replica game ball instead  either is a dependable choice the one thing i will say is that while you can play outdoors here and there with this  it s not great if you play all the time  it will last a decent amount of time  but the real problem is the composite leather  it by nature picks up more dirt and dust from the courts than other materials  definitely bring a towel to keep wiping this off so to recap  great all purpose ball with durability at a great price point  but material composition means that other brands that have rubber leather hybrids will be better choices if you tend to play more on outdoor courts than indoor courts   if you play more on indoor courts and occasionally at the park  then this should be your everyday ball  or the other spalding ball depending of feel preference      
777,5.0,                       i don t know what s the relationship between zi o and zi o excel  but there is only information for zi o excel on spalding website  so i guess zi o excel is the successor of zi o previously i had a zi o excel  bought from amazon about a year ago  it was good  but unfortunately was stolen some days ago so i decided to buy another ball  a nicer ball  first i thought the zi o would be better than zi o excel cause the price was higher which was         but the second day after i placed my order  the zi o price went down as same as zi o excel which is        that sucks  then i didn t know which one is better after i received it  have it in my hand now  i can tell that the feeling of zi o is more smoother and softer than zi o excel  and the color is lighter  more orange like rather than red and brown appearing of zi o excel  the grip is good too  i can grab it easily by single hand which is only   inches long  haven t tried it on the court yet so far i like the feeling of zi o more than zi o excel  and it is a good deal now with the same price as zi o excel      
778,5.0,                       perfect     
779,1.0,                       dealer forced return of item not as described at site very far from delivery address  so return was too difficult to complete  not recommended  ball not leathery as depicted and has bad bounce to mess up your handle      
780,1.0,                       i got the ball out  it was kinda flat  i put it back in the box  after   days i decided to play with it but i needed to fill it up  when i tried to fill it  soon as i entered the needle in the air hole  the seal broke and the air hole went inside the ball and all the air came out  instantly broke  didn t have time to return it then forgot about it so now basically money down the toilet  never buying this company s ball again  buy a wilson they re way more quality      
781,4.0,                       bought this for my son  it appears to be of good quality  does what it s supposed to do  bounce  passed and tossed      
782,5.0,                       i bought this for my son   he loves it   great grip and holds up well on the black top courts   i would strongly recommend this product      
783,5.0,                       very good ball   indoor or outdoor      
784,1.0,                       poor quality   piece of trash  for one month it was good  after that  the ball starts losing air after    minutes of playing  no use  even my   kid s mini basket ball holds better      
785,5.0,                       just what my son wanted  a good ball      
786,5.0,                       great ball we are still using it to this day  rarely needs extra air  great seller with fast shipping     
787,5.0,                       the grandson grew into the full size ball and wanted one like he had in the younger league  great for indoor or outdoor play       
788,5.0,                       in the quest for value when purchasing a basketball  look no further  it s reasonably priced  aesthetically pleasing  incredibly symmetrical  pleasantly hued and a truly valuable addition to one s athletic menagerie      
789,5.0,                       this was a gift for my grandson      
790,5.0,                       grandson was thrilled to get this basketball      
791,5.0,                       i like it  will buy another one once this one wears out     
792,4.0,                       great ball for cheap     
793,5.0,                       ball plays good outside and indoors  not much scratches or anything so far  i usually use it at the park      
794,2.0,                       it came fully pumped  but for some reason it lacked the bounce it should have had  i d have to put extra effort into bouncing the ball to get the ball back up         
795,5.0,                       indoor feel for outdoor use   perfect for me  i ve been playing basketball for a long time  pickup organized  and these         spaldings have always been my preferred choice  i just do not see the quality improvement on a     wilson  it comes down to preference  i can say that the wilson s do seem to design better and longer lasting  outdoor  basketballs but it can never compare to the feel of a spalding      
796,5.0,                       love it     
797,3.0,                       great when i got it but it s really slippery only after   months of play on outdoor asphalt surface  i don t know if any other balls can maintain some form of stickiness on such a dusty surface but i was hoping this ball would do it since it s rated as outdoor and costs double the cheap balls      
798,4.0,                       good     
799,4.0,                       yep  looks like a bball to me and smells like one too  you can even dribble it   i think it s a winner      
800,5.0,                       best     
801,1.0,                       the basketball was not giftable  it was received deflated  it also did not hold air once it was filled up again  unfortunately  i had to return the item      
802,3.0,                       i like the ball overall  but it is slightly out of round which is not too bad a thing  but it is a little bit of a bother  i enjoy a purely round ball  it s okay though      
803,5.0,                       just a i had expected   love it      
804,5.0,                       exactly as described      
805,4.0,                       feels good will have to try it on the court that will be the true test  it also has a really good bounce      
806,5.0,                       i just got this ball the other day  and it came within   days  pre filled with a good amount of air    psi   i like the feel of the ball  and it has a good grip and good weight  it is easy to handle   shoot  i will update this review in the coming weeks   months if i notice anything bad  i play about once a week so take my review with a grain of salt      
807,5.0,                       used indoor by many children  it is doing well      
808,5.0,                       great and fast service  thank you      
809,5.0,                       great     
810,1.0,                       ball faulty    doesnt bounce well and the valve has a leak so it doesnt hold air     bought one before which was perfect     this time i guess a faulty one sipped through and i got unlucky     
811,5.0,                       great outdoor ball     
812,5.0,                       the last three years i ve used one of nike s old under the glass balls and a crappy summer camp rubber basketball to shoot around in my driveway  i decided to purchase this upgrade after seeing the great reviews i am so glad i bought this  it feels great on my hands  it also has a good bounce to it on asphalt  not too bouncey but very controllable  the price was great  very satisfied      
813,4.0,                       good     
814,1.0,                       i searched for a non leather  vegan  basketball and this was the amazon choice  i looked at the material of the ball and it is listed as  polyester   when examining the ball  it s stamped  composite leather   which is a compound made with leather fibers  i learned not to trust amazon s descriptions      
815,1.0,                       i m not sure if we got someone else s return but this was damaged  it deflated that same day after we opened it  we had to return it      
816,5.0,                       my grandson has used this practically everyday  was thrilled to get it      
817,5.0,                       highly satisfied  exactly as i ordered      
818,1.0,                       received product that was not regulation size  its a fluke  no big deal  guy in warehouse grabbed the wrong ball received replacement  the same undersized ball arrives which is not regulation nba size  description of item is blatant lie at least the look of the ball matches the photo  that s about it      
819,5.0,                       nice ball      
820,5.0,                       great     
821,5.0,                       bought it for my cousin and it works perfectly     
822,5.0,                       my son loves this ball        
823,5.0,                       received on time  i also bought a new net and the pump kit  this ball has great grip feel works well on smooth or rough pavement  i would recommend this product  i made a great decision based on reviews      
824,3.0,                       the ball is pretty good quality and has a good bounce   for an indoor ball this would be pretty good  but outdoors it tends to pick up a lot of dust dirt  which makes it very slippery   it s alright for a few minutes  but as soon as it gets dirty it starts to lose grip   i bought this with the intention of mostly using it outdoors  where it s almost always going to be getting some dust and dirt on it  so it s not ideal if you re just shooting around by yourself you can still grip it alright  but trying to make any quick movements with it can be difficult   it s not like it constantly goes flying out of your hands  but it s definitely noticeable and not a good game ball on some courts
