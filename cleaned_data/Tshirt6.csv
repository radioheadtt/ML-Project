0,5.0,                       fruit of the loom s products are always well made   these shirts are no exception   material is just the right thickness  length is correct for my height and intended use  and the material is soft on the skin      
1,5.0,                       perfect fit  i am     and weigh aprox    lbs  i always worry about shirt lengths  this  xlt fit perfect     
2,5.0,                       they arrived on time   they launder great and were great  just what we needed for a big bellied man      
3,3.0,                       although overall quality looks good  there was some shrinkage after washing once   it s a tight fit with very good length   might want to order size larger if you want a looser fit   i chose all cotton  so should have realized some shrinkage      
4,1.0,                       the fabric feels like sand paper   not the usual fruit of the loom fabric   something is not right   i have washed it and the harshness doesnt go away   am now wondering on the authenticity of the product   never had this issue with this brand ever before     
5,5.0,                       at       i don t usually need to order tall length shirts   i ve learned  however  that white t shirts usually are made of realtively cheap cotton fabric and shrink in length significantly   having learned my lesson  i order these in tall and find that even though they shrunk a little in lenth  it was relatively minor and the shirts still are long enough to stay tucked in   if i were a few inches taller they would still be long enough   not sure they would stay long enough for someone at      or           
6,1.0,                       the shirt is only slightly smaller through the chest than an x large t shirt and much longer   i bought these for my middle school aged son who can now wear some adult size small shirts   i guess i will save them for college       
7,5.0,                       a   i go through a lot of shirts and these are my favorites      
8,5.0,                       they re undershirts  they do what they re supposed to  wash well and do actually stay tucked in      
9,5.0,                       bought some of these previously along with some shorter ones  i like the length of these so made this purchase      
10,1.0,                       discolored compared to new store bought tees  yellowish    awful smell coming from them     
11,5.0,                       good quality product in a large quantity   i m     with a    chest  and these t shirts are great for me   glad to be able to buy many at once and not just   to a pack at retail stores   i also plan to dye a few  haven t done it yet  but i think the material will work well      
12,4.0,                       i m not tall but i like my undershirts to stay tucked in  they do tend to shrink over time so i use them as my yard work   car repair   house remodeling undershirts  they are a lighter weight which  is more comfortable in high humidity or heat      
13,5.0,                       love these t shirts  i m          pounds i get tall size because of my wide shoulders and these are perfect  not to thick not too thin just right      
14,5.0,                       i really like these shirts and had bought them at local walmart until they stopped selling them   they are a       cotton poly blend  they are a thin undershirt   i like them cause they seem to retain their length after washing   i hate buying undershirts and after washing they fit like belly shirts   i like them cause they are thin material wise  which i stated above  i don t like my undershirts to be thick  they have a modern fit to them  so if you are looking for a boxy shirt  look elsewhere  i will continue to buy them as long as they make them      
15,1.0,                       check your order  i did the  buy it now  option thinking i was going to get    shirts in my size and ended up getting   which was not what was displayed  advertising hijinks  shame on me i guess  decided to wash the   shirts before wearing and just cut my losses and they shrunk down   sizes smaller  hats off to this terrible product good for washing cars now i guess      
16,5.0,                       my husband has a very long torso  and a very flat rear end  this causes his crack to be visible every time he lifts his hands or bends over  i keep telling him he needs to change professions and become a plummer anywho  these shirts are awesome  i ve thrown out all the old white shirts and replaced them with these  they also hold up and wash well  i just soak them in bleach water periodically to keep them nice and bright      
17,4.0,                       fit was great  a bit slimmer than some  undershirt  t shirts  and the length does shrink up a bit when washed  but it stays a couple inches longer than most other t shirts  of the few types of hanes fotl t shirts i wear  this isn t the softest  but it s fairly nice  feels like a      blend shirt      
18,5.0,                       the first thing my husband said when he tried fruit of the loom t  shirt on was finaly a t shirt long enough      
19,5.0,                       bought for associate he wears and likes them for work     
20,5.0,                       they are a bit tight around my arms but otherwise for well and stay tucked  after a few washes  still maintaining shape and softness      
21,5.0,                       there are so many brands in just about every category of products  that it sometimes becomes a bit bewildering  i ve pretty much stuck with fruit of the loom and haines for underwear and have never  to my recollection  been dissatisfied      
22,2.0,                       i bought a pack of large   tall man  and they shrunk after washing them  they are kind of tight and short now  i guess the material isn t that great     
23,5.0,                       i  am someone who likes tuck in  shirts and i m not a fan of thin undershirts so i figured i would give these a try   so far i m not disappointed  i purchased   pack but have only used   so far these shirts are great for me as i always wear dress shirts and polos that have to be tucked in      
24,2.0,                       yes  this shrink and changed color after   washes  return and when with other brand      
25,5.0,                       nice feel  deep colors  good quality  just a bit too big for my very slim son      
26,5.0,                       always trust fruit of the loom to fit correctly in every way   good quality always   very trusted brand for years delivery fast too      
27,5.0,                       love these shirts especially during the summer time working outside although they are hard to find at any of the walmart s near me but thankfully for this seller had exactly what i was looking for items were as described and fairly priced             xl gives a nice loose fit     
28,5.0,                       shirts fit great and as expected   i wear them under my medical scrubs and these shirts stay in place all day without coming untucked   will buy these again when i need more undershirts      
29,5.0,                       soft and very comfortable   they wash and air without too much shrinkage   no tag in back      
30,5.0,                       i m a woman and i love to get my tees in men just feel more comfortable and more roomy  these are definitely my go to and the price is right      
31,4.0,                       nice shirt but the black ones tend to fit a bit smaller then the gray ones      
32,3.0,                       i buy men s t shirts because i hate the tiny sleeves on women s  i am a woman s s m so i got men s medium  the shirt fits just as i like every where but the sleeves  they are tiny and tight like women s sleeves  the fabric is nice though      
33,5.0,                       the package is a great deal for someone who uses them daily the shirt is a descent thickness for an undershirt and yet just enough for a top shirt on a light day      
34,5.0,                       product is as expected  basic crew cut undershirts  my husband wears them under work dress shirts  or by themselves when doing yard work  after a few months of wear they do get pretty discolored from deodorant under the arms and they are repurposed as car towels or  garage  rags  for the price they are great undershirts      
35,5.0,                       big fan of these shirts so far   a couple things to know  they are  stay tucked  because they are longer   a lot longer   in the photo  i am comparing these to a hanes comfortfit shirt  and you can really see the size difference  in the roughly     months of wearing these  they have stayed pretty soft  the sleeve size is pretty small   this is important if you wear a lot of polos as you don t want your sleeve of your undershirt sticking out   has not been a problem for me with any of my polos    see photo for sleeve size  overall  i really like these   i wasn t sure about the extra length but it really does help my undershirt stay tucked and not bunch around my waistband  an issue i ve had with other undershirts      
36,5.0,                       i bought these for undershirts for button dress shirts  they are nice quality  hold their shape and plenty long to stay tucked in      
37,2.0,                       ordered these having no experience with the brand  i usually use hanes but thought i d try something new  these are the worst fitting t s i have ever purchased  the neck sits well below mine and the stiching is cumberson  the sleeves flair out from mu shoulders to my biceps and i cannot keep them from curling up  the cut makes the shirt tight across my shoulders  the cotton in the shirt is still stiff  even after   wash cycles  the only good thing i can say is they are long enough for my      frame  i weigh     lbs  so weight is not an issue in fit  keep searching    i m gonna have to      
38,5.0,                       these t shirts are soft and fit me perfectly   the collar does not sag and looks good around my neck   i m      and the length is well below my waistline  to about the bottom of my abdomen      
39,5.0,                       i too read the reviews of many t shirts  chose this  cause they were cheap  got exactly what i ordered    pack  assorted colors   xl   i am              i finally found a t shirt long enough without paying a small fortune for them   these fit like they should  these are soft enough  these are a terrific value       for a  xl tall   that s all i have to say        
40,5.0,                       i recently been same product in the more medium size  and those were just too tight whenever i worked out and just wearing in general  so i went up to large  was worried about the fitting but it was perfect for me with my height and build  comes in   per pack      
41,5.0,                       my husband is so happy with these tshirts  he wears them under his polos for work and likes the sleeve length as well as the fact they stay tucked in  so glad fruit of the loom realized the need for the extra length      
42,5.0,                       my husband is very happy with these t shirts  he is a large man and these fit him nicely and are soft and comfortable  good quality for price      
43,5.0,                       for a generic t shirt  you really can t go wrong  i bought these to go with some scrub bottoms i have  and i think they re wonderful  they really do stay tucked in all day long  could be a bit more breathable  but that s just my personal opinion   definitely not something that would keep me from ordering again in the future      
44,3.0,                       ordered for my hubby  he s          lbs  it fit perfect  but they are not thick  he uses these under his thermal shirts      
45,4.0,                       the shirts i got are of good quality   ordered xxxlt  and they fit well   they will shrink some  as should be expected   the shirts loose a star because they shed a ton in the dryer   even several months later they still loose a lot  although the shirts don t seem too much worse for it there is a real problem  however  with being able to order these again   when i ordered the first time  at         the same price at the time of this review   i received a pack of six   now  when i link to the item from my previous purchases  the description indicates it is a pack of three  the photo indicates a pack of six   essentially  it appears this is not the same product i ordered  then  and i m glad i read the details prior to reordering   it appears many other customers are confused as well   questions posed by other amazon customers for clarification of quantity seem to indicate they are a pack of six but may also be five   one customer said they received only three   there is just too much uncertainty to justify ordering again   i don t remember seeing any other item on amazon where you have to gamble on what you might actually receive   it would seem that amazon could easily get it together on this item  but from the number of questions they receive regarding what the actually quantity you will receive is it appears they show little interest for that reason  i don t recommend ordering these  at least not until amazon can definitively address all the conflicting information in the product description      
46,3.0,                       quality and fit is ok  they are t shirts so the expectations are not really high or low they are thinner then i am use to though      
47,5.0,                       these t shirts are comfortable and wear well  i always order the next size larger for a comfortable fit  when laundry day rolls around  iwash these t shirts using the warm water setting to avoid shrinking these t shirts  i also add a half cup of baking soda to this wash load  which seems to head off these t shirts turning yellow  yes i have tried using bleach in the past  but using  baking soda  these t shirts seem to last longer  another feature i like is that the length of these t shirts ensures that the t shirt stays tucked in securely and there is no   waist creep       
48,5.0,                       i have been using white for years and my wife decided to get these in color  i didnt expect them to be extra long perfect for dress shirts  thanks for quick delivery      
49,2.0,                       these undershirts are so close to being perfect  i love the length and quality  however there is one big problem that forced me to return them  the collar is too wide  besides the awkward feel of having so much collar bone exposed  the bigger problem is that  because the collar doesn t line up with a dress shirt collar  these undershirts show under a dress shirt  having a circular ring show through my dress shirts because the undershirt collar is too wide is unacceptable to me  if anyone knows of a long mens undershirt that doesn t have this wide collar problem  please write me in the comments  thanks      
50,4.0,                       these are definitely great shirts  i was shocked at the length though  these fall well below the belt line on me and i m      i was also somewhat surprised at the fit  they fit well in the chest and shoulders but get somewhat tight towards the belt line and below  overall a great purchase  but length can catch you off guard if you re not expecting it      
51,5.0,                       these undershirts are exactly what i need  i am so tired of having to tuck and retuck my undershirts at work  i move around a lot  and these make my life so much easier  i will not buy any other undershirts as long as these exist      
52,1.0,                       i ordered the classic large for my brother in law a week ago  while the upper body fit was good  it was way way too long  probably around   inches   he is about   feet   inches  i was disappointed because i specifically choose not to order the tall man fit because i knew he wasn t overly tall  so i didn t expect to get a tall fit  maybe they mixed up my others  idk   it was soft though and the material looks lasting but boy will he have to tuck them t shirts in  smh      
53,5.0,                       great fit all around   love these shirts as they are good quality at a great price      
54,4.0,                       i ve bought these shirts a few times  i like them because they don t tend to shrink   my last batch did after about     washes   i wear an undershirt daily so that s no good   bought these again and washed for the first time  we ll see how it goes   normally they hold up well and fit great  hoping the last batch and an anomaly      
55,5.0,                       i ve been looking for some replacement undershirts for dress shirts for awhile now  according to the size chart i should have ordered a large  however i ordered xl instead since that s always the size i order  fit was perfect  and it only shrank maybe    percent or less after washing  they are long and stay tucked  not a shirt you could wear casually  it is definitely an undershirt  i m       lb  dad bod  and not slim      
56,4.0,                       i m average height but pushing    lbs and lost of  table muscle    very active but large gut and decent shoulders this shirt is roomy from the shoulders down on me   feels thin and do not see them lasting a long time but they are my under shirts   they breathing well and are light  i chose  x extra long because of my gut   the shirt does not pull out of my pants while working with my arms over my head or when i squat down     waistline    inch shoulders  big belly      
57,3.0,                       this is the third or fourth time i have purchased fruit of the loom signature tee shirts  i normally purchase at a store but they were out of stock  the fabric on these shirts is much thinner than in the past      
58,5.0,                       good shirt i am satisfied not sure about the moisture wicking yet because it s kind of cold right now but so far good shirts i will be buying more a lot cheaper and a lot more choices in color than my usual stepper brand got do you have cotton shirts anything else doesn t feel right     
59,4.0,                       i was on the look to replace my old gap undershirts  good quality and fabric  and came across these fotl taper ones  i am           lbs with a flat stomach and    in  chest so instead to buy what i am familiar with  i decided to go with fotl taper undershirts in size medium the item arrived in one piece and good packaging  for sizing  i did a measurement on the garment when brand new just to see if they shrink after wash  which they did  but i ll get to that later   i wear size s in gap but was in between s   m in fotl and glad i went with bigger size as it turned out they run a bit small  refer the last two photos for the actual fit  the fabric is soft and the neck rib is good  these shirts are longer than my gap ones  and i expect these to stay tucked in as they claim  also the hem width is about a inch smaller than the chest width so they are true taper cut  which fit me nicely with no excess fabric when i tuck it in  they do have seams on the sides so these are not tubular shirts that are commonly seen  anyway the first impression is very good  i would say the fabric weight is between     oz however  some things changed a bit after just one  cold  wash  they shrink  especially in length about     inch shorter  so they do bounce up at waist from time to time during my one month use  that s why i rate these   star but not     also the shoulder chest width became smaller after wash  but not as much as the length so i guess i am fine with it overall these are good undershirts  i might try size large for above reason the next time but now i am still happy with the purchase  hope this helps anyone      
60,5.0,                       i purchase these for my husband every christmas  we take his whole undershirts and re use them as cleaning cloths  they last forever  super soft and a perfect fit  also no tags so they don t bother him      
61,4.0,                       great fit  soft and comfortable  my only complaint is unusually hard to clean      
62,5.0,                       these shirts are white  they are cotton  and they are soft  fruit of the loom seems longer than hanes so i buy these  i hate how the deodorant makes the pits yellow after awhile  but hey  that s the cost of looking good      
63,5.0,                       my husband loves these shirts hes able to tuck it in and pull out just enough hes comfy and it still stay tucked all day and look good my husband is         pounds had belly they look big but once you wash and put ot on its not as big as it looks on you trust me      
64,5.0,                       these were purchased at the request of my sil  he loves the fit and style  he says they stay soft  this was his second big bag purchase      
65,5.0,                       so far so good  these shirts have been washed and cloroxed repeatedly and have held up great  very pleased with my purchase      
66,5.0,                       just what i wanted  plan on them shrinking half a size  long enough to stay tucked on average builds  sleeves are short enough not to show under short sleeved shirts      
67,1.0,                       been buying these for    years   i wear these everyday for work   so i would get replacements about every     months   this last batch is made from a stiffer cotton and it shrank a lot  around    they are now very tight around chest belly   i can put on the ones which are   months old and they still fit and are soft   i am guessing cheaper material   guess i have to find another brand      
68,5.0,                       bought to donate to a homeless shelter  so i didn t actually wear them  but they felt like good quality   hopefully they liked them      
69,2.0,                       disappointed  too short  sleeves ridiculously short  weird collar fit  threw them out  costco kirkland brand are a revelation that i highly recommend      
70,3.0,                       they fit perfect    but they also shrink a lot  you have to air dry them if you want to keep them for long other than they are pretty and really won t come untucked just be sure to let them shrink       
71,2.0,                       i got the answer to my question  whether  stay tucked  is longer than others  or only tall sizes were longer  since talls are      more expensive    stay tucked  is nothing more than a slogan  i also ordered colored cotton tees not labeled as  stay tucked   the packages  other than one is a   pack and the other    and the color shown on the model  are identical i have an order arriving tomorrow of xl tall size  i ll update my review once i compare the two  i also have gildan brand  so i ll compare all three but  if you re ordering stay tucked because you think they re longer than others  think again  all fruit of the loom tees say  stay tucked  on the package  not on the shirts   the shirts only vary by the size ordered update   the xl tall tees arrived today  and they re going back  keep in mind tall sizes are a lot more than regular sizes  xl are        each  xl tall vary from        to       depending on vendor   so what do you get for       times the price  about    longer         maybe  because the shirts vary from front to back   i measured them back to back  new  right out of the package  the point being  it s not a lot  if the difference in price was as small as the difference in length  i could understand  i bought a   pack of gildan tees that are about the same as fotl for         each   this is not clothing that will last forever  if they get a stain or rip  or just wear out  they become rags  and if you wear them untucked or as undershirts  the regular sizes work fine  they even stay tucked and  tall sizes don t have their own bag  they come in a generic fotl bag that only says it is not a toy  nothing about the contents      
72,5.0,                       very comfortable  size large  undershirts that fit perfectly my          lbs frame  i am very pleased with that purchase  the quality is fine and i am sure they will last      
73,5.0,                       finally a shirt that stays tucked  i m not tall  i just like my under shirts to stay tucked      
74,5.0,                       these are great       thanks amazon   fruit  of loom       don t woorry about those negative reviews           buy these            
75,4.0,                       slow shipping  but a comfortable fit  order your regular size  only problem was one of the tshirts had an oil stain  probably from a conveyor belt  came in   separate packs  probably would ve paid the same at walmart but i m lazy       
76,2.0,                       material not as good as last time i ordered them  feel cheap and fit is small      
77,1.0,                       scratches you  very thin  i don t know what cotton they used but it won t even clean my glasses without smearing     very cheap don t buy    not thick      
78,4.0,                       i like the tapered shirts  shirts are not heavy  good for florida heat  not the highest quality  but still okay female fit size        large  i wash in hot water and dry in a hot dryer they have not shrunk      
79,1.0,                       these have not lasted at all  when they arrived there were several with holes  like a fool i kept them thinking  oh they were a good price and most of them are fine    well just a few months later  this is not the case  the majority of them have holes after two or three washes  don t waste your money     
80,5.0,                       well made cotton shirt  but longer length in order to avoid showing when you bend over  especially in jobs where one has to move a lot      
81,5.0,                       these are great shirts  no complaints  perfect to wear under my dress shirts during the day  i do have to often replace these every   mos or so but that is just me being picky because i like my shirts to be white and it s tough to keep that bright white color after    washes   anyway great value and great product  comfortable  soft  and fits right      
82,5.0,                       these t shirts are of good quality  be mindful they are extra long  but true to size as far as width  they are meant to be tucked inside a pair of pants  if you want to wear this as a regular shirt  these may not be what you want      
83,5.0,                       if you are looking for long t shirts this is a definite go   they are perfect     
84,4.0,                       after first wash the sleeve ends curl up  but can be ironed back flat if you wanted to  i wear them as under shirts for work so that doesn t bother me  second time ordering      
85,5.0,                       true to size  and fits very well  the shirts are also very soft      
86,4.0,                       a good value but ran a little snugger than i care for in the chest     
87,5.0,                       awesome shirts        would definitely recommend them     
88,1.0,                       warning  i received what appears to be factory rejects  all six of the shirts had at least one defect  stains  appear to be ink of some kind   small holes  and one had a defect in the seam under one arm  i have returned these and requested a refund  will update      
89,5.0,                       i purchased them for my daughter and she loves them      
90,4.0,                       husband really likes these after a first use  they re longer than other large  tall shirts that he s  had  they re not overly thick or too thin  sleeves are short enough to fit under any polo  i m saving a fifth star for if they also hold up well over time      
91,5.0,                       these shirts are longer than your normal white t shirts    they stay tucked and look good under other clothes  this is the  rd time i ve ordered these      
92,5.0,                       way much amazing fabric  well design  highly recommended  a        
93,5.0,                       the most comfortable t shirt that i have ever worn   i sweat a lot  and this cotton material soaks up the sweat super fast without making me feel wet   also  the collar is perfect around my neck      
94,4.0,                       pros   very inexpensive   the price is more than fair for what you get  pretty good quality from what i can tell  not scratchy loose strings   extra length so they stay tuckedcons   they shrink an insane amount after just the first wash  they get a bit less comfortable the more times you wash them no matter how expensive your detergent fabric softener is  they re very thinthere s not much to say about this exactly  they are just regular shirts but with an extended length so they stay tucked in under a dress shirt  functionally  they work great   i ve even bought a second package just because they do what they re meant to and they do it well  the only problem i have with them is that they shrink a lot after just the first wash  i guess that s where the extra length comes in handy though   if any other shirt shrank this much then there would be a problem i wear a button up shirt to work every day and these shirts have never done me wrong  i actually hate wearing any other regular white shirt under my button up s  they usually end up rising up too much and bunching up around the waist   not a good look in the end   i put that they do fit as expected  i would say that brand new they fit as they should  though  if i was you   i d probably size up and wash them as soon as you get them  you ll probably end up with a better experience  overall though  they re pretty thin so i would probably feel a bit weird just wearing them standalone   but they re great as an undershirt  what more could you really even ask for  yeah quality is nice  but if it s going under your shirt  who really cares  spend the extra money on a better shirt to go over it and thank me later      
95,1.0,                       thin  very thin shirt   thinner than a tshirt   best to be worn as layering  not as a tshirt to wear daily     
96,5.0,                    son buenas para el precio  quedaron excelentes        
97,5.0,                       i am one of those old school middle aged guys who wears a white t shirt under my dress shirts to work every day  i m typically somewhere around a medium or large in size  kind of on the borderline between the two  i usually buy size medium undershirts so that they will actually fit under my dress shirts  larges are typically too lose around the midsection for me   however  lately i have noticed that size medium undershirts in some brands feel a bit too tight and small to be comfortable  i decided to try these fruit of the loom ones based on reviews stating that these run a bit big for their size  while they seem fairly standard in the chest and shoulders for a size medium  what i find is that they run longer than other brands  this is a good thing for me  because they actually do stay tucked in while some of the competitor brand ones do not  these undershirts also have some stretch to them so they don t feel restrictive  all in all a pretty good fit and a good value at this price  if you are looking for a basic white t shirt to wear under a dress shirt or polo and are between sizes  this may be a good option for you      
98,1.0,                       i have ordered these before but this time the arms were sewed with string that does not give  it cuts my underarms  i cannot return this because i do not have the packaging anymore  very disappointed     
99,5.0,                       i finally purchased a t shirt that stays tucked in my pants  love the quality  great fit for a  xlt they work great under my dress shirts for work      
100,3.0,                       i am         lbs  and typically wear an lt or xlt t shirt   i was excited to find these as i normally spend the same amount on one shirt as the whole six pack of these costs   unfortunately  they are very loose around the neck and look sloppy when wearing a collared shirt after a few washes      
101,4.0,                       it s hard to buy clothes when you are tall  and nowadays nothing seems to be as great as the stuff i bought    years ago   that being said  this t shirt is the best one i ve worn from all available options   i ve tried a few   will this t shirt last a year   i ve been ordering these every   months for about a year   they slowly shrink over time   i stretch them every time i pull them out of the dryer  and i always dry on the lowest heat setting and wash in cold water    like i said  these aren t perfect  but there the best i ve come across      
102,5.0,                       real comfortable and soft  is a little long on me but not too long that it bothers me      
103,5.0,                       i guess they stay tucked because they re too long  had to return them because my husband doesn t tuck them and they re too long otherwise  i still gave   stars  they were very soft      
104,5.0,                       soft  comfortable       cotton tag less undershirts at an excellent price  for far too long i would order medium undershirts and be uncomfortable  i recommend ordering a size up  i ordered a large  so you can be comfortable throughout the day  i think you will really like these great shirts that don t jump out of your pants  what a nice change  i plan on buying them again in the future      
105,1.0,                       black lines were marked with permanent marker on tags and stains were on shirts  only offered     discount if kept or refund if i send back but i must pay for shipping      
106,5.0,                       so far  i have purchased two packs of these extra long undershirts for my husband  and even after many washings  they still look fresh and white   he finds them to be soft and lightweight  are very shrink resistant  and hold their shape well   i couldn t be happier      
107,2.0,                       wanted a tapered first  these were baggy at the bottom      
108,5.0,                       these have been a game changer for my office wear  no joke  i didn t realize how disgusting my old undershirts were until i got these in  soft fabric  perfect length for tucking them in  please note   they are way too long to wear untucked    they ll hang out below your shirt  they do shrink the first wash dry cycle but were long enough initially that it didn t have an impact on the  tuckness   they are slimmer fitting in the chest arms area  i m            size l for reference      
109,1.0,                       i washed the shirts on the day they  arrived i ordered size medium but one was a large so i kept the large one for myself to use as a sleep shirt  the remaining three were for my grandson  while i was  wearing the shirt i noticed really bad smell and realized it was the shirt   since it had just been washed   i knew it should smell fresh  i went and checked the other   shirts and they have the same bad order  so i washed them again  and they still smell bad     i have washed these shirts   times in a row and cannot get the weird smell out of them   i m going to throw them out     i m very disappointed and not at all satisfied with this purchase   the fit and quality was good   they just smell bad   i would just like to know what is in the material that makes them smell so awful      
110,2.0,                       i don t know why but these shirts itch and stay itchy even after numerous washes  i want to like these shirts but the itch is annoying  update i guess fotl assumes everyone wants their sleeves to start at the arm pits  the shirts have shrunken so bad that the sleeves creep up into your armpit  i would not recommend these shirts      
111,1.0,                       i don t remember the last time this kind of thing happens  but the tagless blue print ink dyed several piece of white clothes  including a brand new exercise shirt  shocked this is still an issue      
112,2.0,                       i bought size men s medium and i got t shirts that were as tight as women s small or a youth large  no room in the shoulders   the sleeves could almost pass as ladies  capsleeves  they ll go to my nephew  i guess      
113,3.0,                       shirts are ok not as soft as the others i ve tried it is also not a      cotton  so keep that in mind when purchasing it might say      but most likely you ll get a cotton blend      
114,4.0,                    son para el uso diario  pero no aguantan muchas lavadas antes de ver el deterioro        
115,4.0,                       normal quality    not thick   nice bright white  i am      and these t shirts run long   about   inches to long   would have preferred them a touch shorter   but they are a good quality shirt  i ordered x large  but not tall   seems the normal length runs long      
116,2.0,                       thousand tiny white balls of cotton  came off the tees  when dried  i know this as the lint trap was just all white   did not realize it as  pulled the shirts our of the dryer into the basket  and then onto the dark blue duvet cover my  cotton  pants and green cotton  shirt covered with these thousand white white balls of cotton  trouble was tht we bought the black cotton crew socks with the white tees  washed separately but dried together and the socks look like they have a disease the pix is the socks washed twice never worn         
117,4.0,                    me extra a que siempre est n hechas en un lugar diferente        
118,3.0,                         pack included   black and   gray  not   gray as indicated by the product picture      
119,5.0,                       was looking for a long tee shirt  but still snug at the neckline   these worked perfectly   was afraid they might shrink over time  but so far  so good   the material stayed true to size   will order another set soon      
120,5.0,                       my husband is a big and tall man and always has trouble finding undershirts that fit  there was very minimal shrinkage even after   months  undershirts were at mid thigh when purchased and are less than an inch shorter  comfortable     
121,5.0,                       item as expected  maybe a little small but nothing drastic   comfortable  maintains its shape   satisfied with the purchase      
122,1.0,                       disappointed in quality  i ordered these shirts expecting them to hold their shape through at least a dozen wears washes  after first wear the neck broke down and that was it  i have some black hanes but i wanted this color  going back to hanes as i have not been happy with these shirts  if you wear these under a shirt and the collar is exposed you will not be happy as the neck is poorly made      
123,2.0,                       you can see through these shirts    literally   i returned them and ordered some heavier t shirts that might last a little while      
124,4.0,                       i bought these shirts to wear around the house and also sleep with  some of these colors are nice but the one i would stay away from is the light stone gray color  these shirts are cheap so i can t complain much about the quality  i bought these to wear indoor and sleep with  definitely do not recommend wearing these casually outdoors as the color fades very easily and looks dull one thing i will say is that the large fits nice and i m       the length is perfect for me and shorter on the arms which i like  i have washed them multiple times and the color on some of the shirts like the black ones have faded a bit but thankfully it has not shrunk      
125,5.0,                       t shirts are good are they fit me just right in it that my homeboy just right who is about two or three inches shorter in about    to    pounds lighter so say     to                    two fit but husky army and ex army guyes     
126,1.0,                       edit   the arms shrunk up so bad my armpits are visible if i raise my arm at all  and the stay tucked is hardly able to stay in my pants  lame original review  fresh and clean like a white tee should be   fast shipping  fair price    stars   sold      
127,5.0,                       fits as expected   material a little thinner than other tshirts   perfect for spring fall weather and when layering      
128,5.0,                       these are definitely longer than expected  i am not huge but have a large belly so my work uniforms won t tuck in and when i raise my hands everyone gets a look at some sexy flesh  now i can tuck these in under my uniform and all the girls behave themselves      
129,2.0,                       welp  pretty sure the arms were sewn on backwards on these puppies  feels very strange in the shoulders indeed      
130,4.0,                       these are  fine   they re not great quality compared to the calvin klein ones but they re so much better than hanes   i ordered all three and the hanes went back as they had holes in them   i knocked off a star because they re not as soft as others  but then at this price  i ll probably just ordered two packs of these every   months when they get yellow      
131,5.0,                       it is difficult to find an all cotton shirt for a tall  slender man  my son is       and    years old  it s just nice to find a shirt that doesn t slip up and show his underwear while he s moving around  in other words  a shirt that stays tucked  he can wear these shirts alone or as an undershirt for dress shirts  well done fruit of the loom      
132,5.0,                       these are good quality shirts that are longer than regular t shirts   my husband loves them  they are a great price and they fit him perfectly      
133,2.0,                       i ordered these same shirts in a   count pack from amazon last year  this pack is much worse quality      
134,5.0,                       these shirts are comfortable  fit correctly  and are white  i wear them frequently i am typically a medium when it comes to shirt sizes  male    lbs  i tend to be a smaller medium so sometimes shirts are larger than i want      
135,5.0,                       it fit before i washed them a couple time  then they started getting tighter  they still fit just not as loose as i like  i m a     pound man and i like to have my stomach covered up  i love your under clothes and i will continue to buy from you     
136,5.0,                       i m     and  always end up looking like a plumber  these will either cover up that area or stay tucked  very good product     
137,5.0,                       these long t shirts are the best for undershirts  they stay tucked in and fit great  i buy one size smaller than my regular shirt for a tight fit  they ve lasted for almost a year      
138,1.0,                       i got the medium and i am about       and the sleeve length is way too small for me  it s usually a bit longer not shorter when i get medium   then even though it s cotton  it s the cheap crap cotton that makes you feel hot  i regret making the purchase and if i had not washed before wearing out of covid safety  i would return them      
139,2.0,                        nd purchase of these  the quality and size has gone way down since my first purchase  stay tucked is a joke  i normally wear a tall and figured these should be about right given they claim extra length  yeah  that s a big nope  i buy and use these just to kick around the house so didn t expect much but they don t even meet the bum around shirt level i expected    stars is generous  i based it on the fact that they are technically shirts  piss poor ones but shirts none the less      
140,5.0,                       these are my boyfriend s absolute favorite  long enough to tuck in  super soft  the fit is perfect  i ended up buying more      
141,5.0,                       finally a shirt i can tuck in a stay tucked  it s a few inches longer than a regular undershirt which makes all the difference        
142,5.0,                       nice and long   a little on the thin side  but not too bad   still a five star considering the great price   the shirt fits nice and is comfortable      
143,1.0,                       fits great  actually  long enough for me which is rare since i m   foot    however  they re super uncomfortable  which was the main reason i bought them      
144,5.0,                       long length so i can tuck it in  material is soft and comfortable      
145,1.0,                       just received these shirts today and handed the package to my husband   there was something under the plastic on the top shirt and my husband said it looked like a clothes moth   i looked at it with a powerful magnifying glass and it looked more like a tiny piece of beige fabric but next to it there was a tiny translucent oval amber object that looked like an insect egg   this alarmed me so i saw another speck under the clear plastic and it looked like a young dead bedbug   i immediately bagged the t shirts up in a plastic trash bag since the bag they came in had some rips in it and it is now in the garage  i am debating whether to take them back or wash them on hot   dry them on hot which will kill any insect or eggs   i am really freaked out but i have heard of this happening to others   i would have taken pictures but i don t think my camera could get a close up very clearly and i don t want to unbag them      
146,5.0,                       a little see through but super nice t shirts   soft  and great for under shirt use   perfect         cotton   fits nice  looks nice      
147,5.0,                       i love that this size is available  it is hard to find  xl tall in stores  these came and are the perfect size  well made  fit right  long enough to stay tucked   you are all welcome      
148,5.0,                       my husband is     and weighs    lbs of muscle   fluff  he needed shirts that weren t just big around  he needed them to be long enough to cover it all  arms up and free to move around without showing any belly  i purchased these  some fabric dye and for      i gave him   awesome tshirts that wear and fit better than most i ve purchased for that amount each  they are soft  and comfy  do it     
149,5.0,                       this is a nice tee  just a plain ole      cotton tee white    which i ve been looking for online  for awhile  will buy again      
150,5.0,                       really amazing soft and comfortable would recommend to anyone who is looking for something simple and to go to the gym or use as undershirt for work purpose      
151,5.0,                       i was concerned my     year old boy might not like the longer fit and he wasn t around to ask when i ordered  but he absolutely loves these tees  they fit great  are long enough to stay tucked in but not ridiculously long  nice weight to them  not beefy but not paper thin  he wears them under dress shirts      
152,5.0,                       well i normally wear a med t shirt  however  i order the x large and man feel great loose and easy to work with  cool   i recommend you all who need a t shirt to just work around your home order a larger size and for the price its a steal   you got the key for your car go for it     
153,5.0,                       longer length so when it shrinks up a bit from washing and drying  they end up perfect size  not too tight or too baggy  just a great fit      
154,1.0,                       comfortable undershirts  they tuck nicely unfortunately  shipping was much longer than the   day prime i subscribe to      
155,5.0,                       perfect fit  i m        lbs with a busch light gut  i ordered xlt and plenty of room  with a perfect amount to tuck in  hopefully these hold up better than the last brand of undershirts i bought      
156,5.0,                    hasta el momento estoy muy contento  vamos a ver cuantos meses aguantan         
157,1.0,                       in almost all brands and styles  i wear a medium  these are undershirts  expected to fit a bit more snug than a regular shirt  so a medium should be scaled down appropriately to work as an undershirt  they are freakin tent like  thin  and the collar is loose like a worn out wizard s sleeve absolute garbage product  buy literally any other undershirt before buying these      
158,5.0,                       i really like these   i don t  have to fight to keep them tucked in all day no matter what i m doing      
159,5.0,                       very good product for the price  i like the fit and the various colors  would buy again      
160,5.0,                       i like their      cotton i use them as layering for the cold weather since i work outdoors      
161,1.0,                       not a fit  at all i bought the small size  and even so  not a fit  this shirt is very very long  it s comical long if you are buying thinking it s going to be a small fitted tee  forget about it ridiculously wrong      
162,5.0,                       a little tighter than i thought but our son is wearing as an undershirt so it works perfectly and doesn t come untucked         
163,4.0,                       these shirts shrank a ton when we washed them so my husband only got minimal use out of them  we plan to buy from the same brand again just in a bigger size      
164,5.0,                       i ll admit i gave up when they came out with extra thin shirts at fruit of the loom  and went with a new brand that was very expensive  the new tapered fit is a little longer and don t pull out of my waistband when leaning over  what a breath of fresh air that i finally found what i was looking for  just placed my third order     
165,5.0,                       great fit  great price and quality as expected   tried another name brand and purchased at the store  they were horrible and shrunk to fit an infant   bought these fruit of the loom in large  washed in hot and dried so they shrunk a tiny bit as i expected   they fit great now   would and will purchase again     
166,5.0,                       i am currently wearing a grey shirt as i write this  i love undershirts whenever i wear a polo for a more fashionable look and it definitely feels nice and cool and is made of good material      
167,3.0,                       they are pretty cheap  they fit ok  maybe a little small for a large  the fabric is kind of stiff and a bit scratchy  they are ok for the price  but i won t buy them again      
168,5.0,                       nice soft under shirts  i bought a size large  i am  ft     lbs with a long waist  these stay tucked in     
169,5.0,                       love them  they are soft and keep their size and shape pretty well after washing and machine drying them  excellent price and fast shipping are a big bonus as well      
170,1.0,                       very thin  see through shirt      
171,2.0,                       these fit very small  i order the same brand and size every time and this time they fit very tight  it s time for me to go to a different brand      
172,5.0,                       one thing is for certain  these shirts will not become untucked  they re very long and travel past my groin just before the top of the thigh  these shirts are a little on the thicker side  and do not wick or air out the best  but for your everyday shirt that you gotta keep tucked  then look no further this is the deal for you      
173,1.0,                       the material is extremely thin and the size runs very small  i ve purchased fruit of the loom products at stores and i ve been happy with the product  this is not fruit of the loom  thin and very cheaply made  not sure if amazon is using generic sellers marketing items under a known name for a much cheaper price and product  this definitely is what this item is      
174,4.0,                       they shrunk a lot had to give them to my girlfriends teenage son      
175,5.0,                       these are great t shirts and the slight extra length is a great attribute  however the t shirt will shrink a little  i m      and     lbs medium build and the medium size is a great snug fit for me  i wear them under my dress shirts which are trim fit  so the snug t shirts work great      
176,1.0,                       i bought these because of all the positive reviews   after washing the shirts  they are night and day different and literally half the size that they were   i am not a body builder but the sleeves are so tight that they make it look like i am   almost everything described about these shirts in other reviews is not the case with the batch that i bought   they were super discounted so not sure if they were being offloaded due to being the wrong size or what   suffice to say i am sending them back because they are not soft at all and are terribly uncomfortable      
177,5.0,                       fits my husbands  beer belly  perfect  he can lift his hands and it s still long enough to stay over his stomach  no more sitting down and seeing his crack either  it stays covered        
178,4.0,                       i ordered these for my husband to wear as undershirts for work  they are just the right length to stay tucked in all day even when bending  squatting  and reaching      
179,4.0,                       not yet washed  the  stay tucked  version is a full    longer than the standard  fruit of the loom men s   pack crew neck t shirts  that i ve been wearing and not liking the past year or so   for the simple reason that they are cut too short for an average size torso  if you are looking for an undershirt this seems like a much better choice      
180,2.0,                       purchased for my dad for father s day to wear to bed  the collar was way too snug for him  ended up returning      
181,5.0,                       my          pound husband has a tough time finding undershirts that do not turn in to  baby tees  after washing them  no more belly or back sticking out when raising his hands or bending over  these shirts did not shrink  quality cotton  not see through  we will be buying these again and again      
182,5.0,                       my fiance really likes the extra length  his shirt never comes untucked anymore  he s happy  i m kinda bummed      
183,5.0,                       purchased for myself although i m a woman  prefer this vs women s version  fits great  nice quality  not too thick but thick enough      
184,4.0,                       can t argue with the pice and quantity  the shirts as sized   i enjoy them  however the shirts are kinda thin as you can see through them a little   but i assume they are their lower quality shirts to match the pricing      
185,5.0,                       i ordered these t shirts for my brother in law who has a long torso   his work also requires him to do a lot of kneeling and bending  it annoys him to keep re tucking his shirt  i found these extra long t shirts a few years ago and he loves them   besides being long  they are also soft and of good quality      
186,5.0,                       perfect fit  no more plumber s butt   soft and comfortable     
187,4.0,                       the fabric is a little thin  the feel isn t the best and the sleeves are a little short   but overall the fit is excellent and the price makes these shirts a great value      
188,5.0,                       if bending over reveals a bit too much of your anatomy  these shirts are just what you need  bought these for my son and although his waist is very large they come down lower than any  other undershirt i have seen even after washing      
189,3.0,                       i usually buy my under shirts from wal mart  always same brand and size  these are identical in packaging and look  they are just a thinner version material i guess  if you are only going to wear them as under shirts then they would be fine  but you can see through them to some extent  the ones i purchase from wal mart you cannot see through like these  i don t think id buy them again online  will probably just stick to retail for my under shirts      
190,4.0,                       prior to ordering  i read some comments complaining how the shirts shrank after they were washed prior to washing  i measured the front and back prior to washing  i also washed as instructed in cold water   i dried them in medium heat   these t shirts did not shrink   the front measured at     with the back      approximately    the quality of the shirt  after washing was great  strong and white   these shirts will stay tucked and i will be purchasing another package      
191,5.0,                       with the tapered fit version of the classic white t   fruit of the loom makes my great american conviction buy list    i will not buy any other    if you lift weights it s for you   no extra material at the waist       
192,5.0,                       i m a woman who wears these around the house on my days off so if i need to run out  i m not looking disheveled put on some jeans or yoga pants and run  i love the fact that after washing them so many times  they still look good      
193,5.0,                       super soft  feel great  love them  great value      
194,5.0,                       this is a great undershirt  i have been searching for one that s not too thin  or not too tight after you wash it  this one does shrink a little but all cotton shirts do  i actually could wear this shirt to the gas station or grocery store  it doesn t look embarrassingly small or thin like others i ve tried  will order more once these wear out but very happy customer  you will love these   highly recommend      
195,5.0,                       i m     girl   b size small in hollister superdry tops and xs size   in calvin klein skinny jeans and the size small fits a little loose but not too much  they are long as expected but once shrunk in the wash a little and they ll be perfect  nice quality  thin but not extremely translucent  and amazing price for         
196,4.0,                       i do plan to update this in a few months  i only just bought these  i washed the first few shirts and then compared pre washed to post washed for size  it seems to have lost about an inch in every direction  warm wash  cold rinse  dried on low heat  the comfort is good  frankly  and i like the tagless construction  i do wish these were a little more robust in materials  and i wish that the cotton would be pre washed prior to sale  but all in all  so far i am pleased      
197,5.0,                       although i do enjoy seeing my husband s belly  i don t really want to share it with the world  this t shirt enables me to keep the world s finest hairy belly to myself  the shirt is soft and long   stays in place  tucked into his trousers      
198,3.0,                       very nice shirts at a very reasonable price but they are too tight and long  should be wider and more rroomy     
199,4.0,                       if these fit you great  but i m          lbs  not built like rock  and medium they are too tight in underarms and arms i had purchased the same  medium  around      and      and fit was comfortable  but something has changed   these are not the same cut  i had to return them   first i bought a   pack and thought that was the problem  so i bought a six pack with      cotton  but same problem       
200,5.0,                       my husband is     and a lot of regular shirts are usually too short  especially when he s moving around  working  etc  these are the perfect length  they might just be a tad on the long side  but i think that s preferable to being too short  i expected them to shrink a bit after washing but they really didn t  everything else  sleeves chest  etc   fit just right  they really just kept everything the same and extended the length  which is what we were looking for      
201,5.0,                       fits as expected and no shrinkage in washing machine  this product is priced right  i am about     pounds and   feet tall and opted for the large size             perfect      
202,5.0,                       quality tshirts at an awesome price   these don t shrink up and survive several wash cycles before showing wear  naturally  you don t want to over dry them   these are great shirts      
203,5.0,                       fit is excellent  long style does not come untucked from pants  will buy again      
204,5.0,                       very comfortable and breathable  they are long as expected  but have a good fit and seem well made      
205,5.0,                       my husband is tall  and i had a hard time finding t shirts for him that don t shrink up too short in length  these hold their shape  they re long enough to stay comfortably tucked when he wants  and they wash well  he likes these so much that i m now ordering him more  so i can just donate the ones we recently bought that he felt were  too flimsy   i do hope this product remains available      
206,5.0,                       i liked these so much i bought a second package   i am           lbs with a        waist   the large tall size fits me perfectly  and hang down long enough that they actually don t come un tucked   no bs      
207,5.0,                       i bought these for my husband and he loves them  he usually wears a medium  so that s what i ordered him and they fit perfectly  he loves that they re so long since he tucks his shirts in for work  shorter undershirts tend to bunch up under his button ups  but these don t do that      
208,3.0,                       the shirts were longer before the first wash  but they are still gooddec     after   washes  the seam on the arms are coming apart on   shirts      
209,3.0,                       these stay tucked t s fit well  have the length to stay tucked in  and are comfortable thanks in part to the tagless design   the lower rating i gave was due to the weight or thickness of the material used  they seem to be about half the weight of the material used in my older fruit of the loom  t s which have held up well for years   i don t think these newer  lighter shirts will last nearly as long      
210,2.0,                       i ordered both these fruit of the loom  fol  shirts and gildan   these fol shirts are very thin and lesser construction quality than the gildans   i bought the fol because i had read a review somewhere that their material was thicker than gildans   the opposite is actually the case   i will not buy again      
211,5.0,                       i m          lbs  mediums fit great      
212,2.0,                       good fit on my      long torso frame   good quality cotton but the neck stretches out every single time i wear them   ordering a diff brand today and using these for cleaning      
213,1.0,                       we bought a package of these fotl t shirts in xl  i washed them in warm water cold rinse and regular dryer heat  you expect cotton to shrink but these shrank to about the size of a medium   we ll use them for rags   we ve been using hanes for years  same size  xl  without any shrinkage   go to any other well known brand   such a disappointment  the fotl were also scratchy  if anyone wishes to know  the batch sent to us was made in el salvador      
214,1.0,                       these shrink a lot and feel like sandpaper on sensitive skin   already washed them to see if they would soften up but no  guess they are going to goodwill or rags      
215,5.0,                       my husband needed new white t shirts for under his button ups and just some to wear around the house  the length is great  even after drying they didn t shrink up a significant amount like i thought it would    i have a tendency to accidentally put in the dryer his shirts that we don t want dried   because we know they ll shrink  big time all in all   great fit  good price for the amount of shirts in the pack   it made my husband happy  hope this review helps you or someone you may know        
216,5.0,                       so  my dad is a dry waller and every year for his birthday i get him fresh white tees because that is what he wears to work  and the white tees stain  fast  ergo  i know my men s white tees lol  this was a really good deal for the price  i didn t get to see them on him yet but seems good quality  was able to  feel the softness  as they put a hole for that reason and they are indeed pretty soft  hopefully it the same good deal next year        
217,2.0,                       t shirt is made of very thin fabric requires cold water delicate wash and dry  cannot use bleach came in a fruit of the loom bag but do not have tags on the shirts  possibly knock offs      
218,5.0,                       perfect undershirt if you are on the tall side   i m      and regular undershirts are too short for me but these are great     
219,4.0,                       i m wearing them as an undershirt  so no issues  but they were significantly longer than i expected   hypothetically  i could not wear any underwear and still go out in public      
220,5.0,                    celente me encantan estas camisetas me encanta el material me encant  el color me encanta la marca        
221,5.0,                       best fit on the market for me          i wear a size medium tall and this is right in line with that size  but tighter as it is an undershirt meant to be tucked   the sleeve length is perfect  too   these won t stick out of my polos   the collar is firm and fitting so it look professional  too   i was a lifelong hanes tshirt guy   never again   hanes collars start to curl due to their smaller size and strong understitch  plus they are way too short and untuck when reaching i would buy these shirts if they were pricier than hanes  but they aren t   amazing    unfortunately sometimes i expect the pricier item to be better  then suffer at my own expense  glad i figured it out this time       
222,5.0,                       true to it s label the shirts stay tucked in  they are just the right weight for fall layers      
223,5.0,                       liking these so far  gone through several packs  they don t shrink like some t s and neck doesn t get stretched out like some  great fit  only question is the armpits seem to stain faster or deeper  not sure if just me or in the design  still recommend      
224,5.0,                       they are a bit longer than i thought but can t beat the price besides they re worn for work so no big deal      
225,4.0,                       i have been wearing these for about    years   they last forever  fit perfect  and look good  the only reason i gave this   stars is because the cotton doesn t seem the same as all my other ones  lint never sticks to my old ones  but these ones get covered in lint the moment i put them on  idk if they stopped using the same cotton or if it is the dye  i haven t had to buy new ones in years since the others last so long  still good shirts  maybe after a few more washes the lint problem will stop  also they seem to not clean my glasses as well as the older ones do  probably due to the same issue  they are soft  with age my others got super soft and comfy  i hope these ones do the same  i ll be really sad if it ends up changing      
226,5.0,                       these are my husband s favorite undershirt   he s a tall guy but fairly slim   i can get him a large in these  he s           lbs  and they fit him across the shoulders but are long enough to tuck in and stay tucked in   they are good quality and have held up well to many washes   i will buy these over and over again      
227,5.0,                       very soft and very comfortable  so far the collar band is holding up great      
228,1.0,                       thought     was a good deal    to good to be true it usually is    another donation to the salvation army     mediums are small  material quality is just ok     whoever is running fruit of the loom    once a company known for quality is flushing that down the drain        
229,3.0,                       these shirts aren t soft at all  i ve washed them   times with extra fabric softener  and they re still very rough and scratchy  they also shrunk a bit and will pull out of shape if you have a belly  i like the length  but that s about it      
230,5.0,                       i love how long these are  they ll definitely not come unplugged  what really surprised me was how each shirt was nearly the same length when i bought hanes stay tucked shirts they had horrible quality control  i was lucky if   shirts out of a   pack were the right length  but fruit of the loom certainly got it right  i ll be purchasing more soon just to have them on hand      
231,2.0,                       if i could split stars between the general shirt quality and shirt condition  i d do   stars for quality and fit  and   star for condition   one round of shirts was ordered  at full price  and they were new and in good condition  the collar seems flat so far  and they were just as desired with regard to shirt length   longer than typical undershirts that don t stay tucked    note   size was selected assuming the shirts would shrink a little   if you don t take that into account  they might be shorter than you want  so  since the first set worked out nicely   i ordered another round     shirts total  and was pleasantly surprised that they were discounted   well  nowhere did i read anything that the likely reason for the discount was that all of these shirts appear used  with black marker through the label   about half had an obvious stain or flaw  and out of four packages of three  one package seemed to contain a completely different product even though packaging was the same    that set of three had some different wicking fabric for the underarm    various stains on outside and inside  a few tiny holes   they are intended to be worn under other shirts and will definitely be washed first  so i m keeping them  but i m unhappy to have received used products with no warning and no way to know ensure that i was ordering new products      
232,1.0,                       when i first opened the package  they were a great fit  after the first wash  they were tight  after two or three washes  they no longer reach my belt  and are tight across the chest  arms  etc  maybe my granddaughter can wear them every t shirt i have is medium  and these  after washing are probably extra small disappointing     
233,5.0,                       have washed all but  twice    i kept to compare  washed the others in cold cycle  first dried low heat next time on drying rack  when checked on still new one they are all the same      
234,5.0,                       my husband loves these shirts as they are long enough to stay tucked in while reaching  great buy      
235,5.0,                       i hate  i hate  i hate having to tuck in my shirt constantly throughout the day  and i can t stand not having a shirt tucked in  finally an answer  these shirts are fantastic  i have no desire to let them hang out like justin bieber in his rap videos  they tuck in great  and stay tucked in due to their longer structure  really great option and i am so happy i found them  i would recommend these highly   very comfortable to wear underneath a polo shirt not to heavy in causing over heating      
236,5.0,                       i love them so far  i m      tall and around     pounds  my torso is long and i need white undershirts that stay tucked in workout having bulky sleeves that stick out past overshirts  these fit perfect so  if you re looking for the elusive xlt  or whatever size in tall length  plain white t shirts that stay tucked in  buy these  they seem to be better quality than my old fruit of the loom xlts  these are almost as long even though they don t carry the  tall  size designation      
237,5.0,                       my husband needed to replace some of his  old  worn t shirts  these fit well  and were great price   we will purchase again when these are old and worn      
238,2.0,                       material very thin  cheap looking and feeling  we are sorry we purchased these  we won t order on line again      
239,5.0,                       these shirts are long   they don t come untucked when you bend or stretch   so refreshing      
240,2.0,                       they are great and comfortable to wear until you wash them  they shrank a lot   i am disappointed      
241,5.0,                       it fits great  it doesn t come untucked  it s breathable and soft  good shirt      
242,2.0,                       maybe go     sizes up shrinks to a smedium after first wash      
243,5.0,                       after getting other shirts that shrunk in the wash i bout these hoping they would not shrink and i was not disappointed      
244,4.0,                       these shirts shrink a lot  buy at least one size larger than normal  i usually wear a medium which is what i ordered the first time around  after washing and drying  they were way to small  i ordered large the second time and they fit much better  but honestly  i think i could have even gone to x large and they would have fit well  i am only      and     lbs  so obviously i would normally have no business buying xl anything      
245,5.0,                       great undershirts  i use that term because that is what they are  reading some of these reviews makes me believe people some do not know what that means  it means    you cannot screen print them   they are supposed to fit snugly  this helps wick away moisture so it doesn t show in your outer shirt  the sleeves are short so they do not stick out of your shirt sleevesthat being addressed i love these shirts  they are a great value for the money and work perfectly as described and intended      
246,5.0,                       these are the only undershirts my husband likes  cotton is nice and cool in hot  humid texas weather  he s      tall and these are long enough to stay nicely tucked  yes  cotton will shrink after washing so size accordingly i m so glad i found these on amazon and at a great price  too  just made my husband very happy      
247,2.0,                       these are good  but why the two star   each and every one had a black magic marker across the label in the back  not even sure what that means   i m not really too upset as you need to be within inches of my neck to see this but why   could have returned them but what the hey   they are fine      
248,4.0,                       this under shirts are comfortable but i found them to be perfect at the shoulder length but too loose around the waist area     
249,5.0,                       fruit of the loom has been around forever and for good reason   quality product at an outstanding price   you can t ask for more than that      
250,5.0,                       i bought these on a super sale  maybe a lightning deal and was not expecting much for      normally tall is preferred because t shirts are typically too short and tend to shrink more     surprisingly  these were not short like some other brands  but certainly not tall and drying on delicate cycle  have no complaints with the regular size  but  if i am paying retail  i would still buy the tall     they stay in your pants all day and can dry on regular cycle with a little shrinkage      
251,5.0,                       i am one of those people who wears undershirts  because they are made of cotton  which is gentler on the skin than the synthetic and blended fabrics that my wrinkle free shirts are made of  so the cotton goes directly against my skin  while the polyester and acrylic fabrics of the shirts stay off my skin  these undershirts are made of a thin material  which is good because i live in the warm to hot climate of southern california  i will be buying a bunch more of them  and i recommend them as a good value and a comfortable fit      
252,1.0,                       the black shirts fit like a large   i bought xl  the gray are extra long   below the butt  they grab the armpits  i would not recommend these shirts  i highly recommend the gildan brand   far superior      
253,1.0,                       very cheap material  amazing how far these brands have lowered their standards      
254,2.0,                       very thin t   cut   stitching are great   material is very soft   no complaints i read reviews   knew they are thin   great under shirt      
255,5.0,                       great feel  a bit big  but shrank after a hot wash and an even hotter dry  my fault  should ve ordered  xl abs not l  xl      
256,5.0,                       i m  ft ft        lb i bought the large  if i wear them untucked like usual  the shirt tail falls midway on the back pocket of my jeans  i wear my jeans normal   at the waist   i heard mentioned that they were too thin of material  that is not the case  i found after i washed and dried they shrink just the right amount for my size torso  and have compared several brands  these are  after drying thicker and more comfortable than even old navy s crew neck t shirts for three times the money     
257,4.0,                       these are fine but i didn t expect them to be as long as they are  i know the description says that they  stay tucked  but most t shirts like this shrink up so much   so i thought these would just be a normal length instead of too short  nope  they are long and stay that way      
258,4.0,                       they re just a little bit tight but i can t order the large      
259,5.0,                       this product fit great  it s hard to find a good deal here in hawaii  i am happy that we purchased this item  we may purchase more once he gets paint on these      
260,5.0,                       a bit on the thin side which is what i wanted   an undershirt to wear during warm weather under polos or other dress shirts      
261,5.0,                       so hard to find t shirts long enough for      dh  i was skeptical because of the low price  compared to a  big and tall  store  but these are nice and long  launder well and are an adequate weight      
262,5.0,                       good tee shirt  but a little shorter than i prefer      
263,5.0,                       it drives my husband crazy when his undershirts come untucked throughout the day   i got him these and he loves them   we have ordered them several times      
264,1.0,                       i returned the product unopened  once i saw that they are treating the garments with a new dow chemical that is intended to be some sort of odor protection   i don t know what these chemicals are  and i don t want unknown chemicals on my clothes skin environment   trying to find manufacturers that sell just good ole  cotton t shirts  and having a tough time finding them   this used to be a great product  fitting me perfectly  but i won t buy clothing that is treated with unnecessary chemicals   our environment is too toxic as is      
265,5.0,                       i am    years old and have wearing fruit of the loom underwear all of my adult life  they are the only underwear i will buy  i have never had any trouble or problems with them     
266,5.0,                       hubby lo ed the lenght  white  not aso called white  for the money well worth   i washed and believe this   no shrinks   i know hard to believe that  but truth  and women no wrinkles  cant beat price  will tell you not the finest but for price material id soft and fits better then some of the expensive ones i bought for him   i order because he likes his to stayed tucked in and these sure do the that  i ordered lg  he is tall and slender      
267,2.0,                       remember when fruit of the loom was a quality brand   the shirts looked huge when they arrived   after one washing in warm water and drying on permanent press setting  the large size i ordered is somewhere between small and medium   also  the bottom tends to roll up      
268,1.0,                       as much as i was looking forward to receiving these  they are wrongly advertisted by not cleaelt stating the  stay tucked feature  is simply that they are extremely long shirts which are not wearable to a normal person alone unless they are     minumum  would look goofy on anybody shorter and possibly still on them  the second picture at the top is a complete different shirt      
269,4.0,                       fabric is soft and breathable  colors are nice  it is a nice tight fit  and shows off biceps nicely  but that same short cut won t do much for keeping perspiration off your shirts and sweaters  so just beware if that is a real concern      
270,2.0,                       my husband    wear medium   and because of the review i bought lg  and it s too big and lang       
271,4.0,                       my husband is    and these are plenty long for him   after washing the length stayed the same but they shrank in girth   he usually wears a large but they were too tight after washing so i replaced them with xl   those fit the way he liked them      
272,5.0,                       i m a tall guy and have always had problems with undershirts shrinking up too much  if i buy extra large they don t fit right with the rest of my torso  these shirts are extra long so when they do shrink they still fit well and don t look like a flipping belly shirt  i know my fiance and kids appreciate not seeing my midriff lol      
273,5.0,                       these are the good kind of t shirts   they can go through multiple washes and stay white   the      cotton ones always turn gray   these outlast the ones that you normally find in the stores   i d highly recommend these for anyone with hard water  or who has trouble keeping white clothes white       
274,5.0,                       i ve only had them for a week  but so far these shirts are great   i am       and     lbs and i had been buying tall t shirts in a large for a while to make sure they stay tucked in with a dress shirt  but no tall size is necessary with these   i bought a large  and these will absolutely stay tucked in all day long  no matter what   the material is nice and quality seems to be good so far   the cut is not too wide  and not too slim  and the neck opening is a very good size for me   i read some complaints about a wide neck  but i don t have that problem at all overall this is a good quality shirt with a very good fit for me   not a bad find for less than     for a   pack      
275,5.0,                       these are my favorite men s t s  mostly i love the weight of the fabric  they re cool and they retain their shape over time  don t shrink up lengthwise  my favorite  i buy these for my husband but i might start getting them for me      
276,2.0,                       poor material  shirts lost shape after   wash  not quality you find in department stores  took a shot and missed       
277,5.0,                       better than expected at this price  thick enough and soft enough  too long  but not enough to be a problem with tucking them into briefs      
278,5.0,                       my husband is      and wears a    waist band  these shirts are beyond perfection i m jealous and wish they made them for me  the material is beyond soft  they wash well even using a stain remover  there that t shirt that both my teenage boys have already gotten  to them to steal   i m sure i ll be buying more packages     
279,1.0,                       i am so frustrated  i bought a   pack of these t shirts in a size medium because my favorite shirt is by fruit of the loom and a womens medium  i assumed that the mens medium would be if anything  bigger  i was wrong  the mens medium fit me way tighter than my womens shirt in medium by them  i know it s not how i laundered them either  because i followed the instructions and used cold water and low heat  i wish i could return the item or get my money back but sadly i jumped the gun and washed them where i could wear it the next day only to realize it fit skin tight  do yourself a favor and go up a size  or        
280,4.0,                       these t shirts are very comfortable and a great fit until it comes time to wash them  despite being laundered on  cold and tumble dried on minimum they still shrunk  i can still wear them but they are not as comfortable  i would suggest buying a size up and washing before first use      
281,1.0,                       initially  i was quite pleased and impressed with these shirts   i bought them to go on vacation because my older shirts were stained and or had small tears in them   i washed them  they shrunk to an appropriate size  and i thought   great     the problem is that they continued to shrink   i am      and i ve had the shirts less than   months and already believe they are too small   i ve had the hanes long undershirts for years and they never shrunk this much   i m very disappointed      
282,1.0,                       nothing to complain about the quality of work to make the t shirts  but what cloth  material  they chose to make them with is unbelievably bad   maybe once they were using higher quality cloth because of so many reviews praise them and some say they are much better than another known brand   i was looking forward for them because of those reviews   what i got are with like the canvas cloth that has been beaten to smooth it out   washing them won t help   can t use them for animals because that ll be an animal abuse   choose hanes or something better      
283,3.0,                       not what i expected  in the photo it looks like the fabric is comfortable and moves well  but it s more on the stiff  side  i realize it s a men s shirt and i m a woman but i ve worn men s shirts before that were soft fabric and not structured  there s nothing wrong with the shirt but if you re looking for something soft and unstructured this isn t it  it would be nice to wear out tho because it is more fitted  not an undershirt tho in my opinion it s a bit scratchy      
284,4.0,                       they are extra long  hence the stay tucked  so i d wear this around the house  but not much anywhere else  unless i am using it as an actual undershirt  the sleeves are shorter than a normal t shirt so they don t show when being used as an undershirt  a major issue i have  however  is they are really wrinkly even if you pull them fresh out of the dryer  they re nice for the price  but i can t see myself purchasing these again  only because i was looking for something i could use as both an undershirt and casual wear  the wrinkles and the extra long length make it so i can t use it for casual wear  unless i plan on staying home      
285,5.0,                       the length on these undershirts was perfect  they did stay tucked as advertised  the material was soft and comfortable though if i had to find something wrong the sleeves do occasionally ride up my arm with movement throughout the day      
286,5.0,                       these are not damaged or cheap versions of these shirts  these are the original quality you would expect from ones you bought in a store  i like it alot      
287,3.0,                       fits great  soft  only thing is that all the shirts i received have small holes in them  i have already washed or i would return for a replacement  i m sure i just received a damaged product      
288,4.0,                       best quality soft fabric cool love the soft cotton recommended for this price can t be beat      
289,2.0,                       i buy medium size hanes usually and it fits fine  this time   last time  i tried this brand and i am not at all happy with the quality and size  its too snug for me and the fabric is also not comfortable  not sure if it shrunk after washing but it s a bit too tight and the sleeves are also too small   although i ordered the classic fit  i feel like i was sent the slim fit version       
290,5.0,                       for my brother he love them true to size awesome deal thanks amazon they was late due to usps smh     
291,5.0,                       i selected the xl with an extended body shape and it fit me perfectly  i m        weighing about     kg and after reading all the reviews  gambled with this size  i said  gamble  because i purchased   sets of   pcs  a total of    pcs and especially in my currency  plus shipping  that is a lot of money  but it was definitely worth it because this same brand used to be available locally but they stopped bringing it in  those were available only in the xl size  these are xl long  i m very  very happy with my purchase  may even buy it again soon        
292,4.0,                       the product is nice because it is      cotton but the sleeves seem short like if they were tailored for children the length seams perfect but also a little tight around the chest  the colors are very nice but like i said the size seems to be off for a medium  i thought maybe i could buy a large but i m sure it would be too long in length     
293,1.0,                       didn t realize when i bought them that they ve been treated with some mystery chemical from dow  supposedly for odor control  personally  given dow s history  i d rather not be exposed to any of their chemicals  i d rather just wash them and myself to prevent odor like a normal person      
294,5.0,                       i can t review this product as i purchased the t shirts as a needed item for a shelter in town and had them delivered there i did  however  purchase the t s because of the existing good reviews     
295,5.0,                       i am a woman and i bought these for my self  they were great price  looked nice and soft so i decided to try them    and these are great  soft  comfortable  and affordable unlike most woman shirts      
296,5.0,                       my husband never used to wear undershirts until this year i bought two packages of this item now he thinks they are so comfortable and they are just like enough and not a weird color that he wears them whenever he wears clothes which is wonderful     
297,3.0,                       these shirts are okay and certainly reasonably priced   but they seem to run small   either that  or they shrunk considerably in a cool water wash   the material is also pretty light weight   they re not awful but not fully what i expected  either   they ll work okay as an undershirt but not for wearing as a casual tee with jeans   had i gotten a larger size  they might have been fine   their tuck in length doesn t seem to be any greater than any other tee shirt i ve owned   also  the sleeves are about half the length of those on all my other tees   they look kind of ridiculous if i were to wear the shirt without something else over it   again  perhaps shrinkage   but they were washed in cool water just as i do with all my other tees that seem to fare better      
298,5.0,                       it s fine as it is  that s why this is my  rd purchase  if you happen to be the taller type of person or prefer a longer length to avoid the rear side rolling up  which very seldom happens  then go for the  tall  version but of course at a slightly higher price  i had bought both types and both are fine for me  i m more concerned with the loose shabby sleeves  which did not happen to these that i purchased so far      
299,2.0,                       length is how i d like it  long enough to stay tucked in  about     inches lower than their standard undershirt however  the inseam of the sleeves are one inch shorter than the standard shirt  sounds crazy  but that little difference makes the shirts uncomfortable  always feels like your sleeves are bunched up into your armpit and so uncomfortable i turned all mine into rags      
300,5.0,                       in the second wash the tshirt gets shorter and third becomes unusable  but overall satisfied with the product     
301,5.0,                       finally a long enough undershirt without long sleeves  perfect  doesnt untuck inside my button up dress shirts  my only undershirt from here on  great for a guy with a bit of a gut      
302,5.0,                       i bought these to put htv on  great price   fits like it should for a man  however i bought for myself and should have ordered a size bigger  kinda runs a little small       
303,5.0,                       great pack my husband loves them and he is very picky  fits just right  my husband is       and    lbs if that helps anyone      
304,5.0,                       these are great undershirts   soft  comfortable  perfect sizing   in the past  i had to have several different types of undershirts depending on what wearing   some had large neck but also longer  short  sleeves  so they would stick out past short sleeved shirts   others had shorter sleeves  but higher  small necks   would look funny poking out of many shirts  i wasn t going for a catholic priest look    v neck undershirts never worked  btw so what i needed was    a loose neck with    shorter sleeves  so that would work in any situation   finally found what i was looking for      
305,1.0,                       after first wash they shrunk a full size or more   now using as a garage rag   if you want to buy them add at least   to   sizes or dont wash them      
306,5.0,                       love these shirts  the extra long is great  never have an issue with them coming untucked in all kinds of conditions and different kinds of pants  i never go to anywhere without one of these on underneath my clothes if the outfit needs it  they do look a little silly if you wear them as a regular t shirt because of the length  for my body type anyway  but underneath is great   quality is good too  no ripping or wear even with frequent use     
307,5.0,                       very pleased  the shirts fit perfect and do not ride up  definitely going to buy more  recommend to any  thank you     
308,2.0,                       ordered medium size  my chest size is approximately     unfortunately i washed them before i tried them on apparently they shrink  could barley get it on  not true to size  order next size and hope for the best      
309,5.0,                       great undershirt  i ride motorcycles and the undershirt always came untucked  this one is long enough that it never comes untucked  i m sure the people behind me appreciate that  crack kills  but mine doesn t cause this shirt keeps it covered when i ride      
310,5.0,                       i love these shirts  i have a slightly longer than average torso so i buy these and they stay tucked in through the day under my dress shirts  they re perfect for that      
311,5.0,                       my husband is picky about his shirts  and the hanes shirts are always shrinking or becoming too short to tuck  this is his brand of choice and i have yet to add any of these  stay tucked  shirts to the rag pile of shirts that are deemed too small  i will be buying more in the future      
312,5.0,                       slim fit shirts  excellent length so they stay tucked  feels like very good quality material  love these      
313,3.0,                       why do these shirts smell  i have been wearing them  but cannot get over the smell i have to take them off  i have washed them multiple times and they still smell like poo   idk its horrible  i regret buying at all      
314,5.0,                       i purchased mediums for my    yo            lb son  he s never complained of his shirts coming untucked  but when he said he needed more undershirts i thought these couldn t hurt  he says they fit and are soft and comfortable      
315,3.0,                       too many people say they run large  they do not   i m       and about only    lbs  half the shirts i own are medium and the other are large  only buy large for longer length  got a medium because thats what everyone keeps saying  only get a size smaller if you have very feminine baby shoulders  length was fine but the width fits my girlfriends size small women s  shoulders      
316,4.0,                       i rect bought some fruit of the loom white tees and the were two inches in the length  stay tucker much better than the hanes product of the same discerption  however the hanes a much better price point      
317,5.0,                       these are my favorite t shirts for wearing as undershirts and for working out   the sleeves are bit shorter than a normal t shirt  which makes them ideal to wear under a short sleeved shirt because they don t peak out from underneath   they also flatter the biceps while working out   the extra length is great for me because while i m not overly tall  i have a large belly and the extra length keeps that from being exposed when raising my arms or otherwise stretching my torso   i have purchased   sets of these shirts and found the sizes on all of them to be perfect and consistent   while there was some slight shrinkage i have not experienced as much as many of the other reviews on amazon  but i do take care to wash with cold water and tumble dry on low heat      
318,5.0,                       i ve always bought the standard white tees  and they usually get untucked  these are obviously meant to help fix that  so they have a good length that you tuck in and don t have to worry about the rest of the day  using a urinal is not a hassle at all  as these aren t so long that they make it a hassle  perfect length and great quality product      
319,5.0,                       daughter looking for comfy oversized t shirt   these are exactly what she wanted   can t say how it would be for the target audience  but she loves      
320,5.0,                       at      and     pounds these  xlt shirts for me perfectly  they stay tucked in my pants when i wear them that way      
321,4.0,                       these shirts fit great  even after the first wash  they didn t shrink too much and they are still very long so that they stay tucked in while allowing movement throughout the day  i should mention that i wear them as undershirts to my dress shirts polos at work  they shirts are also very soft and i will be purchasing again      
322,2.0,                       washed once and there was shrinkage   i wasn t in the pool either  we ll see how the second washing goes  okay  i was in the pool  second wash  more shrinkage  shirt does not feel soft anymore  i think a cotton blend would be better      
323,5.0,                       women s clothes are too expensive and in this type of product the men s med  made excellent work casual t shirts for her and had a better price  by the time you wash   dry them   or   times  they re a perfect fit      
324,5.0,                       i bought these for my boyfriend who is      and has a long torso  they fit as expected and don t show hill belly when he raises his arms like the other shirts he has      
325,5.0,                       finally found an undershirt that fits my husband  he s     and about     pounds  this fits and stays tucked in because of the proper length  it doesn t shrink much after washing either  i will be ordering him a second pack  this picture shows the difference in his regular length shirts and these which are actually for tall guys  amazing difference      
326,5.0,                       these shirts fit well  are long enough so that they will not shrink up to chest level after a couple of washings  and are of decent quality  the fabric is very nice   it s difficult to get excited about undershirts  but these have worked out well   decent product      
327,5.0,                       love these t shirts  they re just t shirts  but oh what they do  or don t do   they freakin  don t come untucked  i tell you  yes  they re longer than average  but not quite as long as a dress    unless you re into that  which is okay  i tuck them into my undies  so that they don t bulk up and or fold up under my tucked in button down shirts  they work great  will they last a lifetime  no  are they worth the money  yes  they ll hold up long enough to see you through      
328,5.0,                       fruit of the loom t shirts  super fit  softness good  wears well     
329,3.0,                       i bought these for a project  after washing them  nd time i noticed that it had shrunk a tiny bit  i only wash in cold water so i m not sure why they had shrunk     
330,5.0,                       it was white   had a hole for head  and a hole on each side for each of my arms   it also had a hole on the bottom for my toros  unfortauntel  the  stay tucked  only meant it was longer than usual  and i just didn t need that  and most importantly  i did not like that extra length      
331,5.0,                       i guess maybe the price could have been lower  but all things considered i would buy them again     
332,5.0,                       these are high quality low cost men s t shirts that cost about half as much as a similar bundle at kohl s  i ve been buying these for over a year now and simply replace all my old ones with new ones when i place the order  they are tagless and very comfortable for those who wear t shirts under their work shirts  i strongly recommend these over buying them at the store      
333,5.0,                       i hope they will last like older ones i  had back in      s   they are still good   can t  say that for the last   packs  i have bought several months ago   i  actually contacted customer service    weeks after opening old brand x  devloping holes   not cuts   rotten cotton      have no complaints about these newest ones   i  will  add comments  later if i  need to      
334,1.0,                       these are very poorly made  i ordered my size and it s like wearing a bed sheet  i wish i ordered a size smaller  in addition to being too big  the material is very cheap and thin  i wish i just spent a little more money to get something of better quality      
335,5.0,                       excellent choice for wearing them at home and as pijamas  i m going for a couple of packages soon      
336,1.0,                       i am sorry i made a mistake i didn t realize that i bought crew neck i want it v neck  what can i do about it  can you exchange him to v necks      
337,4.0,                       the shirt felt great but wasn t just right for length and i was afraid they would shrink being      cotton  they came right about a quarter of my thigh and i m        the fruit of the loom brand works best for me      
338,1.0,                       don t order these shirts unless you don t carewhat colors you get   they will send you what ever colors they have available surely not how they are advertised   would never order from this company again     
339,4.0,                       fits as expected every time  even after washing  little to no shrinkage from what i can tell  very comfortable and have held up very well for light duty   office work  my favorite undershirts      
340,5.0,                       price was awesome  product was great and soft   not moisture wicking tho so i m not sure why this was a suggested rating option   would buy again      
341,5.0,                       amazing the difference in having cotton rather than a poly mix  my husband really likes these cotton t shirts  comfortable by themselves or under a shirt      
342,5.0,                       these are great lightweight shirts with a good amount of length for a long torso man  such as myself      
343,5.0,                       i like my white t s  it can be so hard to find something that fits like it s the   st century leave the boxy t s in the    s i m an athletic male   feet tall     pounds and the classic fit medium fits perfectly  especially at this price  hang dry      
344,5.0,                       medium fits me perfectly   i m            with a     waist   it does shrink after the first wash  very nice  soft  and slim fitting after the first wash   if you need a loose fit  then you need to buy a larger size      
345,4.0,                       price was really important here  as this purchase was for a teen boy  he s constantly growing  so i did not want to  pay a lot for shirts that could last anywhere from   to    months  right out of the bag  i was impressed with the softness of the fruit of the loom men s stay tucked crew t shirts  plus  the bottoms are tapered  which was an extra bonus as my teen is extremely thin  no loose ends catching on things  these shirts are used as pajama tops  which turn into daywear during the pandemic  very happy with this purchase      
346,5.0,                       my daughter bought the fruit of loom tee shirts for her husband  they fit perfect and they are so soft      
347,1.0,                       i m not at all happy with these shirts  only because they re too long  this is my fault for not catching this in the description as  stays tucked in   i don t tuck in my t shirts  i ll pass them to my son who tucks his in  if you don t tuck them in they hang down way too much      
348,5.0,                       shirts are nice quality   they wear well and wash well   very minimal shrinkage with washing      
349,5.0,                       like the material  i might sound crazy  but for some reason my skin rejects all the t shirts i come in contact with except for a few   year old calvin klein t s that were  made in haiti   unfortunately there are no more of these made in haiti   this t is the next best thing i found that i am comfortable in  yes  you read it right  i found a t shirt of my skin s liking after almost   years  have ordered   more of these in colors and will see how that goes  thank you again fruit loom      
350,5.0,                       these shirts fit as expected  i washed them before wearing  only time will tell how well they hold up over several washings      
351,5.0,                       i struggle finding an undershirt that is the right size in the right places  they re always to short i m in length or the sleeves are too long and stick out of your over shirt  this one is just right  stays tucked in all day and the sleeves are short enough to stay hidden under a golf polo      
352,5.0,                       i always keep an eye for this product to go on sale  it is the perfect length with the stay tucked option  i ve had these be too short in the past and under a dress shirt they pop up and make your mid section look flabby  you don t have that issue with this product      
353,5.0,                       my husband is tall especially his torsothese fit great he can raise his hands with it out it coming lose     
354,5.0,                       the t shirts are comfortable and the quality  is good  i am a female and i purchased the t shirts for me      
355,3.0,                       i ve been wearing these undershirts for years and have enjoyed the collar fit and softness  after reordering  i ve discovered they now include seams down the sides that were previously not there  they are uncomfortable  distracting  itchy  and a massive downgrade from the previous products  how are you going to get rid of collar tags in the spirit of comfort  and then add massive  full length seams  additionally  the collars have gotten a little wider  not to the point it bothers me  but guys who like snug  tight collars may see it as a negative i don t know why something so basic can t be left alone but i guess i ll be looking elsewhere next time   the last thing you should be noticing all day is an undershirt  but these annoy me all day      
356,5.0,                       these shirts are nice   and they have an extra few inches in length for my tall husband  he s always complaining about his shirts coming untucked  and these definitely stay tucked in all day  we tested out one pack  and i just ordered two more packs  very happy with this purchase      
357,3.0,                       once washed and dried these were very snug in my husband  he usually wears a small in undershirts but won t wear these because they shrunk in the laundry      
358,4.0,                       shirt is great value for the price  i have tried more expensive brands and this has held up really good so far  however i tend not to tuck my shirt and noticed it rolls up when i am wearing say a sweatshirt  i am       chest       waist     and weight about        lbs and medium was perfect    no saggy  baggy lose ends  i noticed the shirt tends to appear shrunk in size after a long day  strange thing is after washing in machine it seems to go back to shape  overall you can t go wrong with buying this     
359,3.0,                       careful when ordering  i would go a size up as they shrink  other than that they re ok if you re just looking for work t shirts or for the gym      
360,1.0,                       sewn incorrectly  must be  nds  sew seam on collar is pinched and does not lay flat  it wouldn t be that big of a deal but it is right in front so if you are wearing a polo shirt you would have to button all the buttons in order to hide it      
361,5.0,                       these shirts are awesome  i havnt even washed one yet  but even if they shrink theyll still be longer than any other tshirt ive had  hanes sucks     
362,5.0,                       they are      cotton  but a thin material  i like them so much  i bought some for my wife  so i could keep mine   recommended      
363,5.0,                       wow  these are very nice undershirts and hard to beat for the price  they are nicer than i expected and will fit nicely under my shoulder holster and keep m warm too  the shoulder holster caused my old undershirts to ride up  these being longer to tuck in better don t seem to ride up  they are very soft too      
364,4.0,                       they shrunk a little when washed the first time  washed in cold water  dried on low heat   i normally wear an xl shirt  and the last xl t shirts i order were to tight  hence the  xl   and i order the tall ti ensure they would stay tucked in  they are still snug around the waist  but comfy everywhere else  and do stretch throughout the day  we will see if they last  and i ll update this review      
365,4.0,                       overall i like the tighter fit than standard shirts   i do wish they were about   inches longer as the stays tucked in ad is a bit of a joke the other issue is the neck elastic is too stretchy so i can tell the necks will not hold up      
366,3.0,                       great shirts but    i always try on and then wash any garment before wearing it  they fit fine before but not after washing them  also neck is smallest i ve ever worn  so i will try to find someone i can safely give them to      
367,3.0,                       now a days it seems the manufacturers are starting to cheat us by making the materials so thin  it s ok for the price but shrunk down a size      
368,2.0,                       very thin material  when washed first time shrunk and all wrinkled  washed a  nd time and one of the shirts has a hole in it  they were cheap and cheaply made  i usually wear stafford heavyweight shirts  x tall more expensive but holdup better and worth it  just have to keep eyes open for a sale       
369,5.0,                       perfect for my son  he s      and loves an undershirt     
370,1.0,                       i bought a   pack of these shirts to replace some older shirts that were stained or just getting worn out  they arrived quickly and they fit as expected  however  when they were washed they emanate an odor that smells between hot tar and a burning odor  it seems primarily on the grey shirts and perhaps it is because of some additive  the shirts say dual defense so is that some additive that is heat activated  when the shirts are cold  they have the odor but when the shirts are in the sun they reek  never had a problem with this brand in    plus years so guess it s time to change to something else      
371,4.0,                       mediums are apparently like smalls in this brand  very tight on the shoulders but long and loose around waist  but quality and the value of this   pack is great      
372,5.0,                       this product is huge for the claimed sizes  i would argue that for an undershirt choosing the smaller size would be better  that said  the shirts are nice and worth the cost      
373,5.0,                       with my brother s recent loss of both legs  he needed some new  nightshirts  to wear while sitting in a wheelchair all day  i am on a fixed income and had to quit working to care for him  so this was a perfect choice for me  the other shirts i bought him   years ago have bit the dust  with his daily nose bleeds these can be washed easily  when i can i will try to get him   more packs  maybe in color and maybe before christmas      
374,5.0,                       my son needs these shirts for school  as he wears white dress shirts as part of his school uniform   they are perfect for under his shirts and fit perfectly as he can still tuck the t shirt and his dress shirt in his uniform pants and not feel all bulked up   they wash and dry perfectly   i have not noticed any shrinkage and he has worn them every day to school      
375,1.0,                       these shirts are extremely thin and look too cheap for outerwear  i bought them to print heat transfer designs but they are too thin to wear as a stylish t shirt  do not buy these shirts with the hopes of printing designs on them  they are better suited as an undergarment only      
376,1.0,                       these seemed like a great purchase because they are a good fit and quality fabric  however after a few washes  they developed a horrible odor  i tried multiple times to get rid of it  but nothing has helped  i ve even washed them with other items but the smell is only on these shirts  i unfortunately will be throwing these away      
377,3.0,                       the length is good   the problem is that we like a  collar that retains its shape  lays flat   this collar is very thin and curls after washing  loses its shape pretty quickly   also note    i shouldn t have to iron my collar and sleeve cuffs to get them to lay flat instead of curling up under my shirtsleeves      
378,3.0,                       i ve been wearing fruit of the loom undershirts for over    years now   size and quality has been pretty consistent  but these shirts run way large   have the torso of the shirt loose is not a big deal  but the problem is that the neck is also scaled up  so out of the package it s super loose  and this will only get worse over time   it s like they just packaged a size larger shirt  named it  stay tucked  and called it a day   i had to order a size down to get the correct fit    now i have   brand new rags in the shop      
379,5.0,                       great t shirts   i really like them  fit greati liked them so much that i bought another pack of t shirts     
380,5.0,                       never have to worry about taking my shirt in  are the t shirts wasn t anything to tuck in  especially after you wash them a few times  but these i don t have a problem with it all      
381,3.0,                       i always wear a white t shirt as an undershirt  in the picture  the shirt underneath is a kirkland medium  compared to the kirkland shirt  the medium fruit of the loom shirt has smaller sleeve lengths and is a thinner material  the fruit of the loom shirt is decent though      
382,5.0,                       haven t washed the ts more than once yet  so i don t know well they ll hold up  but so far they are extremely comfortable  i just hope they don t start shrinking once they ve been through the laundry a handful of times      
383,4.0,                       for the money these are quality undershirts   while i would have preferred them to be slightly thicker  they are adequate for what they are  the length is nice and long  sizing for me was just a bit on the small side  though your mileage may vary  they wash up nicely and don t shrink too much  if on the fence on size  i would recommend one size up if anything      
384,2.0,                       these are not particularly soft or of high quality  they will most likely be donated to the thrift store  they are lengthy and even the classic fit is quite form fitting  i regret this purchase      
385,5.0,                       bought these for my husband to wear under his work shirts  these are the only ones he will wear  they always fit great  don t shrink  and are tag less     
386,1.0,                       i hate      cotton t shirts  these were advertised as     cotton and     spandex  the blended tee has a softer feel and don t shrink and stretch out at the neck as much when it s a blend  just be aware  at least for me  i received      cotton tees  if you want that  then maybe you will like these  but i did not      
387,5.0,                       these look great coupled with tights     and a belt if you re so inclined    these shirts wash great  no shrinkage  feel good  warm   good quality      
388,3.0,                       these are much larger than i expected but are nice shirts     
389,5.0,                       this undershirt is very soft and comfortable   the length is great for big and tall guys and on hot days it wicks moisture so you stay comfortable     
390,5.0,                       i ordered these shirts for my dad and we are in different states  he received them next day and the shirts were perfect  great service from the vendor amazon and delivery  very please with this purchase  thank you       
391,1.0,                       buyer beware  i always had purchased these shirts from target with no issue  shirt was long enough for a large after being washed to keep my dress shirts tucked in  no issues  i purchased   of the same shirts from amazon and   of them are shorter than the other   by about   inches  the tags read the same everything matches they are just shorter and unwearable without them constantly coming untucked  lesson learned  back to target      
392,5.0,                       great  especially for the price   fits as expected    not too thin  not too thick   good undershirt thickness   sleeves are perfect length and do not stick out   at the price you can replace them every few months      
393,1.0,                       what the   i ordered the   pack which was supposed to come with three gray and two black shirts as pictured  i got a four pack  three black and one gray  not factory packaged the shirts seem fine and fit quite well  so i m not going to bother returning  however  i doubt the authenticity      
394,3.0,                       the fruit of the loom men s stay tucked crew t shirts arrived in a simple clear plastic bag   when my son first tried on a t shirt  i could see through the it  and it hung to just above his knees   i read through other reviews and decided to wash it   wow  the shirt shrunk so much that i debated if he needed a larger size   with the shrinkage  i was no longer able to see through it   the collar lays flat  but the material appears wrinkled even fresh out of the dryer   i will not buy these again      
395,3.0,                       i was looking for some oversized men s shirts and the pack was on sale so i bought it  i usually wear a women s xs or s so i figured a men s medium would be perfect but they were too small around my hips  so i ended up cropping most of them  not exactly what i was looking for but good value for the money  definitely size up more than expected if looking for an oversized look      
396,5.0,                       this is my  st time buying the stay tucked t shirt s  but as always fruit of the loom doesn t let me down   excellent quality along with that they just feel good wearing them   these t shirt s are just as good as the other costly ones that are advertised daily   if you want a product with the same qualities  but at a lower price men don t delay making these t s your next purchase      
397,4.0,                       to be honest  i really didn t do much research before buying these undershirts so my expectations weren t too high when they arrived  however  i was pleasantly surprised the t shirts are lightweight  comfortable  and the collar stays flat all day  two things i noticed about these undershirts are that they re thinner than most other undershirts which i don t mind personally but i d understand if others would  the other is that they re longer which i find nice because the shirts stay tucked and don t bunch up at all  as far a size goes  i typically order a size smaller so that the shirts are more form fitting  i m         lbs  and a small fit perfectly overall  i m very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend these undershirts to anyone looking to buy new ones  hope this helped      
398,1.0,                       washed once and the material doesn t feel combed in any way  it seemed to shrink down one size on first wash and is way more form fitted than i would have expected i want to return this because the cotton is very rough and the shrinkage factor is very dramatic  expected more from fruity the loom      
399,5.0,                       transport to nz was more costly than the t shirts  the shirts are made to high quality standards  this is a repeat order  first order was similar high standard      
400,5.0,                       i washed them once i received them  fit pretty good  soft  will update on how well they hold up  shrunk slightly after washing and drying them on the appropriate cycles for new clothes update  still white  in shape  and fit well      
401,4.0,                       i bought this pack to use at the gym  so my standards were pretty low to be honest  i just wanted something with no labels and easy to use they fit well  they are not super soft  hence the   stars   and don t look super cheap  move pretty well with them doing all kinds of weight lifting and using machines plus cardio just be sure to pick the correct pack option  i don t know why there are so many to choose from it makes everything confusing      
402,5.0,                       i m very happy with these undershirts  really like the extra length  it s not much  but makes a difference  the collar stays nice looking too after washing for the price  a great product highly recommended      
403,5.0,                       love these shirts  comfortable and long enough to stay tucked in all day      
404,1.0,                       i m so sick of this   it happened with some black t shirts i ordered too   have to return these and those   sick of this   you buy a clothing product and it s perfect   this is the third time i bought these because they were so good   now i get this third purchase and they are so thin   you can see your hand through them   i would never were these   they are seriously not much thicker than a gauze bandage   so irritated i had to take a picture   it may be hard to see my hand but if you look close you ll get the point   such a shame because the two previous purchases of this same item were right on point      
405,5.0,                       i m      tall  long torso  and have a hard time finding t shirts that stay tucked  these are the longest i ve ever had  they are also not see through material  overall  i think these were a super bargain      
406,5.0,                       great comfort  softness and good value for your money      
407,5.0,                       a smidge too big but i personally hate it when they are too tight  so it s perfect for my tastes  other thing i love is the length  seems that most t shirts you have to hope they are long enough to be able to tuck in without them popping out in the back  these are longer and again  perfect for my taste  definitely gonna get more       
408,4.0,                       i ve bought many different brands of t shirt s to find one that doesn t shrink into a short shirt  so far after a few washes and drying in my dryer they are still as the day they arrived   they were priced very good for a multi pack of high quality shirts  i would buy again      
409,1.0,                       the package that arrived stated that the cotton had a treatment by dow chemical to make the cotton more odor resistant   the website did not mention this   i do not want to wear chemically treated cotton   returned      
410,5.0,                       perfect fit for my     husband  super soft  hubby liked them so much i had to order more      
411,4.0,                         ft        in and      lbs  shirt fits chest and shoulders fine without being to loose   hangs low enough to stay tucked but doesn t need to be piled up on the back of the john to drop a deuce   not itchy or scratchy  probably won t get it s own show   hasn t shrunk up yet      
412,5.0,                       fit   length for me is hard to come by  i require a large tall in my t shirt for them to stay tucked  these shirt are spot on with the fit i ve been looking for  let me know if you have the large tall a frame tanks      
413,4.0,                       i bought size small for my son who is about   ft    inches tall   these came down way past his belt and part way down the thigh   i guess if you wanted a tee shirt to stay tucked in these would be nice but for regular wear they re too long   and he said they didn t feel very comfortable  either   we sent them back      
414,5.0,                       wanted to make a change from the white undershirts and found this package with its color combination   shirts soft and fit as expected  with enough length to tuck and stay put during the day   shirts are definitely of the quality one expects from a brand like fruit of the loom      
415,5.0,                       i m        lbs  so being my size with a taller muscular build  it s hard to find shirts that are the right length in the torso region  i was absolutely blown away at just how perfect they fit  they re the perfect length and fits the frame of my body perfectly  even after a cpl washes  they still come out a little shrunk which is to be expected  beings how there      cotton  but they still hang well below the waist line  i ve already bought   other   packs because of my experience and how much i loved them  so if your tall like me and how a long torso  these shirts are the way too go         
416,2.0,                       too loose fitting for an undershirt  thought they would shrink in the wash but they did not  uncomfortable when warring them with a slim fit dress shirt      
417,5.0,                       loved the t shirt   the typical  long  t shirt is very expensive so ordered these instead only to find it was longer than average and fit as expected in every other way   i live in florida so don t mind that the material is a little thinner than typical      
418,4.0,                       as others stated order   size up   shrinks alot hopefully not everytime it is washed  does not have pocket     
419,5.0,                       i have had alot of undershirts over the years  this brand of undershirts imo is far superior because     they offer a stay tucked version  which they actually stay tucked  and     they dont seem to shrink in the washer dryer  these are definitely worth the buy plus they are cheap      
420,3.0,                       fabric was fine just a little small  don t get me wrong i could have sent them back and ordered the size up  i just changed my mind and amazon accepted the return as advertised  great price  great service      
421,5.0,                       awesome  i am    tall and have put up with t shirts which bunch up around my waist above my belt forever  these t shirts are about   inches longer  which are perfect  i ordered large regular   i was tempted to order a tall  but am glad i didn t  as these are plenty long      
422,3.0,                       i am giving this   stars because what was delivered to me was  in fact    white shirts  and surprisingly they fit  so no false advertising there but the quality    for shirts that are    each  you won t be surprised how poorly they re made  i felt the seams rip putting on the shirt for the first time  i didn t dare attempt to wash these  but i can only imagine these cotton shirts in the wash would shrink tremendously  on top of that  they re very see through  so they can be used as undershirts only so buy at your own risk  if you need some quick  cheap undershirts  then these will work for you  but if you re looking for a shirt that ll last any amount of time  buy something else      
423,5.0,                       these are the best t shirts as far as fit  in my opinion  i ve probably gone through     of them since they first started making the  stay tucked  version  i do wish the material was a little softer  but with fabric softener they are good enough  i wear medium as undershirts and large as a regular t shirt  i m a muscular athletic build      
424,5.0,                       i purchased these for my significant other  he was frequently complaining of the competitor brand he had always purchased  especially after they were washed and dried he always noted that they shrunk on the sleeve length as well as the length of the shirt itself  although he does not tuck in his undershirt  was hoping to find a white undershirt that would not ride up beneath his outer shirt   after washing and drying this product he was pleasantly surprised to have found a t shirt that didn t shrink too much  he still referred to it as fitting perfectly  i will note that he did not follow the wash instructions he used fabric softener and washed with warmer water and dryed them on low heat  however  even after these factors this white undershirt t shirt fits perfect and will definitely be something we purchase again  i would definitely recommend it it is an excellent quality and a great value     
425,4.0,                       bought these for my husband  got them for a great deal and liked that they ran long because other white undershirts tend to shrink quite a bit after a couple washes  these stayed long but not too long  the one thing i would complain about about these shirts is that the sewing is off which makes folding them difficult due to sides not lining up  if you place a few up next to each other  they re not close to being almost identical      
426,4.0,                       these are low end products and i don t need any better   good for the price   i ve only washed it for first time and didn t come out unraveled or damaged      
427,2.0,                       i ve worn fotl t shirts for decades  i know the fir and i know how they re made  these shirts are tighter than usual and the sleeve hems and bottom hem are much smaller than usual  prob      vs      hems    they also roll constantly  i suspect knock off   will not buy again from this source  i ll order from target where i ve gotten them for years      
428,5.0,                       these are long tail and will stay tucked in  not the average length which is what i like     
429,5.0,                       love these shirts  i got them because my butt crack was always accidentally exposed at work  these are great because they tuck in and help save my coworkers from seeing my butt crack on accident      
430,5.0,                       great fit  was a little concerned but after first was the fit was still perfect      
431,5.0,                       i ordered these and of course clothes are not made the same  i bought this style at walmart and they were so thin and cheap  but i did order and the quality is better  the t shirts were much better than walmart  there slender but they still fit my husband  could have been a tad wider  but the longer t shirt was great because they are just the right  length   if you want to wear outside of your jeans not to long   but if you like to tuck as i do these are great  got a good tuck and didn t try to slide up  lol     
432,2.0,                       expect a nice fabric and classic fit   wrong  hanes should be embar    assed   i confess i bought them because they were chea p     
433,1.0,                       there was a line running down the front of each shirt   returned     
434,5.0,                       fit is slightly larger then i expected but they are very comfortable     
435,1.0,                       shirts are great  but only received five  packaging said six  not going through the hassle of returning  when i need them now  an option for a reduced    credit would be nice     
436,5.0,                       i have these same ones in white  was worried they wouldn t be exactly like those  since they are a different color  we ll  they aren t  they might be better  i use them as undershirts but they could easily be worn as a normal t shirt  the long length is perfect for keeping them tucked under sweaters  dress shirts  etc  i will definitely be purchasing more      
437,4.0,                       these shirts are a little bit sweet through as they are very light  they are very comfortable  for a petite woman  the small size is a little long and loose      
438,5.0,                       these are true to size  like the different colors   good price point       cotton      
439,4.0,                       it shrank after washing drying and the bottom now slightly turns upwards and won t sit straight  so i think it shrunk unevenly a bit  not make or break for me as i just used them for practicing tyedye and i m a xs female i got size medium so it would cove me fully and i could wear it for sleeping or around the house  they re fine  nothing special      
440,4.0,                       these are great general purpose undershirt  they are super long in the torso  but  this is why they are called are stay tucked shirts  to me this limits their situational usefulness  but i did buy them specifically to go under my dress shirts and the occasional polo shirt i may wear  ftl does great work  they are comfortable  soft and i especially like that they are tagless      
441,4.0,                       they are very comfy not really that see through  only complaint the packaging was a little broken     
442,5.0,                       length is perfect  i ve been struggling to find a longer undershirt that will stay tucked in  as other reviewers noted  the shirts do shrink a little when first washed  but they are actually oversized prior to being washed and then shrink to the correct  expected fit  they are very comfortable  i ll be buying more soon      
443,4.0,                       i am still wearing these after about six months  but they no longer  stay tucked   they color has held relatively well with only minor fading  but the shirts shrank more than i expected them to      
444,1.0,                       i am disappointed in the black shirts   i have white  and they are great  the two out of five gray ones that came in this pack are great   the black ones start way long  and i thought they would be great   major shrinkage after first wash i bought these in hopes that they would not shrink like the other black ones i have  but there must be something in the black fabric   all other undershirts i have  multiple colors  all shrink way way way less than the black these shirts are still slightly longer than the gidlan s  but with how much they shrunk at the lower end  they also shrunk equally at the top end   i m not a huge guy by any stretch  but this got tight across the chest and biceps   if you have any sort of gut  expect it there too   mine isn t big enough to pull up on the bottom of the shirt  but if it was  these would easily be pulling out of my pants was very much looking forward to this problem going away  but alas  icarus flew too close to the sun and his hopes were trounced happy hunting      
445,5.0,                            pure cotton  very comfortable and best of all  low price   excellent product  thank you      
446,1.0,                       do not buy these shirts   they shrink after one wash   and i always wash my clothes in cold water   complete waste of money   will definitely be looking to return them      
447,4.0,                       i bought a size larger to allow for shrinkage  but they are long enough and stay tucked in  i d buy them again      
448,4.0,                       i did not realize these were the shirts i purchased before  they fit great  they re very comfortable for exercising     
449,4.0,                       nice cotton   quiet long t shirt that i would like   its under shirt so suppose to be not that long   i bought a medium sized ones   the arm pit not that flexible and tight   so when you raise up your arm it would move the whole shirt up    so you can say its a tight fit somehow         
450,5.0,                       these undershirts are a great option for men who have to wear business attire each day  the shirts fit closely to the body and don t wrinkle under the dress shirt  but they are not tight or uncomfortable in anyway  i would highly recommend to anyone looking for new shirts to wear under their dress clothes      
451,5.0,                       love these  as i get older and fatter my  large  size t shirts just are not long enough  so an extra inch or so is way more comfortable   anything i get that is long enough is like a paint smock    except these i m   foot about    lbs and the large fits me perfect      
452,5.0,                       fits great and is comfortable  rating low due to the fact it s only slightly thicker than   ply tp  should either be even less money or thicker material        
453,4.0,                       these t shirts are very versatile  it can be the t shirts for a quick trip out  and can also be an inside shirt for a dress shirt  it fits as expected  it would be even better if it feels softer  compared to some other brands   this shirt is slightly rough to the touch   however the prices are great  overall its a great buy for the money     
454,5.0,                       the stay tucked is the sole reason i purchased these and they delivered   i wear these under my dres shirts every day and hate when my dress shirt is tucked but the undershirt ender up pulling itself out   non longer a concern with these     
455,2.0,                         stars for  odor control   why do they need  odor control   do you even know what makes up odor control and do you know how it affects your health  if you don t care  no problem  you ll love these shirts  i wish i had paid more attention when i ordered them for my son      
456,1.0,                       i ordered the medium size but it defiantly all smalls   on me and measured against actual medium t shirts i own   it s one of the problems of off shore manufacturing   will never buy again      
457,4.0,                       i was looking to purchaser some shirts for my father when i came across fruit of the looms   pack of men s t shirts   this  was just what i was kooking for   the shirts fit nice  are a good quality  and very reasonably priced      
458,2.0,                       now i remember why i don t buy tee shirts like these   quality is bad   very thin   let s see how many wash it will go through before it evaporates  lol   i guess i ll stick to my normal brand      
459,5.0,                       good cotton  perfect at the shoulders and chest      
460,5.0,                       i have been wearing fruit of the loom forever and a day  i wore whites tees under my suit when going to work  no more job   no more suit  always wore their pocket tee s off duty  but colored tees aren t always the way to go sometimes hence the whites are back      
461,4.0,                       a bit too long  apparently i m somewhere in between      
462,5.0,                       these shirts are great  perfect for a base layer as winter hits  no more itchy sweater again my skin      
463,5.0,                       the shirt is  bit tighter in the chest than i expected a size medium to be  but  a size large would be too big      
464,5.0,                       these are great       soft  absorbent cotton  no tags and at least    longer than the regularly sized t shirts  these are long enough to stay tucked in when my man bends over and long enough to cover my hiney when i steal one of his t shirts to wear to bed   label says use non chlorine bleach  one strange thing  i compared the price offered between the  x  small        chest   and the  x  small  and noticed the  small  ones were about half the price of the other listed size smalls   i ordered the less expensive version which was just under fourteen dollars  and when the package came  it said  small         chest   so i don t know why the sizes are listed two ways but buyer may want to look at pricing for both listed sizes and choose the one with the best price      
465,1.0,                       received with a black stripe through each tag   someone took a marker and marked the shirts   the marker bled through so each shirt has a black line on the back   tried to return and i have to ship the defective material back  but seller indicates returns on clothing won t be accept in instruction email i was sent a defective product that was damaged intentionally   i suspect the shirts didn t meet quality standards and were marked as such   just give me my money back      
466,4.0,                       this product fit fine   i would have liked the material a bit thicker  but you can t have all you want unless the price is increased      
467,5.0,                       the extra length on these t shirts is just right  i always have to buy tall sizes of most things  but these are perfect just as they are  the cotton is soft  and the fit is great  they shrink just right  as in  the t shirts are the right size when they come out of the wash  and they re very comfortable      
468,3.0,                       lost about     inches in length when wet   thats normal  but the shirts did too really  once through the wash twice they shrunk up good and now expose my belly when arms are raised   fruit of the loom support responded quickly to my concern  but but did so too quickly  by sending out six more t shirts of the same size  nice to see them so eager to try to rectify the problem but i would have preferred if they consulted me first  as i would have told them to send the next size up  i do expect the replacement shirts to shrink just as much as they are the same exact product for the record i m a lean       and i got medium to avoid excess billowing at waist   fit great coming out of the package but definitely order a size up if you are concerned about length      
469,3.0,                       these t shirts are good quality but thin gauge  fit higher at the front of my neck than i d like  at my adam s apple   the length is definitely longer than i m used to   maybe not too stylish for some   utilitarian might be an accurate description i purchased the black and grey package  and i like the colors   i m satisfied with the purchase  but next time i ll look for v necks      
470,5.0,                       very nice shirt  i ve been buying hanes large  undershirts  but they re rather short and i have to stretch them to tuck them in  these fruit of the loom shirts are much longer in the body for easy tucking in addition  i prefer the texture of the fruit of the loom shirt  smooth  silky feeling cotton  vs  the hanes shirt  rougher cotton texture  as you can see  i think the fruit of the loom shirt is better than the hanes shirt  to top it off  they also cost less      
471,4.0,                       not a fan  super thin material  very cheaply made  shrunk when washed in warm water  would not buy again      
472,4.0,                       initially i didn t think these would be comfortable for my husband   the texture felt rough and not what we are used to in this brand   they were inexpensive so i figured you get what you pay for   i decided to wash a couple to see how the texture would be   these softened up a lot   my husband says they are pretty comfortable      
473,1.0,                       they shrunk   sizes after   washes  definitely a waste of money  afraid to buy a larger size  as might be too big in the neck  i don t like a saggy neck on t shirts  update  after multiple washing they continue to shrink even more  now they will not tuck in at all      
474,4.0,                       after having lost a lot of weight  i needed new t shirts to wear under other shirts or sweaters  these were a great price and so i bought a pack  not disappointed  they shrunk a bit after the initial wash but they re not uncomfortable tight      
475,5.0,                       these are my all time favorite undershirts  the long cut is great  and they are soft i did notice on my most recent purchase  however  that they seem to have taken on a slimmer fit  that s not necessarily bad  but i almost may need to move up a size      
476,5.0,                       used to wear hanes  latest batch was different and shrunk so short they could barely tuck  these are much better  stay tucked all day through work and playing with the kids      
477,3.0,                       product is for taller men  i m        however  there is quite a bit of shrinkage after they ve been washed a couple times  not so bad that they don t work as advertised  but if you ve got a big build  the t s will be tight around shoulders  chest  and arms      
478,5.0,                       nice craftmanship  fits really well and a great value   the cotton material is sturdy and comfortable   well constructed   and  the material doesn t disintegrate with multiple washings  or bleaching like a more expensive brand i tried   would definitely recommend this product to everyone      
479,5.0,                       the tee shirt fit is comfortable and not too heavyweight      
480,4.0,                       these are really comfy and seem pretty durable so far but i might have taken too large a size in error  i chose to get a large as i normally do whenever i purchase any shirt garment but these were more on the roomy side compared to the snug fit that i prefer  i suppose medium would have been best   i not too worried about it though especially since there were a few reviewers that expressed these shirts shrink significantly once they go in a dryer   this is probably the only time i m looking forward to the  dryer effect  happening  lol      
481,5.0,                       buying these at the store you are going to pay a lot more  the fit is great and it is fruit of the loom quality  buying an extra large tall is not always easy but this made it easy to buy   well worth it      
482,2.0,                       these t shirts are tight on me and uncomfortable  i m     or   tall         and i usually buy cheap t shirts  large size  to wear both as an undershirt in the winter and as a single shirt in the summer   i bought these large size t shirts  twice  while sheltering in place because my current ones were getting holes in them and i needed some new ones for summer  i wouldn t buy these again  they are  much lighter in weight than my normal  t shirts  which means they won t work as well as an undershirt in winter   the sleeves are shorter than normal    x     top of sleeve   under sleeve  in comparison to    x   for my previous ones   the armhole where the sleeve attaches is smaller  so the sleeves are then tight   binding under my arm and also makes the shirt stretch and pull under tension when i raise my arms  and tight around my biceps  not too much actual measured difference  but because of the shorter length of the under portion of the sleeve combined with the too small arm hole  ends up making the sleeve somewhat tight around my not enormous biceps   and the neck is also somewhat binding  the arm hem seams are somewhat tiny  suggestive of general scrimping on material  and the whole shirt feels  tight  and binding  not loose as i normally get  the shirt is uncomfortable to wear    i regret buying them  but they ll have to suffice for now  i would not advise buying them  unless thin light weight   tight is what you re looking for  the only good things are they lack physical labels  which irritate the back of my neck   and they are long enough to not ride up out from my pants in activity  they fall halfway between mid thigh length and belt height       
483,3.0,                       like the headline says  these shrink quite a bit  i was expecting to use these for more than just a few uses but the material just shrivels up and they become small after a few wears  out of the bag  they feel great  just dont expect them to last very long     
484,1.0,                       fruit of the loom don t hold up to machine drying  out of the package  they were great  after one machine drying  they were trash      
485,5.0,                       perfect fit tapered shirts   no more bunching up when you tuck your shirt in     i ve always just purchased xl shirts from walmart and thought id give tapered a try    glad i did       
486,4.0,                       i have had better undershirts honestly  just not very happy with how this product fits      
487,1.0,                       very itchy material  i have order undershirts from amazon before  different brands and they have been just ok  but this order is bad  very itchy fabric also very low thread count  i can see right through this batch      
488,4.0,                            cotton t shirts shrink after each washing until they choke my chest  but these cotton poly blend shirts stay the same size   they re well made  comfortable  breathable  lightweight  tagless      cotton     polyester  durable  economical  and almost perfect except for the prominent permanent crease running down the middle   washing  wearing  and even ironing does not remove it      
489,1.0,                    son demasiado grandes la talla m es igual a una xxl y las de talla l  xxl        
490,2.0,                       when we wore the shirts the first time they fit great   we washed the product as suggested and they shrunk  to the point we could not wear them anymore      
491,3.0,                       i like the shirt   although after i washed them the color of the fabric changed a little   it was perfect white but after washing it becomes almost off white        
492,1.0,                       every single one of these shirts has shrunk up until my belly pokes out the bottom  in fewer than   months  the fabric is starting to fray at the tail and sleeve cuffs as well  this is even with washing them on cold with good detergent and drying them on low heat  i would not recommend purchasing this product from this seller  the quality is very low and the product will not be serviceable for nearly as long as one would hope      
493,5.0,                       these are my favorite basic shirts  you might think they re just undershirts but they ve quickly replaced most of my t shirts as my every day wear      
494,4.0,                       these are pretty good undershirts  not thick enough to wear as a regular shirt but do the job  out the box they seem a little short but have good stretch     
495,5.0,                       it s always good and comfy   wears out every   years or so with weekly laundry      
496,2.0,                       these fruit of the loom t shirts are of a lesser quality as compared to those we had bought years ago  the hem of the sleeves tends to roll as does the bottom hem  they are flimsy  simply not the quality of those purchased before  they don t measure up with bvd s round neck      cotton t shirts  my husband likes to wear them under sweaters  these he will wear for working around the house or in the yard      
497,3.0,                       the ad for these t shirts show   colors of shirts  i received   black shirts and   grey  if i did not need these shirts i would return them  i will never buy these in the future  i am not sure of the fit yet or the comfort level since these shirts just arrived  it ticked me off about the colors to immediately write this review   update next day   the shirts do not shrink when washed in cold water  they are soft against the skin and comfortable to wear  the lack of variety in color is my only complaint      
498,1.0,                       way too tight to actually  wear  if they didn t  need to ever be cleaned  they would be fine  they fit out of the package  but  even following the washing instructions  the amount of shrinkage was way in excess of what should occur  they became little boy t shirts  ugh  total waste of money      
499,5.0,                       what s there to say  the material  durability  length  fit  and size are all what you expect from fotl  the necks are staying in good shape  and the seams are maintaining with daily use over the past several months i ll buy them again  as i ve been buying them for over a decade  they ve yet to fail me      
500,5.0,                       i m a woman and just needed some t shirts for around the house and stuff  i ordered these and i love them  they re not too light and not too thick  i hate really thick tees  and they re super comfortable  five for     yes please      
501,5.0,                       husband is long waisted so xl tall fits him perfectly  barely any shrinking too      
502,5.0,                       these t shirts are now one of my favorites   they are great for tucking in your trousers because they re long enough to stay tucked in   i purchased them to wear under long sleeve shirts but found that i like wearing them just as t shirts alone as long as i want to have them tucked in   in my opinion  they would be too long to wear outside of your trousers but that s not what i purchased them for   so they work great for my use   fabric is just thick enough for all around use      
503,5.0,                       i waited a few months to write a review to make sure the shirts held up and didn t tear easy or fade  they didn t  they look just as they did the first day i got them   great shirts  not too soft but comfortable and no irritating tags     
504,5.0,                       my husband loves these tshirts  soft  comfy  great fit  no more winnie the pooh  length is great for those tall guys      
505,3.0,                       i bought a few packs of xl so called preshrunk cotton   well guess what  i wore a few before washing  and then i washed in cold water and dried and they shrunk considerably  they are still below the waist but really shrunk too much      
506,5.0,                       the t shirts fit perfectly  they are quite long and will stay tucked in  important for me as i prefer to tuck in a t shirt  even if it is the only shirt i am wearing       
507,4.0,                       these are comfortable and fit as expected   my son has had no complaints and i was happy to find white t shirts for him that were affordable enough that i didn t need to worry too much if he ruined a few here and there  as teenage boys tend to do i like the style and the cut of the shirts and he likes the comfort and that is all i am really looking for in a plain white t shirt      
508,1.0,                       not sure what all the good reviews are about  paper thin  practically see through  returned      
509,4.0,                       these aren t super soft but pretty decent   they fit ok   the length is good   washed several times now and they are holding the length which is usually a problem with t shirts      
510,5.0,                       this is a perfect white undershirt  i cannot say more or less about it than that      
511,2.0,                       package says large  but it fits like a medium  way too small  seller also says free returns on the order page  but if you request a refund  they won t take it  due to covid  buyer beware      
512,5.0,                       for whatever reason most t shirts are made for people with really small bodies and they tend to shrink vertically as they are washed   these shirts are long enough to remain tucked in and it is hard to imagine them shrinking enough to cause un tucking issues   i threw my other shirts out and purchased more of these      
513,5.0,                       i love the fit and the soft feel of them  i will definitely be ordering more very soon  you can t go wrong with fruit of the loom products  thanks once again amazon      
514,5.0,                       these are great  i m a bigger guy        lbs  and used to buy xlt undershirts so they would stay tucked in  the problem with them was that the sleeve was always too long too these are great though  they stay tucked in all day and don t hang out of my over shirt the one drawback is that they aren t very soft so you definitely need some fabric softener for them      
515,5.0,                       for yourself or for a gift this is a no brainer   great material  and feel nice to the touch   remember  don t buy t shirts that are too baggy   you ll love these      
516,1.0,                           i received three black shirts and two gray shirts  but the picture shows three gray shirts and two black shirts   i bought this set because i wanted the gray shirts     i bought these shirts because the merchant says that they are light weight  but they are medium weight     shirts are not flexible especially at the stitching on the sleeves     shirts don t breath   they feel like i am wearing a sweater in the summer     these shirts are itchy like wool   i wore plenty of fruit of the loom clothes when i was a child and i never remember them being of such poor quality     shirts smell terrible  like they were worn by a homeless      
517,5.0,                       wish it was slightly longer but it s the best i ve found for tall but not  too  wide      
518,1.0,                       this is the third pack over the years i ordered   this one the material though it says      cotton is not as soft as prior shirts  seems like there is some polyester in there   shirts are much smaller than last mediums they actually fit like smalls   unless fruit of the loom went nuts  i think i got sold a pack of seconds or mistakes by amazon for full price   i ll be shopping at a different location for clothing than amazon going forward  i can not put to words how much different and bad this pack of shirts is from the prior two   plus  since      the price went up         
519,5.0,                       i bought these as a woman  to dye or decorate as sleep shirts for summer and love that they are so soft and the longer length is perfect for my purpose       
520,2.0,                       i ve gotten many a hanes and fruit of the loom undershirt on amazon before  these however are terrible  and i mean terrible  it s an undershirt and doesn t need a masters degree to perform these are oversized and very  very thin  the tag ends in     my last order ended in     it s not worth sending back     in undershirts so chock it up to my last fruit of the loom so compare these to toilet paper  these are the equivalent of the cheap single ply garbage you find at the airport  nobody has time for one ply  and no one should for these shirts either      
521,5.0,                       great product pitch as it s supposed to tapered soft and light not too heavy doesn t make you sweat definitely would recommend     
522,2.0,                       i don t like the excess length of these shirts but it was too much of a hassle to return them  not too good unless you tuck t shirts into your pants      
523,3.0,                       these are smaller than expected  i would definitely order a size larger than your normal shirt size  the material is just cotton  nothing exciting  the sleeves are also too short and too tight  i won t be buying again      
524,4.0,                       first off  i must admit i am totally surprised  we have not purchased  fruit of the loom  t shirts since the      s  back then they were very thin and never fit right after washing  today s version is much better  the material is much thicker and the shirts fit quite comfortably  ok  the trick to ordering is to order a size bigger than you actually want  after reading other reviews and many were complaining of the shrinkage  i ordered xx large since my husband wears x large  when the shirts arrived  i panicked  they were gigantic  but after washing them and then drying them in an electric dryer  the xx large did shrink all the way down to a perfect x large  my husband loves the fit and the feel of the shirts  warm and soft      
525,5.0,                       true to size for so if u like a little looser order next size     
526,1.0,                       cheaply made  very short sleeves  almost like it was made for kids  but in adult sizes  not the same fruit of loom from my experience years ago      
527,5.0,                       they hold their shape and don t shrink after repeated washings  the collars don t roll down when wearing  and they seems to be resistant to staining under the arms i wash them in hot water with tide and oxi clean also  the arms are shorter and a little more snug than other undershirts  so the the arms don t  wing away  from your upper arms      
528,5.0,                       i really like these  with one unexpected issue   when using the potty  sometimes i can t find my undies as they re under this longer shirt   embarrassing digging around down there at a public urinal when all you re trying to do is find where the shirt ends      
529,5.0,                       so far they are exactly the shirt fir everyday use  washer and dryer have not caused any color loss and or damage  even after    or so washes      
530,5.0,                    son las preferidas de mi suegro  no les da calor  tampoco frio  simplemente perfectas para el  muy buen acabado y comodas para dormir y estar en casa         
531,5.0,                       they are good shirts for work if you need ones you can buy in bulk that you may have to dispose of  i work in a kitchen so they see grease and all so if they would start to tear i can just toss them and switch to a newer one and order more if i need to      
532,1.0,                       a sandy  scratchy inferior cotton fiber   i m slim  yet shirt fits tight around torso and biceps after initial cold waterhand washing and air drying     this cotton is not even suitable for use as a cleaning cloth   extremely disappointing      
533,5.0,                       great quality as always  i prefer white tees for under shirts especially a bit larger ones for tucking during the colder season  these were perfect for that purpose thick and durable quality  in the spring or summer i will buy again but purchase mediums      
534,5.0,                       so i get it    they re just t shirts    but if you re like me as a kind of tall guy with maybe some extra weight and or a desire for slightly loose fitting clothing these are sized perfectly they re of decent weight   definitely more summer than winter  but nothing flimsy like xtemp or super thin style very pleased      
535,5.0,                       i have been wearing these undershirts for years  easier to find on amazon than at the store in a  xl      
536,5.0,                       my husband loved these  they don t shrink after washing them  very soft and breathable      
537,5.0,                       wow  i just love these light weight under shirts  they don t feel bulky  great length  stay down instead of crawl and you almost are unaware of them under the shirt  at    years old  i wish i knew about these year ago  just not a fan of regular or heavier under shirts because they kind of irritated me and i felt a certain freedom from not wearing them now  i feel just great in these under shirts  i would recommend them to anyone who kind of feels the same way i do about my old undershirts  which are now all discarded and replaced with these under shirts      
538,5.0,                       i am always afraid of ordering clothes online due to size variances  i hate to have to deal with shipping back to amazon  but i will sat that these t shirts were the actual size that i ordered and i am very happy with the quality as well as the price      
539,5.0,                       it isn t always easy to find tall sizes in undershirts and these are a nice thickness of fabric and fit well      
540,3.0,                       after the first wash dry  the length of the shirt shrunk to the point that i don t know if it will stay tucked consistently upon wearing it for a full day  and that was after only one wash dry cycle      
541,4.0,                       these were great  good shirts for a great value  i took one star off for the amount they shrunk  he was still able to tuck them in comfortably but they lost a couple of inches after washing them      
542,5.0,                       bought for bf  he loves them   he s slim but muscular and lean  shirts fit perfect and he loves to wear them      
543,4.0,                       i like the way the shirts fit especially the tight collar  but i would buy even more if they supplied them in other colors especially black   why cant you supply these shirts in black           
544,2.0,                       these t shirts remind me of dollar store clothes  they look fine on day one but not so much after one wash and dry  i wouldn t buy them again      
545,5.0,                       they are nice and long  not like some other brands that i have purchased in a  xl that fit like belly shirts   lol     
546,5.0,                       i ve been looking for white ones for a minute the price was too good i returned the ones i bought from dd s these were thicker and better quality for cheaper keep the price low      
547,4.0,                       decent undershirts   not as great as the quality of hanes or banana republic white tees that i have used  but can t beat the value and they don t shrink too much  wish they didn t wrinkle so much in the dryer  other than that  good shirts      
548,5.0,                       great value for a great price          came nicely packaged  just washed and they washed beautifully  perfect sized even after washing  ordered xl tall   will buy again for hubby who states   great fit   t shirt stays and does not ride up      
549,5.0,                       the brand says it all and you can feel the difference in weight when comparing to other brands  these will last longer and be less likely to rip or tear than cheaper brands      
550,3.0,                       i find the cotton to be very coarse and not very comfortable   there are other cheap t shirts that i think have a better blend   i do like the longer length      
551,5.0,                    mido      y peso     encargu  l pues muchas marcas han achicado sus talles y yo siempre estoy en los talles del medio  pero esta no  el l me qued  grande pero sobre todo demasiado largo  me quedan para regalar y encargu  un m  colores agradables  sin etiquetas interiores  muy c modas  buena tela de algod n         
552,1.0,                       fits as expected  if you wear one straight out of the bag  and throw it away after one use  i have had used this brand and model shirt in the past  but they were store bought     lasted forever  the shirts i ordered from amazon are terrible and cannot survive more than two washes  yes i know how to wash white shirts  yes i have a good washing machine   the shirts become loose at the collar and the waist  actually now that i think if it  they become loose all over     the fabric also feels coarse  surely this is a knock off product  it s garbage  do not buy      
553,4.0,                       my husband wears them under t shirts so he likes them a little tight  they did shrink a little bit when i wash them  you can t beat the price of these shirts  i would probably order them again knowing that they will probably only last a couple of months for how much my husband wears them  i can t tell a difference in the more expansive one and these      
554,2.0,                       this shirt is very long  i am      but this is more like a large undershirt then a small  it would be fine if you are wearing it as the only shirt  but for an undershirt  i would stick with the hanes  they are a tighter fit and shorter      
555,5.0,                       i used to order this shirt from amazon and i have no problem with it  perfect fit for me     i received it on time  thank you        
556,5.0,                       these shirts fit great for tall men  my husband is     and just over     lb  so he s tall and leaner  usually he has to get big and tall for length but then they re huge  i washed and shrunk these on high heat and they re the perfect fit and length  they go down past his hips but not overly long once shrunk      
557,5.0,                       bought the xl s and they were a little big  but i m assuming they will shrink when washed  overall  the quality of these shirts was amazing  most big department stores charge     for two or three of these types of shirts  and i was at a big department store when i saw that before going onto amazon and looking this up  i ordered this while still in said store  and don t regret it      
558,5.0,                       if you are looking at purchasing a classic mens       cotton  t shirt  this is it  it is not a slim fit  but fits as expected  and blends seamlessly under clothing  long enough to tuck in  and stays tucked in  this product is tag less i would recommend this product      
559,5.0,                       have ordered fruit of the loom products in the past and have always been pleased with the quality and price      
560,4.0,                       these undershirts are cut really big  from the other reviews  i was expecting them to be long  which is a good thing   so they stay tucked in  however  the collar is huge   i can almost pull it over my head in without the shirt touching my ears on the plus side  it makes me look like i ve lost weight      
561,4.0,                       the size was not that i was waiting but still good  the cool i think it was a little yellow grimy      
562,5.0,                       if you are a tall man and need some quality t s  then these are what you need   i am          lbs   these t shirts are a great fit and value      
563,1.0,                       we returned these  they re marked as containing a coating called intellifresh  if you do your research  you ll see that there have been problems with the chemicals in intellefresh  no thanks      
564,4.0,                       overall a great undershirt  the  stay tucked  aspect is defnitely true as i have not had any issues with the shirt coming untucked   i took one star off only because the shirt feels slightly thinner  or cheaper  than the other undershirts i am used to   i am      with a     waist and     chest and a size medium fits me perfectly i highly recommend to anyone looking for an affordable and quality undershirt that will stay tucked      
565,5.0,                       my boyfriend like the fit for undershirts for work  great price      
566,4.0,                       the shirts seem fine  but you won t get the exact colors pictured  they were still blues and grays  but if you re picky you might want to pass on these      
567,3.0,                       shirts looked nice out of the package and fit well  the odd thing is that after being washed with all whites they come out of the dryer looking very pink  once they cool down  they no longer look pink  if these are really      cotton they must be treated with something that reacts with the heat of the dryer      
568,5.0,                       these t shirts are perfect for suits  and being tucked in with dress shirts  our youngest son has special needs  and he kept his t shirt  and dress shirt  tucked in all through his sisters wedding    success    thank you                
569,4.0,                       i bought this for my husband  fix perfect just i expected  these are the same as the one i used to get in walmart      
570,5.0,                       worth every cent spent thank you for not costing to much perfect fit and length     
571,1.0,                       so i ordered the black and gray tshirt pack  i expected actual black  what i got instead is more of a very dark blue as you can see in the picture  the third shirt is mine and is true black  highly disappointed     
572,5.0,                       cant beat these shirts for the price   bought all the colors they have  wear them every day for work  i get the large im         lbs  they shrink a little but since there longer they still fit great      
573,5.0,                       i ordered these for my twelve year old who usually wears a boys        according to the sizing  a men s small should have fit him  the shirts mostly fit  however  they are too long for him at this time  he is        and   lbs and the shirt game lls about     inches from his knees  i thought maybe they would shrink up after washing  but they really didn t shrink at all  hopefully  he will grow into them at some point      
574,5.0,                       bought them for my dad who just wanted a few shirts to replace the ones he was slowly wearing out  the shirts fit as expected so no issue there  it s a good value for what you get      
575,1.0,                       i was really excited about ordering these shirts after much research  only to be sorely disappointed when they arrived in the mail my primary concern is their  dual defense  additives  specifically intellifresh  which refers to dupont s silvadur embedded nanosilver particles  this is not mentioned  anywhere  in amazon s product description or photos  so i thought it was worth posting a review for others to be aware  i have included photos of the packaging so you can see what i mean what s so bad about nanosilver  isn t odor fighting  moisture wicking technology a good thing  i used to think so  but now don t anymore  i encourage you to do your own research  but the latest info says it is best to avoid antimicrobials completely because they provide no net benefit to humans and many of them are suspected endocrine disruptors  nanosilver is relatively new and not well researched compared to traditional silver  but it can pass the blood brain barrier and if ingested could interfere with your healthy gut bacteria additionally  silver is extremely toxic to marine life  second only to mercury   and when these particles wash out of your clothes in the laundry  they will eventually end up either in the ocean rivers  or in wastewater treatment plant sludge  which is often land applied as fertilizer  this could do massive harm to ecosystems if you want to learn more  search online for the  six classes of chemicals  website and then go to the section on antimicrobials  the resources section at the bottom of the page has links to lots of useful info  including    silver nanotechnology and the environment  old problems or new challenges   pew project on emerging nanotechnologies report         some antibacterials come with worrisome silver lining   chicago tribune              germ resistant clothes  pick or pass   abc news           i have no affiliation with that website  a coworker shared it with me recently which triggered me to research more on my own i returned the undershirts to amazon immediately and did not open the package  so i can t speak to their fit or durability  i suspect they are great shirts except for the nanosilver additive  which makes this all the more disappointing fruit of the loom  if you re reading this  please offer these exact same shirts but in plain old cotton  no additives   i would happily pay for that      
576,5.0,                       very comfortable and stays put  i wore one of these under a dress shirt for a job interview and i felt very comfortable and put together  i got the job  thanks fruit of the loom      
577,5.0,                       i bought these because i wear a suit every day and like having an undershirt underneath my button up  i m a tall guy        and most undershirts are not long enough to get tucked into my slacks so they come out and then get bunched up in my button up shirt  these shirts are more than long enough for me and tuck into my slacks as well      
578,4.0,                       these are used as undershirt and are very comfortable  they are long enough to stay tucked in nicely  i don t have large arms  but he sleeves are a bit short and tight on me  i pulled at the sleeve cuff a bit  which broke a few stitches  and now they fit better      
579,5.0,                       fits perfectly   material is nice and soft   have to wait until washed for further opinion length is more than sufficient   neck is well made      
580,5.0,                       these t shirts are fantastic  high quality  terrific fit  the best   comfortable  the best t shirts out there  while others have reduced the thickness of the cloth or trimmed things like the torso length and sleeve length to save cost while not reducing the price  fruit of the loom has not done that with these  i strayed away from the brand and am back as a lifer  thank you fruit of the loom      
581,5.0,                       i can t believe i waited so long to search for something like these extra long undershirts  these are a life changer for taller people like me  whose undershirts are always coming untucked  underneath  button down dress shirts  causing that stupid spare tire lump  i didn t experience the crazy shrinking that others mentioned from laundering   mine shrank a tiny bit in length  probably less than an inch  totally normal and acceptable      
582,2.0,                       sono liked these shirts  they had a ell but they fit great  then i washed them and they shrank  now they are too small to stay tucked and too long to not tuck in  i would if bought other fotl products instead of this  now i can t return and i have weird shirts     
583,5.0,                       still to be washed  but hope no shrinkage occurs do to fitting good out of package  may go up to a large if this happens      
584,5.0,                       super comfortable   the collars don t crinkle your when you wear them  i would def buy this again     
585,4.0,                       this is a very good light weight t shirt and a great substitute for the very heavy kirkland brand sold at costco   i d been buying those for years but they became just too warm in summer so i tried these and am very satisfied   these don t hold their shape as well as the kirkland s so i m not sure they would look good if worn alone but as an undershirt they work really well      
586,5.0,                       great if you are using them to make shirts out of  good fit  great quality      
587,1.0,                       i don t know what  why or how  but these brand new straight out of the package turned pink when washed   i washed them with my socks  gray  and boxers  blue  gray and black    the load i washed before was four pair of wrangler blue jeans   i am not blaming fruit of the loom  but as i can t wear pink tee shirts  i won t be buying any more      
588,5.0,                       i love that they re longer than a regular tshirt  they stay tucked so much better  comfortable and good looking  the collar lies flat  haven t washed them yet  so i m not sure if they ll shrink  i hope not  they re perfect the way they are      
589,5.0,                       these fit great  they re a bit too long for me to wear untucked but the whole point of these shirts is to be longer in the body so that they don t come out from basic movement while having a shirt tucked in  they re very comfortable and a great price  i looked at these same shirts in kohl s and they were almost double the price for the same   shirts      
590,1.0,                       i m an xl in every other t shirt brand but with these  i wanted a little looser fit for just bumming around the house so i ordered xxl  the xxl fit like a medium  it was crazy  fit is nowhere near as described and the size chart is laughably incorrect      
591,5.0,                       have purchased fruit of the loom products over the years and they do what they do best in my case   fit good  feel comfortable  and last about as long as one can expect  not too long depending on how often you wear them and the neck band is will of course over time not be as elastic as when you opened up the bag  but then again they re a reasonable price so that s when i purchase new ones  they re disposable and usually i ll get   to   months before the neck starts to slack  but that is more than enough for the price  overall a useful tool as an undershirt      
592,5.0,                       i purchased these shirts for my wife to wear to rehab after her hip replacement  they was very comfortable to her  easy care  little bit big for her but that s what she likes  they were a great buy  made out of a good quality material  shipping was on time  for a good fitting t shirt i recommend these      
593,2.0,                       i bought these shirts because i have the exact same ones that i bought previously   i put one on and it was tight   i measured it against the original ones and the width was as a full inch less which means the circumference was a full   inches less  they were both marked the same size xl  same material      cotton and both made in the same country  very disappointed in fruit of the loom      
594,5.0,                       i bought these in size medium for my husband  he s      and weighs about      he s naturally slender and doesn t really work out  his height is mostly in his torso so undershirt length is important the shirts fit him well  when we washed the shirts they shrunk which we expected  the shirts still fit him fine because they have some stretch to them  they feel soft in my hand and i haven t heard my husband complain about being uncomfortable with the undershirt overall these are good budget undershirts  keep in mind that they shrink about a quarter to a half size in the wash so you may want to consider sizing up      
595,4.0,                       it s good honestly  buuuuuut i was expecting colored shirts  i expected a green  blue and purple w the purchase of my t shorts  i came in w doubles of black  navy and grey  the fit great w me     
596,5.0,                       for   well forever   have used hanes shirts   haven t been very happy with the last two reorders of those  so went with these this time fit is great  i love the extra length to help keep them tucked in  and so far it works   would love a tiny bit more length in the sleeve  but that s not a deal breaker i feel like these are thinner than the hanes that i ve been used to  which wears fine   and better on warm days   but i am thinking that this will negatively impact their lifespan fit s great  they do stay tucked in      
597,5.0,                       it s a day for me every couple years when i turn all of my old white tees into rags these particular white tees are an improvement over my last batch  they are quite noticeably longer  allowing them to stay tucked better  they fit just as expected as well a great product      
598,5.0,                       my husband wears these as undershirts to protect his dress shirts from deodorant  stains discoloring  these undershirts fit him perfect  he is         slender build     lbs   and is very picky about not wearing baggy undershirts  these are the perfect fit at a great price      
599,4.0,                       always a good brand name  doesn t stretch as much last longer  recieved my package very quickly i highly recommend     
600,5.0,                       the shirts are very comfortable and no bacon collars so far       better than hanes shirts that have gone down the drain in terms of quality  would definitely purchase again      
601,5.0,                       like the added length of the tall size   these shirts stay tucked in no matter what   the sleeve length is also extended and shows from under some shorter length short sleeve shirts      
602,5.0,                       the tee shirts arrived on time  in good condition  they fit well and are comfortable  the weave is light  the tee shirts are suitable for summer but would not keep a person warm in winter  they are opaque white and cannot be seen through each plastic package contained   folded tee shirts  the tee shirts are creased when they come out of the package  removing the creases would require either washing or ironing the tee shirts      
603,5.0,                       i have yet to wash them so this review may change  but i am     athletic build and i bought mediums and these are by far the best white undershirts i own  they fit my length and comfortable loose  sleeves fit well and don t look awkward and they were relatively inexpensive  depending on how they shrink i will for sure be buying these again  i wear them everyday and they look great  little thinner material but not thin enough to see my nipples under my shirt  highly important  as i work out in these after work and rather not look silly   great product     
604,5.0,                       hubby is     and most white undershirts seemed to shrink in length  but not these     he loves that its breathable cotton and the extra length def stays tucked in all day at work   ordered an xl for his   in waist and fits perfect      
605,5.0,                       this shirt is thin but we continue to buy them perfect for the price since you get the perfect length when they dry they do not shrink up like most shirts the only downside would be that it s really thin but i wear a shirt underneath mine we d continue to order them over and over and over again because i spell a lot of stuff on my shirt and my wife just orders more we ordered some today stephen the only shirt that we ve found that stays the link that it is without shrinking     
606,5.0,                       i am        but i have a long torso and shorter legs  regular large tshirts after being washed will not stay tucked in  these shirts are great  the length is perfect for under dress shirts and does not look bad alone and untucked either  surprisingly good quality for the price  roughly       usd each      
607,5.0,                       very soft and they truly stay tucked  purchased for my husband and he loves      
608,5.0,                    son frescas suaves y los colores son vibrantes las puedes lavar tranquila que no manchan otra ropa  a mi esposo le gustan las compramos de forma regular  muy buena marca recomendada        
609,1.0,                       i ordered these t shirts for my husband who wears them for work  most nights  he works    hours and needs shirts that will stay tucked in  upon opening the package  i thought  oh good  nice long tails   once they were washed and dryed  they had shrunk at least six inches  maybe more  these shirts won t even fit my    year old grandson  most reviews were glowing  so i gave them a try  i have to wonder if they were paid for their reviews  i wish i had not made this purchase  they were a waste of time and money  fruit of the loom will be added to my do not buy list      
610,5.0,                       i needed  x size t shirts   this multipack had different colors and arrived as expected      
611,5.0,                       i got these for my husband to wear under his work clothes   they are soft and comfortable   they were a little tight across his chest and shoulders  but he does work out regularly and may just be a little wider due to that   for undershirts  they work perfectly     
612,5.0,                       i thought the medium sized tees would fit snug  almost tight   they did however  i have a long body and long monkey arms  so the bottom of the tees came up just above my belt i normally wear large shirts  but i got medium sized  because they re under shirts and i wanted them to fit sort of tight again they are tight like i wanted  however the length of the tees   sleeves were too short great product  by the way i was just confused with what size to get exactly  as i haven t bought undershirts in years      
613,5.0,                       bought size medium for my husband  perfect size and value for the price      
614,1.0,                       all of the   t shirts that i bought have a black magic marker slash across the brand logo and   of the shirts have little round green stickers  located on the fabric   i have worked for a clothing retailer and when we got factory seconds they were always marked in a similar fashion   no where in the description does it indicate that these are seconds or flawed   what is the story here      
615,1.0,                       i was looking for new t shirts  and i like the fruit of the loom  eversoft  fabric  as the name implies  they re soft and comfortable so  i did a search on amazon using only the word  eversoft   without specifying  fruit of the loom  or  t shirt   these shirts are the first hit  and are shown as the number one seller  i selected large  and looked at the included photos  two of which show the packaging  and sure enough  the photos mention  eversoft  i ordered two packages  and  my luck being what it is   the packaging i received is different  and doesn t mention eversoft thankfully  amazon has free returns on these shirts if unopened  so  back they went within    minutes  fastest return i ve ever done on amazon i ve bought the same shirts as these locally  and for me  the new fabric is a waste of money  it s thin  and every time they are washed the sleeves roll up like there s a pack of lucky strikes in  em  same with the bottom seams i hope this saves someone some time      
616,5.0,                       these shirts came in eco friendly packaging  thin bag with no marketing on bag  no tape holding shirts in the bundle  and no cardboard insert  i bought v necks at the same time  the v necks came with the more sturdy  less eco friendly  retail ready packaging  heavier bag  shirts taped in bundle  and cardboard insert created a lot more hassle and waste      
617,5.0,                       great long shirts but i would buy the next size up next time  it is a bit tight around the armpit for me      
618,5.0,                       perfect fit  price and delivery speed   great product      
619,5.0,                       great fit and length  i don t have to worry about it coming untucked      
620,5.0,                       great quality and weight tee shirt  did shrink a bit but remained long enough for tucking      times better than the last hanes tees i bought which were thin and would not remain tucked      
621,2.0,                       i bought these t shirts which the costco brand was out of stock   i was disappointed in how thin these shirts are   the sleeves ride up and they don t keep their shape very well   not worth the money      
622,4.0,                    son camisetas un poco largas y un poco peque as  compre talla m y no es como otras camisetas  es m s peque a  queda m s ajustado que una camiseta talla m  las medidas parec an bien pero a la hora de llegada son algo m s ajustadas de los que esperaba        
623,3.0,                       these shrink to the original size of the normal hanes shirts before they shrink in the wash   i was hoping for longer   before shrinking they were great      
624,1.0,                    las franelas son delgadas para el verano caliente pero la confecci n es muy mala las medidas de los de una manga diferente a la otra parece que tengo un brazo m s largo que el otro        
625,5.0,                       my husband needed plain white t s for work   these were perfect  they fit him great  the size was perfect   the price is excellent  would buy again     
626,5.0,                       my husband loved these all his white work shirt tshirts   always shrink up after several washes  no matter what they shrink and ruin  we ordered these and they didn t shrink too much  which was perfect so he feels like it covers his belly perfectly  we will definatly be only ordering these tshirts from now on  i wish they made these in long sleeve  that would be my only dislike request  for his winter time shirts thank you so much for these shirts      
627,3.0,                       overall i m happy with the tshirts but they are not black  i went back to look at my order to make sure i didn t order navy blue lol and yup it clearly says black  but they definitely look navy blue  you can see on my pics  i m wearing black sweats and the tshirts are right next to them and they look navy blue      
628,5.0,                       one of the only tee shirt brands that fits length wise but is not a  tent    fits good in shoulders  chest and waist      
629,5.0,                       husband loves them  they are the right length and right weight  not too thin or thick  we ve tried them all  and this one works      
630,5.0,                       i was expecting this shirt to fit and to feel like every other undershirt i ve ever purchased  however  it feels better and fits better      
631,4.0,                       overall i am extremely pleased with my purchase of these undershirts  trying them on they are noticeably longer in length than your normal white undershirt which is exactly what i was looking for  my only concern going forward is the felt a bit thinner than some other undershirts i have previously had and waiting to see how they hold up against discoloration  i am very pleased with this purchase      
632,5.0,                       knowing these were cotton i opted to go up one size from normal  good decision  it is so nice to have a shirt stay tucked in the entire day without adjustment  fruit of the loom has been my normal choice  i hope these last the several years the last set did  time will tell      
633,3.0,                       too small  bought these for my boyfriend who is about     and like    lbs but has pretty big arms  bought the large and they re really short and right around his biceps  wish i would have returned these before we washed them      
634,3.0,                       i love everything about these shirts with one exception  the neck of the shirt wearing it for the first time is of poor quality  wearing a sweatshirt over this t shirt  you would never think a t shirt was underneath  it is time for these companies to incorporate exceptional quality  disappointed      
635,5.0,                       the extra length does help the shirt stay tucked in   so far two washes and no color fade      
636,5.0,                       absolutely love these shirts   i have been looking for a shirt my entire life that fits like this  absolutely perfect fit after   run through the drier  these shirts are perfect  they are just a little bit longer than a standard shirt so they don t show your back when you bend over   well done fruit of the loom  i have    of them and i want more      
637,5.0,                       these were purchased during a sale and the quality of the product is adequate  the shirts are not perfect  but for the price  they ll be just fine      
638,5.0,                       not the first time i am buying these t shirts for my husband  they look great and serve it s purpose  my husband also likes them  good quality for money you pay        
639,2.0,                       these new ones are smaller and shorter and also not as soft as my previous order  very disappointing and pointless purchase      
640,5.0,                       bought these for my husband because he s tall and often wears polo shirts for work  i read on another review that the sleeves wouldn t poke out while wearing a polo shirt  and that was correct  i m glad i took a chance ordering these  he loves them and already wants more  they re soft  tagless  and a great value      
641,5.0,                       very nice shirts  reasonably priced  they fit nice and are very comfortable   wash well  would purchase again      
642,1.0,                       i honestly had a feeling this was obviously not going to be like the polos from ralph lauren i get my boyfriend  but this was a bit below what i expected honestly  it s not soft and it s kind of rough and cheap  not worth the money on less you work with them and dirty and brake them easily then i would consider it      
643,5.0,                       ok i know these are just tshirts   not really though   these are a longer than a standard tshirt and will stay tucked in   no more bunched up tshirt inside your shirt   they are soft and medium weight material   replace your old worn and yellow tshirts with these  you ll be glad you did      
644,5.0,                       the quality of the material is soft and stretchy  the length was a little long but will probably be ok after washing great price and nice bright clean white color      
645,5.0,                       it is a lot of shirts that fit good  i go through shirt a lot exercising so it is good it comes in a large pack      
646,5.0,                       fits as expected   i don t recommend drying them they may shrink  i suggest washing them in mild detergent  the price is good compared to competitors      
647,2.0,                       these are the cheapest of the cheap t shirts  they are made in el salvador which is known as one of the few countries that actually manufactures clothing cheaper than china  these are       retail quality shirts  thought i was getting a bargain   less than what i paid for  honestly  not too all uncommon a thing nowadays  in the future i will stick with jockey   they are way more expensive  but as of my last order  a much higher quality regards      
648,5.0,                       finally  i have found a t shirt that stays tucked all day  sure this is from the tall line   but they fit  i was tired of buying larger shirts to stay tucked in   having them bunch up around the chest or midsection  these fit great  i wish companies would just add an inch or two to the length of their undershirts   those should be designed for that purpose  when i need replacements   i will get these again      
649,5.0,                       excellent tee  he loves them  they are for personal use tot to print on yet i would have used these for the buss  soft warm and comfortable      
650,4.0,                       nice shirts  a little tight for an xl though i m sure they will stretch out a little      
651,5.0,                       this t shirt is perfect for my needs   fits great   not too tight  not too loose  long tail stays put   it is lightweight and very comfortable   i use it to sleep in and for under dress shirts and it is perfect for that purpose   can t speak to long term wear as i have only had it a short time   i wanted a t shirt that wasn t too heavy or tight and this works great   price was good  arrived quickly and was as described      
652,5.0,                       the shirts fit as well as i expected  they were basic shirts just as you d want      
653,5.0,                       i switched from hanes undershirts to these fruit of the loom s because i felt the hanes was too thin and cheap feeling  these feel a lot thicker and better quality  glad i made the switch  they re long for some reason  but that s fine with me  very soft      
654,5.0,                       i bought these tshirts for my son and they fit just right  my son loved these tshirts because they are comfortable and they fit just right      
655,4.0,                       there ok shirts kinda thin and i ordered a lard because at walmart i buy large shirts from the men s section to have over sized shirts and these are just to big maybe size down     
656,1.0,                       these are not the same  i have purchased these in the past elsewhere and they are way stretchier and fit a lot better     
657,4.0,                       the information about this product is lacking both on the packaging and in the amazon description   the shirt is      cotton and tagless   i was unsure what stay tucked meant   it means the shirt is extra long   i bought a small for my tween son and it is skinny and    inches long from top of collar to bottom hem  it may work for people with long torsos but definitely a tuck in tee for anyone else      
658,5.0,                       really like the quality of these shirts  haven t even worn them yet  just put in the washer to clean up any left overs in manufacturing spent more than i usually do  never really invested in a quality t shirt  so down range i sure up they hold up to their rep      
659,4.0,                       i had originally gotten a   pack of grey and black in size medium  first of all  for reference  i m tall and skinny but have pretty wide shoulders  the length is perfect for me   it s long enough to actually stay tucked in and the length didn t drastically shrink in the wash unlike most other undershirts i ve worn  the width is narrow tight which is great for me around the waist and chest since most other undershirts are a bit to wide  but the shoulders were uncomfortably tight  even as someone who is used to dealing with shirts with narrower shoulders  it was surprisingly too tight and uncomfortable  so i ordered the same pack again but with a size large this time  now they are much more roomy and comfortable around the shoulders  although maybe a little too baggy wide  and of course the length is hilariously long since the mediums were already long enough  but since i always tuck them anyway in i don t mind  i m still glad i switched to the large and will probably keep wearing them since it s hard for me to find grey undershirts that are long enough to stay tucked in  so i would recommend ordering a size up if you can t stand really tight shoulders another thing to note is that all the shirts smelled pretty bad at first  again  i got the grey and black ones so i m not sure if the other colors smell too   i m guessing it s from formaldehyde or something  i didn t always notice the smell right away for some reason  but it s definitely noticeable after the shirts are sitting there a while or you sniff closely  and none of my other clothes smell like that so i know it s not coming from anything else  however  after washing them several times in a row and adding a cup of white vinegar in the washer with them  the smell has pretty much gone away  so in the long run i don t think it s a big deal  just be aware that you may have to wash them multiple times for the smell to fade away one more issue is that the number of each color pictured in the pack is not necessarily what you will get  the black grey   pack i ordered had   grey and   black shirts for my first order of size medium  which is what was shown in the picture and is what i wanted  however  when i ordered the same pack but with a size large  i got   grey and   black instead  it s not a huge deal to me and not worth returning given the cheap price  but i was slightly disappointed because i mainly just want the grey shirts  so keep in mind that the picture might not match exactly what you will get      
660,5.0,                       breathable and great for work  my husband is a machinist and he loved the colors and how soft and sweat proof they are    lol  great value and quality for quantity      
661,5.0,                       i really like these t shirts   they are long enough to stay tucked in and really comfortable      
662,5.0,                       i bought these undershirts for me  female    they are like a uniform for me   feel comfortable and if i don t dribble or spill my coffee on them   look great for a long time  happy with my purchase  i bought size medium for my small frame   not petite  just small      
663,4.0,                       shirts are great for what i wanted  thin and shrunk quite a bit after first wash  did not go in dryer  but i had these in the past and knew they would shrink so i bought the size with that in mind   i wear these primarily as undershirts and like how thin and light they are   so  for that reason  i think these are perfect and the price can t be beat      
664,4.0,                       just ok quality but good price  will not purchase again     
665,2.0,                       just received these  and did an initial wash right out of packaging  already they fit too tightly  very concerned how they will be a few months and washing cycles from now  if i had known  i would have ordered xl instead of l      
666,5.0,                       these are hard to find  got a six pack price for a lot less than i would pay for   at a big and tall store  fit great and are very comfortable      
667,5.0,                       these shirts are great for a guy who is      tall   they always stay tucked in and did not shrink when washed   i was not sure these shirts would be long enough  but they are perfect      
668,5.0,                       i m female and purchased these for sleeping shirts and i love them  they re super comfortable for bed      
669,4.0,                       best undershirts i ve found in awhile  they do shrink a bit after multiple washings  but that s expected even for pre shrunk cotten  very comfortable  durable  don t know whether they  stay tucked   as i wear suspenders and keep my pant waist looser than most      
670,5.0,                       it took some time to get them but the wait was worth it in the end   now i don t have to worry i all ways have some hanging      
671,5.0,                       glad i got these    the leangth will help them not shrink up above my belt after they ve been washed several times  which has always been the problem with t shirts for me      
672,1.0,                       i bought these the first time about one year ago and really liked them so this purchase was a reorder   they must have changed the material or manufacturer because these shrunk up so much that they are flooders about   inches from the ground and ride up in the back   the old pair was washed and dried in the same load and they still fit great   disappointed      
673,5.0,                       great product  needed these t shirts for my working attire      
674,5.0,                       rather big  but after washing expecting a good fit  hubby has added a few pounds   the regular tshirts weren t staying tucked in after washing  now no more belly peeking out  he seems to like   says that they are comfortable  i m pleased so far      
675,4.0,                       it s a fruit of the loom shirt  nothing more  nothing less  i do prefer them over hanes  they seem to always stay tucked better and the collars stay flat longer it s thin  as always  but it does the job and lasts for well over a year  rotating between about a dozen shirts worn daily    keep them coming      
676,2.0,                       these shirts work great the first time you wear them   the problem is after the first wash  these things wrinkle like nothing i ve ever owned  and the hems all fold over themselves  you essentially have to iron them to get them to fit right  which to me defeats the purpose of an undershirt      
677,4.0,                       nice t shirts  they are longer and tighter around the waist  i think they run a little small   or i run a little large  but i would recommend a size larger than your normal t shirt  unless you like it snug      
678,4.0,                       i got these shirts on sale for about       so    each   for the price  the value is great   if they were regular price  i wouldn t be so complimentary   the material is more rough than soft and smooth   they do shrink  as another reviewer said  but not enough to make them unwearable   so for the money  they re great   as a fine t shirt  no      
679,5.0,                       these are perfect  i just started at the gym and these are perfect for working out  i should have ordered xxl as i m     but i got xl and as long as i stretch them out some they fit fine   so comfy and just great tshirts      
680,5.0,                       i like the fit of the shirt very much  they are very comfortable and should wear well      
681,4.0,                       i always try to find the best deal for white undershirts when i need them  i haven t had fruit of the loom in years  i ve been using gildan most recently  these shirts are a bit longer and will stay tucked much easier  however  they are quite a bit tighter around the shoulder   armpit area almost to the point of being uncomfortable  i m only           lbs so i wouldn t expect a size medium to fit so tight in the arms   shoulder area  they seem to be slightly thinner than other shirts i ve used in the past  but  for the sale price i paid  i can t really complain too much      
682,1.0,                       these fit great and definitely stay tucked in  until you wash them   i followed the wash instructions and they shrank a lot   to the point where they will not stay tucked in at all now   would not buy again      
683,3.0,                       no much arm and chest room  ordered for my teenage son who wears a medium  maybe a large would of been better      
684,2.0,                       i washed these t s immediately upon being delivered and they shrunk as i expected   but     they were xl s but after washing would say the fit was more like a large  so   pack became useless i literally have them away      
685,3.0,                       so they are a bargain but alas you get what you pay for   the t shirt is tight fitting when new   the t shirt is very thin so it s definitely an undershirt   the worst part is the shirt shrinks after washing in warm water even more   i wouldn t buy them again      
686,4.0,                       these are long as described  good quality for the money      
687,5.0,                       i am not slim  and not too rotund    i really do not like buying t shirt packs because they are always so   square sure you can wear them around the house  but if you ever go out  they make you look like a cube these are the first pack  of reasonably priced  shirts that do not make you look like spongebob squarepantsthey are comfortable as well      
688,5.0,                       excellently made  good cotton material and perfect fit for a man with a small belly  it s perfectly price  i would buy again   very satisfied     
689,5.0,                       these were ordered for the material to make face mask for family members who work in hospitals   not the super duper protection of medical face mask  but definitely better that nothing   able to make   mask per shirt      
690,5.0,                       really impressed  i am not exceptionally tall      but was constantly having to re tuck t shirts because they were too short  these shirts have plenty of length and fit great  the price is a real bargain and i couldn t be happier  and they are also a cure for  plumbers crack       
691,3.0,                       i have used hanes large and they are a little smaller and a better fit for me   i really like the stay tucked length  they are longer than normal undershirts  the material is rougher than hanes   it isn t terrible just not as soft and slightly thinner   i likely won t order these again      
692,1.0,                       i am very disappointed with these shirts  the neck opening is huge  very very stretched out  they may as well be v neck shirts  they are also very long  great for staying tucked in  but forget about wearing them as a normal t shirt  people will think you re wearing a dress  the sleeves are also short and tight  and i have skinny arms  hanes shirts fit much better and have a normal sized neck  i will not ever buy these again      
693,2.0,                       some product review said these were soft t shirts  i have found lots of others that are much softer  i would say they are a bit stiff  also with a     chest i ordered xl  but it still felt too snug on the fit  if you are looking for a soft undershirt this may not be the right one for you and the fit is a bit small      
694,5.0,                       hey folks to get started    shirts for the price paid is pretty dang good  i just got done washing and drying them and it fits excellent  i am           cm  and    lb     kg   i normally wear a size  xl but considering the brand and cotton shirts i had bought a  xl  after a wash in  cool  water  and a dry cycle on  low  the shirt came out perfect  nice  clean  and looks great  it isn t too tight  or too short  the stay tucked feature really held up to its name       recommend this product      
695,2.0,                       these shirts are definitely undershirts  their level of thickeness made us laugh  these are about as see through as you can get  soft yes  see through  holy crap       
696,5.0,                       needed longer undershirts to tuck in for concealed carry and these were perfect  they don t ride up even with a firearm on my hip shirts are also very soft and comfortable  maybe the best undershirts i ve ever worn      
697,3.0,                       i gave them only   stars because their medium is so tight on my husband  and they seem a bit too thin as well  not the quality i was looking  for  all his other tee s are mediums and they fit fine  so we gave these to a friend that has boys  and went out a purchased large for my husband      
698,5.0,                       finally  a shirt that stays tucked and doesn t cost an arm and a leg  i bought two packs and love them  i no long have to worry about my undershirt coming untucked and bunching up under my work shirt      
699,5.0,                       i like these t shirts very much  they fit well and they are fresh  i used then to do work in my farm     
700,1.0,                       i bought this specifically to go with my work polos  expecting   gray shirts and   black like in the picture  nope  got   black and   gray  now i have to buy a whole nother pack to get the gray shirt i need  when just one would have been sufficient if it had actually been the displayed color combination      
701,5.0,                       good tshirts for the money      polyester makes all the difference      
702,5.0,                       my husband always complains that shirts are not looking enough   he finally stopped complaining   these are great and have very little to no shrinkage   great undershirt   or everyday shirt      
703,5.0,                       very comfortable and i really like the extra length  it s just enough to keep your shirt tucked in but not too long  my old shirts would always come untucked and bunch up inside my other shirt      
704,1.0,                       these shrink immediately after the first wash dry  i ordered larges and they fit perfect when i first got them  i tossed them in the dryer on the lowest heat cycle my dryer offers  brand new dryer  they shrunk to smalls  they aren t long enough to stay tucked in and the arms are almost like a shoulder cover now  if you do get these order     sizes larger if you want to toss them in the dryer after a wash they came in a pile like they were from a bulk order or something  none of them had tags or were folded just a stack of tshirts      
705,5.0,                       we ve been getting hanes for the last ten years and the quality just has been the same i remember looking at this brand in the store but my husband likes to stick to his ways so i bought his normal hanes brand he s been getting frustrated lately on the fit and shape  so he approved the trail run lolnow he is one happy camper      
706,2.0,                       my gripes are covered by the headline   i had purchased these to use as undershirts  i do not like undershirts with a high neckline   it wasn t clear from the product photographs or description that this would be the case   so maybe mea culpa on  that   however after the first wash there is a pronounced shrinkage   while it was welcome on the length i did not like the way sleeves shrank      
707,5.0,                       exactly what i expected and wanted  these t shirt s were bought for my husband who asked for thin  soft t shirt s that do not shrink up to his belly button  good price too      
708,4.0,                       i have some fotl  xlt shirts and they fit perfect so im not sure why these feel tight  the length is spot on but if these shrink i wont be able to wear them other than that they look great just wish i could find em in a color other than white    i ll either send em back or give them to my dad      
709,4.0,                       finally  shirts that stay tucked   i would have given these five stars had they not shrunk a bit      
710,1.0,                       i bought them in january and my husband just got around to taking them out of the package   they are cheaply made i washed them and they all curled up by the arms and bottom of the shirt fabric wrinkled and looks awful   i am going to use them as rags because it is too late to return them   don t buy this product   i use to think fruit of the loom was quality but not anymore     
711,3.0,                       soft and comfy but very thin material   this is strictly an undershirt      
712,5.0,                       my hubby love s the size  length and comfort  and they are true to size especially for husky men     i loved how these shirts fit on him i bought the color pack of   and of course the shirts fit perfect        will be buying more         
713,5.0,                       i went with the big man size  extra puffy   true to size and cozy as usual             lbs    xl       
714,4.0,                       i have never had a tapered t shirt  they fit fine for me but if you have a big belly probably not for you  at least in a large      
715,5.0,                       i love these t shirts  they still real cotton and now with the stay tucked length they are even better  the only thing that is different since i last bought them is that they are super snug  i mean  hug to your body snug  i haven t changed in weight at all  i bought the extra large   i have a    inch chest and    inch waist and there is no wiggle room  i would still probably buy the same size again though      
716,5.0,                       finally  a shirt long enough for me   i m      and have always had problems buying white t shirts because they shrink and come to about my waist line   these are long enough to tuck in  even after several washes      
717,2.0,                       i don t know who they used to take the measures from  but definitely wasn t small  this  small  is gigantic  abominatingly large and long to the thighs  i am short yes  but even at      these shirts compared to my other shirts are just way too long  i gave them away to my brother in law who is      and they fit him perfect  thanks for reminding me of my height amazon  but i really don t care      
718,1.0,                       these shirts were a huge disappointment for my husband  the sleeves are super short and ride up into the armpit  the shirt itself was sized too small  he always wears a medium and a medium men s on me fits like a large women s  this fit me super tight and him it looked like he d been stuffed into it  the length was also overkill  this shirt doesn t make sense      
719,5.0,                       i love how the medium tall fits  but my only downside is i should ve gotten a size up  i m all about perfect fit  but as soon as i throw it in the dryer it s a wrap  also because i love oversized shirts for the comfort   overall  i like it      
720,2.0,                       you get what you pay for  these are very cheap and low quality  the  hems  on the sleeves and at the bottom wad up and won t lay flat after first wash i would not recommend or buy these again      
721,3.0,                       fruit of the loom has good products    in general   these shirts     delivered by date advised via amazon   but the shirt lacks quality   purchased  gildan s at similar price and better quality and look   but again fruit of the loom does make good product  this wasn t one of them   will not repurchase      
722,5.0,                       i just want a comfortable white t shirt to wear under a button down dress or casual shirt   the choices always were between a designer t shirt that i couldn t afford but fit well  and an affordable t shirt that pulled out of my pants and rode up my back every time i bent over   fruit of the loom has rescued me   these t shirts are affordable  check   white  check   comfortable  check   and long  double check    basically they go down to the crotch of my pants   my life is now complete      
723,4.0,                       i got these at a killer price for     and for that reason alone  there isn t a lot to complain about  are they the softest t shirts i ve ever owned  no  are they terribly rough  not at all   they are a little tighter than i d like in the sleeves  but since it s worn under another shirt  it doesn t bother me at all   when i opened the package and compared them to my older ones  these were huge  but they shrank quite a bit in the wash  overall  i m pleased with them and i d buy them again  as long as the price is right      
724,4.0,                       being a big guy makes it difficult buying clothes that fit great  these shirt exceeded my expectations in comfort and feel  the size chart was a big help in choosing the right size      
725,3.0,                       i m       and these fit fine before being washed  they shrunk a ton   will now be garage rags  size up at least one      
726,1.0,                       don t write many bad reviews  but i thought i had to this time   i have bought jockey brand underwear for many years  but i decided i would try haines for a change   what a mistake   the x large is at least one size smaller than everyone else s x large   secondly  the shirt material is very thin   looks and feels cheap   finally  instead of a label on the inside neck  they have printed their name in huge print in red on the inside of the back so you can see it showing through when you hold it up to the light   i will try to return      
727,5.0,                       i went a different route the last time i bought white tshirts and was sorely disappointed with the quality and length   these shirts are long enough to go over your waistline  but not long enough to be overly problematic  and not short enough to always come untucked under your polo or dress shirt shirts are comfortable  not itchy  and perfect for the price   i do tend to sweat a lot in my armpits  so after a while  the shirts will become discolored  but a   pack of these every     months at this price is just fine by me      
728,1.0,                       shrunk the first time washed and dried  unwearable now  wide and short  i got the xxl  im     and now shirts come up to my hips now      
729,5.0,                       easy to buy and came on time  new underwear is great      
730,1.0,                       the two gray shirts are some of the worst i ve ever seen  the arms are from a sh medium  the chest is a large  and below the waist is an xl  the necks came pre stretched for that nice  clean look  the black shirts are slightly better  i d find something else
