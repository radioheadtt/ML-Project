0,2.0 ,                       i replaced all my home smoke alarm batteries like always this new year and have had   die since  so   out of   have failed in a     month period so in conclusion these are turning out to be pretty bad batteries  about on part with the ultra cheap batteries from the dollar store or harbor frieght      
1,2.0 ,                        v batteries are larger than most  so may not fit in some devices   batteries are individually shrink wrapped  causing extra headache to open each package   batteries come with no guarantee against leakage causing damage to whatever they re installed in  unlike the guarantee provided by the duracell  etc       
2,1.0 ,                       i have a carvin electric bass guitar that has  like thousands of other instruments  an electronics module powered by two  v batteries  when my latest set of duracells began to fade  i popped in a couple of these and expected to be back in business  wrong  i got no sound at all  i did the  tongue test  to verify that the batteries were alive  yow    and double checked i d installed them properly  zilch  in desperation i put the old duracells back in  and they worked just fine i m an electronics engineer and this was a problem i had to find  on close examination  here s the only possibility i can come up with  the metal   and   terminals of the duracell battery project slightly farther from the battery s case than the amazon s do  apparently this allows them to reach the two contacts inside the bass  also  the amazon battery is a bit thicker than the duracell  but i don t think that s the source of the problem these would probably work fine in any application that has an actual battery clip that snaps onto the battery terminals  but for  drop in  installations  you d better verify that they work      
3,5.0 ,                       i really like the amazon basics products  so i decided to give these a try  they fit perfectly into my smoke detectors and they are the exact same size as the other brands with which i was replacing them  from prior experience with amazon basics  i knew that if they didn t fit  i would be able to return these pretty effortlessly because they re customer service is excellent  very satisfied with these batteries and will purchase amazon basics batteries in the future      
4,3.0 ,                       overall  a good value for this type of battery  one battery lost all power less than two weeks after installing  if the rest last longer than   years  they ll be as good or better than the expensive name brands  copper top and bunny   used in smoke detectors      
5,4.0 ,                       ok very important   these batteries are a great price and do work fine electrically   however  they are slightly larger than your typical better known brands   this means in some applications these batteries may not fit   since the price and other qualities are good  i would suggest buying the smallest package of them to test in all your needed applications to see if they work for you   they did fit in my wireless switches and volt meters   they were almost to tight for my smoke detectors and i had to push them in to the point where they are jammed     not the best but i got them in   in certain other devices they were maybe just a millimeter or two to long and i had to go to the local drugstore and buy some well known much more expensive brand   amazon  love the product  please address the size issue      
6,1.0 ,                       i don t write reviews very often  but felt compelled to call these batteries out  i am a big fan of amazon basics in general  so i thought i would give these a try to save money over name brands  used them for smoke detectors and keyless entry system  schlage   after only   months  had to replace each one    batteries in total  due to voltage drop down to less than     volts and devices no longer working  will try  nd tier name brand next time  don t waste your money on these      
7,2.0 ,                       i purchased these batteries to replace the batteries in the smoke detectors in my house   within a few months  one smoke detector is already chirping due to low battery   the return window has closed so i can t get a refund   i would not recommend this product   pay more and get better quality batteries instead edit  they all went bad later today  i called amazon and they refunded me  do not purchase these batteries  they are awful      
8,5.0 ,                       these alkaline batteries have worked as well and lasted as long as any brand i ve used beforeamazonbasics batteries always come packaged well in convenient storage boxes     
9,1.0 ,                       worst battery ever     i replaced a duracell battery in my garage door keypad that lasted for   years   in   months since i have now used   amazon batteries in the same keypad    it only gets used maybe   times a week  don t waste money on amazon batteries  if i could do zero stars that would be more appropriate     
10,1.0 ,                       i purchased these because of the price and regret every penny i spent on them  i used one in my answering machine as a backup to only be used if the power in the house failed  within   weeks of installation my machine alerted me that the battery was low and needed replacement  other brand name batteries i ve used in it have lasted over a year in the machine  because they are simply sitting idle until a power outage don t waste your money on this useless junk      
11,1.0 ,                       these were the worst batteries i ve ever used   i had one die after less than    hours   they are large for a  v and don t fit easily into devices   i was using it in a small portable device with a plastic case  and the oversize battery actually forced the plastic seams apart   will not be buying again      
12,5.0 ,                       as with all  v batteries  these are relatively expensive   however   they are cheaper than the other name brands   they offer similar performance as well in low drain devices such as scales  smoke alarms and multimeters   i d buy again   thanks amazon      
13,3.0 ,                       batteries came packaged in a box   great  but each battery is wrapped in a hard tight cellophane   grabbed a knife and started to open  and before proceeding i realized that the metal in the knife would short the battery terminals out   have not checked the life of the battery yet   but right off the bat  a   star for one of the dumbest packaging ideas ever      
14,1.0 ,                       these  and all amazon basics batteries i have bought  have very short lifespan and last dramatically less than name brand batteries  i used their  v when replacing batteries in our smoke detectors and was able to compare its performance against one regular brand battery i replaced at the same time  the name brand battery is still working  and i ve replaced the amazon battery twice  which with a smoke detector comes from that annoying beeping which begins only in the middle of the night i had thought batteries are a simple commodity and amazon  or whomever it has contracted to make these  could make batteries of roughly the same quality as a name brand  i was definitely wrong  buy a real brand      
15,1.0 ,                       i would give these negative stars if i could  i ordered this brand a year ago to use in a smoke alarm  the alarm started beeping around     weeks after the battery was installed  so i chucked it and got a duracell  i assumed i got a defective batch and forgot about it  i ordered a pack of these a couple months ago to change the batteries in all the smoke alarms i have  and once again the whole household was woken in the middle of the night as one  then two  then three alarms started beeping just weeks after installation  a bummer  a hassle  a waste of money      
16,1.0 ,                       put one in my smoke alarm only to get woken up with the wonderful dead battery squak in less than a month  get what u pay for avoid them at all cost they are garbage and i bought these aaa and aa aaa same results in a tv remote that uses nothing for energy same result  aa lasted in my pc mouse aprox the same amount of time      
17,1.0 ,                       these batteries are dangerous  we put them in all of the fire alarms in our house  and they died within the year  moreover  we had two  dead  batteries next to each other on our wooden kitchen counter  and one of them started to smoke and smolder  when we picked it up  the counter was burned  my husband threw the battery in the sink  luckily  we were home  this would have caused a serious fire otherwise      
18,5.0 ,                       needed     volt batteries for the yearly smoke alarm change  prices in the store are outrageous  if you ask me thank goodness for amazonbasics  great price  great packaging and a long lasting battery until next year        
19,1.0 ,                       come on amazon  we ve bought a lot of aa and aaa amazon batteries and have always been pleased with them  this was the first time i bought  v amazon in may       several of the batteries were bad right out of the box  i thought my device was wrong at first  but my battery tester confirmed they were indeed bad  i have never had this experience before with other brands   i ll be going back to them      
20,2.0 ,                       the batteries are okay but the packaging is so frustrating  each battery is individually shrink wrapped in a very hard to remove plastic  why have to take    to    seconds to get the wrapper off a battery  who individually wraps their batteries       
21,4.0 ,                       i received the batteries in a short period of time  which i needed in order to get my smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors working again  to get   for    bucks is phenomenal as the   volts that run the detectors  i prefer to replace all at the same time   and as it is a safety issue  i needed them quickly since one of the detectors was already chirping and i replaced it with the    volt battery i had left  the least expensive price locally was       for    the fact that i got   for less than      each is nice  it isn t high tech that i needed the batteries for but as they are replaced  x a year minimum   x is recommended  this made the most sense for quantity and price  we ll see if they last til the spring time change  they had better make it past the fall time change      
22,5.0 ,                       i really like these batteries and believe that they are as close as it gets to duracells for less  i will continue to purchase them      
23,1.0 ,                       after purchase  one of these batteries tested as dead  kinda crappy but they are cheap  so far they have lasted  m in a smoke detectorfollow up  i have had these batteries in my smoke detectors for my home  i have used all of them within a year because i have had to replace them every  m  they are completely dead    of them in the box were dead on arrival  never again     
24,1.0 ,                       i love that amazon is such a behemoth they make their own batteries  on a research driven decision  they pass marginal savings along to us  the amazon brand  v batteries are individually shrinkwrapped with very strong plastic  as you may see  i scraped the paint off using a screwdriver to remove it   tip     start puncturing the plastic between terminals  tip    allow a minute or three to get the plastic off  you cannot be in a hurry to replace the battery in your guitar pedal  an   pack should take no more than    minutes  if you want to open them all at once      
25,1.0 ,                       these batteries were really bad this time  installed them in smoke detectors  kept beeping since new batteries were weak      
26,1.0 ,                       first off  these don t fit the majority of smoke detectors   the are fractionally taller than typical   volt batteries   also  when i received my package  not one battery had a full charge   the all were nearly out of juice   on a positive note  i liked the packaging and amazon was great about giving me a refund      
27,5.0 ,                       with all of the large  multipack options for batteries  it s easy to over buy and end up with dead batteries that have never been used  this was the case with my previous privately branded amazon   volts  at first  i was dismayed to find that the batteries in storage were as dead as the one in the device needing an exchange  however  after searching my purchase history  thank you amazon for this   i found that i had last bought them   years ago  my how time flies  so now i m trying to be more realistic about my needs and buying smaller numbers  this might not sound like a money saving plan  but finding   never used dead batteries certainly is not a money saver      
28,3.0 ,                       i don t know yet how the batteries will hold up  but there is a problem with the invisible  tight plastic wrap around each of them   if you are in a hurry and just load them into your smoke alarm  it will soon start chirping at you   once you realize the plastic wrap is there  it s not easy to remove   one has to cut it with a sharp object that leaves me uneasy near the battery and it s a pain to rip it the rest of the way   my suggestion for amazon is to put a bright red  pull tab  and perhaps some serrations so customers would be sure to see the wrapper and then have a simple way to remove it   one should not have to use tools in order to replace a battery      
29,1.0 ,                       the size of this battery is a good bit more than the standard  v battery  so much so  that i had to pay a guitar luther  ppl who fix guitars and other stringed instruments  person to get the battery out of one of my guitars because the battery was so thick that it got stuck other  v battery brands fit perfectly  but not these amazon batteries i have changed the guitar battery out dozens of times and never got a battery stuck until i used these amazon batteries even after peeling the outer white plastic  amazon  coating on the battery  it was still too fat to fit in my guitar s battery receptacle so  before you go crazy and buy bunches of these  make sure they fit your device first      
30,5.0 ,                       alkaline batteries are good for low powered devices like voltage meters etc people complaining probably need to be going with lithium ion      
31,1.0 ,                       these batteries don t last  i thought the first battery going out in less than a month was fluke but these batteries don t last more than   months in smoke detector     month in multi meter  terrible  smoke detector batteries last years also for multi meters  this is a bad product and waste of money  i wish i could return them  save your put it towards energizer or duracell     
32,5.0 ,                       perfect smoke alarm and carbon monoxide combo replacement batteries  they last longer than a year but why take the risk hope that helps      
33,1.0 ,                       i bought these batteries to use in a tens device because they were significantly cheaper than the duracell version that i would normally use  however  i tried   of the   batteries and none of them lasted more than    minutes in the tens device    compared to the duracell  v battery which would last for days  very disappointed in the performance      
34,5.0 ,                       so  i have what is referred to as  stellar bad luck  around most things  when it comes to smoke alarm battery chirps  they always seem to start between  am    am  so i now operate on the policy of when i hear one low battery chirp  i replace all the smoke alarm batteries  having just completed a   month smoke alarm test since buying these batteries  i can say they still are holding a good charge  and i have avoided the disrupted sleep from that obnoxious   sec interval chirp      
35,1.0 ,                       i know  what else would you use   volts for   i ordered two sets of these to install in smoke detectors and exactly   weeks later  all of the smoke detectors are chirping   the original batteries lasted    months and these couldn t last slightly more than one the odd thing is that when i test the voltage  they still show close to   volts   however  under load  they drop well below   volts   of course  the smoke detectors are checking them under a load   these just don t have the mah s to handle smoke detectors   at least mine anyway  kiddie brand       
36,5.0 ,                       i have bought expensive batteries and cheap batteries  you can always tell the difference with the  really cheap  batteries  but the amazon batteries hold up as well as the more expensive batteries   happy with them     
37,1.0 ,                       purchased in april   put in smoke detectors   months later and they are dead batteries  would not buy again for anything you need batteries to work in dependably      
38,2.0 ,                       not really sure what happened  but i replaced the battery in my kitchen scale with one of these  and the scale almost immediately began smoking  and wouldn t turn on   scale was replaced under warranty  and they had never heard of this happening   they even paid to ship this scale back to their lab to test   i m wondering if the battery had somethign to do with the issue     
39,3.0 ,                       the batteries are packed like you are buying an iphone  a cardboard case nestled inside of another cardboard case like they were eggs  on top of it  each battery is individually wrapped in a thick  heavy duty plastic steel shrinkwrap  there is no easy way to open it without slitting your wrists trying with a knife how about using  basic  packaging and reducing the price  all this shrinkwrap and cardboard is wasteful      
40,3.0 ,                       i ordered a pack to replace the batteries in our smoke and co detectors around the house   come to find out these amazon basics batteries are just slightly larger in length  width and depth than the standard  v batteries from duracell and energizer   they won t fit in some of my smoke detectors  we have four floors to our house and about    different protectors throughout the entire house    use caution as these may not fit in devices such as remotes or other electronic devices where the battery compartment has little tolerance      
41,1.0 ,                       the size of the battery is bigger than the ones from other brands like duracell or energizer  it didn t fit in my guitar and i had to force them in the smoke detectors in my house  i don t think i ll ever buy them again  amazon  please fix the issue  looks like your quality control personnel might need additional training or you have a supplier with bad qc      
42,5.0 ,                       i m not a battery engineer   but i purchased these as they are much less expensive than batteries at retail to put in all my smoke detectors  one started beeping at  of course    am  when we had guests staying the night    decided to replace them all   it s been about a month and   well   they seem to be working      
43,1.0 ,                       the rating on these seemed to be good  so unfortunately i didn t look in to them any further   if i had  i never would have purchased them   i  like several others  purchased them to be used in smoke detectors   i installed them in   smoke detectors all on the same afternoon   by  am  less than    hours later    of the smoke detectors started chirping because of a low battery   by the time i removed the bad batteries in those   detectors  the other   had started chirping as well   these are garbage      
44,4.0 ,                       great price on   volts  cannot attest to longevity at this time  packaging went above and beyond  nestled in a folded to fit cardboard frame  within a well structured  heavy cardboard box  batteries themselves are shrink wrapped in strong cellophane      
45,5.0 ,                       they do what they are supposed to do  very well priced and i have not noticed any difference compared to the well know brands  which cost a lot more they come in a functional  sturdy  box  and are individually wrapped  no need for extra presentation  actually i would hope for more companies to adopt the concept of minimal  functional and affordable      
46,5.0 ,                       these   volt amazonbasics batteries work exactly as expected  and are easily comparable to both duracell and energizer alkaline batteries in their performance and longevity  i have used them in various applications from stud finders  to smoke alarms  to voltage readers  as well as a rode videomic pro r shotgun microphone  i have not yet found any gadgets in which they mysteriously do not fit as a result of being too small or improperly sized these are very good batteries for the price  as because with all amazonbasics products  you are getting good quality at a lower cost as a result of not paying for fancy packaging or marketing associated with the product      
47,5.0 ,                       i buy amazon basics batteries because the price is right and they seem to last as long as the name brand batteries   why pay a lot extra when the  basics  will do      
48,5.0 ,                       i don t have any complaints they work as aspected i used mine for mine fire alarm and carbon monoxide detector and the battery has been holding up fine i would recommend     
49,1.0 ,                       i tried to use these batteries in my smoke detector  put one in and it kept beeping  put a different one in and it worked for   days  awoke to the alarm going off this morning  no fire no smoke nothing  reset alarm and it s beeping  changed battery  continued to beep  changed it   more times  still beeping  each time using a brand new anazon battery that i just unwrapped  went to the local gas station  bought a  v battery and replaced the brand new amazon battery  no beeping  working fine  but if course i ordered the batteries in dec abd it s too late to send them back  very disappointed  haven t had any issues with aaa  aa  c  or d from amazon      
50,5.0 ,                       bought these to change out smoke detectors  they last the   months they are supposed to  then i use them in other non critical devices and they last a while in those as well mine were white with a gold stripe  not gold and black like the pic shows  not that it really matters      
51,3.0 ,                       the performance of these batteries so far seems pretty good  but they are a tiny bit larger than other  v batteries   which is problematic   i ve got a couple of little battery powered christmas decorations   little led lighted christmas trees made out of circuit boards  and the battery forms the trunk of the tree   i ve used all sorts of other batteries over the years with these decorations with no problem   a couple of weeks ago i put these batteries in  and they almost wouldn t fit   it took so much force to push them in place  i was worried that a  i might not be able to get them out again  and b  they might break the decoration   when i did take them out  i can see marks on the battery casing from being forced into place   i ve never come across a battery that wasn t the standard size    v batteries have been around for decades  how could it even be possible to make them the wrong size   i ve seen other reports of these batteries not fitting in guitars and some smoke detectors   i wish i had plaid closer attention to the reviews on this  but who woulda thunk that something like this could be an issue with batteries   i m sorry i ordered as many of them as i did  given that it s now a bit of a crap shoot as to whether i ll be able to use them or not   i won t be buying them again   which is too bad  as i ve usually been happy with my various amazon basics purchases      
52,5.0 ,                       good looking batteries in a very tasteful packaging  these batteries should last for years to come and appreciate the bulk size as many items in our home use this size     
53,5.0 ,                       these have lasted as long as duracell batteries in our smoke detectors  the only reason i need to buy   volts any longer   it s a much  much better value  they work well  and the packaging was appealing to me  flat packed in a cardboard box  instead of those plastic shell glued to cardboard  since i only needed a few  it was nice to not have to tape a package shut again  i ll get them again next time i need them      
54,5.0 ,                       if you have a lot of smoke detectors in your house  this is the best way to deal with the constant need for   volt batteries  the price was the best i could find and they seem to be holding charge much better than a few other brands i have tried in the past  maybe i just received a really fresh set  try them if you re on a budget or brand agnostic      
55,3.0 ,                       i am just a bit unhappy with the longevity   i seem to notice that one battery is not the same quality as others inthe same pack   over all an ok     
56,5.0 ,                       i don t see it especially long than other major brand   i use it for my tens  massager  since there is no rechargeable for some of the units    i do have one that uses aaa    i gone through them   a month perhaps   it s not good for the environment i know  guilty  maybe i will find a rechargeable solution in the future  this will do   it s individually wrapped  and you have to use something sharp to unwrap  i guess that s good safety measure      
57,5.0 ,                       apologies as i didn t have my previous duracell  v battery to compare it to but on the flipside i provided the other   types of batteries  a ruler to measure height to y alls advantage  and a voltage check  but it fit my needs perfectly and all i had to wait was   days   can t get much better than that  basically i had no issues with fitting it in my co detector and it works correctly even if the lifetime of this amazon basics battery is     ths of that to a duracell   which is unlikely due to the voltage measurement i just took  honestly it s just a better price point over time  if you re on the edge i d say take the splurge you can power other electronics with an adapter for a pricepoint so cheap      
58,5.0 ,                       it works   i replaced some  v batteries in smoke detectors   hopefully they will last a long time      
59,2.0 ,                       i bought these almost a year ago in order to have batteries on hand for when our smoke alarms start beeping  i started swapping in these batteries which were still in the original packaging but the smoke alarms are still beeping and some that were fine started beeping after i swapped in these batteries  i followed the reset instructions for each fire alarm which included removing them from constant power  removing the battery and holding down the button for    secs to no avail  just ordered some duracell batteries with a    year shelf life by default and replacing these as soon as they arrive  would have expected better quality but i guess for the price you get what you pay for thus the   stars     
60,1.0 ,                       amazon suggested this purchase    batteries  when i ordered a product that needed   volt batteries   however  when the product arrived  it required only one battery   also  when returning the product  i tried to return these unneeded batteries   amazon informed me that they are non returnable   that fact is not clearly stated in the item description      
61,4.0 ,                       the coolest thing about amazon batteries is that they come in easy to open close cardboard boxes   way better than those plastic coffins regular brand batteries come in   by the time i get a battery out of energizer packaging my blood pressure has gone through the roof and my will to live has been sapped can t say much about the longevity just yet   the  v batteries went  easily  from the box into co  detectors   hopefully this review will be long forgotten by the time they die      
62,5.0 ,                       these seem great  but the packaging sucks i just wish they d put a warning label or use opaque wrapping  the terminals are covered and the batteries won t work unless the clear plastic wrapping is removed we all use these for smoke detectors  so heads up  remove the plastic wrapping from the battery before using   not before  because they could drain start a fire packed in the box the way they are  i just replaced the batteries in all of our six smoke detectors  then had to scramble around to take them out and remove the wrapping because our dogs were losing their minds due to the chorus of warning chirps all over the house      
63,1.0 ,                       i purchased these batteries approximately     months ago believing they would be of the same quality as name brand alkaline batteries   only cheaper   well  in this case the old adage you get what you pay for is quite true   on average  the life cycle of each of these batteries has been about one month   you will get the same results from the old non alkaline batteries that are sold cheap   they do not last   i guess there really is a reason that name brand batteries are so expensive   dont waste your money on this crap      
64,5.0 ,                       i put the entire pack on my tongue to see if they were all charged up   it s been a week and i still can t taste anything  but that s ok since my wife s cooking isn t that great in all seriousness  these appear well made and a great value for the amount of batteries you get for the price   if they end up being junk i ll update my review would buy again      
65,2.0 ,                       bought these dec  th to replace smoke detector  v batteries  here it is jan   th and just replaced one of the new batteries   when reviewing it asked about packaging  don t think they need to individually shrink wrap the batteries  a little disappointing overall  first and i guess last time buying amazon batteries      
66,1.0 ,                       put one in my tens unit and within    minutes i started smelling something chemical  my entire unit was hot to the touch  and when i pulled the battery out the wrapping was starting to crack and i had to use a cloth to hold it it was so hot  beware      
67,1.0 ,                           this is bizarre  but i bought these for my tens device  muscle stimulation  and i have to wedge some paper towel into the battery compartment to hold the battery against the contacts because these batteries are physically shorter than the duracell and eveready batteries i ve used before  is that crazy or what      the duracell battery i took out had lasted for well over a week of use    or so hours a day    the amazon basics literally lasted a day    less expensive  but never again      
68,5.0 ,                       i had used duracel for years then sam s club stopped carrying them   i have used an interferential unit  like a tens unit  for pain control   it is a wonderful device but they eat batteries   duracel always gave me the longest battery life for pain control during work hours   i found these on amazon and tried them  hoping that because amazon put their name on the product meant the product was worthy of its reputation   i was not disappointed   i get a full day s use out of each battery   the price is reasonable  especially compared to the alternatives   i even tried rechargeable batteries  but they barely lived   hours and then take forever to recharge   now that i have found a place to recycle my used batteries  i don t feel like i am polluting the environment in order to control my pain in a non pharma manner   the   on the packaging is just because the plastic is so thick it is hard for me to get off   you may not think that is important      
69,3.0 ,                       this may sound crazy  but these batteries aren t the standard  v size   they are just a fraction of an inch thicker around the outside   so small of a difference that it is imperceptible until you go to use this battery in something formed exactly to the standard  v battery size   in my case  i have a taylor acoustic guitar   it has a removable  caddy  for the battery   the caddy needs to fit the battery tightly  because you don t want to hear a battery rattling around while you are playing   other name brand batteries fit like a glove  but this battery simply would not fit   i almost broke the caddy trying to force one of these before i gave up and bought a different brand fortunately  i have a lot of guitar pedals and other guitar accessories that use  v and they do not have such tight constraints  so i was able to use these batteries just fine  and they perform well   i was definitely disappointed to find that they wouldn t fit in my guitar  though  as that s the whole reason i ordered a new pack of  vs and thought i would try these out      
70,5.0 ,                       there are exactly two reasons people buy  v batteries     they have some dumb power tool that requires it and you go to get it to work  wonder why it doesn t  open up the battery compartment  see it s empty  and you go  why are people still making things that require  v batteries      you re taking a circuits class in your engineering degree  and you re in some dumb lab that requires a  v battery  and you go  why are people making me build circuits with  v batteries  so instead of driving out to the      or nearby gas station to get them now  you order a pack off amazon so they arrive like   days later   that way you can tell someone  sorry professor i can t do my lab i had no batteries  or  sorry spouse i can t build that shed because i don t have any batteries  and then you get back to what s really important  being a lazy person and then these batteries show up and it s all  ugh that s right i have to go do that thing  and you pop them in and it works   why does it work because it s a pack of batteries    long lasting  yeah like you re not just gonna buy another pack the instant you need that tool again in   years no matter what brand you bought   get over it      
71,5.0 ,                       i will update this if they die before   months  but right now these were a perfect buy for me   i have battery operated smoke detectors and refuse to pay       for a single battery  considering i have    of these in my home   i have tried dollar store batteries  but their longevity is inconsistent  to say the least   these were a great value option   they have been in for   months now  and so far  so good      
72,3.0 ,                       these are ok in a pinch  i own a media company so using them in wireless mics  iems  ect they do ok and last about     or so hrs we keep them around incase we run out of procells and have done a good job just understand they will not last as long these are a great value so when we do shorter shows we use them or burn through them for rehearsals ect      
73,1.0 ,                       i bought these to replace all my fire alarm detector s all at once  the batteries  are no good  my chirping alarm kepp chirping i gave up after the  th one didn t work  i also tried them on the carbon monoxide  and they didn t work either  i think someone forgot to juice these up  hopefully  i can still return these as its been   weeks      
74,5.0 ,                       bought for a tens unit i use dsily on my knee after surgery in the same unit i used a more expensive name brand battery and these last the same time for a lot less  i would recommend them for sure  also arrived fast      
75,1.0 ,                       that is exactly where your box will end up of bad batteries if you purchase these  i normally do not do reviews but this in not acceptable  these were purchased for our smoke and co detectors thinking we purchased a reliable product we in bulk for back up  after  yr and   months  which is what the amazon rep specified for length in time from order date and that they will not back their product  they are all bad   we went through   alone within an hour trying to find a good one left in the box  we didn t have one  this also happened with their aaa we purchased  bottom line do not buy amazon batteries if looking for long lasting and reliability      
76,2.0 ,                       i bought these in march      and i have already replaced   in my garage door keypad  normally i do not have to worry about replacing them for years  i think their life span is not eve     of other branded ones  i have to say one thing though that when i bought them they were white and orange color  now the color is copper   i bought them because i normally trust amazon brand      
77,2.0 ,                       my smoke alarm began to chirp  no problem  i bought a box of  v batteries from amazon  got a flashlight and a step stool and a battery  climbed up on step stool  put flashlight on top of a piece of furniture so i could see what i was doing  and replaced the old duracell with an amazon special smoke detector kept on chirping  repeated the whole process next day  still no joy  so i cursed amazon and ordered a pair of duracells  which arrived two days later   i do thank you for that  amazon   went through the routine a third time    and blessed silence   thank you  duracell  i think the problem  as another poster wrote  is that the amazon metal terminals are shorter  so they didn t fit against the contacts in the smoke detector  so they are useless for this purpose  which is about the only use i have for  v  and i ve had the batteries too long to return them for other purposes  where there are actually plug in   plug on contacts  i assume they would work all right      
78,1.0 ,                       bought these to use in our home s smoke detectors   had been using another major national brand   these lasted only   months  on average  about     th of the time the other batteries lasted i m a fan of amazon basics products  in general  but these were horrible   very   very  disappointed      
79,1.0 ,                       every time i tried to use these they don t last  recently replaced in a fire alarm  unit kept telling me the battery was low  after trying   amazon  v i switched to an energizer battery   no problems   never buying amazon batteries again      
80,3.0 ,                       cheaper battery  arrived with some almost dead  i liked the individual wrapping  but they run down quickly  i will not order these again  i do not recommend for home smoke detectors or anything critically important      
81,5.0 ,                       i typically buy all my batteries from amazon   they are a good value and last for a long long time   just as good as national brands      
82,2.0 ,                       put the amazonbasics   volt batteries into my kiddie smoke detectors and   out of   only lasted about   months  the duracells typically last a year or more  i did not do specific testing or document this  but i would rather spend more to have less hassle      
83,5.0 ,                       our house hold had used up a set of these that my son had bought so to keep from needing a battery for the next time and realizing that oops we didn t replace them when we used the last one  i picked up these to have on hand  granted we don t go through a lot of them fast but they do seem to have a good shelf life for us  i suspect the inventory is moving fast enough so they don t lose part of their usefulness just waiting to be sold      
84,2.0 ,                       the price is right but the batteries are individually shrink wrapped in plastic   a hassle to cut and unwrap each one  the cardboard container is sturdy  but it seems a lighter weight container would work just as well  that batteries are fairly sturdy  just like other  v brands  i doubt there is a risk of damaging the batteries when they are shipped       
85,5.0 ,                       just put these in my smoke detectors and thank god i don t hear that annoying beeping anymore  not sure how long they last but they work and fit in my detectors     
86,5.0 ,                       no complaints   came as advertised   price is good   i would buy them again      
87,2.0 ,                       name brand costs less product is what you d expect  a  v battery   they work  no issue   my application is an electronic lock that sees daily use   i formerly used duracell   the last two duracell batteries lasted     and     days   i switched to amazon basics to try to save a dollar or two   the last two of these have lasted    and    days   in short  the durcells cost  x more  but last  x longer   i ll be switching back when my   pack of amazon basics runs out      
88,1.0 ,                       we purchased a set of these for smoke detectors   first battery went bad in less than    months   we then purchased more expensive name brand   volts at target to replace them   they cost about     more  but the quality difference is immediately evident as they feel about twice as heavy   if you need to climb a ladder to change these batteries out  the extra    to not have to do it     times as often might be worth it      
89,1.0 ,                       bought these a while ago to have on hand for smoke alarms   they seem very weak straight out of the wrapper   touched them to my tongue and they are no stronger than the ones i just removed from my smoke alarms   i know not the most scientific way to test  but these are awful   these seem to be like the cheapest batteries you can buy at the dollar store      
90,1.0 ,                       i purchased these batteries in february so that i would have them on hand when it was time to change the batteries in my smoke alarms in march   today was the day and every single one of them caused the alarms to beep with the low battery notification   after driving to walmart  despite being told to self quarantine due to the coronavirus  to buy duracell batteries and then installing them in my smoke alarms  all the alarms stopped beeping   these amazon batteries are no good  and since it s past the date to return them  i am out what i paid for them and am very unhappy      
91,5.0 ,                       obviously my life has hit a new low because i m sitting here on a saturday morning reviewing amazon edition   volt batteries  anyways  i ordered    they arrived quickly and i had them in my smoke detectors within minutes  packaging was tight  the batteries themselves are of quality  and they are considerably less expensive than what is carried at walmart  target  or at grocery stores  the only problem is  i apparently should have ordered   batteries because i m hearing a distant smoke detector chirping at the moment and it s driving me nuts  in conclusion  order these batteries  you can t go wrong      
92,1.0 ,                       the battery leaked in the smoke detector  still has power but was beeping  pulled the battery to find a milk substance  i ve had good luck with the amazon batteries  name brand only going in the detectors now  all batteries can fail but a smoke detector is not under load imo      
93,1.0 ,                       i am not happy with the generic brand of  v i received   i was under the assumption  because the package is in the color of duracell betteries  very deceiving   that it was  duracell  which is what i ordered   only now do i see the little caption that picture may vary     that is not acceptable    what do i do with betteries that already do not      very unhappy     
94,5.0 ,                       i liked that i could buy just five of these    volt batteries aren t ones i use very often  so i was happy to see them in a smaller package at a good price  so far  the one i needed and am using is working fine  i like the solimo products  for the most part  and so far this is a good value      
95,1.0 ,                       i didn t read the other reviews on this product because a battery should just be a battery  right  my mistake   the footprint of this battery is larger than name brand batteries  ergo  it does not fit in my smoke detectors  some of my guitar pedals  my guitars  etc    my battery died during sound check this past weekend   no problem i have a ton a   volts from amazon  wrong  thank god for the generosity of my bass player and good ole duracell  buyer beware if you need to place this battery in a confined area  it may not fit      
96,5.0 ,                       we have a whole house smoke detector system   these are working great   i would normally buy duracell   not sure of longevity as we have only had them in for a few months  but happy so far      
97,5.0 ,                       what can i say   they re the cheapest batteries i ve seen that will work reliably in smoke alarms   i have    smoke alarms in my house  yes       including   in the basement    upstairs  and the rest on the first level   i tried replacing batteries as they got low  beeping alarm   but they all went within about   or   weeks   next march  all    will be replaced at one time   it s been a while since i ve installed the first of these and so far  so good   so far  i ll buy them again      
98,5.0 ,                       i am a big fan of amazon s batteries   the prices are great and i see no difference whatsoever from the standard rayovac or duracell batteries   i also like the bulk quantities you can purchase   i typically look at  v batteries as a  ripoff  because of the hefty price for what you typically get  but these are a good deal      
99,1.0 ,                       i bought this for my smoke alarms  i have had to replace   of them again because they just started beeping after a few weeks  i know the bettery is the problem because i went and bought different batteries and it solved the problem      
100,3.0 ,                       my experience with these batteries is fairly dull  i ve put them in devices and those devices worked  but  my complaint is the packaging  each battery is individually shrink wrapped and pretty much takes a knife to open  it s not that big of a deal  but  since i can get batteries that don t require trying to strip plastic off of each individual battery   i ll be getting these elsewhere from now on      
101,5.0 ,                       we ve been buying amazon basics batteries for the past   years and have no complaints they ve been fresh  last a while and best bang for our buck i will admit  they do not last as long as duracell or your higher end batteries but dollar for dollar they re the better bang for your buck  they last longer than you re typical cheap batteries  perfect for smoke alarms  kids toys  remotes  etc        
102,1.0 ,                       i bought these to keep on hand to use in various things including smoke detectors  as they always start beeping when it s not convenient to run to the store   i tried   brand new batteries in my smoke detector yet it continued to beep  once it was replaced with a rayovac it stopped  upsets me that there isn t enough  juice  in these  i bought them   months ago so i can t return unfortunately      
103,5.0 ,                       the batteries seem ok  i ll have to wait and see   they are less expensive than duracell   i use them on my smoke alarms and change them yearly      
104,1.0 ,                       smoke detectors have tighter tolerances than one would guess  these batteries do not fit  they are bigger by just enough to make you think it will fit  but they won t      
105,1.0 ,                       i use them  sparingly  for medical devices     minutes at a time  a couple times a week   they don t last more than   weeks   i used added up altogether  they don t last more than a few hours running steadily  also  their safety wrapper  label  peels off like a cheap sticker   underneath you see it s a crappy plastic shell of poor quality  never buy these       
106,5.0 ,                       which  you know  they only chirp because they batteries are low and they re just trying to save your life    anyways  these batteries work  that s all i need from them  really  and they accomplished that          
107,5.0 ,                       glad that amazon basics can provide me reasonably priced alkaline batteries  all the big battery companies want an arm  leg and more for their product  these perform just as well      
108,5.0 ,                       decided to try because the price was cheaper than the name brand batteries and was pleased  i ve used them in my smoke detector and they seem to hold up almost as long as other batteries  will buy again      
109,5.0 ,                       i had written a very bad review but have since learned that my problem was not the batteries but the smoke detectors themselves  i had no idea that the detectors should be replaced every    years   which is why they kept beeping after new batteries were installed      
110,5.0 ,                       it s difficult to gage the longevity of a product when asked to review it shortly after purchasing it  but i went ahead and gave it   stars  although my review on that aspect shouldn t be taken with any seriousness  they are otherwise batteries and they power things as expected  so  seem pretty good      
111,3.0 ,                       i use them in my smoke detectors and they wear out quickly      
112,5.0 ,                       i bought this pack so i could replace the batteries in all my smoke alarms     volt batteries are surprisingly expensive in the stores   so it was wonderful to find some inexpensive batteries on amazon   hooray  i m happy      
113,1.0 ,                       bought these terrible batteries for smoke detectors  most of them were dead out of the box  great fun when smoke detector is chirping in the middle of the night  avoid amazonbasic   volt batteries      
114,5.0 ,                       great value  last as long as the expensive big guys   i have not found defective battery since i test the majority before i use them   will reorder     
115,4.0 ,                       we immediately replaced all  v batteries in our three smoke detectors   all are in working order at this time and we are no longer annoyed by those warning chirps   i am most glad that all replacement batteries arrived when we expected   so all is safe and secure again for another year      
116,5.0 ,                       i paid              tax for eight batteries my favorite big box store sells an   pack of duracell   volt batteries for                tax hmm    as a complete non sequitur  i m hoping amazon continues its foray into other areas that sport that  amazon basics  badge      
117,1.0 ,                       i was very disappointed when i pulled the last     of these batteries out of my desk drawer a couple weeks ago and both were very low powered and i was unable to use    they were going into devises that i hardly use and they were supposed to replace the same amazon   volt batteries  that didn t last as expected     purchased just shy of   year ago  i expected more from this  amazon recommended  item    i guess i just get what i paid for  cheap is cheap      
118,5.0 ,                       amazon batteries excel in all areas  i have an improvement suggestion to pass along to amazon regarding the  v battery clear shrink wrap on each battery that is difficult to peel off and not easily removed with scissors or knife  i don t have a solution except possibly remove the wrapping but that may not be in compliance with shipping regulations      
119,2.0 ,                       we have had good results from amazon branded batteries in the past and thought these   volt batteries would be no different   the batteries themselves seem to do the job but that packaging is horrible   each battery comes individullay shrink wrapped and they are nearly impossible to extract them from the wrapper   to get the wrapper off you ll need a small knife or razor blade which should not be necessary at all   hopefully amazon can address this with their vendor   ease of use difficulties lowers the rating for me   if one is elderly look elsewhere for   volt batteries because these will be useless      
120,4.0 ,                       whereas it is difficult at this time to determine the longevity of the battery  overall i am very pleased with my purchase  the  beeping  from the smoke detectors has subsided and thus this product gets a favorable rating  i enjoy amazon specific products because buying amazonbasics products keeps the escalating stock prices trending in the right direction      
121,3.0 ,                       not as good as the bunnies  i thought they would be  but this morning a smoke detector started chirping for a new battery  i hopped on here and  ordered an   pack    detectors and i change all  and then saw  you bought these june last year   none of the detectors have ever had to go into alarm state  so it wasn t like they were being used up  the bunnies used to last two plus years next year  back to the bunnies  i guess  bummer amazon  i love the amazon basics line of stuff  even my mouse and keyboard are amazon basics as are usb hubs  cables etc      
122,1.0 ,                       bought a batch of these in june      and did not get around to trying one out until   months later   found out all were low voltage between     v to    v very unhappy and now can not even return         
123,5.0 ,                       this plain jane battery keeps up with the best of them  eat your heart out energizer  running in a high draw application  a tens unit  this little battery runs for      hours  about the same as a rayovac  and far out distancing the eveready energizer max batteries that we tried that petered out after only   hrs      
124,5.0 ,                       came quick and works like name brand batteries  no issues  used for fire alarms      
125,3.0 ,                       these seem to be hit or miss   since purchasing these  v batteries  i ve had two  chirping  smoke detectors   no problem though  because i ve got my whole box of brand new amazonbasics  v batteries     the problem is  two days after replacing the batteries  the same smoke detectors started  chirping  again   here s the funny thing  though  i replaced the  defective   amazonbasics  v batteries with other amazonbasics  v batteries from the same order and they ve been fine for a few weeks   so  it s as if random batteries in the batch i ordered are defective  while others are fine   so far i ve only used the four batteries from my order and they re   for    not great in my book   i ll update this review as the  good  batteries live on longer and i use others from the order        
126,5.0 ,                       they are   volt batteries  labelled from amazon so no clue as to whom themanufacturer is   they are individually wrapped and come in a cardboardbox for easy storage   great price     no more    batteries for      fromwal mart   comes in a set of   so you can spares around for use whennecessary      
127,2.0 ,                       these batteries could have been great for the price  but     they leaked in the box  i had   left and went to fetch one for my daughter s rc car remote  only to find dark powder all over the inside of the shrinkwrap  i gave this review   stars instead of   because it didn t leak inside the remote  only inside its own packaging  i checked the box and it was made in       supposed to expire in       but i guess we know that didn t happen as it s january      right now  next thing i need to do is to go get ripped off at a retail store before my next s s batch comes in  bummer note  don t buy leaky batteries  they will destroy your electronics    i m looking at you  kirkland signature a k a  duracell    you owe me a thousand bucks       
128,1.0 ,                       these batteries are just slightly thicker than other  v batteries  like duracell and energizer  which makes them completely useless to put in items with tight battery compartments  like smoke alarms  remotes  etc   i can t use them as i wanted them for my home smoke detectors   a waste of money      
129,1.0 ,                       every one of the  v batteries leaked  one was still in the package  never used  the rest were in use and leaked inside my smoke alarms and other equipment  damaging them  before there was any indication that the power level was getting low one star because i can t award zero  i trusted amazon to put its own brand name on a decent quality product but that is definitely not true in this case      
130,5.0 ,                       love amazonbasics   i finally decided to stop constantly searching for batteries around the and stocked up on all the most common sizes   well  i did so and it didn t break the bank   i bought all amazonbasics batteries and won t ever go back to the expensive brands from the big box stores again   now  when i need a battery i just go to the kitchen drawer and have whatever i need on hand so far  i ve experienced at least the same usable life as any other brand i ve used   time will tell  but with the pricing on these batteries  i ll definitely be back      
131,1.0 ,                       i bought these because i needed to replace batteries on my smoke and carbon monoxide detectors  i used   and each battery lasted about a week and two days before indicating low battery by the dreaded detector beeping sound  other batteries i ve used lasted for years  these not even two weeks  luckily amazon has great policies and i was able to get a refund for this product  maybe i got a bad batch or something    i would not buy this product again      
132,1.0 ,                         out of       volt were bad probably old or never made with pride made in china  don t buy     
133,5.0 ,                       these batteries we use once in while and so it was good buy for the price other brands might or may not last long  same with any batteries it was good for the price i bought for the home fire   smoke alarm and it still going on more then   months  no issue   positive purchase      
134,5.0 ,                       i m gonna have to eat some crow on this  i was a firm believer in name brand batteries  i was under the assumption that amazon batteries were low quality but how wrong i was  will not buy any other batteries      
135,2.0 ,                       the price on these is good   they seem to last a decent amount of time   they have one serious flaw   every time i remove a battery from a device  the female terminal breaks away from the battery   i have tried various ways of removing these  very carefully  and they still always break off  this has happened on multiple occasions   must be poorly connected at the factory   i have never had this kind of a problem with any other brands      
136,4.0 ,                       unsure about longevity  we use their aa for xbox controllers and they seem to run the same time as others but they package each  v battery seperately in a very tight plastic  very annoying  it s already packages well without the needed plastic      
137,3.0 ,                       the batteries are individually shrink wrapped and lack a tear strip making them hard to unwrap  however  battery voltage was excellent  each battery measured approximately     volts when not under load which dropped to     volts under a    ma load  as mentioned in other reviews  these batteries are larger than standard size and are difficult to install in smoke detectors  as others have mentioned  the expiration date is of microscopic size      
138,1.0 ,                       i purchased batteries to use as we were running low in the office  i usually buy duracell or energizer alkaline batteries for the office  i tried the amazon brand for the first time  they are kept in a cool dry supply closet  the office did not need to use immediately  when we opened the package on august    we tried   batteries and none of them worked  the window for return closed on july     we ended up using the duracell batteries my office manager bought prior to these batteries  i now don t even want to bother opening the aa size that i also bought  i will not ever buy these again or recommend any of this brand      
139,5.0 ,                       so far so good  i have been using these to powers my auduino projects  they have been working good so far  i priced them in many places before purchasing and read the reviews and decided these would fit my needs  i have no requests purchasing these batteries over name brand  i saved and they worked the same  win win for me      
140,4.0 ,                       for some reason the batch i received was about     mm too small to fit in my e stem machine that amazon sells   i have to fold a piece of thick paper several times to hold the   volt in place   this is still a good deal as   volts are stupid expensive      
141,5.0 ,                       the least expensive way i could find to stop the horrible chirp when the smoke alarm decides it s time for a new battery  i found that it helps to remove the plastic wrap around the battery before you install it  that wrap is important because unlike any other type of battery   v batteries have both terminals exposed on the same end which makes it possible for them to make contact with some type of conductive material and start a fire  and when you dispose of these  make sure you put tape over the terminals for the same reason      
142,4.0 ,                       batteries are very good  and from past experience  they are just as good as name brand batteries   the one thing i don t like  is the supposed   year shelf life   batteries were produced        with   year life of         however  i just ordered them on march           that s almost   year less time than advertised      
143,5.0 ,                       i ordered    of these for our electronic firing system used on our fourth of july fireworks show   they worked flawlessly on that show and many were reused for another show a month later   we ve used all types of batteries including energizer  duracell  rayovac  and other  generic  alkaline   price for performance these things take the cake   not one failure yet   i ll be buying more again next year      
144,2.0 ,                       we use these in tens units but they only last for about       days  i wish they lasted longer but the price is more reasonable than other brands and i keep reading about fake knock offs for some of them that i buy these because of the amazon brand  hopefully that would make it more trustworthy   idk      
145,1.0 ,                       don t last very long at all      
146,5.0 ,                       needed new batteries for my carbon monoxide and smoke detectors around the house  best to change all the batteries at once so i m not second guessing which ones i have changed and which i haven t  also  all the smoke detectors in my house are hard wired in a circuit  so if one beeps  they will inevitably affect the others  plus  i don t like being woken up to the loud  annoying  low battery  beeping in the middle of the night  call me lazy  these batteries are the best price i ve found  even compared to costco  of course  costco carries the duracell brand  so i don t know how well they compare in terms of longevity  with changing them yearly  i guess it doesn t really matter  they work find for where i m plugging them into      
147,1.0 ,                       normally these things are awesome  the last batch is trash literally they go dead almost immediately the other ones that i ve purchased previously have always been better than the leading brands      
148,1.0 ,                       i bought these to replace chirping smoke detector batteries  just a few days later they are chirping again   these are complete garbage and i regret buying them      
149,5.0 ,                       i was weary of buying non brand name batteries from reading tons of reviews  however  i have gotten some duracell batteries from amazon which were already past the expiration date  and as expected  they had nowhere near the charge one would expect from them left  the amazonbasic   volt batteries were roughly half the cost of the big names  and so far  they are working great in my devices  i am using them in guitars and related guitar effect pedals  and they really do the trick  the guitar tone is big and beefy  which you wouldn t get out of a wimpy battery it s great that they offer an   pack  because i seem to be continuously running out of   volts  and i can get   here  instead of a two pack for the same price of the big names  each battery came individually wrapped in plastic  to insulate the terminals and prevent discharge  they are housed in a purpose designed cardboard box  which keeps them nice and organized pros   arrived fresh  full  powerful charge    pack   inexpensive  comes packaged in a neat little cardboard box to keep them organized in cons   haven t found any yet      
150,1.0 ,                       i bought these for everyday household use  smoke detectors  door locks  tools my smoke was going off and needed a new battery   when one goes i replace them all   i also write the date i installed them   i usually get a year some times more   the first battery i show had a voltage of      and set off the smoke   the next three i show were the fresh amazon batteries right out of the box   the last two are the ones i was about to take out of service   so      set of the change battery beep   amazon batteries were            and the ones i was changing out were      and         i would expect all the fresh  v to be closer to   v out of the package   i was not able to get a brand name battery to compare with  but the ones i was replacing were just cheep insurance company batteries   i had to return these   good luck if you still decide to buy them   i know how you feel   i don t give a lot of weight to negative reviews ether      
151,5.0 ,                       yay  cheap batteries  interesting how with battery technology slowly coming of age      bigger  more power  longer lasting      it seems the price should be coming down  not so for a few of the bigger battery companies  duracell  energizer etc    have noticed a slow rise in prices of batteries i used to buy for all sorts of things  supply and demand you say  posh and poo i say  of course if i was king of the world i d sell every battery operated toy for       and charge         per battery after the  st one wears out  wait    aren t they kind of sort of doing that  now if amazon would come up with a battery for my leaf      now we re talking          
152,5.0 ,                       use these in smoke alarms  ceiling fan remotes  and battery backup for our power assist lift recliners  yes  they use   volt batteries   seem to work fine wherever i ve used them  don t know about longevity  ask me in a year if ceiling fan remotes are still going   other amazon aa and aaa batteries i ve used in other devices  principally mice  keyboards  and tv remotes  have held up fine  i m expecting these to behave the same as they re basically   aaa batteries in series inside the   volt packaging      
153,5.0 ,                       i keep a dozen on hand at all times for my acoustic guitars  i m a country artist and play a lot of shows   these work great  last long  and come in at a great price      
154,1.0 ,                       i use   volt batteries to power my tens unit  small medical device  and i usually get about     hours of use  it is a power hog for sure but these amazon batteries never even got close to   hrs  one of them tapped out after   hour   halfway through the box i m very dissatisfied with this purchase  even if the rest of them work great that would leave quality control at like        nope skip these  i like other amazon basics and these batteries are just the worst      
155,1.0 ,                       i bought this multipack of  v batteries to replace the batteries in all    kidde smoke detectors in my house  i replaced the batteries in june   almost immediately after installing them  i had issues with them going off  when the first one went off  i thought it was a fluke  it was summer and i thought  maybe  humidity was to blame  but then another went off and another  my kitchen counter has   smoke detectors with their batteries removed  only way we could stop them from going off   today  after the  th one went off  it finally dawned on me that maybe the batteries were to blame  we had the smoke detectors for a year  with the kidde battery that came with it  and never had a single one go off  so i started testing the new amazon batteries  and sure enough  even the unused ones don t have full power  total crap  i m now buying energizer batteries so i can actually put up my smoke detectors again  instead of sitting on my counter  where they re doing no good       
156,1.0 ,                       i was changing the battery for my smoke detector last week  upon unwrapping one of the battery and it start heat up immediately to the point where i feel burning my finger i immediately run to the door and throw away into the back yard just like the hand grenade  so worry it will explosion in my hand i will not buy again no matter how cheap is amazon basic price  i will go back with the trusted brand name even paying more       
157,4.0 ,                       they came nicely packed in a box where the tops didn t touch   my son had them in his pocket as he replaced smoke detector batteries for me   when we got to the last two he grabbed them out of his pocket and the tops had touched so that the batteries were very hot to the point where we couldn t hold them without burning our hands   i threw them in my sink to cool off   i did not add water  that was kind of scary as i have never had a duracell do that   get hot like that   we went ahead and replaced the batteries using the other two in the box   so far they seem fine      
158,1.0 ,                       not worth the money  put them in my smoke detectors  couple minutes later  my smoke detectors were chirping like the battery was low  thought my smoke detector was going bad  tried a couple other batteries from this lot  same problem  found some energizers laying around  put those in   no problem  did some research and found that a lot of off brand batteries aren t always giving off the right amount of voltage   these don t seem much different  save yourself the time  stick with the name brands     
159,5.0 ,                       my house has many smoke detectors    six i think   when one gets a low battery  they all go off   this is no longer an issue  because for the price of these batteries  i can replace them all at once  once a year  and avoid the ear splitting headache of the low battery warning   packaging is simple  batteries work great in the smoke detectors   i can t speak to other applications as nothing else i own requires a   v      
160,1.0 ,                       thought i was getting a good deal on these  duracells last about a year in smoke detectors and the garage door key pad  these are going out every     months  worse than dollar store batteries      
161,1.0 ,                       i usually go to the amazon brand and did this time but these batteries or at least the batch i got had a very short lifetime  i am going to call amazon and see if i can get a refund even thought the return window has shut stay tuned      
162,1.0 ,                       i ordered and received the   pack of  volt batteries  they fit fine into the co smoke detector  but only lasted about     weeks apiece  i m now on my last battery from that order  i will not order again  this is the only time i ve been dissappointed with the amazon basics products  the battery has a stamp of           on the bottom which would seem to imply that they are not anywhere near expired      
163,4.0 ,                       batteries seem ok  but they are shrink wrapped in hard plastic film which is very difficult to remove  takes a knife or some other kind of blade  and then one risks cutting oneself  couldn t a different kind of plastic film could be used just as cheaply      
164,5.0 ,                       i tested the aa size amazon brand battery to find out the actual usable capacity as compared to the aa duracell procell battery  the results showed that the amazon battery is about    percent the capacity of the duracell  if you calculate the cost per unit capacity  the batteries are almost identical  the amazon battery was actually slightly more expensive when represented in cost per watt hour  because of this i would probably choose the procell  if i can get a good price on it  just because it means less frequent battery changes  the amazon battery is a surprisingly good battery though  you will probably barely notice the difference in capacity  so if you don t want to waste time shopping around then its a good choice i also performed the same test on duracell copper top  and energizer max  their performance was nearly identical to the procell  more interestingly  i tested the energizer ultimate lithium aa cell  this cell was   times the cost of a procell at       per cell  however the capacity was only     times that of the procell  so don t waste your money on these batteries  they re much more expensive per unit of capacity   the capacity of all these batteries were measured in watt hours  here are the numbers aa amazon battery        wh  my cost per cell           cost per watt hour         aa duracell procell        wh  my cost per cell           cost per watt hour         aa energizer lithium        wh  my cost per cell          cost per watt hour         this test was done using an op amp circuit to maintain a constant current load at    ma  voltage and current were being logged ounce per minute and this data was used to calculate the amp hour with a     volt cutoff  the watt hour was then calculated by multiplying the amp hour by the average voltage from the beginning of the test to     volts  all batteries mentioned were tested using this same method  note that the capacity of these batteries can change dramatically under different conditions  the same battery under a heavy load will have a fraction of the capacity that it would under a light load  this data is only good for a comparison when choosing what battery is worth buying at what price  unless your device loads the battery at a constant current of    ma in summery  the amazon batteries are not bad batteries  at least based on this test using the aa cell   if you choose to shop around for a name brand battery  stay at or below       per cell  anything above       per cell will be more expensive per unit capacity than the amazon battery  oh  and definitely stay away from the energizer lithium unless expense is not an issue  these batteries are only worth the additional cost if your application requires a light weight and relatively high capacity battery regardless of cost  these batteries are surprisingly light weight compared to an alkaline      
165,3.0 ,                       purchased these for use in our church while i had previously assumed all  v batteries were the same size  i know differently now   these batteries taught me that lesson in most applications  the size is fine   the size difference became apparent when swapping in one of these batteries for our acoustic guitar electric pickup   the battery was inserted correctly  but the door to the battery was difficult to close because the battery was a fraction of an inch bigger than the compartment   all the amazon basics batteries fit the same  but name brand  v batteries fit much better      
166,1.0 ,                       doesn t even deserve   star   the batteries i received didn t work right out of the box   of course i didn t know that until i needed to replace the one for my wireless monitor system that my band uses during the middle of the gig   i was surprised to find out that the voltage was so low that wireless system didn t even turn on   had to scramble to find another battery   was not happy at all      
167,5.0 ,                       use these in guitar pedals and other electronics  nice to have a stock of  v they last like the silver ones and the coppertops      
168,3.0 ,                       purchased these batteries a while back   ct alkaline  and the box has an exp of          batteries have been stored in the original packaging and box inside my home  half of the batteries have discharge and corrosion inside the plastic wrapping  did not have issues when i did use the other batteries but was disappointed when i had to replace one of the batteries in one of my devices and found out i didn t have as many batteries as i expected  the strength of the batteries was adequate but i would avoid buying in bulk as they may not last      
169,5.0 ,                       keep these around to change your smoke alarm batteries   i don t change mine every time we change the clocks  but i do test the alarm then   i change batteries every couple of years even if they still work though   no need to take chances      
170,5.0 ,                       we have a heavy duty smoke alarm and carbon monoxide detector in one  an average  v battery from duracell was lasting us right around    days  the dollar store kind lasted just about   weeks  and the amazon brand lasted about    days  when comparing prices per unit these were clearly the better buy  and it s nice to have months worth on hand so when your smoke alarm s low battery notifier starts beeping in the middle of the night and you must remove the battery  you can replace it immediately  giving you peace of mind and one less thing to put on your to do list  this is one of the most important household subscriptions i get through amazon  and frankly it s a steal      
171,1.0 ,                       bought the   pack  had my energizer  v finally go bad  time to try the amazon batteries  none of them had any battery power left in them  all of them  don t know if i had a bad batch or not  all the batteries were individually wrapped so you couldn t test them right away      
172,5.0 ,                       these are a little bit less expensive than name brand batteries and appear to last as long    volts is an odd size but for some reason are required in a lot of home electronics  they last     years of occasional use in for wireless ceiling fan switches and a couple of months of periodic used in a tns box      
173,5.0 ,                       i almost felt like doing a  unboxing  for these   they are so nicely packaged   i really don t have a lot of expectations from a  v battery and the only reason i have them  is to backup my hardwired smoke detectors   i replace my batteries twice a year in them  as recommended by the national fire protection agency   and after   months  these guys still show a lot of juice left   i could probably get by with going longer between changing them out  but i m not willing to risk my smoke detector not working when i need it i love these and will continue to buy the amazon  v batteries      
174,1.0 ,                       i bought    amazon brand   volt batteries for my smoke detectors  i replace my smoke detectors each august  the first five     failed on each smoke detector within five minutes and began chirping  i stopped installing them in the other smoke detectors immediately   i had to put the old duracell batteries back in until i could buy some additional duracells   these were made in china with no expiration date either on the box or batteries   it s pretty obvious the shelf life of these batteries was expired  note that these were sold as  amazon s choice    i ll be returning them      
175,1.0 ,                       these were terrible waste and died within a day  i used them for rc cars     
176,1.0 ,                       i purchased these to be in my smoke detectors as a backup to my electrical wiring and they do not work at all   any product that i put them in  they do not function   i highly recommend not purchase this amazon brand like i did and purchase a name brand   i missed my return window and now stuck with them   sad to have this experience as most of the amazon branded items are great   buy another brand      
177,5.0 ,                       installed   of the amazon   volt in our smoke alarms and   more in the backup controls for our adjustable bed     months later all continue to perform and have outlasted name brand batteries used previously   great value at less than     the cost  similar experience with d cells used in motion detector lights around our farm      
178,5.0 ,                       i purchased these batteries for my home smoke alarms   they tested fine when i put them in the smoke alarms about six months ago   i haven t had any  low battery  beeps  at all so far   so i think these batteries are alright  good price as well      
179,1.0 ,                       i ordered these for my cat feeder   i have bought   volt batteries at the store and they last a couple of weeks   these batteries last   days before they need to be replaced   i was on vacation and my cat didn t get fed for   days because these batteries are such pieces of crap   i came home to find all of the food in the cat feeder and my cat not fed   i replaced these batteries prior to leaving town    i wish i would have read the review prior to buying   if i had tried these out sooner  i would have returned them   don t waste your money  these batteries are junk       
180,3.0 ,                       bought these for my smoke alarms       i nearly broke my legs leaping out of bed because the smoke alarms were going off in the middle of the night  just imagine your sleeping and bam   fire  you jump out of bed and your legs just don t work because it s      in the morning next thing you know your face down on the ground with bruised knees and a sprained wrist then running through the house looking for the fire  because that s what your suppose to do  i m thankful my house wasn t on fire but i would have been happy had my batteries actually lasted longer than   months    these are a great deal but i would not suggest them for a smoke detector       if you need them for a toy or clock or something less important than a smoke detector i d      buy these      
181,5.0 ,                       i prefer to buy all of my batteries on amazon  they last just as long as name brand batteries and they cost significantly less  i use these in my smoke detectors at home  i am always prepared when one needs a new battery because amazon offers them in bulk      
182,1.0 ,                       these  v batteries work fine  that s not the issue  the issue is that they are a fraction of an inch shorter than duracell or energizer  v batteries  so they don t fit snugly into the battery compartment of kidde smoke alarms and co detectors  you ll insert the battery  close the battery door  and it ll still chirp because it s not  quite  big enough to make full contact when seated in the battery tray  it barely touches the terminals  hence the continued chirping   very frustrating  considering i bought a whole box to replace all the batteries in my entire home s smoke alarm system  just be aware if you are buying these for your smoke detectors   stick with major brands      
183,3.0 ,                       i only use these in smoke detectors   they don t last as long as the energizer or duracell  these freshly purchased amazon  v batteries only last about     as long   size is off  looks a bit longer and thinner when trying to install into smoke detectors     
184,1.0 ,                       amazon basics batteries   i bought a    pack aaa  a large pack of aa and a pack of    v batters  they say they have a shelf life of ten years  i bought then all in may      i want to change all   of fire alarm batters some take   aa some take  v every last battery was dead  total waste of money  i had to back and buy new batteries  amazon says they won t take the return  this is poor customer service  you don t use batteries right away all the time  i don t plan to ever buy amazon brand again      
185,5.0 ,                       smoke alarms start chirping when the battery gets old   they appear to be programmed to start that chirping at   am   good to have some spare batteries around when that happens  or plan ahead and install the batteries early   like i would do that      
186,5.0 ,                       i always thought the more expensive batteries were worth the price  now  the less expensive versions have caught up enough so the high price is not warranted unless you have specific application needs  for regular use in standard electronic gear i find them long lasting      
187,1.0 ,                       this battery cannot last more than   months in a keypad lock  went out completely in an instant and lock me out of the house a duracell battery will go out gradually and allow the keypad lock to give out signal that it s running out of juice don t buy this      
188,1.0 ,                       i have never given anything on amazon   star  but these batteries are absolute junk  i bought them to replace the old ones in all the smoke detectors in the house like the recommendations when you turn the clocks forward  and during the first week  three of them failed  do not buy  nice to put crap batteries in your smoke detectors  talk about not sleeping at night  i am replacing all the amazon ones with real batteries      
189,5.0 ,                       i have    a c smoke detectors that have a  v battery back up   there is nothing more annoying than that chirp you get when the battery runs low after     years  i needed an economical alternative to the name brands which would have run me around        dollars to use  instead of these amazon batteries   well i am more than pleased  after being installed for about a week the detectors are all quiet       
190,1.0 ,                       bought these for smoke detectors       lasted   months      nothing like that shrill noise in middle of the night if you are reading this amazon  i d like to send the   left back to you      
191,1.0 ,                       pulled this out of my smoke detector  it was in the type of compartment that just pushes the   and   against metal connectors but doesn t attach like a snap  clip or click like a classic  v battery connector so why did the   connector fall off  quality issue  i believe i will go with name brand on this one as i have never seen a   volt battery tip fall off      
192,1.0 ,                       first off the batteries are individually wrapped which are difficult to cut off  next the batteries seem to die in warp speed  i just replaced all my smoke detectors in my home  about    with these batteries and within a few days my smoke alarms were alerting me that the batteries are dead   it wouldnt be as big of a deal except the alarms cherpb intermittently which makes for a terrible time trying to find which one died  ughh just going back to good ol  duracell and pay a little more for a   year guarantee      
193,5.0 ,                         volt batteries are a must for any household  i still have multiple devices in my home which need them from camera equipment to smoke detectors  these have been doing the job just fine so far  i like that they come in a no frills box  and each is individually wrapped in some plastic so they won t touch anything else in the junk drawer   i ve also since purchased a battery organizer which has changed my life   and junk drawer  i ve filled it up with all the batteries neatly placed      
194,5.0 ,                       well so far these have been pretty good batteries they ve lost this up to this point without any problem i got them for a smoke detector      
195,5.0 ,                       a battery is a battery  not much to say   it works great  last a long time and is worth the value i only use amazon batteries now      
196,1.0 ,                       had these in a drawer for just over a year wanted to put them in fire detectors all bad      
197,5.0 ,                       these are some good batteries  they can compete with other top notch brands  good deal for the money  i really like the fact that amazon takes pride in their packaging  highly recommend  pleasure doing business with you  thank you      
198,5.0 ,                       i got these for the sole purpose of replacing smoke alarm batteries  honestly  it seems like not many things use  v batteries anymore  but smoke detectors sure do  haven t had any issues with these needing to be replaced prematurely      
199,1.0 ,                       these will usually read out between        v but are very prone to swelling and later leaking and or draining very quickly  think weeks with light use  sometimes days with no use  very inconsistent      
200,3.0 ,                       i purchased these for my kidde smoke detectorthey were to replace the amazon  v batteries i had put int hem last yearthese seem to have a slightly shorter connectors then standard  and i guess shorter than the one s i purchased last year    after replacing them about   hours later all my smoke detectors started chirping  they are ac with battery backup after a couple of hours of troubleshooting i went out and bough name brand  v   it was obvious that they connectors were slightly longer than the amazon ones and all the detectors worked perfectly after that i am extremely annoyed   i d assume that  v is a standard batter   never seen anything like thisin the end amazon did refund this purchase   so for that reason ill still give it   stars to be fair   they stand behind the product and did make it right     
201,4.0 ,                       i have been purchasing the   pack of amazon   volt batteries  each spring for years to keep fresh ones in my smoke detectors and co detector   they have always worked out great  but this year i had a slight problem   the batteries are just slightly longer than in previous years  making it difficult to get them seated properly in the tight battery compartment of the detectors   i actually had to use a thin bladed screwdriver to force them into place   other than that  they work and are a good value for the   pack  which is just the right number for my needs      
202,1.0 ,                       not the solution for smoke detectors if you are considering buying these as a economical power sources for smoke detectors  keep looking my wife and i adopted the pattern of changing out   volt batteries in each of our smoke detectors when we change the clocks for daylight savings   it s a bit of a nuisance  but i hate standing in a hallway trying to determine where the beeping is coming from   do it all at once  get it done  don t have to think about it again but after several years  i can attest  many of these amazon   volt batteries don t even last the six months   so yes  for the third time this month  they re supposed to last till next month   i ve been wakened by the beeping of an alarm with a weak battery   better find a better manufacturer  amazon   in the meantime  the rest of us better find a better battery      
203,5.0 ,                       this is a great price for    v batteries  you can t find this pricing at any store   they were shipped in a couple of days  and the packaging was ideal   i highly recommend this product      
204,2.0 ,                       wrapping each individual battery in plastic is really annoying  this packaging is not frustration free  besides that the batteries work fine      
205,5.0 ,                       i use these in a tens pain control unit that i wear at work for    hours shifts   ive tried ever ready  duracell and rayovacs    i do well to get a shift and a half on these before i have to replace the batteries  the amazon ones last three days and i still have some charge to use at home on my days off   hands down better because im not having to worry about them going out and keeping spares on hand and they are saving me money      
206,1.0 ,                       we got these for our smoke detectors  we literally almost bought all new hardwored devices for our home because these suckers have been chirping in various spots around our home for the last year and we are on the brink of insanity  however  we popped name brand ones in on a whim and bam  no problems  we love all of the other amazon batteries but these ones are no good      
207,1.0 ,                       i have tried using   of these   volt amazonbasics everyday alkaline batteries and they only lasted   to    days each in my smoke alarms  the expiration date isn t until      so that s not the problem  next  i put brand name batteries into to make sure that the alarms weren t faulty  problem solved   the amazonbasic batteries were the problem   safety requires that i go back to brand names batteries  i will not trust these batteries      
208,5.0 ,                       these were the same cost as two of the name brand in the store  after over a month of continual use of a lazer thermomoter  the first battery still has plenty of juice      
209,5.0 ,                       i usually purchase my batteries from a large discount warehouse  however  these amazon basics   volt seem to be the best value i can find  i have found   volt batteries for cheaper but they have been absolute crap and a complete waste of money  they have lasted me as long as   volt batteries     times the cost      
210,5.0 ,                       i purchase them for our church microphones   we use an average of three for each service   you don t realize the monetary savings until you look at the difference from receipts in short period      
211,2.0 ,                       i do not recommend these for smoke alarms i split these with two of my kids so so three of our houses could change our smoke detector batteries we each had an issue with one orr more of the alarms beeping after a few hours  which is a dead battery indicator  we all have different brand alarms too however  we also used these in some remote controlers  and they worked fine      
212,5.0 ,                       i switch over from buying name brand batteries and i actually feel these are just as good if not better  the packaging is simple  the last a long time and the price is right      
213,5.0 ,                       love amazon brand batteries  they are very affordable and last a long time  i always forget to buy batteries so getting them here next day it amazing and so is the price      
214,5.0 ,                       i am so glad amazon ships basic necessities at reasonable prices  the battery worked perfectly for our smoke alarm  i can t speak to the life of the batteries  as i ve only just received them  but will update the review if i find anything negative in the future      
215,5.0 ,                       the amazon basics batteries are a great deal as my practice has come to expect from amazon  these batteries can hold up just as well as the major brands dr rick wagner california     
216,5.0 ,                       first battery  turned hot tried the second battery  same thing  this seems very dangerous so am not planning to use or order again later  it appears that there was a faulty connection in the scales  which is a problem with the scales and not with the batteries  therefore  i m changing my rating from one star to   stars      
217,1.0 ,                       i needed to replace a  v battery today  i bought eight of them less than a year ago  i ve kept them in their original shrink wrap packaging and kept in a cool closet in my house  every single  v battery has lost most of its charge and my tester says they all are drained  these are the most useless batteries i ve ever purchased  what is the refund policy on these batteries      
218,5.0 ,                       fairly recently bought a    pack and have used them for everything from smoke detectors to reviving several long lost measurement tools  probably too early for me to comment on longevity  but i have had beyond excellent results with amazon basics c  aa    aaa      
219,5.0 ,                       great product  i put it on my smoke alarms each battery is packaged separately in plastic which is hard to tear which is a little frustrating if you have    smoke alarms       
220,4.0 ,                       most of the batteries worked as expected but one of them exploded a few days after being installed in a smoke detector     
221,1.0 ,                       put one of these in a smoke detector and dated the battery  now   months later  the detector is beeping indicating it needs replacement already  i checked the battery on a volt meter and it is only putting out   volts compared to the   volts when new this battery died way to fast for use in a device like a smoke detector  i cannot be replacing these every two months      
222,5.0 ,                       i have been buying these over the duracell s from costco simply because it s convenient to order from amazon  these seem to last just about as long  can t go wrong with many of the  amazon basics  products      
223,1.0 ,                       i bought these   volt batteries for our smoke detectors and they did not fit   i actually bought a new smoke detector thinking it was defective but all along it was the batteries   i usually read reviews but since we have had luck with the aa batteries  i assumed these would be good as well   bottom line    always read reviews before you buy      
224,3.0 ,                       i bought a big box of  v batteries so i would have them around when needed  i kept them in desk drawer    years on i found that they had all gone bad  these don t keep so it doesn t pay to stock up them  buy them as needed      
225,5.0 ,                       i don t know many items that still use   volt batteries  in our household  its only all the smoke alarms scattered around the house in awkward hard to reach locations  these smoke alarms seem to beep randomly at   am to let me know its battery might be low  so i purchased these to replace all the smoke alarm batteries in my house to stop the beeping  after replacing all the batteries  and i finally laid down to rest  i learned that i had more smoke alarms than i thought as i still heard beeping      
226,1.0 ,                       i purchased these batteries to have on hand for my smoke alarms  we used them today to replace batteries in   units  the battery only worked in one out of seven      in comparing the amazon batteries to the previous duracell batteries  it is obvious that the terminals are ever so slightly shorter   thus not making proper contact in the smoke alarms and causing them to beep after installation  i m very disappointed with the amazon batteries      
227,1.0 ,                       sorry to say these seem to be a huge disappointment  bought for smoke alarms and i am getting beep alerts each night from different smoke alarms  cannot be      sure  the blame belongs here but never had this issue with other batteries      
228,1.0 ,                       i tried these batteries in exterior motion detectors which are a part of our security system   the name brand batteries previously used provided a usable life span of well over two years   these  basic  batteries gave up the ghost in only a few months   don t waste your    on these and definitely don t bet your life on them by using them in smoke detectors or other life saving device      
229,1.0 ,                       i am replacing these batteries in my smoke detectors every few months because they just dont last since my smoke detectors are monitored for battery life by the security company there have been   instances where the battery i put in new registered as dead immediately while the price was great they just arent really worth anything due to the fact they dont last      
230,4.0 ,                       the price was great and they work fine  but they came in a box approx   x   inches   it was like a jewelry box made of cardboard  you lift the lid and the batteries are in a small cut out in the center      x   inches   this was a ridiculous amount of packaging      
231,5.0 ,                       they make my tongue tingle real good     
232,1.0 ,                       wow    do not use these batteries in your smoke detectors or any other device that could save your life  i had these amazon basics batteries in my smoke detector and the battery bloated so much it split the label  also had one of the battery contacts fall off  sorry  but this has never happened with other reputable brands  nope  this issue wasn t the smoke detector because i cleaned up the mess this battery left behind and put in a quality battery and it s working fine i m just thankful i caught this issue  never again        
233,4.0 ,                       seem to be good alkaline batteries for a reasonable price my only complaint is packaging related  the cardboard box these came in is quite superior to the plastic molded packaging of other  v cells  unfortunately though  each individual cell is shrink wrapped in a thin hard plastic that covers both terminals and is surprisingly difficult to remove completely  presumably this is to prevent shorting  which i fully support i was using these in smoke detectors  so i considered simply cutting the entire top of the plastic   but it ended up being just thick enough to prevent installation in my application  so i had to remove all of the wrapping  which took quite some time      
234,5.0 ,                       like a lot of amazon products  these are a fantastic deal  the  volt  aa and aaa batteries typically outlast energizer and duracell batteries in the most recent  prosumer  youtube comparison videos  if that means anything  i ve purchased and used a lot of amazon s batteries in extremely cold and extremely hot climates and have never had a single issue with leaked caps or sub par life expectancy  i find amazon batteries to be dependable and hope they continue to remain this way      
235,5.0 ,                       bought these to replace all the batteries in our smoke detectors  no more low battery beeping makes me a happy camper   these seem to be just as good as name brand batteries  and at a better price      
236,1.0 ,                       battery do not hold charge while awaiting use  most competitor products last    years with out affecting performance  had to discard   of the which i consider unacceptable      
237,4.0 ,                       the batteries work fine  and they ve kept my fire alarms going for weeks  but the size of the box they come in is mind boggling   why do four   volt batteries need to be packaged in a box larger than a cigar box   it s a waste of materials      
238,1.0 ,                       further confirming my bias against packaging engineers everywhere  these  v batteries are shrink wrapped in a manner that they cannot be opened without a tool   and the nearest tool is almost always something conductive  making the exercise nerve wracking   additionally  as with the many of the other one star reviewers  the smoke detector into which this battery was placed began warning of a low battery after about    hours of service   disappointment all around      
239,2.0 ,                       they seem to put out a lot of power in the beginning then fade down and put out less later on and they don t last as long as say duracell imo  but they are cheap      
240,4.0 ,                       amazon basics   volt alkaline battery   pack   can t beat the value and packaging  as reported by other buyers  the very slightly oversize dimensions make it too big for devices with tight fitting battery compartments  there were more of those than i expected  great where they do fit      
241,4.0 ,                       batteries are great and last as long as the other brand names  however  the individual batteries are ridiculously hard to unwrap  i am    with no arthritis  yet  at least  and it s just stupid hard and time consuming to open each one  especially when in a rush  which is usually the case in my situation   please fix      
242,1.0 ,                       it was     am on a saturday and i was rudely awoken from my slumber to the familiar chirping sound of my smoke detector  no cause for concern as there was no fire  but alas  the battery was low  which always occurs at the most inopportune time  i  being somewhat of an adult  went to the drawer of random essentials everyone has in their kitchen and pulled out a brand new  v amazon basics battery  still half asleep with one eye open i precariously teetered on my step stool  reached for the ceiling  and replaced the battery  making sure to turn it the proper way  i latched the unit back to the ceiling and as i was getting off the step stool    chirp   imagine my distain  so  i got in my car and drove to rite aid  the only store open at this hour during a pandemic  and bought a pack of duracell  v s for double this price  and guess what  they worked  so save yourself a disgruntled drive to rite aid at  am and just buy the good batteries  it is worth your sanity      
243,1.0 ,                       i ordered these in december      to make sure i had some on hand  the smoke detector just started beeping so i installed a new one  it kept beeping so i checked the new battery i had just taken the wrapper off  dead  so i got another  dead  and another  dead  they were all dead  so now i m going to the store to get batteries that i thought i had on hand because i  saved myself some time  and ordered them from amazon  it s not worth the effort to return them  just beware      
244,5.0 ,                       used for my smoke detectors that i have throughout the house and garage   very happy with them   i don t know how long they will last  but from all indications    they will be every bit as good as rayovac or duracells   if i find that they don t last  i ll update my review at that time      
245,1.0 ,                       i bought an   pack for       the first thing i didn t like about these were they were individually wrapped in plastic  what a pia to get each individual one unwrappedsecondly and more importantly  i use a tens unit on the same setting practically      ea  day as soon as i purchased these i started tracking the amount of time these batteries lasted because i go through one   volt battery pretty much daily  i would start a fresh battery time and date stamp it in my phone   st one lasted    hrs  i was pleased with that knowing how much power my tens unit draws on constant  i thought that wasn t bad however the second battery i timed when i put it in  again on the exact same setting  it lasted       hours  huge inconsistency  i m on my third one today it s been on about   hours and i can feel the battery is dying  you may get a few in the bunch that last   times longer then others     hrs was the longest and it s been all down hill from there  spent the extra money  don t listen to the reviews unless it s for something like a smoke detector  i will not be purchasing these again  i feel i got ripped off  now i have a pack of    duracell procell   volts on the way after tax costing me    dollars after tax  don t go cheap if it s a decide that draws a lot of power  the ones that say  specifically made for tens units are even worse  i ve learned my lesson  duracell is the only   volt battery i will get in the future      
246,2.0 ,                       i bought these as replacements for my tens unit batteries as i tend to go through a lot of batteries when my back is acting up  the last time i bought  v batteries i got      duracell procell   volt batteries  pack of                           which lasted me about    months  when i was on my last battery in the pack  i went to buy more  v and saw the amazon basics  since i have had generally good luck with amazon basics products and the price was lower  i decided to try the   pack and figured i d be back in    or so months for more  it was july   th when i got the   pack and i used my first one about   weeks ago  i just had to change that one out today barely a month after i bought the pack and after only   weeks of using it  the box the batteries are in is easy open but the batteries themselves are anything but easy  each battery is individually shrinkwrapped in tight plastic that was difficult to remove without a knife or scissors  so from just over a month of use  based on my experience  i will be back to buy more batteries in about   months  it ll be the    pack of duracell procells that i buy then  i didn t notice a size difference in  my tens unit and never thought to compare since they fit the compartment but after reading the other reviews  i d steer clear and go with something else      
247,1.0 ,                       i would rather buy something i know works good like duracell   i trusted amazon and thought they would not promote and sell cheap stuff with their name on it  but i was totally wrong  i bought these batteries for using it in my wight scale  a regular duracell would last about     months on average vs the first battery out of box lasted for a couple of weeks only  i thought it may just be one that was bad  but the second one of the box lasted for about one week  again i didn t lose hope  but the third one i put in for usage did not even work  i am on the fourth one out of the box in less than   months  i think these total   would not last anywhere close to what duracell s one battery lasts i will not consider buying amazon brand again or dont recommend it to anyone  not sure if its even worth asking for refund as i have used half of the batteries out of the pack      
248,5.0 ,                       i bought these for my carbon monoxide detector  these were cheaper than the duracell batteries at the dollar store  so far  one of these has lasted five months  per dollar spent  that s about as good  and the amazon battery will probably last at least a little longer      
249,5.0 ,                       the batteries come in a tightly packaged cardboard box  there are   of them  each battery is also individually wrapped in plastic film  i can t speak to their life as i m using them as replacement for the smoke detector  but in my previous experience with these batteries   well they haven t run out yet so i think it s pretty good i don t have a picture but they are exactly the same as the ones on amazon page      
250,2.0 ,                       have used amazon batteries in the past with no problems   maybe this was a bad batch   several batteries did not work  but even worse  got really hot   if i didn t pull them out  i don t know what would happen   fire maybe   returned for refund      
251,4.0 ,                       got these for various things and they seem to hold up nicely  only time will tell and if they don t last i ll update but if they do then i ll say so too      
252,5.0 ,                       these were a steal for the amount you get and the price paid i needed them for my children s metal detectors and they have worked great so far i am happy with my purchase  the fast shipping  and quality of the batteries  i plan to continue to use amazonbasics batteries for my future battery needs      
253,5.0 ,                       good for the price  they won t win any awards for longevity  they are just your average batteries  i have been using them in my smoke alarms  i change them every six months  they have never gone dead  i m able to reuse them in my dvoms and other tools that require   volt batteries      
254,1.0 ,                       these are the worst   volt batteries i ve ever bought  don t buy the get name brand batteries   these only last about   to   weeks in a very low power using device      
255,5.0 ,                       worst batteries ever  idk how they are   stars at all   stay away  this was your warning   let s put it this way  they re worse than the dollar tree batteries   just go buy those instead  you re better off these batteries will drain and not lost long   i ve gone through an entire box in   year     i  comparison  the dollar tree batteries would last me    years   how is this possible      
256,1.0 ,                       i bought these at the end of august and have burnt through the entire   pack as of december  st  i bought these solely for use in the keypad on my garage door  the previous energizer in the transmitter lasted about three years  i won t be buying amazonbasics batteries again      
257,4.0 ,                        v batteries are those batteries that just about everything runs off of that you don t realize  most importantly your smoke detectors  when the batteries die in those things it drives my dogs crazy with the random little chirps  rather than just running to the nearby big box store to buy like two  it s handy to have a large collection of them      
258,2.0 ,                       i purchased these batteries on july         to replace our smoke detector batteries   yesterday  november           two smoke detectors began chirping because of low batteries   today  november           the third smoke detector began chirping because of low battery   these batteries lasted four months when other batteries have lasted well over a year in the same smoke detectors      
259,1.0 ,                       they do not fiti tried them on my digital clock  no fil   buy duracelldid not fit for my safe did not fit on my remote     
260,4.0 ,                       they re batteries  and they work   came in a frustration free box  and that s good   however  there is clear cellophane wrapping on each battery that is rather difficult to remove  instead of using  caps  on the batteries as some other bulk brands do      
261,5.0 ,                       i purchase these batteries for my home s smoke detectors   a package of   perfectly replaces all my smoke detectors at once   great value      
262,1.0 ,                       i bought a hand sanitizer dispenser and had to buy some  v batteries for it  i bought this amazon branded batteries  however  the size of this battery is too short  it won t fit  i tried to use it on my home smoke detector but it wouldn t fit either  i don t think if i can use these for anything because of its size      
263,1.0 ,                       i purchased these to replace all the batteries in my smoke detectors  they lasted   days until all my smoke alarms were going off at  am because the batteries died  i ve also purchased the amazon aaa and aa batteries and they also do not last longer than     weeks      
264,2.0 ,                       while i like the designs using six  aaaa  batteries as done by a leading  copper hatted  brand  compared to the plastic cell design of others   it does no good when the spot welds connecting the cells are substandard  i had one battery so far that was  dead on arrival  so i dissected it to find if it had leaked or otherwise self discharged   i found a tab between the cells was not properly spot welded and was not making contact   while this quality issue is of little importance for non critical  applications  i was using these for battery operated smoke detectors  what if a tab pops off randomly after a successful test  poor weld pops due to normal thermal cycling   such a simple quality issue could lead to injury death at least i now have six aaaa batteries for my pen light      
265,1.0 ,                       i should have red the reviews  but who would think that you would need to when buying  v batteries     they are taller than a normal  v  by a good     of an inch  and do not fit in any of the smoke detectors in my house    which are now all going off  since they are all connected  and one of the batteries is dead   now i have to run out to the store to buy more  real  v batteries so this beeping noise does not drive me mad   do not buy these batteries    how hard is it to make batteries that are the proper size      i normally love the amazon brand products  but these suck      
266,1.0 ,                       the battery i have received is with white label on them  not as it shown in the listing photo   the wrapping on some batteries were torn  tells me basically i received their old inventory batteries      
267,1.0 ,                       it used to be easy to return amazon products at a nearby amazon locker for free  now they require a trip downtown or to pay to return  the return charge almost equals the purchase price  i will not by this type of goods from amazon again   they are backing off of their past excellent customer service  foolish when it is so easy to buy elsewhere      
268,1.0 ,                       i bought these last year  thinking i got a really good deal   in january       i put them in some of my fire alarms on ceiling   one of them started chirping  on july   th        that is only   months of use on a fire alarm that does not drain much power   i took a duracell out of another alarm and had put it in there november of        still working great   that s     years    i know i m supposed to change every year  but  really  they chirp when they are dying  besides that  i have them in every room two in hall  so surely several of those will be working properly       
269,2.0 ,                       i was trying to use these in my new paintball gun pe geo tech    r and these things could not make it work  huge aggravation figuring that out why my new gun wasn t working with brand new batteries in it   turns out these batteries just suck  stick with the name brands     
270,4.0 ,                       they re  v batteries  good price  i like the packaging with duracell procell batteries however  the plastic inserts which protect the positive and negative terminals on the duracell are a good addition  that are not on the amazon basic batteries  the packaging in a rather awkwardly square box in which the batteries are stacked on top of one another rather than size by side   in other words  more space required for storage will probably by the duracell s when they go on sale again given the differences in the packaging and the plastic terminal protectors      
271,5.0 ,                       absolutely fantastic   v batteries are pretty expensive from the store and the work great in my smoke detectors   a few people said they were longer then a typical  v but that was not my experience   i compared it to the old energizer and they were the same length    ie it fit the smoke detector just fine      
272,1.0 ,                       i m using this battery in my fire alarm  this is actually smoke and co detector  i change my previous battery after a wile and when i start using this battery  after a week start showing battery low      
273,5.0 ,                       best value battery i could find  excellent longevity at great cost  couldn t find a better performing battery this will be my new must have      
274,1.0 ,                       within two days of receiving these batteries i had two batteries explode sitting on my dining table  i m sure explode may not be the correct term for it  i heard a weird fizzle sound from the batteries  when i went to touch them i had two of them that were extremely hot to the touch  almost to the point of burning my fingers   i requested a refund and am throwing the others away  i would not trust these in anything i own extremely disappointed          
275,5.0 ,                       wasn t sure what to expect with these but i need to run   of them in my metal detector and they seem to be lasting  i ve read that i should under normal circumstances be able to run my detector for       hours with out head phones and i know i m over that so longevity doesn t seem to be an issue with these batteries  other then that they are batteries and i don t know what else to rate them on      
276,1.0 ,                       after i discovered it did not fit in my electric guitar i went back and found a one star review that said did not fit an electric bass  height of terminals is ok  standard  but the battery box itself is a bit taller and thicker  so it does not fit some battery compartments  such as my taylor guitar   very annoying as all other battery brands fit just fine  disappointed in amazon research which is usually quite good      
277,1.0 ,                       i guess i should have read reviews but the batteries didn t even last a month in a smoke detector  started chirping after   weeks  amazon needs to look into their quality control  i requested refund     
278,5.0 ,                       i did a subscribe and save on these so that i could replace my smoke detector batteries every   months  i think that was a little overkill but it is nice having the peace of mind and knowing that i won t wake up in the middle of the night to that annoying beeping  these fit well in the detectors and seem to last as long as i need them  the price is right too      
279,5.0 ,                       i purchased an   pack to replace in my   smoke detectors  my smoke detectors are all hardwired in and the battery is a backup in my particular detectors  i see several reviews about them failing and while they ve only been in for a few days and are back up  i haven t experienced any issues with this yet  i also didn t have any issues with these fitting into my detectors  first alert brand   should any issues arise  i ll certainly update the review  one thing to note  however  and this isn t really a negative so much as it was just unexpected  is all of the batteries i received are tightly wrapped individually in plastic wrap  likely to protect them from making contact with one another  so if you have several to use you ll need something small and sharp to unwrap them      
280,5.0 ,                       going thru our emergency supplies as hurricane season approaches noticed we had every battery necessary but the   volts  these are good quality  reasonably priced and were exactly what we needed   an easy size to over look but one that quite a few things we have require      
281,1.0 ,                       not very good quality  the battery terminal fell off and the battery leaked all over  there was about   other batteries in the package with the same issue  make sure you check them over well after receiving  i m past my return window so am out of luck      
282,5.0 ,                       works great   do not waste money on brand names   these work just fine   not a huge fan of the packaging  but they work and that is the root of what matters      
283,1.0 ,                       the first battery i pulled from the package lasted less than    hours   i purchased these for the remote to my ceiling fan  which is getting no use currently during march    i was hoping it was one defective battery but when i grabbed another one from the pack   same deal except this time i paid closer attention and it ran out of juice in under   hours   i think its safe to say these are junk and a waste of money   hopefully if you buy these   you will get a pack that actually works      
284,5.0 ,                       i strongly dislike this item  i purchased the batteries for my smoke detector and they ve lasted less than   month  after the month the smoke detector began to beep  i installed a new battery thinking it was a faulty battery but this other battery didn t even last    hours  i m extremely disappointed with amazon and their product  i expected better results      
285,4.0 ,                       i will be using this batteries for a smoke detector  i unwrapped two and measured them with a voltometer  the voltage is excellent at     and      however i took one or perhaps should take two stars off because they re extremely hard to open  it took me and my expensive  spyderco pocket knife quite a long time to cut through the shrinkwrap  i think they could do a lot better job of that      
286,5.0 ,                       these batteries work about as well as the name brands  i haven t done a scientific study to prove that  so maybe they are not quite as good as an energizer max  but they are half the price  and probably     as good   for something like a smoke detector  you are supposed to change out the battery after one year  and when i changed out one of these  i measured the old one with a battery meter  and it still showed in the  green  zone  that s good enough for me      
287,5.0 ,                       these alkalines are way cheaper than duracell or energizer  and still cheaper than rayovacs   i use them for smoke detector batteries that get replaced and tossed after   year anyway   these are a good option for that use   in general  all amazon basic batteries are a good choice      
288,2.0 ,                       i tested the batteries on the day they arrived  and they varied from    v to    v  only two batteries were above  v  and the rest were     or lower my smoke alarms in my new home start chirping at  v  so getting batteries that are mostly already too low to use in my devices was a drag      
289,2.0 ,                       i bought these in march waiting to replace my smoke detector batteries  today i tried to replace them and    of them didn t work   you know how hard it is to get the latter out and climb it   times   well  when   of them didn t work it was a major disappointment   and amazon will not do anything about it      
290,1.0 ,                       my device calls for   v alkaline batteries and i purchased   packs of   amazon   v alkaline batteries  the amazon   v alkaline batteries don t work in my device  my device just refused to turn on  amazon states that this item is not returnable or refundable  i placed a new order for rayovac   v alkaline batteries that do work in my device the amazon   v battery does work in my garage door opener  but be aware for some reason they do not work in all devices that require   v alkaline batteries follow up  the amazon   v battery quit in my garage opener in less than    days  amazon  why don t you accept the return for credit on these degective batteries      
291,1.0 ,                       put battery in smoke detector  starting beeping in less than    hours   put another in a new device  only shows one bar of battery life out of five upon installation   i didn t expect these to be as good as the major brands  but thought they d do better than this   will probably try to send them all back  as one would expect better than one day in a smoke detector where other brands go at least a year      
292,5.0 ,                       it s hard to believe these necessary batteries are so spendy   my renters neglected almost every smoke detector in a   bedroom house  they were all missing     thank you amazon for having a more reasonable priced product and bulk availability   we re   months in and so far no chirps      
293,1.0 ,                       i bought these for the smoke detectors in the house and other various electronics  however  they are a complete waste of money  i put on in a smoke detector and it started chirping the very next day  do not waste your money  buy real batteries      
294,1.0 ,                       i ordered these about     weeks ago  and immediately used one to replace a smoke alarm battery   two nights ago my wife and i were awoken about      am by a smoke alarm   it was the one i replaced  and it was the same battery i haven t tried the others yet  except for the one i just replaced  but so far we are   for     if it turns out to be a   off  i ll update this review      
295,1.0 ,                       i bought these for an alarm clock to work using the battery if the power goes out  unfortunately when the power went out the battery was already dead  not great for the price      
296,5.0 ,                       the verdict for longevity is still out as i just replaced my smoke detector batteries with these  the packaging and the way they were securely placed in the box with extra wrapping creates a professional look  also it s you can t beat a price like these      
297,1.0 ,                       i purchased these batteries for use in smoke alarms  i installed them as soon as i received them  as of january             of the   batteries had to be replaced  i have had good luck in the past with batteries purchased from amazon  but this time i should have paid closer attention to the reviews      
298,5.0 ,                       i tried amazonbasics batteries   or   years ago  since then that s all i buy  i ve been very satisfied with the price  quality and lifespan  i even buy the amazonbasics lithium cr   a  v batteries because they ve worked so well and the price is reasonable i wish they made button cell batteries too  depending on the supplier it can really be hit or miss      
299,4.0 ,                       how is every battery packaged in individual plastic frustration free   ships in certified frustration free packaging  is not an accurate claim for this item i bent my fingernail back accidentally multiple times unwrapping the batteries  i used scissors first to create an opening in the plastic   i could not imagine having to fight with the packaging in the middle of the night when a smoke detector battery is low and the detector is chirping no issue with the size of these batteries as others have experienced      
300,5.0 ,                       bit the strongest  v battery but i guess i get what i pay for      
301,5.0 ,                       yeah they re just batteries  the box came with them all nicely tucked in  i did try to put one in a smoke detector before taking off the shrinkwrap which was so tight i couldn t see it  best price though for   batteries i use amazon aas in my game controllers and while their longevity is      you get so many for a good price that i don t mind      
302,5.0 ,                       when you need a  v  your house will literally scream at you until you get a new one for a big price gouge in a   or   pack i have individually wrapped  vs that come in a nice package for years    and it doesn t cost much more than that one emergency trip would cost  let alone the cost to replace the fire alarm you ripped out of the wall and smashed with a hammer  then got a bigger hammer and smashed it again just buy them  fire alarms only go off in the middle of the night  all night before a big day at work  save your career with a few dollars of advance preparation      
303,5.0 ,                       these  v are really nice and work great  these are my go to now for  v batteries  as a bass player  i use a ton of  v batteries for my active basses and my pedals  i buy a box of these and just keep it in my gig bag  the boxes the batteries come in are really nice and sturdy and make a great way to keep them organized in your bag  additionally  each battery is individually wrapped in plastic which is great if you want to store them loose  the plastic wrapping also helps you identify a used or new battery in a pinch  nothing worse than having a pile of batteries and not know which ones are used  fast delivery from amazon as well      
304,1.0 ,                       i recently went to change the batteries in my co    smoke detectors with these  when i tested the alarms suddenly none were working  i opened them back up to check if the battery wasn t seated properly  they were in properly however the batteries themselves were scorching hot  i immediately removed the batteries from the detectors but they remained extremely hot  because of the battery issue i had to run out and purchase a new co  detector because i was afraid that the heat from the battery may have damaged it  this happened with multiple batteries from the box  clearly some sort of defect and a dangerous one at that      
305,4.0 ,                       pros  price for   pack  it did increase    since july        small  convenient storage box same batteries  last purchased  july         received    months of use in my first alert smoke detectors  seems normal  my home has six detectors   a little less time in an infrared temperature gun  and even less outdoors in yard irrigation control  probably due to se usa heat and humidity causing terminals to corrode  expiration date on this pack           see very small print on bottom of each battery  i added the red dot to the image  i use so many  typically shop for price at the time these seem to meet my needs and have not yet had a malfunctioncons  the picture shows copper color casing  mine were white as in the pic posted other thoughts  almost bought the ac delco until i dug deep into a few reviews     
306,1.0 ,                       i purchased this   pack of batteries in november of      so they re just a bit over a year old  one of my smoke detectors just started to beep so i went to replace the amazon basics battery with a new one  i had   left of the    none of them are now any good  none worked in the smoke detector  which i tested with a good battery from another unit  so i will caution any potential buyers  good deal if you plan on using them all quickly    but they don t hold a charge while in storage  perhaps the new ones are better    i see that they re a different color  just don t get the white ones  can i no longer trust any batteries from amazon       
307,1.0 ,                       used them for carbon monoxide detector   detector continued to indicate low battery when i put a new battery in the detector   my experince with amazon basics this time and previous times  is that they way below standard and useless they act like repackaged rejects      
308,3.0 ,                       each battery is wrapped in heat seal plastic  its kind of pointless and wasteful  the batteries themselves didn t have very long life  but it could be user error on my part because our smoke detectors are older  i wrote the review anyway because i think amazon should stop packaging the batteries in individual plastic  its single use  not recyclable and very bad for the environment      
309,5.0 ,                       love the price for these  stores love overcharging and the amount you get here makes this worth its weight in gold  especially when you have annoying smoke detectors beeping on an hourly basis and driving your wife insane  ive never spent better money in my life to keep the sanity  get these batteries and keep your marriage happy      
310,5.0 ,                       these come individually wrapped which is nice as we found out from previous batteries that the ends should not touch each other or they can get very hot  love the quality of these and especially the price      
311,1.0 ,                       warning this is a very small small sponge  nothing like the picture   even the shape is different   i tried to return and they don t respond   fits a childs hand  not for adults they show a picture of a rectangular sponge   this is not rectangular but curvey   bad description misleading picture      
312,5.0 ,                       have become a big fan of the amazonbasic batteries  a lot of the comparable cheaper batteries such as sony ones are so light you wonder how long they will really run  these have a nice weight to them and are great quality  if they last as long as the aaa and aa ones i ve both then they ll be great      
313,2.0 ,                       bummed that it is past the return date   i got   new smoke detectors in my home and put these in   they worked for about   months  so i put another battery in and it gives you that annoying smoke detector beep every few minutes letting you know the battery is low   so not only did the ones i originally put in them died out fast  the ones that were not even used died as well   amazon is great for many things  but i have discovered  not for batteries   sorry      
314,5.0 ,                       needed this for my schlage door lock and working great so far  compared to the cost of duracell and energizer  i am happy with the value these batteries provide      
315,4.0 ,                       this is nice to get so you have some on hand  i always forget about   volts until the smoke detector starts chirping or the power goes out and my alarm clock is messed up  these are great for the value and have enough in them to remember to change them regularly      
316,1.0 ,                       great price but they don t last  we ve gone through these like water  we use them in our smoke detectors and after a little over a year with this   pack we have one left  and they seem to always start chirping in the middle of the night      
317,5.0 ,                       these stopped my smoke alarms from beeping constantly which was actually stressing me out and making my nerves go bad  i m really sensitive to noises especially loud or surprising ones and popping these into my   smoke alarms through my house that were all beeping loud at random saved me a headache and my nerves these seem to last quite a while too  i put some in like   months ago and the smoke alarms still haven t began beeping even after a couple power outages update  several months later  these batteries are still working great and haven t had to be replaced  even in the digital outdoor garage opener that is powered by     volt battery  very impressive performance for alkaline batteries      
318,1.0 ,                       had to give this one star because it won t let you give any less than that  these batteries are awful   the first one or two i used lasted a couple of weeks at best  then i went to use one the other day and it was completely dead  i tested the rest of them and they were all dead  wish i would have tested them sooner so i could get a refund      
319,1.0 ,                       i had ordered quite a few more batteries than i needed  relying on the batteries to have the shelf life that was advertised  those batteries are now dead and i had to order more recently and throw away more than half of the quantity of   volt  aa  and aaa batteries  they are reasonably priced but don t count on the shelf life being accurate        
320,5.0 ,                       used to buy the expensive brands for batteries  saw amazon brand and tried them   they are usually much less than the big names and so far have worked just as well mostly use these in kids toys and smoke detectors  i change them once a year and only have had one start to beep a few weeks before when i usually change then pretty sure i won t be buying other brands and will stick with these      
321,1.0 ,                       i purchased these batteries   months ago to replace all my smoke alarm batteries in the house   all the smoke alarms have since started beeping due to low battery   the first one was just a week after installation   very disappointed in these      
322,5.0 ,                       i used to buy my batteries at costco or sam s club   once i saw that amazon sells batteries and that i can get them in one or two days i decided to try them out   so far no complaints and they have lasted just as long as the name brand or club brand batteries   i used these for some of my kids toys and smoke detectors      
323,1.0 ,                       i purchased these batteries for our church worship band since i had good experiences with amazon products in the past   the oversized battery nearly ruined a taylor guitar and wouldn t even fit into the shaft of our cordless microphone   don t buy these batteries and risk ruining your equipment      
324,1.0 ,                       battery was too big  how can a  v battery be any bigger than every other  v battery on the market  wouldn t fit in my guitar  got stuck for a while   maybe ok for other devices where a tight fit isn t an issue      
325,4.0 ,                       i bought the batteries for my hard wired photoelectric smoke alarms  some of the batteries did not work on the smoke alarms and they kept signaling a low battery condition by chirping  i contacted amazon and they gave me a refund  i am satisfied with the customer service and the no hassle return policy of amazon  i bought the batteries on december      and the batteries had a shelf life date of          that s approximately a   year shelf life  the batteries are good  however  they did not serve my purpose  smoke alarms are finicky about which batteries will work  many times the batteries are still good when the smoke alarms signal a low battery condition by chirping  don t be quick to throw them away  you may use them on other devices  if you are buying these batteries for smoke alarms  then i suggest that you purchase other batteries and consult your smoke alarm manual or website and you can find out which batteries are recommended      
326,1.0 ,                       i installed these flesh  batteries on my test meters   but couple weeks later when i tried to use them and they won t turn on   the batteries were dead   totally useless   don t waste your money      
327,5.0 ,                       so we purchased the amazon brand batteries on a whim because we were too lazy to venture out in      weather here in north dakota this past winter so we ordered these online hoping they would last in until the weather warmed up for us to get out of hibernation and get to the store to buy them  wouldn t you know it  these darn batteries lasted longer then duracell or energizer    guess i won t be running to the store for batteries ever again      
328,1.0 ,                       i purchased these on             used one  it s now one year   one day later  i went to use another one    all of them are dead  i ve never had batteries with such a short shelf life      
329,5.0 ,                       if your order these    your smoker detector will stop beeping because of its incessant need for a new battery  all you have to do is put one of these suckers in and like bam    silence  peace  calm  remembered  and lived  do yourself a favor  if you need  volts for your smoke detectors  stay stocked and get a year   out of these slick bad boys  or    you know use any other brand name  volt and you should have your dire situation resolved note  not tested on any other product than smoke detectors  results may vary        
330,1.0 ,                       these  v batteries were delivered on september          i installed one ina smoke detector soon after  it s october   th       at     hrs  i m now out of bed changing out the battery in said smoke detector to stop satin s bird from chirping  it lasted less than    days in a smoke detector that should have been good for at least a year      
331,5.0 ,                       bought these in the beginning of this year and they are still going strong  before buying these  i bought another brand and those didn t last very long  they work great in my fire detectors and my battery powered led light  no issues with the battery dying yet      
332,2.0 ,                       i trust amazon and feel a bit taken advantage of i have a smoke detector that started chirping and needed a battery replacement  the smoke detector is on the ceiling of a seventeen foot great room  i managed to pull out the old battery and put in a  brand new amazon  basic nine volt  didn t work  climbed down and climbed back up with another  didn t work  finally  the third battery did work  now i wonder how much juice it has left in it  i had seen reviews of similar problems and figured they were just a rare instance  i expect better from amazon      
333,3.0 ,                       i use all sizes of amazon s rechargable batteries  they work great   however  i bought these  v for my hard wired smoke detectors  and they lasted less than two years   that matters since ever single one of my   smoke detector batteries die during the middle of the night  thereby setting off the high decibel alarm until replaced will not buy again  duracell longlife works better  lasts longer  worth the few bucks extra      
334,3.0 ,                       ordered item did not use for about one month  upon checking voltage was below   volts   installed battery in test meter and is still working  i do not how long battery will last  usually new batteries have over   volts  i did check voltage with two different volt meters      
335,5.0 ,                       these were cheaper than any i found at local stores they have held up very well i m happy with the purchase     
336,2.0 ,                       these didn t even last a year in smoke detectors whatever other batteries that are in the other smoke detectors since i moved into the house are going strong had to replace   of them already      
337,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       first and foremost  we really like the amazon brand batteries   i used these batteries in a digital clock and worked just fine   however  our main reason for buying this set was to use them in our smoke detectors   in short  they are too big   i never realized  v batteries vary in size until we tried to use these in the smoke detectors   please see the pictures   they are slightly taller and a little wider   the door on our smoke detectors simply won t close and you don t want to force it   this is the only reason we purchased this many   so learning has occurred   we simply don t use them for anything else other than the occasional battery in a digital clock and for that they work fine   please keep this in mind when purchasing  make sure whatever you are putting them into that you have the extra length and width to accommodate a slightly larger battery      
338,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i bought these for a semi annual smoke detector battery change out  i like the way each battery is individually shrink wrapped because of the short problem while storing the batteries  i also installed one in my carbon monoxide alert system and it kept  chirping   i checked the voltage of the new battery and it was only     volts d c  i also had a second dead battery  so   of the   were duds  i didn t return them because of the hassle   i will not buy these again because the quality control is not good      
339,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                          updated              shortly after i wrote this review  i tossed out the entire box  so disgusted  i didn t even want to hassle with sending back for a refund   trash      this weekend i received the batteries and a first alert carbon monoxide alarm   i bought the  v for this purpose   and to use in the smoke detectors   when i managed to wedge in the slot  the connectors did not fit the alert   i turned it upside down thinking i had installed incorrectly   no  i was surprised that i had to forcibly push it into the slot  because of the extra width compared to standard  v batteries  after no more than    seconds of this  i took it out and it was warm  which i thought was odd  in the next minute  i could actually smell the chemicals  and touched it again   it was hot   too hot to hold and  truthfully  i was sure it was building to explode  i put a cup over it until it cooled off  i ve never had this kind of a reaction with a battery  ever  maybe i just had a bad batch  but once is enough for me   i then inserted the eveready which came with the detector  problem solved   these are being returned   i am not a name brand snob   quite happy with the amazon basics aa   aaa batteries     before i clicked  submit   i checked the eveready and tested the alarm   my furnace died the other day  which is why i wanted the cm alert  and it is    degrees in my house   the battery was just as cold to the touch   win      
340,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       the positive and negative charges on one of the batteries in the set was labeled in reverse  i installed the battery based on the charge and within a few seconds the battery was making sizzling noises and smoking  i turned off the device and carefully opened the battery compartment  upon comparing it to the other batteries i realized it had been mislabeled  i m thankful i was still in the room when this happened considering one of the devices i d installed the other  v battery in was in a different room  i will be contacting amazon and filing a complaint  i m very disappointed in their quality control standards      
341,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i thought these would be a great deal since i have quite a few pedals and active basses that need  v batteries  also seeing the amount of star ratings thought i couldn t go wrong  but these things can t seem to keep a charge even when i unplug everything i ve also had the same problem as a bass player who reviewed these batteries  the battery is too tall and fat for tight battery cavities and don t last long enough   you can see from my attached    photos    that it doesn t even fit in my battery compartment w o smashing it in and you don t want to do that because it ll bite into the attached wiring there are more cons for this particular usage than there are positives  they may work great in other applications but i m going back to buying regular brand batteries for my electronic instrument needs      
342,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       fyi  this review is for the   volt batteries  amazon apparently groups the reviews for all of their battery styles together  i can t really help with that batteries were just a tiny bit longer than the ones they were replacing  this was a problem in my carbon monoxide detector    but the battery compartment is finicky to battery size  i imagine this would work fine in most places  so long as the battery compartment isn t too fancy by my measurements  the amazonbasics battery is the same size as another heavy duty battery that won t fit in my co detector  these batteries are    mm longer and    mm wider than a standard duracell battery my photos attached show some measurements    which may not be perfect but hey i don t get paid for this    the length measurement of an amazon basics battery       mm   along side a duracell  clearly shorter  and another brand  heavy duty  battery    a measurement of the difference in thickness between the amazon basics and the duracell battery       mm thicker    a measurement of the difference in length between the amazon basics and the duracell battery      mm longer      
343,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       put these on a   month subscribe and save and use them to replace the batteries in your smoke detectors at regular intervals  i got the last batch on november         and exactly   months later on january         the  am chirps from a smoke detector indicating a low battery went off on one  a day later  a second chirp at  am on jan    went off  i m canceling the subscription and going back to a name brand  and replacing the rest of the batteries this weekend      
344,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i used these to replace the  v batteries in   smoke detectors in my house   within   weeks  all of my smoke detectors are now chirping the low battery warning  typically  my smoke detectors will last at least   months using name brand batteries   i will not buy these again   i m seeing people report low capacity for years now  amazon really needs to work on the quality of their products  supply chain  as the amazon basics line is really hit and miss  these  volt batteries are a total miss and not worth purchasing      
345,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i did not read the reviews before purchasing these batteries   and if i had  i would not have purchased them  i bought to install in water leak sensors placed under out sinks and water heater  i tested each water leak sensor and each worked  with these batteries installed  then i was going to buy another   and saw the reviews  bummer  i need to check the voltage of each battery so i know the batteries are good  i have just finished doing this  each battery was     v   measured with a very good voltmeter  this is a bit higher than i thought it should be  but ok  i set off an water sensor and let it run for about    seconds  that battery read     v after this  sill fine and more in line with what i thought the batteries should read  i can t vouch for how long they will last  but there is no current being pulled from the battery unless the sensor goes off  so i think i m ok for a few years  but i plan to test every   months or so   easy for me to do as i put velcro on each sensor so i can remove easily from under the sink  the battery pulls right out  and i can test quickly  the size is not an issue in the application   but i can see where in other applications it might be  costco has    off the gold top duracell   year guarantee  v batteries  which brings the price from        to         so not much more than these       so i did buy   of those to be used ads backups   but if these amazon batteries work under load  when the siren goes off  i ll be buying more      
346,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       these were bought to put in a our ceiling smoke detectors   in less than   year   of the batteries went bad and in the middle of the night we were awakened by the chirp in the detector indicating a need for a battery change   we got new batteries  but had to go through the expense of having someone come in and change all of them in our    ft  ceilings   we buy allot of items from amazon and usually don t have problems  but we sure did with this item
