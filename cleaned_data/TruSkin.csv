0,5.0 ,                       there s nothing less than a five star for this product   i bought it for my wife because of a cousin referral  and let me retell you there s nothing out there that has given me more husband points than this  a little behind the scene  my wife got an allergic reaction on her cheeks  and forehead which started to breakout in her face and no medicine  or antibiotics reduced it  calm it down or took it off   as a husband i can see her frustration everyday with going from a perfect smooth face to this breakout  she used a derma roller together with this product and i kid you not in three days i ve seen so much of it go down  and a big smile coming out   now we know that is a matter of time before it all goes away and her face goes back to baby bum smooth  hahaha    that you truskin  for the fast shipping  and great product     and of course the husband points           
1,5.0 ,                       i truly believe that it s a myth that you have to spend a fortune on skin care to see results   i have tried many different vitamin c serums at all different price points  and i really believe that truskin is the best on the market   my skin looks brighter  feels smoother and i get compliments all the time   although most people think i m much younger  at    i needed something that was really going to make a difference and truskin is just that   don t think twice about ordering a bottle  just do it   you re going to love it      
2,5.0 ,                       man oh  man where do i start  i have been struggling with blemishes and acne for years now and can say that i have tried possibly everything and nothing really gave me the results that i was looking for until i found this baby right here  this basically pure skin love in a bottle  i follow a routine every morning and night and this is apart of my routine of smoothing out my skin and even brightening up the blemmishes that are basically almost completely gone now  i am so happy that i choose this product and look forward to being a long time customer forever  definitely recommended     
3,1.0 ,                       i normally never really leave bad reviews but this serum really just didn t do it for me  i read all of the reviews and was hoping it would work as well for me as it did for everyone else  i m so sad i just finished up my bottle and towards the end i was really realizing it was not having any effect on my skin  but i had bought the serum as a gift before realizing it was no good  i also recommended it to my sister who bought it shortly after me and has also come to the same conclusion that it just doesn t work  i m on day two of the pacifica brand sea salt and vitamin c and i can immediately tell the difference between the two serums this one is working    times better i feel like my face is so soft and smooth and i can also see dark spots literally disappearing  so sorry to say this product does not work     
4,5.0 ,                       i have battled dyshidrotic eczema on my palms for over a year  i have been prescribed topical steroids and specialized lotions  i have tried all kinds of diet adjustments and supplements  most have had minimal effects  i read a review of this product about how the purchaser had smoother hands now after applying the product  i gave it a try and finally my hands have returned to normal  it s taken about a month for my hands to completely heal  if you are are almost out of remedies  give this product a try      
5,5.0 ,                       i m    years old  and i finally realized that taking care of your skin was very important  and meant applying cleanser  toner  a serum  and moisturizer every night  rather than just washing your face with soap in the shower  i never had acne prone skin  or cystic breakouts  but i would have the occasional hormonal flare up that would give me a couple whiteheads on my face  i am also very pale  and am prone to developing red patchiness as the days goes on  when i was browsing serums that could reduce dark spots from a some pimple scars  as well as reduce red patchiness  i came across this brand  and immediately bought it  from the various   star reviews  i knew i had to try it out on my skin  now  a month after i bought it  i am seeing amazing results  sure  it does not magically get rid of your hormonal flare ups  but it does reduce their intensity  and leaves my face bright  refreshed  and clean feeling every morning  i highly recommend this product because i am seeing results  and have been complimented on my great skin recently      
6,5.0 ,                       i wish i did a before and after photo  my skin wasn t terrible  but i had a few problem areas  hyperpigmentation and dark circles under my eyes   i have been using this product for about a week and i can already see a noticeable difference  it did exactly what i wanted it to do  and i can still use my favorite moisturizer on top of it  not from truskin  and not a dig at theirs  i just haven t tried theirs   this serum is definitely worth the     if you have any of the issues i mentioned  you don t need an expensive chemical peel  or whatever else you ve read about      
7,4.0 ,                       update  after being in contact with the seller  they refunded me for the product and sent me a different complimentary item for me to try since this one did not work for me  i will have to see how it feels on my face these next dew days  but the seller was very attentive and made sure i was a happy customer was very excited to try this even though i m skeptical about buying face products from amazon  this is not hydrating at all  i imagined it would be due to the hyaluronic acid  but it actually makes my face feel dry  definitely not buying again      
8,5.0 ,                       i ve been in the market for a good serum for awhile  after trying out a few  including some high end brands that cost me well over      and didn t quite deliver  this will be the serum i stick with  my skin absorbs it really quickly  and i somehow feel as if my moisturizer goes deeper into my skin when i apply it after the serum  i ve noticed a positive change in my skin tone  which used to be patchy and red  but is now much more smooth and clear after having used this serum for about   weeks  also have to make a note about the great customer service   i had a few questions about their product line  and questions were answered personally and directly to my specific questions  i m a very happy customer and am looking forward to trying out the other products in their line      
9,5.0 ,                       as soon as i got the product  i got detailed instructions on how to use it via email  it works perfectly and so far i can already see results with my face looking brighter and more awake  i will definitely be purchasing again since i ve been eyeing vitamin c serum for some time and did not know where to start and saw amazing reviews for this online and here and decided to go with it  i ve only had it for a day and so far my face feels smooth  also feels like it s tight in a good way and i noticed after i slept that my face didnt look tired  i will edit my review later to show other results but so far no issues with this vitamin c serum      
10,1.0 ,                       i have amazing skin  i was looking for something to brighten it  since using it  i have a black line appear on my cheek  i spoke to a dermatologist and they said what ever this serum contained  he reacted poorly with my skin and made it more sensitive to sun damage  not i have to use a skin whitener to correct the damage caused  it made my skin feel so tight and unmovable as if i had elmers clue on my face and it dried   and the packaging was crap      
11,3.0 ,                       i purchased for my daughter who s going through puberty  she has some face and back acne scarring  based on the reviews  i purchased with excitement for her she has been using this once a day everyday for over a month  no changes  so far  i feel this is a sham  it doesn t work at all starting today we are going to start doing it  x a day and i ll post an update at the end of this month  dec update     after posting my original review  customer service reached out and offered me a refund or their vitamin c cleanser to use in conjunction with this  after about two weeks of using the vitamin c cleanser  i noticed her face acne scars have lightened a bit  she said she doesn t see much of a difference  but i do  she continues to use both products every night before going to bed and it seems to be working  to me   i ll post before and current pics soon  no matter the outcome  i am very pleased with the customer care provided  they respond to all my emails and concerns  they do what they say they will do and never asked me to post a positive review  like many others have  if these products work for my daughter s back acne scars  omg  i will post another update and i will not be able to sing their praises enough  they are very nice  responsive and understanding  i pray  this work so i don t have to deal with anyone else        
12,5.0 ,                       having been a long time user of a luxury medi spa brand  i just always purchased my  usual  brand that my esthetician would recommend  and sure  i was happy with it  however  i also one day noticed how much money i was spending on this particular luxury brand   so i decided to do something about that  i always check and read customer reviews  and felt good about trying this brand  truskin naturals appealed to me since it was a natural product  and also contained the hyaluronic acid   vitamin e i was looking for  so  after using this product for about   months  the price is about     less per bottle than what i was paying for my luxury medi spa brand  and my skin feels wonderful  rejuvenated and smooth  the customer service from this company is incredible and i am a convert  you will not be disappointed with this serum   even if you currently use the super fancy  costly  serums  do yourself a favor and get this product  take yourself out to lunch with your savings and have a glass of wine to celebrate how smart you are      
13,3.0 ,                       update as of           i had someone from the company message me in regards to my review  they offered me a refund and wanted to know about my skin so they could help me find something appropriate for my needs  i was more than pleased with the customer service  and that they did this  oh and they did not ask me to remove or change my review  like other places have asked of me  i find that to be really refreshing it makes my skin super soft  i didn t see any wow results like some reviews  i probably wouldn t buy it again  only because i may try a higher end brand to compare  was really hoping for an omg what a change  but my skin is being very finicky lately and i m really not sure why      
14,5.0 ,                       i recently suffered  from over exfoliation on my face  i had a product that said  daily exfoliating cleanser   and it wasnt super gritty so i didnt really think i was truly exfoliating   i i kno better now   i found this product while doing research on how to heal the redness  sensitivity   pain with touch and inflammation  on my face   i ve used this twice and i ve seen soo much of a difference   i m so happy that with this product   my skin looks amazing and its definitely healed so much of my redness   not only does my skin look improved but its beautiful      
15,5.0 ,                       just love this light rejuvenating serum    i m    and live in dry colorado     i need real moisture not just oil  this product helps to replenishment   smooth and moisturize my sad dry skin  no sticky or greasy feeling after applying  i ve used this product for over a year  tried other products   but not the same result  i also have noticed a reduction of brown spots over a couple of months    be patient  results don t come overnight  i m also celiac  can t have wheat in my skin care products  for over     research a good oral collagene and omega   product   they can help increase benefits to your skin too      
16,5.0 ,                       i am thriled with this product   i actually discovered the use of vit  c in skin products through another brand which is much more expensive  it did work pretty well in softening my age lines  so i decided that   trying a new product using that same ingredient  might be a good idea   i chose tru skin vit c   i am    and the lines from my nose down to my chin are considerably less deep   i had a crese above my nose and between my eyebrows  it is gone    other lines on my face are a bit less deep   at my age  i know that nothing will erase wrinkles    but this product has certainly improved my appearance   and at a great price love it         
17,4.0 ,                       i m     with wrinkles and age spots  and this is my first try at reducing them both   i have sensitive skin and worried that this might make things worse   it did not   i am pleased by how it feels on my skin   no weird odor  pleasant feel   okay  it feels good but is it working   well   i don t know   three weeks of use so far and i m not seeing a miracle  but my make up is going on smoother   i like it well enough to buy one more bottle after this one   hope this helped      
18,5.0 ,                       i have very sensitive  dry skin  i m    y o  i use very little face products and this was my first time using a serum  as recommended by the manufacturer  i dabbed a test spot of truskin vitamin c serum on my neck and within minutes could feel the spot was slightly smoother than the rest of my neck  i had zero bad reactions to the test spot after   weeks of using the serum on my face and neck daily it has made these differences  smoother skin reduced dryness reduced under eye circles  puffiness reduced appearance of fine linesi d recommend anyone to add this serum to their facial care routine  i will purchase again      
19,5.0 ,                       i am on my second bottle  my husband mentioned to me about a week ago that my face was extra soft and looked very healthy  aside from that i have a couple of small brown spots that seem to be fading away quite rapidly  i did some research before ordering the first time and i saved about          i m so glad i did it  happy happy      
20,3.0 ,                       before college  my skin never broke out horribly  i would only get a pimple or two before my period but other than that  my skin was perfectly fine  however  once college started  i started breaking out badly and the pimples i would get were those hard ones that never surfaced a white head  i got a huge pimple on my nose in december and the dark coloring is still here six months later  i researched and found out that vitamin c serums were supposed to help with fading dark spots so of course  i came on amazon and bought the one with the highest reviews  needless to say  this product did not work with my skin  i m not sure if it s the brand or just vitamin c  hence why i didn t give it a   star   but my asian skin just would not react to it  i used the serum every night after my toner and before my face bask  adding a drop to my left cheek  a drop to my right cheek  and a drop on my forehead and massaging it to my face  the existing scars did get better but it s still there and i don t know the extent that this product really helped me  my face is still horrible and dry      
21,5.0 ,                       i love this product  it is hydrating  absorbs quickly  and has helped keep dry patches at bay without being oily and heavy  it is gentle enough to use on sensitive acne project skin  and is light enough to wear under makeup during the day without having a negative interaction with my foundation  doesn t cause it to break up  become oily  or smear   texture wise  it feels like a makeup primer  i was surprised that it didn t have a citrus scent like most other vitamin c products   it has a neutral scent  doesn t really smell like anything   but the performance of the product is exceptional and no added scent is honestly a nice change in a world of cosmetics and skincare with so many overly scented products  so it doesn t bother me at all i would also like to add that the truskin naturals customer service is fantastic  i received an email from an actual person as soon as this item had shipped letting me know some information about the product and to offer any support with questions  i have since communicated with this rep a few times about their product line  and she is responsive  knowledgeable  and helpful        
22,5.0 ,                       this product is amazing   it only took two weeks for me to see visible results   i presume after   months  the result will be dramatic   i have problems with dark spots on my face due to early sun exposure   my skin is also very sensitive and it gets irritated easily   this serum made my skin look and feel better almost immediately   i discovered it by searching for highly reviewed products on amazon  and this item was their best seller with over      reviews   i had to try it and i am so glad i did   additionally  the price is very reasonable  which makes me think the company and people behind it are sensitive to their customer s well being and budget    great customer service too   i got an email from the co founder asking me if i was satisfied with the two products i had bought from them  vitamin c serum and moisturizing cream     i said  yes  i love it       
23,4.0 ,                       i ve only had this serum for a couple of weeks  but can already see such a difference in my skin   i am    years old  and fair skinned  i have used retin a for a couple of years  but my skin still needed  something   adding this serum to my routine has really made a difference already   my skin looks really smooth and clear  and feels so good  i have a couple of larger freckles on my cheek  and am watching to see if those go away while using this serum   so far they haven t  but i am still very happy with this product i had been on the fence about purchasing a really expensive skin care line that a friend has been selling  but wasn t totally sold  i am happy with my choice to try this instead  i also bought the truskin cleanser and rose water toner   i ordered it after the vitamin c serum  and believe the vitamin c serum has shown the biggest difference in my skin i will update this as time goes on  so far i m really happy i haven t been given this product  even at a discount  and i am not being persuaded in any way for this review      
24,5.0 ,                       i m updating my review because i originally gave this vit c serum a   star because i didn t like the way it felt on my skin  i didn t want to go through trouble of sending it back so i was willing to take a loss and move forward to my surprise one of the co owners erica read my review and reached out to me  she wanted to make sure i was satisfied  not only did she refund my purchase but she worked with me and asked questions about my skin type in order to find a vit c serum that worked for me  erica gave me an overview of all the serums that may match my skin type and asked me to choose one and sent me a complimentary bottle which i thought was so generous  the new serum that i choose is their vit c plus which has a totally different texture and felt light on my skin and the best part  it smells amazing i ve never had such a pleasant experience with a cosmetic company  i can tell that they really do care  their customer service is superior to any other company i ve dealt with  thanks truskin      
25,5.0 ,                       first of all let me start off by saying this is my second bottle of this serum  here s my story so you can understand a few things and reasons why i m a customer for life  i m a    yr old woman  who has endometriosis and pcos  i don t take birth control because although it gave me porcelain doll skin  everything else that happened to me while on birth control was miserable  it helped control my hormonal acne  and it helped me lose a lot of weight  i have been off birth control a full   years now  i have always had what i felt was  decent  looking skin  i had a bit of teenage acne growing up but never much where i felt i had to slab make up on every day  now at     with cystic ovaries  i had to change things up in my routine  i started doing research and i ve always liked and leaned towards things that were more natural with less alcohol and other horrible ingredients just bad for your skin  after my research of serums  toners and supplements  i chose truskin naturals vitamin c serum  the fact that it also has vitamin e and hyaluronic acid is major plus  the vitamin e is also great for helping scars face and help fight against aging as well  the thickness and consistency of the serum is matched perfectly  it is not greasy nor oily  i use a dropper full amount for my whole face and entire neck  my acne scars are mostly on my neck and it s embarrassing  having to wear make up all the way down to my shoulders almost is horrible  with the bottle i noticed very quickly within less than a week that my fine lines faded  my acne not only basically cleared up but the scars did too  i kept getting compliments at work and from my patients and they asked what i used on my skin because it looked like a doll s face  they would tell me my skin looked soft and smooth and it was  i told them i use the truskin vitamin c serum  along with burt s bees chamomile and soap bark face wash  i have continued to have amazing results until hurricane tropical storm harvey hit  we lost half of our patients due to them losing everything as well and some relocated and others we don t know  there was a company lay off and being someone who loves and is passionate in skin care and i m a nursing student  and while trying to reach out about working from home to make it easier with my studies  i went to the actual truskin company site and sent a message asking about possible employment  the site and i believe business owner  erica  responded kindly and so sweet  i had actually forgot i had sent that message at the time of the reply and the worst part was it looked like i was drunk while typing it  i lost my glasses from the flooding  anyways  although she was unable to offer employment she was beyond so kind and compassionate and understanding during our correspondence and i was offered a free bottle of the serum to help compensate and i was so excited  i ve never had that happen to me and i told her pretty much all i ve said here on my long winded story  when i temporarily stopped using truskin vitamin c serum due to harvey my skin flipped out on me  i know it s from stress and hormones  i received my bottle of serum yesterday and my bottle of the retinol moisturizer today  it s crazy to say that the results are already amazing  i have sensitive skin  the serum feels amazing  the moisturizer feels great  it smells soft and no burning or stinging  i ll update soon with pictures as promised  thank you erica  for the kindness you showed me and for having these amazing and natural products  i hope to use these as long as i can  because just after a day and a half my skin has already shown the softness and smooth skin i had before that i received so many compliments on      
26,2.0 ,                       update  after i posted my original review  i was contacted by customer service and was offered a full refund and a new product from a different line based on a recommendation by the agent  i was very pleased with this but they did ask me to update my review to reflect dealing with their customer service team  i don t have any problem with that because they were very kind to deal with and didn t make any excuses  but i will not be changing my original rating of   stars because the original product still didn t work for meoriginal  to start out  i ve never had any major acne  just a few minor pimples here and there mostly on my nose and chin  the problem is i tend to pick at them  making them scar  i bought this to help with acne scarring and even my skin tone  i had read reviews about how it got rid of acne scars in less than   months  which i thought was amazing  i wanted to get rid of some scarring for an upcoming trip  i bought this and tested it out on my arm and neck to make sure i wouldn t break out  which all turned out fine  well i started using it on my entire face and after about a week  i noticed some new pimples that were under the skin on my cheeks and forehead  all places i had never had acne before   i thought it was just my face getting used to the product but after another week  more acne started to appear and it was on my chin now as well  it was almost like cystic acne because it was so deep under the skin and caused my skin to become bumpy  i stopped using this for about a week  and my face started clearing up immediately  i had high hopes for this product  but sadly it didn t work out  on the plus side  the smell is good      
27,2.0 ,                       so i have really bad dark spots  i also have pimples that randomly pop up on my face  so i was hoping this would help with my face since i seen all the good reviews on it  however  when i received the bottle it look like it might have been sitting for awhile because the words were coming off the bottle  also the color and cloudiness of the serum looked as maybe it was expired  i might have just gotten an old bottle idk but i think i m going to ask for a refund  because i don t feel comfortable using this on my face      
28,5.0 ,                       i discovered truskin in      i had really bad chin acne that almost seemed like a yeast  i couldn t get rid of it  i tried lots of products and nothing worked  it seemed most products made it worse  i can t remember how i found this product  i just know i have used it ever since i first ordered it  it has greatly improved my skin  chin acne is gone and i feel more confident now  the product is fragrance free and is easily applied  i use it after a shower  i highly recommend this to anyone who has stubborn acne that won t clear up      
29,5.0 ,                       i am someone who loves to take care of her skin  but i am also very impatient  i have tried several different face products to reduce premature wrinkles and have better skin  however  over the years  most products have been unsuccessful or a waste of my money  staying hydrated helps  but i wanted something that i could use at night or in the daytime  luckily  i found this  this is the first product that i ve used that has caused significant results within about a week of using it  the results were noticeable  and i found my skin becoming more smooth  clear  and even  i was hesitant because of the price  but the product lasted me for a month and a half  so  i will be a continue to buy this due to the immediate results  i even went out of my way to recommend this product to a few friends  who saw results quickly  within a week  just like i did    obviously  everyone s skin is different and this product may not work for you    but  i highly recommend trying it for yourself before dismissing it completely  the customer service is also very kind  so  if you have any issues with the product  i m sure they will be pleased to help you any way possible          
30,3.0 ,                       everyone s skin is different  i have dry sensitive skin and delayed adult acne  i use veltin gel prescription to treat it i used it in the day time and night time  seems ok in the day time the one time i used it at night it caused my skin type to break out i do not use it at night anymore i got it to smooth out my acne scars and lighten them  i cant really tell if its working  because my skin broke out  it has since started to clear back up after only using it in a day time routine      
31,2.0 ,                       i ve been using this product for years with no results   i ve purchased   bottles and used to the end   it feels great on skin and is a good moisturizer but that s it   it s spot reducing claims are meh at best   after reading more about vit c this product should really be in an air tight container as to prevent degradation  vit c is so sensitive that the constant exposure to air this product gets breaks it down almost immediately   maybe with that small change the spot reducing removing claims would be one more attainable      
32,5.0 ,                       above all  i would like to say that the customer service i have experienced ordering this product is nothing short of exceptional   i have worked in customer service for    years and am very passionate about both giving and receiving it   it is clear to me that truskin genuinely cares about their customers   i don t leave reviews often unless the customer service or product was extremely good or extremely bad   with that being said  i have not had any issues and am extremely satisfied with the product and as i mentioned the customer service   my skin is clearer and brighter than i have ever seen it and i get constant compliments on how my skin glows   it is important when using this product to be patient and consistent   give it some time to see some results    at least a month   as i mentioned  using the serum consistently is just as important if you want to see results this is a great quality product  that is also affordable and comes with exceptional customer service   you can t go wrong with this serum      
33,5.0 ,                       i began using this serum   weeks ago  in the first    days when i applied it my skin soaked it and felt dry so i used moisturizer on top of it  two weeks later i m not using moisturizer after i apply it because my skin feels so soft and hydrated  my pores are smaller and my face is brighter the first picture was on the first day i started using it  the second picture i am only wearing eyeshadow and lipstick  what you see is my skin without foundation or filters  i can see a difference and i want to purchase it again  i m    years young      
34,3.0 ,                       update  the customer service is great  i m rising the starts to three for the customer service  they contacted me to follow up on how i like the product and when i explained there was no change  they told me i would need to use it in a longer term to see a result  they also offered me to send me a free bottle or refund my money back  due to the great customer service  i ve decided to give it another try  will update my review if i get any result with the second  this time free  bottle i bought it based on the many great reviews  applied to my skin twice a day and have got absolutely no result till the bottle finished  absolute waste of money and not recommended      
35,4.0 ,                       edit  truskin read my review and offered me a refund since i hadn t seen any difference in my skin  they recommended i continue to use it as results may take longer to show up for some skin types  they also recommend different products based on my skin type and offered to ship one to me free of charge so i could try it  this company seriously has the best customer service and i have become a customer for life because of this  although this particular product hasn t made a change in my skin yet  it is a quality product and i will continue to use truskin products in my daily skincare routine                                     i was so excited to use this and finally get control of my skin  i have been using it along with some other products recommended in the reviews for this product and i haven t noticed any difference in my skin  i still have uneven skin tone and none of the dark spots have faded even a little  my pores  fine lines  straight up wrinkles  they all look exactly the same  i am super bummed  i was really hoping this would help  it definitely isn t in making my skin worse  but it doesn t seem to be helping either      
36,5.0 ,                       i read a ton of reviews on this before purchasing it  and i ve seen it on buzzfeed over and over again in lists about must have items  i m sure this works for some people  but this burned like hell on my skin  my skin isn t even that sensitive  i tried it for   weeks and had to stop because it was hurting more and more each time i applied it  i couldn t see much of a difference from day   and actually thought the initial picture i took of myself looked better  i was pretty disappointed in this product  especially after reading so many rave reviews    update  while this didn t work for me  i can see why the reviews are so great  the company refunded my money and also recommended and sent me other products that would be better for my skin  i d totally give them a second chance just for being so nice about everything      
37,5.0 ,                       i m a    year old woman with war torn skin from years of acne   the acne is under control but i have the tell take signs of aging   i ve felt like i lost the lottery in the skin department of life   but this c serum by trial in as brightened my skin and given it new life   i will definitely continue using it  ps  i have eye make up in and mascara and glass  no foundation or powder  or concealer      
38,5.0 ,                       i m not sure what just happened to be honest  my skin is pretty good nor dry nor oily  i barely get any pimples      like ever  i just wanted to try something new that would enhance my good skin but i received this product today and put it on very excited around  pm i think  washed my face with my usual cleaner biore witch hazel and then put this serum    it      pm of the same day and i have multiple small bumps all over my face  this product is not for me  i thought vitamin c would be good for any skin and i m not sensible either  i m just confused  unfortunately i wouldn t recommend it to a friend but it might work for someone else as stated in the comments update       although this product did not work for me seller was willing to issue refund  i did not accept the refund because we as customers also have to be aware certain products are not going to work for us and we risk in buying something that won t work for us  they are very reliable and honest thank you for the help and concern      
39,5.0 ,                       it took my skin a minute to adjust to this product but it s definitely helped my skin look healthier  i ve had fewer breakouts and overall my face looks smoother  i think it s even helping acne scars  i cleanse  use a witch hazel toner  then the serum  sometimes salicylic acid and always moisturize  the only other big addition i added that was also helpful is a aztec clay mask twice a week  i ve been using the serum since the end of march and have pretty dramatic results despite hormonal breakouts      
40,4.0 ,                       the company is great and i do well with their hylauranic acid but caution use this sparingly and not frequently   if you have sensitive skin  too much can give a reaction  took me a minute to figure out where reaction was coming from  my gf told me to get this  i think because it s strong i just need to give myself a break  my gf explained my skin was turning over at too fast of a rate and she gets blotchy too if done too much so now she only uses acids     x per month  i think moving forward after my skin calms down i will try on different part of my body in a patch test and hopefully will be ok  i was reading that reactions happen       hrs post useage for reactions so keep that in mind for patch testing  i hope this helps          
41,4.0 ,                       this item arrived quickly  a small glass bottle well wrapped alone in a box that was large enough to hold      of them     i unpacked and let it settle for a few hours  at night i went through my routine  unsealed the bottle  and used the dropper to get it into the palm of my hand  i was not surprised that i got mostly bubbles     applied the product sparingly to my face  some mild tingling    then spread a very small amount of oil on my face  and woke up to a glow  magic for the   weeks i have had the bottle now   the bubbles have not gone away  with the dropper i get mostly bubbles although the bottle has been i sitting on my shelf and that bothers me  there is no stinging or tingling when i apply it  the results are great let s see how the next bottle is  i ll update this review      
42,5.0 ,                       when i saw all the rave reviews  the cynical part of me was sure it was a scam    that most of the reviewers were paid  but i m happy to say  i was proven wrong  i ve been using this product for less than   weeks  and i don t think my adult skin has ever looked better  i m in my early   s and i ve been dealing with acne since i hit puberty  after using this serum  i do still get little zits  mostly from wearing a mask     the day   but the constellation of red dots along my left cheeck that i thought were acne scars are now     gone   i honestly can t believe it  they ve been there for years and now they ve vanished after just   weeks of using this product  besides the drastic reduction in acne  the overall quality of my skin is just better  i ve never looked in the mirror and thought my skin looked  dewy     until now  i m kicking myself for not trying a product like this before  i ve tried quite a few acne specific products and none of them were worth keeping around  i honestly thought nothing short of a laser would fix my skin  but here i am  dewy af i wouldn t call this product  moisturizing   my skin feels a little tight after applying it  but after i put my moisturizer on  it feels great  i started out just applying it at night  but when i really began to see the results after the first week  i started applying it twice a day      
43,5.0 ,                       i heard good reviews about this serum through a friend so decided to give it a shot  after being able to get rid of my acne i was left with these awful indented scars on my face  i have tried many things for scars including microneedling a couple of times but haven t seen any drastic change with my sessions  i purchased this serum about   weeks ago and have seen a big change already  i ve been using it twice a day morning and night followed by moisturizer  honestly i never thought it would help with my scars but wow am i amazed when i saw my before and after pictures in just   weeks  it helps tighten skin and makes your skin feel soft  i have sensitive skin and had no problems using this  i would highly recommend     
44,5.0 ,                           months of usebefore  top   after  bottom update    months of use  next picture overall impression this has been a key ingredient to my morning routine  the vitamin e   hyaluronic acid additions are a plus  the very first time i applied this on to my face  there was a burning sensation which is normal for skin that hasn t used potent vitamin c  to achieve the most successful results  you must be careful with what other ingredients you re mixing this with because some will make it less effective  do your research before mixing products    in addition  you must use it while it is not oxidized  you can tell by assessing its color  the more pigmented  the less effective  the after result picture is not solely due to the vitamin c serum  but rather the result of my entire morning and night regimen that i ve carefully created to target post inflammatory pigmentation  however  when i added this serum to my routine  i noticed greater improvements in skin texture and complexion incorporated as part of my routine vitamin c is a great protective antioxidant so i use it once a day in the morning after cleansing my face with a niacinamide containing face wash and toning it with thayer s witch hazel rose petal toner  after applying the serum  i let it sink into my skin  which is usually about when i feel that my face has become a bit tight where i can feel a slight film of the serum  the last step of this mourning routine is applying a sunscreen with spf    amount of product used i m quite generous when it comes to application of this serum because vitamin c quickly oxidizes causing it to lose its potency  i went through my first bottle in   month and i m currently on my second one      
45,5.0 ,                       i am    and this inexpensive serum made a difference  a couple of days after introducing it to my skincare regimen my husband told me  whatever you re doing  keep doing it   you look different  in the best way    he was right  no one product that i ever used gave results as fast and as glorious   full disclosure   the rest of my skin care products are on the pricey side   but i ve had my current regimen for a while now  so i could see the difference that this serum made  added to the mix  i use it in the morning  before my spf moisturizer      
46,5.0 ,                       these are some of the things i have noticed since i started using the product  i am starting to notice that the crows feet around my eyes have become less noticeable  in fact  someone who has known me for years who is close to my age commented that  their eyes did not look as good as mine  i also have noticed that i had a few blackheads on the tip of my nose that are definitely smaller  however  i am also using a clay mask  three times a week  in the morning to help with that area so  i believe they are working in tandem  and i am reaping the benefits  i have never had any results until i started using your product and the clay in general  i have been blessed with good genes and pretty nice skin to where i never have and hope to never need to use foundation or blush   having this product makes me happy to know that i feel i can continue not worrying about that   many people ask me what i use  and i proudly tell them nothing  except your product and a moisturizer anything in particular you like about it in particular  i like how it does not interfere with my daily face cream  and  it is mostly organic as well it easily and quickly absorbs into my skin  i am using it twice a day  it was suggested that one use a sunscreen when outside using the vitamin  c  in  sunlight  i had not considered that the only thing that is a negative i noticed was    when i try to put a creamy concealer on under my bottom eye lids  instead of a smooth look  it looks stringy   should i not use it under my eyes   be certain the serum is completely dry and do not use too much under the eyes    recently  i noticed that sometimes along my cheekbones  under the eye area  it appears very shiny  any tips for that or do i avoid that area because i use this product all over my face   i even use it on my neck and decollete and after it dries i moisturize these areas as well again      drops is suggested to use  but spread quickly to get coverage all over the face and under and over the eyes other than that  i love the product  i want to finish this bottle and i will probably get several other products from the line  and of course  another  c  serum      
47,5.0 ,                       i was told by my esthetician that it would be good to add a vitamin c product to my routine   i tried a cream  and then a liquid  which i preferred   then i saw an ad for this product and decided to try it   it has a nice scent and texture and so far  i really like it   using vitamin c has helped eliminate dark spots and evened out my skin tone      
48,2.0 ,                       i used this product for about six weeks and i didn t see any improvement or changes to my skin what so ever  my dark spots didn t fade  my pores didn t shrink  i know that s impossible   my wrinkles didn t improve and i still get acne  that being said  i m giving this product two stars  instead of one  because of my experience with the vendor s customer service  which has been exceptional  they ve gone out of their way to make sure i find a suitable replacement product  in fact  they ve provided better customer service than i ve experienced with any other amazon vendor  the product did nothing for me so i don t feel i can give it more than two stars but i wish there was a way that i could rate the vendor separately  they d get    plus stars      
49,1.0 ,                       i had tried majestic pure vitamin c serum which i thought was just ok  majestic pure s smells like vitamins and it was a bit sticky and orange in color  i thought i d try a different brand so i found truskin naturals vitamin c  and oh man  this makes majestic pure s seem like a miracle serum  the only difference that tru naturals has made on my skin is that i now have tiny red bumps on my face after a week of applying this  i tried to give it another shot for one more week but  again little red bumps appeared  on my forehead and cheeks  i am not happy about this and i will not be purchasing again      
50,3.0 ,                       i have very sensitive skin   i can use this every night no problem  i ve been using it for awhile and don t notice a change in fine lines or wrinkles at all though   i m     but i have them   i will say it makes your skin supersoft  and may help my under eyes a little if i don t get a lot of sleep  not sure i will get again but love the way it makes my face so soft  just wished it helped with the fine lined wrinkles     
51,5.0 ,                       i wanted to wait a bit before writing this review to see if this serum lived up to the hype i ve read on amazon s reviews it s a nice  light serum  and when it dries  you can feel your skin tightening a bit  i ve been using it now for about       weeks  and while i have seen some improvement in my skin tone  a bit clearer   smoother   i wouldn t necessarily call this a  holy grail  product  you can buy great vitamin c serums from a lot of different vendors here on amazon    the ordinary sells fantastic skincare at really reasonable prices  for example  if you re looking for good skincare that does work pretty well  this is a good bet  you do have to hang in there     the first week i saw no change at all    the second week  it started to improve  but my skin did go through a  learning  period  i guess you could say  where it broke out a bit with this  it wasn t horrendous  though  overall  i d say this is a good serum     holy grail  quality   not really      
52,5.0 ,                       i am so in love with this product  i have been struggling with adult acne for almost   years  i ve tried so many products  with small results  until now  truskin is a game changer  my skin has cleared up and my scars are starting to fade  i feel like my skin is less oily now and a lot more fresh  i use it in the morning and night after i wash my face  ordering another bottle now because i m nearing the end of my first one  this is one product that has now become a staple in my house  thanks  truskin  kelly     
53,1.0 ,                       this made me break out horribly  it s been a couple weeks since i ve used it but my skin is still purging      
54,3.0 ,                       i ve been using this product for just about two weeks now  for your reference  i have hyperpigmentation on my cheeks due to acne  i ve been using this vitamin c serum to try and get rid of these dark spots  so far    nothing really  but i know that hyperpigmentation takes time so in the meantime  i m just going to apply my sunscreen and finish this bottle  i ll update my review if i see more progress   or not i use about     drops every morning  i wouldn t use it as a moisturizer  the scent doesn t bother me  also  i have dry skin and it doesn t irritate my skin or break me out      
55,5.0 ,                       this product changed my life  i now leave the house without makeup but feel confident because this serum gives me such glowing skin with an even complexion  this is must for me every morning after my cleanser and before my moisturizer  they use a good stabilizer because the vitamin c doesn t oxidate over time in the bottle  i m now on my second bottle and plan to keep buying  i have normal to dry skin type for the record      
56,5.0 ,                       i think every woman is nervous about adding a new step to their skin care routine  i did try a patch of skin first and prayed  that when i woke up it would not be a scary sight  i m pleasantly surprised  i have used obaji and all levels of professional grade skin care ointments and serums  i have noticed a positive difference in my overall glow  my pore size and slight skin imperfections  i highly suggest that you give it a try  please trust this is my honest direct feedback  i still use all my other skin care at night  but love this new addition  good luck      
57,1.0 ,                       this serum turned my skin bright red and swollen   i also used a very thin layer under my eyes which caused them to swell   i might have had this reaction because i also use prescription topicals for rosacea   i m glad so many others have seen great results  and i m bummed it doesn t work with my skin     
58,5.0 ,                       this product actually works   i ve tried so many products to lighten my dark spots on my face   bobbi brown  chanel  lancome  givenchy  mario badescu and i m sure many more   i googled best vitamin c for your skin and this popped up   i read the reviews and ordered it   the first month i didn t see a lot of difference in fact  i had a bit of itchy reaction to it   erica  from truskin emailed me and asked how it was going with the new product   i told her i felt i wasn t seeing a difference   so she offered to send me a second bottle free of charge   i got the second bottle   i kept using it day and night as erica instructed   i no longer had the itchiness and at the end of the second bottle  i looked in the mirror and a dark patch that i had on my face since my first daughter was born     years  was gone   seriously   gone   i wasn t even paying a lot of attention to see it fade   it was just gone    honestly i couldn t believe it   i know there s no miracle for anti aging unless your cindy crawford  but this worked    i was so happy     i ve ordered my third bottle and ordered the retinol   i also got my mother and best friend to order it   i m in marketing folks  so i understand the gimmicks  i understand the propaganda   but truskin did what it said and  erica was supportive and provided the best customer service i ve had in a long time    i would order this and dedicate yourself to using it   you may not see results right away  but you will see results   i m still amazed that a product worked exactly like it said it would        
59,5.0 ,                       ive looked into  and bought  several serums and  supposed  instant result skin creams and serums and haven t been too pleased by most  after i purchased the vitamin c serum made by truskin i noticed a significant change in the way my skin felt and looked  i use it with another hyaluronic acid serum  but i love this product  i have extremely sensitive skin so i was afraid to use anything new in fear of reaction  especially hyaluronic acid  but i haven t had any bad reactions at all and my face feels hydrated without the use of an added moisturizer  the cost is great and being a skeptic from previously failed products i didn t believe a few drops would really cover my whole face and neck  but it really does  i would definitely recommend this product as well as purchase from truskin in the future  their customer service is also fantastic  within just a few days of receiving it i was contacted  by a real person  to see how it was working for me  so  long story short  if you re looking for high quality  affordable skin care products with great customer service look no further  by the way   i am in no way paid or compensated by my statement just to be clear  i m just a normal woman who wants to pass on the word of products that really work in a sea of those that don t      
60,5.0 ,                       i am adding my review to this unknown brand on amazon which you come across i have used my first bottle of this serum and i have had noticeable results  like really good  i am not comfortable sharing my pics and i didn t take before after either  but people have noticed the change and they don t know that i have using this now  you know why this product has so many positive reviews just follow the instructions of making the most of vitamin c i have ordered my second bottle

64,5.0 ,                       i have been so pleased by this product  it is one of the best decisions i have made for my skin  i try to use it every night  i m working on a better routine but i can be lazy   i like the fact that you mention in multiple areas and multiple times that the product maybe clear to cloudy  i like the viscosity of it  it s not too watery or too think and doesn t feel sticky  i am overall very happy with this product  thank you for making such a great product   and i need to add that i m almost    with adult acne and this has helped clear up almost     of it      
65,2.0 ,                       i read all the glowing reviews  i can only think now that they were free testers  this was definitely not worththe      i spent  i tried it exactly    days thinking if i gave it time it would start working  i didn t see any glow  i actually started gettinf acne when i rarely have the occasional pimple  on the   th day i accidentally brushed the bottle mid application and the glass shattered all over my sink  i had no choice but to throw it away but i didn t feel bad because it probably needed that  i bought the neutrogena serum with the hydraulic acid immediate results  acne clearing after one application    like this one should have been  very disappointed in this purchase      
66,5.0 ,                         wk into this   so far i am very impressed    i live in florida  sw soo surprised when i woke up to a few age spots on my face on morning now frantically during this forced stay in  i have tried various moisturizers  so  disenchanted by all of it i i thought why not just vitamin c with moisturizer so happy i saw this   carefully read the reviews they were true  my skin looks  feels tighter  brighter and to my delight no dark shadows    that along with my new found cream in  wk have lighten age spots on the backs of my hands  i am a young     and working magic on my face        
67,5.0 ,                       i like the way the products feel on my skin  not greasy or clumpy feeling  i have sensitive and oily skin and many products that i have tried over the years have irritated my skin  it has been discouraging to spend the money on a product and then having to throw it away i have used a few other vitamin c products and it seems my skin responds favorably  i really like that these products are reasonably priced and affordable      
68,5.0 ,                       updated dec       i gave this product   stars back in november  as usual  i wasn t expecting to hear back from the seller  to my surprise  i was contacted in less than    hours by erica  not only that truskin refunded the whole price and let me keep the product   i didn t ask for any of this   but they asked me how my skin is to help me find a product that may work better  i replied  and they sent me a full size of a less concentrated vitamin c to try for free   again  i never asked for any of these  it didn t event crossed my mind    and no  nobody offer me anything in exchange for my opinion  i understand we all have different kinds of skin  this serum may not be for me  but if so many people swears by it  it may work for you as well   in any case  please give truskin a try  they truly stand behind their products                                         i started applying this serum   truskin retinol about a month ago and haven t noticed any difference   i tried to use it once at night without the moisturizer  and my skin felt dry and itchy  since the reviews in amazon are so good   i gave it another try by itself on another day  but same thing happened   my skin was so itchy i had to wash it throughly   besides those two instances  i haven t seen any bad reactions on my skin  as long as i use it with the retinol cream   so i plan on finishing the little bottle to see if i get any results      
69,5.0 ,                       after a lot of research  i decided to purchase this serum  for the reasonable price in comparison to some that sell for       i am glad i chose this as the first serum that i have ever bought  acne is not as big of a concern to me as dehydration and texture are  what i love about this serum is that it helped give my skin the moisture it needed without making my t zone any more oily than what it was to begin with  as well as smoothing it out i loved adding this to my morning and night skincare routine  i start by using cerave cleanser  the body shop tea tree oil  neutrogena oil free acne stress control tone rat night  thayers witch hazel aloe vera toner in the morning  this serum  and then neutrogena hydro boost hyaluronic acid hydrating face moisturizer gel cream  this skincare routine has helped my skin a lot  i have combination skin type and acne that usually flares up before after my period and during stressful times i know this has been an earful to read  but if you re like me  i love reading other people s skincare routines so i can find what works the best      
70,4.0 ,                       me la puse por la noche segui las indicaciones y al instante sientes una piel suave y agradable  pero al otro dia esta aspera y rasposa como despellejada tuve que irme al extremo y usar vaselina todo el dia en mi cara para que me hidratara y hasta al tercer dia se me quito esa sensacion de aspera y rasposa a mi no me funciono jamas volveria a usar este producto  es muy agresivo para la piel y no soy de piel sensible ni con acne por eso pense que resultaria se contacto conmigo el vendedor y realmente fue muy amable  me recomendo un producto para mi tipo de piel  estoy segura que es el que necesito  tienen un buen servicio al cliente       
71,5.0 ,                       absolutely love the serum  so far it is the next one  i ve used so far  i ve used high end such as ole henriksen and sunday riley  and cheaper ones found on amazon at tjmaxx    i have dry  sensitive skin  mild eczema  and it gives my face and extra boost and hydration throughout the day   i use it before applying my moisturizer and before my sheet masks at night  i definitely recommend it to my close friends and all you strangers on amazon   thank you and purchasing again and again      
72,4.0 ,                       i have the kind of skin where anything leaves a scar  i could scratch my chin and wake up with a scar  so as imagine  this product had its work cut out  i ve been using the product for about   months and i have noticed significant improvements to my scarring  i use it twice a day  all my scarring isn t gone  but i feel so much more confident  i no longer have to cake on super heavy foundation  and reapply later to keep my scarring from showing   i ve even gone out in public with foundation  can t even tell you when i ve done that before   i am glad i have added this product to my skincare routine and i m excited to continually see improvements to my skin the only reason why i gave it   stars is because it is a tad drying  and i did break out some at first  that being said  i already have extremely dry skin to begin with and it isn t uncommon that my skin breaks out when i add a new product      
73,5.0 ,                       so i was super scared to try this because some people claimed some of the reviews were paid for  which i m not sure if they were or not  but anyway i almost didn t buy this because of that  then last minute i decided i was gonna buy it and try it anyways  so i did     before i say anything i want to say this  it drys out your face   if you use  moisturize  okay back to my review  so at first i honestly didn t notice a difference  but to be fair  i have super clear skin  i ve never struggled with acne  i only get like a pimple every now and then  so it s difficult to judge for me  but i kept using it with my normal routine  i ll put that at the end   i didn t notice a real difference for a while other than my face looked a little brighter  but it wasn t breaking out my face so i kept using it  well i forgot about it for a few weeks and stopped using it  then last weekend i had a bad breakout on both sides of my face from wearing my mask  the first   pics are of that    i never get breakouts like this so it scared me  well that night i went home  washed my face  put the serum on  moisturized  and by the next morning my face already was pretty clear  i still had like   pimples  but it was bad and over night it cleared up so well  since then i ve made sure not to skip a night  again remember i don t have a sensitive face or acne  so our experiences with it could be very different that last picture is me today    days later  with a little make up  my face is clear again thankfully  here s my routine for my face for reference    wash with face wash  i use biore rose gold face wash and wash my face while in the shower   dry face   put on vitamin c serum i put just enough to cover my face remember this serum drys out your face     moisturizei like cetaphil  i always moisturize  but do it for sure if using the serum because it will dry out your face every morning i take vitamins and throughout the day i drink   bottles of water  this helps so much more with your skin than you think i take the hair  skin  and nails vitamins  vitamin c    vitamin d i also occasionally do dermaplaning  research it and your skin type before you try though      
74,4.0 ,                       ok  so at  st  i was not so sure about this product and i was planning on writing a negative review   i gave it a few weeks and you know what   it s good   really good   it s been good on my face but the test was on my neck  i m      a young    but not as youthful for my age as say julia dreyfus or julianne moore  one of my issues that gives me a way is that i have loose skin on my neck   it s so demoralizing   this stuff helped   it actually helped   i use a little morning and night after washing my neck area and it s made a difference   i still have almost a half a bottle left and i m looking to try ascorbic acid products  so if i get another one of these it won t be for a while   we ll see if this one is better  as good or even not as good as the other ones i plan on trying   in the meantime  this one is a good one      
75,5.0 ,                       i bought this sometime last year in      and never used it consistently until lately and i m actually seeing a difference i think  i looked in the mirror one morning  moments before writing this review  and noticed that my face looked brighter  more refreshed  then i remembered that i ve been using this serum every day lately so i m pretty sure it s doing something  because this is a serum  i put it on and let it dry before putting my daily moisturizer      
76,5.0 ,                       i received my first bottle and it had leaked  truskin immediately stepped in and saw to it that i was taken care of i have used the product on my face  neck  and chest for   days and i cannot believe it  with one use my face was brighter  after   days  the sun spots on my chest show     improvement  i m not kidding  it s remarkable i have used expensive ceramicide creams and have never had results like this  i will be using this product and others from this company from now on truskin  thank you for stellar customer service      
77,5.0 ,                       i began using this product april of         years later and my skin has been renewed   i love this product so much  if you are of a darker complexion and suffer from hyperpigmentation i would definitely recommend this product  it s been a life saver            
78,5.0 ,                       it is rare to have a company reach out to you to make sure you are pleased with your purchase or have any questions i was pleasantly surprised at the degree of customer service that i received from truskin   that being said  this vitamin c serum is a keeper there was an immediate tightening effect on my    year old skin and after using this morning and night for several days i can see a luster and brightening to my face already  i have a few smile and forehead lines that i m hoping will be lessened as i continue to use this product  when i put on my foundation and concealer i found that it was seamless and smooth going on and any coverage i needed was minimal  my skin had a more refined look i can t wait to try some of their other products and will post more reviews when i do so      
79,5.0 ,                       love this serum  i had been wanting to switch up my skin care route and stumbled upon this product  after doing some research on the benefits of a vitamin c serum i thought i would give it a try  i didn t really have any specific issues with my skin but was just looking to switch things up  after about a week of using this i noticed a difference  it completely brightened up my completion and helped minimize my pores  i ve gotten a ton of compliments on my skin recently  love this  will continue to use and highly recommend      
80,2.0 ,                       i tried this serum because i m looking for a serum to help lighten age spots  i wanted to like this based on the reviews that i read and for the price i thought it was perfect  i tried this for two weeks and while i know it takes a while for products to work but i can t make it work  the first few days of using this serum i didn t have a problem but after the  rd day or so my face started drying out and i started to get bumps on my face  i did use moisturizer but my face was still drying out  when i stopped using the serum it took me a couple days to recover from it but eventually my skin went back to normal  it s been a couple of weeks now since i ve used the serum and i don t know if i want to try it out again  i really wanted to like this serum but it just didn t work good for me like it did for other buyers  i m glad it worked out for other customers      
81,3.0 ,                       i personally didn t see any benefits from using this  but it didn t cause any ill effects either  admittedly i could have stuck with it longer but it just felt like an unnecessary step in the routine after awhile  the packaging was very nice either way      
82,5.0 ,                       i have dry skin that is rash prone  winter tends to be rough for me as my cheeks look permanently flushed  not in a good way  and i get dry patches around my nose and between my brows  i did not have high hopes for this serum but with all the positive reviews i figured i d give it a try i m glad i did  i noticed a significant reduction in both rash and dryness  and my skin felt smoother  i d use it at night after washing my face and before applying moisturizer  cetaphil for dry skin  and they worked wonders together  i put it down to just past my collar bone and the skin there also feels rejuvenated  thumbs up from someone who s skin does not take kindly to most things      
83,5.0 ,                       alright  when i turned    i knew it was time to get serious about my skin care  and by  serious   i mean start an actual routine that is not just soap and water  in addition to a real cleanser  buh bye dove    toner and moisturizer  i ve been using this on my face every night before bed  it s been two weeks and i ve already received two genuine compliments about my skin looking great  that may not mean a lot to you  but one of them was from my mom who is the most critical and judgmental person i know on earth  and she hates giving compliments  absolutely hates it  and yet my skin has made such an improvement that she just couldn t help herself  amazing  i have noticed that my skin is softer and doesn t look as dull  so that s pretty cool for just two weeks  will definitely continue using      
84,4.0 ,                       updated review giving it   stars because of great customer service  product didn t work for me  everyone s skin is different   but true skin customer service had a courtesy to reach out to me and ask me if i wanted the money back since i wasn t pleased with the product  i could just return the product and ask for money back myself but didn t feel it was worth of my time for       they also explained why product might not work for some people and some info about but c previous review i gave it   star because this serum leaves my skin super dry  i have oily t zone  and can t use creams because of that  maybe because i live in arizona  this serum leaves my skin dry like a paper  i gave it   week try  i do not recommend this if you have a skin already prone to dryness  maybe this company has different product that will work better for you   i didn t have any bad reaction or redness      
85,5.0 ,                       third time i ve ordered   this is an amazing potion  i m over     and was blessed with good skin genes     but no matter what  time will tell i use this  sparingly  around my eyes and forehead  then my neck and mouth area   any extra i rub on the top of my hands  i let it dry before putting on moisturizer  i can feel it tighten a bit when it s dry i ve definitely seen a difference in the appearance of my skin  the texture is smooth  i ve lost the gray look i used to have  it just looks and feels better   and softened the lines around my eyes and mouth i ve been using it for quite awhile  when my complexion gets complimented  i m asked what i use  this is it  it s not meant for moistuizing dry skin so i couldn t give   stars in that      
86,5.0 ,                       i have been using this serum for a little bit now and it s just amazing  i was a little skeptical at first as i have sensitive skin that normally breaks out with any change  environmental  skin care routine  etc   so  i did start slowly using it once a day  and i was eventually able to get up to twice a day  which to me was the real game changer since then i have purchased this for gifts for almost everyone i know  it does contain a lot of botanicals and i have only heard from one friend who couldn t use it due to her severe allergies   so if you have allergies read the ingredients before you purchase other than that  it s been great for me and for my friends          
87,4.0 ,                       the serum is light and doesn t feel sticky  i put it on after my toner and before my moisturizer  my skin looked brighter overall right away  i have some heavy melasma on my cheeks and jaw line that i am trying to see if it will help fade some  i have been using it about   weeks so i will probably go through one more  oz bottle and see what it looks like at     weeks  it seems like one  oz bottle should last about   or   weeks depending on how much you use      drops is plenty for each use morning and night  overall it is a good addition to my daily skincare routine so far      
88,5.0 ,                       short version  helped with some flaking but still want to add a moisturizer skin type  comboi need a little bit more moisture  but intend to  continue using this drys fast  feels smooth on my face  sticky on my fingers  not tight feeling  no stinging  no redness  no rashes  burning  etc i ve been playing around with skin care  learned  seriously you can t use body lotion on your face  i had stopped when i got this  and only used this and makeup  couple days later my face was looking better  it wasn t tight or dry    just didn t feel moisturized  so  i applied some lotion i had to my face  next day    dry and flaky again  stopped with that  and order some face moisturizer  in the couple of days it took to deliver my face did heal again why i think this helped rather than just not using the wrong lotion    reasons i had this  in by    in strip on my hand  back side above the knuckles  that had become mildly burned or whatever from an airbag  it was super dry and flaky  i could feel it every time i touched my face  from nose tickles   anyways    for a couple of days  i also applied some of this to that spot that wasn t healing  it helped it  smooth again the  nd reason i think my face doesn t look as irritated  raw and red      
89,5.0 ,                       so i m on my third bottle of this and i finally figured out how to use it  i bought my first bottle over a year ago and at first i was just using it sporadically  by itself at night  i took a break from it because i like more of a moisturizing feeling and i wasn t seeing any changes to my skin  folks   you have to fully commit to see a difference    i started applying morning and night  once i let it dry  a couple of minutes  i then apply lush full of grace serum bar and that locks the moisturizer back in  after using consistently for about   months  i m seeing fine lines on my forehead disappear  i m seeing pores on my nose shrink so now no more blackheads  i m seeing an overall brightness too   when you apply it has a nice tight light dryness feeling to it  but i would suggest adding another layer of moisturizer  think of this serum as something that tightens  i m     with combination skin  dry oily   my problem areas are my forehead  sunburned way too much in my   s    s   give it a try    i m hooked now      
90,3.0 ,                       i wanted to like this product  i really  really  really did  with a ton of positive reviews i just had to try it  unfortunately  i went through two bottles of it and didn t see any change to my skin  i m unimpressed  i m glad it helped so many other people  but it s not for me update  i have since upgraded my original rating from two stars to three based only off the excellent customer service i received after posting my review  so truly  it s   stars for the product itself  but five huge stars for the customer service shortly after posting i received an email from erica  a truskin naturals representative  offering a full refund and a free bottle of a different product to try  having worked in customer service based jobs for most of my career  i am truly impressed by those who go above and beyond for their customers because the truth is they don t have to do that  not only did i have a wonderful  and unexpected  customer service experience  but i also really like the toner that was sent to me  it all worked out and i am very happy thanks to erica      
91,5.0 ,                       finally  a product that works  i never had acne issues until now  i m    years old    i developed butt acne leaving horrible acne scars  since september      i ve been trying different peodicts   home remedies  nothing worked  this product helped diminishing those scars and i m so happy to get my derriere back  not just that but it worked with hyperpigmentation areas for me  super recommend this product if you are looking to improve skin tone appearance  i wish i could post pics of my results  but i don t think amazon will allow us to show butt pics  lol     
92,1.0 ,                       i ordered this product because of all the good reviews and i regret it  i ve struggled with acne and hyperpigmentation for a long time  and recently my skin started to get better and my face cleared up  after using this product my skin broke out everywhere even in my forehead  an area i never break out in  and for those wondering  yes i did a patch test and nothing happened  but after using it for a few days my skin began to break out in multiple areas  it became very dry  and now i have multiple dark spots on my face because of the breakout  i am very heartbroken because it took years for my skin to clear up and now it s ruined all because of this product  i wish i never bought it in the first place       
93,5.0 ,                       i originally bought this product for my sister  who is turning    this year  as a little gift  she seemed to really like the product and when quarantine hit and i couldn t get my usually skin care items  i decided to give it a try this  is  the  best  serum  i  have  ever  used i m    and have used a range of products over the years  from drugstore brands to high end and this blows everything out of the water this tightens and brightens like no other  i m even contemplating not getting botox anymore because i feel like my skin is just softened enough with this product alone i wash my face in the morning and evening and use it afterwards each time  in the morning i wear it under my makeup and in the evening  i put it on and then use a rose quartz facial roller to make sure my skin can really absorb it will continue to incorporate this into my skincare and so  so happy i tried this product      
94,5.0 ,                       i m    years old   the last couple years i suffer from rosacea every now   then  it s across my checks  it s horrible   embarrassing looking   i couldn t figure out why i was getting it  i went to the dr   he was much help  the creams he gave me burned my face  so  i started to do some research   wanting something more orangic i have very sensitive skin   i came across derma rolling   while searching derma rolling  i came across truskin  i ordered the derma roller with truskin vit c serum   truskin vit c moisturizer   let me tell you    it has been a game changer  people noticed right away how smooth  clear   glowly my skin was  i don t use it daily  i m bad about it  but when my skin acts up  i use derma roller   use truskin   my rosacea disappears in about       hours  sometimes i would suffer for weeks  so a big thank you to truskin      
95,1.0 ,                       update            i was contacted   sent a newer bottle of the vitamin c  doesn t look like spit  but it is cloudy   smells weird  i have used the vitamin c on my face for a few weeks now  applying every   days  i am not impressed  other vitamin c serums my skin has glowed  it helped with the pimples   imperfections  but it has helped my bestie with her acne rosacea a bit less redness  i appreciate getting the new bottle but this is not the right serum for my skin  and i appreciate that the seller reached out   sent me another bottle  but after the  nd bottle this isn t the product for me i don t even know how to describe this   maybe my bottle is an  oops  bottle  but this looks cloudy   like a bunch of spit in the bottle  i ll take a picture to see if it will show  i try to put drops on my face but it grosses me out because it looks like spit  like the bottle was shaken   never settled  i m truly disappointed with this product especially for the price      
96,1.0 ,                       i bought  truskin vitamin c serum  about a month ago to give a try to a new product  since its a best selling product on amazon  first  it delivered in very unprofessional packing  in plastic bubble wrap   second  i did not see any instructions and quantity to use truskin vitamin on the face  and no ingredients description on the bottle as well  third  there wasn t even a single booklet with it  fourth  no measurement on the sign on the dropper that how much you are using  lastly  it gave me itchiness on the skin after using just for one week  as well as the little redness  so  i would highly recommend not to buy  truskin vitamin c serum   i tried to contact customer service as they promise money back and customer satisfaction  but no reply  zero customer service  invest in better brand because end of the day it s all about your body      
97,5.0 ,                       i have used a full bottle  lasted   months  and am ready to provide my review  i did not notice any change for the first month but in my second month i started to see that my skin was little brighter  less sunspots and firmer like it used to be when i was younger  i am a    years old woman and have made real effort to better take care of my skin  i use this in the morning after shower and at night before i go to bed  i then apply either sunscreen moisturizer or night cream on top   i just ordered my second bottle  i highly recommend this product to be added to your skincare ritual      
98,1.0 ,                       not a fan  looks like curdled low fat yogurt  after a few seconds it dries on my face and becomes stiff  does not moisturize me at all  quite the opposite  i m glad it wasn t too expensive cause i won t end using it anymore  i guess you get what you pay for      
99,5.0 ,                       i wouldn t have believed this unless i tried it myself  but this serum has changed my face in approximately   days  probably more like overnight  i had developed acne along my jawline about a year ago and nothing has helped  i tried acne medication  not taking acne medication  stopped using toner  changed toner  changed moisturizer  stopped using moisturizer    nothing helped  i also use a new clean washcloth every day and wash my face morning and night  i got this on monday and today is saturday and really  almost instantly  the acne has all disappeared  i really am shocked  this stuff is a miracle worker      
100,5.0 ,                       if you are looking for a sign    this is it buy it  this stuff is amazing  you know how they always say eat healthy and workout and your skin will be better    yeah they must not know about this stuff  i will continue to enjoy my tacobell with clear skin thanks to this  amen      
101,5.0 ,                       i normally do not take time to write reviews but am constantly reading them prior to ordering products  you can probably tell by my headliner that this stuff truly works and i am so thrilled that i purchased this vitamin c serum  i hate to confess that i am a pimple popper and by having this nasty  bad habit  i tend to leave scars or dark discolorations on my face jawline area  i definitely saw results within a few days of how this product had started to lighten my imperfections  again  this is truly the best serum that i have come across in years     even better than any natural remedy or store bought product i have attempted to put on my face      
102,3.0 ,                       so far ive been using this product for   weeks now once a day  i havent seen any results  ive had problems with dark spots freckles that i just want it to fade  havent seen any difference since using it and im quite disappointed   so i have been using c plus serum by truskin     times a week  so far ive been using it for about almost   weeks now  i have been dealing with dark spots freckles that seemed to be getting more overtime  i do see some difference since using this new serum that was recommended to me by a truskin rep and i do notice my skin feels more smoother  still hopeful it will fade my dark spots while i continue using this product  i do am very thankful for the representarive that contacted me and recommended this new product for my dark spots  they have excellent customer service even gave me this new  product for free to try for my type of skin since the first one i had purchased did not work for me      
103,4.0 ,                       i started using this product along with my skin care routine   i really love this product   it gives my skin a really nice healthy glow  not oily looking    this has to be used with a moisturizer   i usually clean my face  pat dry  then put on this solution   i wait a     hour before applying moisturizer   this solution is not oily   very light   but can t be used alone   you still need to apply moisturizer   i bought a bottle for my daughter    but she has acne prone skin   she still has cyclic acne outbreaks  but not as severe      
104,4.0 ,                       i purchased this for the severe hyperpigmentation around my eyes  i have eczema and some of the cream i ve used have caused the skin to discolor and darken  i ve been using the product a few weeks now and am noticing a good improvement in the texture and color of my skin  my daughter asked me the other day if i had makeup on and i said no  she replied how good my skin looked  i haven t heard a compliment like that in a long time  i use the product twice a day as suggested  after i clean and tone  i will definitely continue to purchase this product as it is now a staple in my daily skin care regimen  also  as stated above i do have eczema and this is sensitive enough that it causes no irritation to my extremely sensitive skin  so if you have sensitive skin do the patch test as recommended  but know it works well on my sensitive skin      
105,4.0 ,                       i did just order my  nd bottle  i can t tell you if it s helping or not  but it s not hurting  this is the first vitamin c serum i ve tried  i don t recall how it came on my radar the good  price doesn t hurt or sting or breakout my sensitive skin bottle lasts a long time  i use it once daily  first thing on in the morning     ml bottle has lasted me over a year  just purchased my  nd  it doesn t dry my skin and i live in the desert so this is importanti am told i have very good  skin for my age and i agree  i use a lot of stuff including from the dermatologist so hard to say what contributes to it   but tons of water and sunscreen are my best friends cons  just check the expiration date  my first bottle arrived aug       the expriration date was dec      with a    month logo on bottle if you look for it  i have still not finished this bottle and use it everyday  is it bad for my skin  is it not working on my skin  i don t know  but my  nd bottle that just arrived has an expiration of de       so i should be fine i could have switched brands when this bottle was up  i ve seen others mentioned by some beauty influencers  but i decided to stick with this one  again  if it s not broke  don t fix it and drink lots of water            
106,5.0 ,                       i added this into my rigorous skincare regime  using it two times daily  morning and night   from the day that i received it my skin is overall pretty clear but i had a couple of dark spots  acne scars  that i wanted to get rid of  i noticed a difference in my skin on about the second week after using the serum for several weeks  my skin is completely clear of dark spots and is fairly even  it s much more clear and has this newfound glow i plan to give the eye gel a try next      
107,5.0 ,                       i purchased this serum at the recommendation of my dermatologist  i was looking for a skin care plan that would address my aging skin  fine lines and sun spots uneven tone  my skin was not bad  but i was using a bunch of products w no real strategy  and spending a lot of money  dermatologist told me to throw everything away and use a good vitamin c serum every day with a spf    sunscreen  retinol at night followed by a good  basic moisturizer  she said to look for a highly rated vitamin c serum  that s how i found truskin and i am so glad i did three months later and my skin tone is definitely more vibrant and healthy looking  sun patches are fading noticeably  pores appear smaller  last month i started following the vitamin c serum with the truskin hyaluronic serum  skin feels more      springy  that s the only way i can describe it i saw a youtube video reviewing this product  commenting on the texture feel as the product dries on your skin  my answer to this is  it s no big deal  feels a little tight  but  as recommended  follow with a basic moisturizer and it s not even an issue  makeup goes on just fine   lately i don t wear much foundation at all   just concealer  that s how good my skin looks  i recently attended a big family party and received many compliments on my skin    you never get any older    you look amazing   is something different  i highly recommend this product not only for the consistent quality and results  but also for the excellent customer support  emails checking in to see if i was satisfied  downloadable  product guide pdf  etc really happy w truskin      
108,1.0 ,                       sticky  very drying  break outs everywhere  and eyes puffed up as it caused an allergic reaction   beware please b c this product ruined my skin   it took   weeks for skin to get back to baseline   i have used other vit c products and have never had this happen   you get what you pay for   stick to reputable brands with truly organic ingredients   pass on this one      
109,2.0 ,                       i m in my late   s with some sun damage  wrinkles  and an oily complexion  i use a glycolic acid wash daily  retin a       three times a week  and a physical sunscreen daily  i used this serum pretty much every morning for two and a half months  i expected to see a bit of a difference in discoloration and wrinkles  especially because my sun exposure has only declined this winter  but i really can t see an effect  of course  i don t have replicates and didn t leave an untreated patch of skin as a control  mostly feel it s important to record this because i think many of these reviews are inflated  i noticed fakespot says this product had a major review purge in late       and the adjusted reviewer rating is a  c       
110,5.0 ,                       i m going to start off by saying i never write reviews about anything  which is pretty backwards because i m the first one to read reviews about every product i use  but i just had to write something about this product  it s god sent    i ve tried everything from top of the line to drugstore brands  and i kid you not this product works     i am a    year old african american female who has always struggled with hyperpigmentation  i had dark slots all over my face  it was so bad i didn t want my boyfriend to seed my true skin when i woke up in the morning  that s how bad it was   i could sneeze wrong and scratch my face and it would leave a mark forever  so i was desperate to find something that actually works for me without breaking my skin out due to me sensitive skin on top of hyperpigmentation  i read several reviews about this product and saw i few pictures and i was sold  but i still wasn t sure if this product would work for me so i said  what do i have to lose it s only         and i practically bought everything else out there on the market so why not give it a try   within a couple of days i started to notice a difference in the texture of my skin and after a couple of weeks i started to notice my dark spots fading on my face  omg  is this really working  i said to myself  and fast forward   months later i have only one dark spot on my face and that is a tiny one on my  forehead due to scratching a pimple recently  now this product is a must have and truskin vitamin c serum is truly a blessing  thank you so much to the genius who created this product for people out there struggling with my same issues  thank you  i am a customer for life           
111,3.0 ,                       i tried this one and the mad hippie vitamin c serum right before this one and i will say that i like the mad hippie one better  this one has bubbles in the serum hat are always there and i feel like the dropper doesn t pick up that much of the serum   maybe because of the bubbles  it does feel nice on my skin but when i first opened it  it does have a little bit of a weird smell  i think i m used to it now  but i still prefer the mad hippie one      
112,1.0 ,                       the only difference i notice after   months of daily use is the return of brown spots   prior to using this  i used obagi professional     vit c serum   my brown spots lightened but were always still faintly there   since using truskin  my brown spots have darkened and i m seeing new faint ones   so i guess obagi was working after all   sorry  this stuff isn t     vit c   the company did refund my money as they promised      
113,5.0 ,                       i ve used this at night for    days  i didn t do a before after  but i can honestly say that when my kid took a picture of me the other day  it looked like he added a filter  literally my skin looks ridiculously better  i m     i grew up a beach baby and live in las vegas now    i m in the sun daily  i swear on    bibles that this stuff has easily taken off    years from my face  literally i use probably           of the dropper  definitely not just a couple drops  it could be because it is so dry here  after applying this  i use black seed oil to moisturize  that s my sum total of skin care  i m sold for life      
114,2.0 ,                       no immediate improvement  but i did break out  for reference  my skin is not highly sensitive  and i have used a serum before that provided amazing results and no break out  so i was hoping this would do the same since my cystic acne flared back up and i m suffering the results  but the last thing i wanted was more problems on skin that s already covered in scars and blemishes  i never expect miracles  always give products time  and always use as directed  i will update if i see improvement before i start accutane  but so far  no good      
115,5.0 ,                       i am currently halfway through my  nd bottle  i use this consistently day and night before my moisturizer  the only time i do not use it is when i am exposed to the elements in the outdoors during the day  this is not a quick solution because it takes time to really clear and even out your face  but i did see quite a difference within two weeks  my skin is so much softer thanks to the hyaluronic acid   smoother  has cleared up dramatically  i look like i could have foundation on when i really don t  as someone who loves makeup  it s nice that i can just dab concealer under my eye and fix my eyebrows lashes  and walk out the door  i don t wear foundation when i travel to extremely hot and humid places  this vitamin c serum has made my skin look amazing  the price is totally worth it  not the cheapest  but not the most expensive either  i am a customer for life      
116,5.0 ,                       i must tell you  i was skeptical  i didn t expect much from a        product on amazon  i ve tried everything and i just couldn t find what works for me  my goodness  this has been the best        i ve ever spent  i have spent hundreds of dollars on toners moisturizers   cleansers etc that claimed to be able to clear my hyperpigmentation  this was the only thing that did it for me  you gave me my life back  i am confident now  i am able to face the world strong and at full force whereas before i hid in the shadows  thank you for creating this product and for existing  you have given me so much more than just a product  thank you  thank you  thank you      
117,5.0 ,                       works well  i usually use a bit of acne cream on specific areas of my face because of tiny breakouts  while using the vitamin c serum  i kept forgetting to put the acne cream on  but the trouble spots went away  the old acne scars are also fading very gradually  but still fading  customer service is also great  i was contacted by erica from truskin asking how i liked the product   i mentioned there are small white granules in it  they haven t bothered me  and i use it anyway  but thought it was weird  erica told me its undissolved vitamin c  and that its perfectly alright  but also offered to send me a replacement product  so product works well and customer service is great  i m very happy with the product and plan to buy other things from them      
118,4.0 ,                       so far  i am super pleased with this product and feel that i would order it again when it s gone   i ve used it every day for the last couple of weeks   and i feel like it s helping   i have a lot of sun spots on my face and some wrinkling on my neck  so those are the areas that i m watching   it honestly looks like the wrinkles on my neck are diminishing   the sun spots   not sure  but maybe a little more time will show some fading   regardless  it feels nice when applied   not oily  or heavy at all       
119,5.0 ,                       amazing product that really helped me in the last       days itself  i wouldn t claim overnight results or anything  but over time and usage as recommended twice a week  i can really see the changes i love how it makes my skin look and feel  helped me with adult acne as well  that was my biggest bane of existence  i never had acne as a teenager and to battle it at this age wasn t something i was expecting  tried a lot of over the counter products and then some prescription meds  but what really helped me stop them from appearing was this serum i diligently read all the reviews and was so very skeptical of the purchase  but i am glad that i bit the bullet and bought it  the great thing about this is the product isn t very pricey but still works wonders i have already recommended this to all the ladies in the family  go for it      
120,5.0 ,                       i purchased this serum to use after dermarolling my stretch marks from pregnancy  i did a    hour test on my belly before starting the dermarolling  and the hyperpigmentation i have on my belly button and my linea nigra faded by about      i ve been applying bio oil  vitamin e  and exfoliating for   weeks with no success  and wasn t even expecting this to work on the pigment i will add to this review once i see  or don t see  any changes regarding the stretchmarks  but amazed to see these unexpected results so soon      
121,5.0 ,                       my first order contained the vitamin c serum   i loved how it made my skin feel   using the serum every other night  the difference was noticeable in just a few days   it s light weight  dries quickly and it not sticky once dry   it has a pleasant  cooling sensation when applied   my skin instantly felt so soft to the touch   i m very happy with this product and look forward to seeing the long term results in the coming months   i will order again because erica s support and customer service is phenomenal    she was extremely responsive and helpful with my questions   i wish truskin would consider expanding their line to makeup products      
122,5.0 ,                       i love it i actually use the tru skin vit c serum   nights a week and the retinol moisturiser  one night a week  i have been using the products for about   months now and my skin has been truly rejuvenated  the vit c product in particular has reduced the dark blemishes on my skin and made my skin more toned  my complexion is the same but brighter   more like glowing  my face still looks alive even when i am tired   my eye area is generally brighter as i used to have dark circles when i am sleep deprived and these would take ages to reverse  now they are barely visible   i used to get rashes during pms but i do not get these anymore  my face is generally feeling looking more youthful  i love itfor context  i am    years old with dark skin      
123,5.0 ,                       i am    years old and have rosacea and acne for   years now  and this product has worked wonders for me     it has helped like nothing ever has before  and that is a lot to say considering that i have had   laser surgery procedures to fix my rosacea  which didn t work  this product helps with my redness and overall skin health for a reasonable price  i love this product and will re purchase for sure   also  their customer service is really amazing      
124,4.0 ,                       i use it in the morning and at night in addition to the daily facial moisturizer and cetaphil daily facial moisturizer with sunscreen when im going about my day in the morning    in one week of use i noticed my acne scars are fading and my face seems to be getting clearer    the dark spots under my eyes from lack of sleep are firming up and are less noticeable    my skin is extremely sensitive and i breakout allergic reaction to a lot of things    so ignore the reviews    read the ingredients    and give it a try    you wont always find what works for your skin on the first try    what works for me might not work for you         
125,5.0 ,                       this product has a million positive reviews but let me just add to the chorus of praise   no one paid for my product or is paying me to write this review   i m a busy lawyer and mom of two young kids and was looking to up my skin care regime   i had used vitamin c in the past but found that it was too concentrated and left my face blotchy and red in spots  so i discontinued it i have been using this product for about a month   i am a woman of color with medium brown skin   when i break out  i am left with scars and hyperpigmentation   this serum slowly but surely is helping those scars fade   they are not gone but i certainly see an improvement perhaps even more importantly  this product has completely cured my breakouts   i never broke out until the pandemic hit  stress eating  perhaps    every time i ate dairy  i would usually have a few pimples a few days later   after using this serum  that never happens anymore   my skin is clear and glowing at this price point  it s not a huge investment and it really works so i certainly recommend giving it a try      
126,5.0 ,                       two weeks in and i m loving how refreshed my skin is looking  i m staring    in the face and i had noticed my skin looking tired  i have crazy sensitive skin  rosacea  eczema  adult acne  and minor skin cancer history  so the products i am able to use are on a very short list  i have used this every morning before i put on my sunscreen for the last two weeks and i love it  my skin tone has evened out and appears and feels less dry  i m hopeful i can also start using more of their products        
127,3.0 ,                       i have only used this for a week  but so far its ok  not great but not bad  compared to drunk elephant c serum or dennis grossman c serum  this falls short  i was hoping to find something that could replace those serums at half the cost  after using this for another   weeks  i think i will switch back to one of the better vitamin c serums and see how much of a difference it makes on my skin vs  cost      
128,5.0 ,                       nice and light  just what i wanted for my aging skin  it is not very cloudy and i m not worried  guess that s the way it s supposed to be  no scent at all  i wonder    i d love to add a drop of orange essential oil to it because i love that scent  but i do not want to take a chance on changing the formula   good price too      
129,1.0 ,                       been using this for two and a half weeks and have noticed nothing so far  makes my skin feel sticky and tight  i tried the hyaluronic acid and it did nothing  thought i d try the vitamin c and i regret my purchase      
130,5.0 ,                       i m always skeptical of any skin care product and claims it may make  but i have seen results from this  i ve been using it twice a day for about three weeks and my skin does look better  i had some very red acne scars on my cheek and chin that look much better  they are still there  but they are much lighter  some of my lighter  less severe scars are barely noticeable at all any more  it hasn t caused me to break out any more than usual  maybe even a little less  but it s hard to say   which is always a concern for me as i have oily  acne prone skin      
131,2.0 ,                       it could be my own fault but i feel a little mislead  when i searched for these   ingredients individually amazon presented how these   things are frequently purchased together for a bulk price  so it made sense to order because it is what i was looking for  except  i was so excited to try them and went i read the bottles more closely i realized that they all have the same ingredients so i really didn t need to purchase all    for example  the hyaluronic acid already has vitamin c so i didn t need to purchase the vitamin c which already contains hyaluronic acid    like i said it could be my own fault  have to pay close attention and read the fine print      
132,3.0 ,                       i did not see any noticeable improvement in my face  in fact  i am now getting dry patches on my skin which i have never experienced in my life   despite having dry skin  i have been using this daily for   weeks followed by all of the intense moisturizers i own and it has turn my face into an irritated mess  really confused at all the rave reviews here   update  erica from the truskin team reached out to me to personally apologize and we had a great conversation around my issues and skin type  i may have a sensitivity to one of the ingredients  she offered some great advice as well as a refund since the product reacted poorly with my skin  excellent customer service      
133,1.0 ,                         days ago  i started incorporating this product in my nightly routine hoping that vitamin c would help my complexion during the cold months      until now  on night    my face has broken out in bumpy rashes covering my entire face  chin and neck  my face feels like sand paper  it s itchy and i have weird dark dry patches that i m now noticing  not sure what ingredients in the product that s making me break out  but my face has never looked bad   i was blessed with really good skin genes  thought i would add a vitamin c serum to keep my young look  but instead i look like i ve morphed into a reptile  i pray my face recovers soon  buyer beware      
134,1.0 ,                       wouldn t recommend this for people with sensitive skin  i have never had skin bumps on my face until i used this product  i did two patch tests before using it on my skin and it was fine  but i guess my face wasn t too happy with the product  i ll be looking for a different vitamin c serum  disappointed that now i have to work on getting these bumps off my face        
135,2.0 ,                       i bought this product based off of a fab review that i read on buzzfeed  the first two bottles were great  consistency was light and it didn t make my face sticky or gummed up  i noted a pleasant citrus smell upon first opening those two bottles   the third month bottle arrived with no scent and was very thick and cloudy the fourth bottle was the same as the third  but i decided to keep with it as the first two bottles had a noticable improvement on my sensitive skin  however    i get near the bottom of the fourth bottle  and i suddenly see the dropper is somehow broken  there are pieces of glass in my serum  i don t move my facial care stuff  everything literally lives in my medicine cabinet  there was no trauma to the bottle to cause the glass to break  i figured i d be okay cause clearly a tiny dropper with no contact would break into a large piece  right  wrong  lots of teeny tiny pieces of glass  the product was clearly already defective  the worst part is that with the inconsistent texture and color  i couldn t see tiny pieces of glass  it all looks like cloudy bubbles  put a bit on my fingers  patted them together to check for foreign material  proceeded slowly  and i m glad i did  i would have had glass in my skin i noted that the best used by date is         on all four bottles i wanted to love this product  i have fair skin  large pores  have lost weight so my skin isn t as tight as most ppls  skin allergies  and psoriasis  so    believe me when i say that i wanted to love this product  two months were great  i can t justify a       purchase at this time  and honestly i m a bit salty to find the glass broken this item has a decent price  so does the ordinary  so does sephora brand  paula s choice is a recent find and excellent  quality control questions like  what color or texture is this supposed to be   are a non issue      
136,5.0 ,                       i had recently lost a family member  my eyes looked tired and more aged  almost overnight  i tried this and immediately saw a difference  the recent fine lines faded and i started to look more like myself  there are a lot of products to choose from  i hope this review helps  because this stuff actually works  i doesn t make my skin feel dry or anything  but i still have to use a moisturizer after i apply it      
137,5.0 ,                       i m sad i didn t do a before and after picture   i m in disbelief that i ve found something that works   since being a teen i ve suffered with  bad skin   prone to breakouts  oily  large pores  scarring   i bought this serum along with a micro needle roller and for the first time my skin is finally clear   i ve got   months before my wedding  and i ve never felt more confident about my complexion   it s smooth  no longer shiny and oily and no more blemishes      
138,4.0 ,                       i like this vitamin c oil and use it consistently  twice daily   it gives my face a nice glow   the oil initially stung my face when i put it on  but after about   weeks  it no longer does it   it is not the potent vitamin c that i used from my dermatologist previously  but it certainly does give your face a glow  and i appear to have a tan after applying it   i have some melatonin on for forehead and have not noticed any change  although it does have hyaluronic acid in it   it is a good product  and a very reasonable price  so i would purchase it again      
139,5.0 ,                       i was very excited to use this product after reading the reviews  i have combination skin and get a few acne every other week  after i began using this products i began breaking out everyday  at first i thought maybe my skin had to get used to it  my skin got worse as i continued using this products  sometimes i would get     acne in a day  i bought   bottles and continue to use them for   weeks  i know that s long but i really  hoping it would get better  but after   weeks my skin was looking terrible  i had acne everywhere and became very self conscious  it s been   weeks now that i have discounted using this product and my skin is clearing up and looking much better  i still have a few acne but it s not everyday that i m getting a new one  i have a lot of acne scars now and wish i stopped using this products earlier  i m happy for those that this product worked for but it wasn t for me  my advice to anyone buying this products    just know it may not work for you the way it worked for others update after my review i was contacted by the company and received a full refund on my purchase  i was not expecting that as i had already considered it a loss  they also provided a  product guide with in depth information on the products they offer and i found it to be very helpful and  it also gave me an idea as to why this product didn t work for me  they also suggested i try i different serum that would be more suitable for my skin type and this product was sent to me free of cost  i am yet to determine how this serum  will work for me but i m super excited and grateful for all they have done for me  providing everything works out great i will be back  this company really takes pride in their products and actually wants the best for you  thank you truskin for taking out the time and listening to your costumers      
140,5.0 ,                       if you are human and have a face  you need this  i m not even kidding  i use this morning and night with additional hyaluronic acid and it has changed my skin  i have sensitive  acne prone skin and this has left it clear and soft and glowing  less fine lines and more brightness  i can t believe this stuff  not sponsored      
141,1.0 ,                       i really wanted this to work   i have hyperpigmentation and thought i had finally found the solution  after reading all of the wonderful reviews  however  i still have not stopped using it and use it as recommended  two times a day  day and night  i have yet to finish the bottle  a little goes a long way and you re only supposed to apply a thin layer  your face still needs to breathe   i can safely say that my face has not broken out while using this other that the normal hormonal break outs as per some of the reviews i have read of this causing breakouts and i do have somewhat sensitive acne prone skin  it will dry out your face a little  vitamin c does that as it moves dead skin to help new skin surface so a good moisturizer is recommended  will keel using in hopes it eventually works but as of now i don t think i would repurchase unless i see a major change      
142,1.0 ,                       item arrived with seal broken and cap unsecured  the product had congealed all over the bottle and packaging and was chunky inside a sticky mess  i don t know if this is amazon or the manufacturer s problem  but amazon is forcing me to return this damaged liquid to even get a refund  i would like to try this product  but don t want to go through the hassle of shipping damaged products back to amazon over and over      
143,5.0 ,                       i have been using this product for a good   months now  i use it in combination with a retin a cream as well as an anti aging moisturizer  you apply the serum first before everything else so it can sink in  i am    years old and have very dry skin  because of this i had tons of wrinkling on my checks when i smiled  my skin was dull and looked aged beyond my years  after   months of religiously using these products my face is so much better  it looks supple and well moisturized  the wrinkling on my checks looks way better as well  i will continue to use      
144,2.0 ,                       smells terrible  which i can handle but after using this regularly i ve developed a huge cyst on my face that i ve been battling now for a few months  and i m not talking  huge zit  people  you d have to see this thing to believe it        i am not saying this is directly related to this serum  maybe it s completely unrelated    but i ve never had anything like this before so i figured it can t hurt to put it out there      other than that i didn t really notice much difference than any other ha moisturizer         
145,1.0 ,                       did absolutely nothing for me  finished the entire bottle and zero results  i bought a different brand of vitamin c serum and that worked wonders  wasted money and time giving this one a try  i wonder where these reviews are coming from         
146,4.0 ,                       update  two days after posting my review the company reached out to me  they gave me a full refund and even offered to send a me a bottle of another product they thought would help  they asked me about my skin and gave a great recommendation  customer service  bomb afmy skin is terribly sensitive and this surprisingly did not burn  it was making my under eyes brighter  but after about   weeks it was no longer making a difference      
147,4.0 ,                       i tried this bc it got good reviews  it s always hard for me to tell the results of products if the change isn t dramatic and i also use several products on my skin  i do think that this gives me a slight glow i don t like how fast i go through the bottle  it s also hard to apply bc i get a lot of bubbles in the dropper and it s very thin runny  my face feels a little sticky after applying it which doesn t bother me bc i use moisturizer after i think i ll probably try a few others before deciding on a keeper      
148,5.0 ,                       i ve been loving the vitamin c serum  my skin has been so dull  dry  and pale for the last few years after i had my son  i also started noticing more lines and discoloration from the sun and hormone imbalances that no matter what i did never went away  it was always sensitive on top of all that  so every time i tried anything new i would breakout like crazy  this vitamin c serum was recommended to me a few months ago and i was blown away how well my skin responded to it  my skin is brighter  without any makeup    it s healthier and more balanced   so no more dry patches  my discoloration is fading and my skin is firmer  meaning those little lines aren t nearly as noticeable  i also didn t go through one of those  breakout phases  like i have with every other product i put on my face  i use it once a day at night if anybody was interested in knowing  i have no plans on stopping this product  and also customer service is amazing  so helpful and quick if you have any issues or concerns      
149,4.0 ,                       edited  i had not opted for a refund since i did use the product even though it did not have visible effects on me  but i was approached by the customer service the day after i posted my review mentioning that they have started processing my refund as i was not happy with their product  and they stick by their      customer satisfaction moto   they even offered me with a complementary bottle that will better suite my skin type  the customer service even followed up to check if the refund was successful and if i was still interested in a complementary product  i still give   stars since the original product didnt work for me  but you can always try  if the product doesnt work for you you can always return it and opt for another brand original  did not see any difference in my skin  it did not make my skin brighter  fresher looking skin  improved tone and clarity  smaller pores  less breakouts  fine lines and dark spots like it mentions  i wanted to give it a fair shot and use it over a period of time to look for better results and not be biased  its been over       months  i don t see any difference at all  the only good thing is that the product does not have a horrible smell like some skin care products and it does not cause any reaction   but it genuinely did not lessen my breakouts or even help my pores  it is not necessary     
150,1.0 ,                       i had such high hopes after reading all the good reviews that this would work for me  so i bit the bullet and paid what i thought was way too much in hopes it would help  however  after using it for   weeks straight  i can tell zero difference in my skin  it doesn t even feel softer  which is strange i think  i know it s a chance anytime you buy stuff like this  and i guess this time it didn t pay off for me      
151,5.0 ,                       not sure if product does what it is supposed to  but i do know it does something  i had a skin irritation from a cheap ring on my finger that would not go away for months  once i started using this product  obviously by applying it to my face with my hands  it went away in a week    dropperful covers my entire face and chest neck    bottle lasts a little over a month when covering those areas  it doesn t have a scent  i apply after washing and before moisturizing  i have eczema and rosacea spots and it has helped with the eczema but not so much for the rosacea   hope this info helps      
152,5.0 ,                       this product is beyond amazing it instantly absorbs into my skin and my skin loves it it s helping me balance my acne prone skin and i can actually see it working for me the change i see in my skin is that my cystic acne is completely shrunken and overall i have fewer blemishes i have terribly scarred cheeks but my scars are fading away after just   weeks  i use the serum immediately after exfoliating my face the funny thing is  it doesn t tingle or irritate my sensitive skin in any way  but does a much better job than thousands of vitamin c serums i ve used in the past it s a new must have for me and i m considering trying other truskin products  hope this review is helpful for someone seeking a genuine skincare product      
153,5.0 ,                       including a thin layer on my forehead and chest  and my skin looks amazing  i m about to explore derma rolling for acne scars and am going to use this as my after serum  i have a background in chemistry so i am picky about knowing what is going on my skin and that the ingredients in the serum are safe and it s nice to have a comprehensive and transparent list on the bottle      
154,5.0 ,                       i ve been using this for over a month now as part of my morning routine   i ve been using a multi step  japanese inspired routine which has made a big difference in my skin overall   this comes after cleansing and toner for me and i apply a few drops over my entire face   it has a slightly gritty feel going on  but it absorbs quickly   i haven t noticed any lightening effect which is fine  i m not looking for that  just an extra layer of protection for my skin   it s actually helped i think with healing small marks in my skin like acne scars as well   i will definitely keep using this      
155,5.0 ,                       this serum is amazing  i was having serious problems with my face  i used a flawless hair remover to shave my entire face and it broke out my skin  i had small pimple like bumps all over my face  i tried everything from aloe creams to hydrocortisone not was working  i searched online and found that vitamin c and hyaluronic acid help improve skin  i found this product with great reviews and decided to purchase  my face has improved so much it s even better than before  my face is so smooth and even i have not been wearing makeup and i feel so confident  really recommend      
156,4.0 ,                       i normally do not use much of anything on my skin  as i am prone to acne and have sensitive skin  i wanted to try somethung to help even my tone and dark marks  after review  i decided to try this serum  i am so glad i did  i enjoy this serum sooo much  there has been a  noticeable difference of my skin since i ve started using it  people have given me compliments on how fresh  clean  and clear my complexion is becoming    weeks nightly use   it melts right into my skin  i have a already recommended to a few ppl  i hope the enjoy it as much as i do      
157,5.0 ,                       not happy with this product even though it has so many good reviews  i got tiny rashes on the areas that i applied this serum on my face  i returned this serum update          the owner of this company is an exceptional caring individual  she went above and beyond making sure that i get a new bottle with new ingredients that fits my needs and skin after an unhappy purchase previously   i would definitely recommend this company and their products   they are very professional and truly passionate about what they sell and towards their customers  definitely leave any questions or doubts that you have in mind and they will get back to you promptly  thank you erica for being so wonderful     
158,5.0 ,                       i love this serum   first of all  my husband is very sensitive to fragrance and this product has no smell at all  so i can use it at night before bed and he doesn t even notice   it also absorbs very quickly and dries so you can apply moisturizer almost immediately afterward   i also use it in the morning  add moisturizer and make up and my skin look like it s airbrushed   my dark spots are hardly noticeable and my wrinkles are blurred   i get complements on my  age     skin all the time after using it for about   months  i decided to switch to the next  more expensive  level up of the truskin superc plus serum thinking  if i love this serum so much  than more must be better   but ended up going back to the basic truskin vitamin c serum   it seemed to work much better and it s less expensive and    to comment on the truskin team and customer service    they nail it every time   with every order they reach out to see if you received your product and ask for feedback   on my last order  amazon delivered a package but instead of my favorite serum  they delivered plastic tumblers       i was so disappointed and when i responded to erica s follow up email about my order letting her know amazon sent the wrong item  she immediately offered a resolution   even though they had nothing to do with amazon s mistake   and did not just offer a small fix  but gave me a new order of serum at no charge    what     no one does that anymore and i m truly wowed by the recovery   thank you erica and truskin   you made me a loyal customer      
159,3.0 ,                       this product has the consistency of water and has no moisturizing quality  for me all this did was dry out my skin  make it flaky and red   i did use it with different moisturizers  i d prefer a serum that includes a light moisturizer i have amended review and stars in appreciation of their reaching out to me and giving me refund      
160,5.0 ,                       best vit c serum i ve used  including the dermatologist office and department store brands  takes very little product to cover face  neck  chest  after second bottle  twice daily use  my jawline tightened and smile lines plumped  my skin feels and looks softer  foundation smoother  their customer service is top notch  i ve never had a single problem  good product  the price is incredible  i hope everyone else has the same experience   and   i have age     skin complete with effects of sun bathing before we knew it was deadly       
161,4.0 ,                       each time i order this product it s because i like the results   softer skin texture  not oily  balancing etc  i can t seem to find a  moisturizer that doesn t breaks me out more  is too oily  or too dry  with this product underneath  they all perform better  balancing my dry cheeks  oily t zone but i have to say each time i ve ordered it  part of the product has been lost in packaging  the product itself is not equipped with a sealed lid like others  where the dropper comes separately  thus allowing the product to leak when bounced around  second  it s an amazon wearhouse issue and how they also secure it with other orders      
162,5.0 ,                       i love this serum   i actually got a few things that are new i m using so i can t      confirm which is helping the most  but i ve suffered from red flakiness around my t zone for years and could not get rid of it   using this in conjunction with micellar water  rose water spray and a moisturizer  i ve had a complete change in my skin   i can now wear foundation without it looking horrendous   i think the truskin is a big contributor because i put the drops on the back of my hand before application and the hand i use is much smoother lol   i should probably switch hands so it evens out some     definitely recommend this   i wish i would have bought a long time ago      
163,5.0 ,                       love love love this product  i m completely      forever a customer  i m nearing      needed a good skin care regimen  as i ve never had one  i can t believe my results  not only has it taken away all dullness  it has reversed some sun damage  my before and after pictures are taken without filters in the same lighting same area of my bathroom  i m highly satisfied          
164,5.0 ,                       this is a really balanced and effective serum  it s great if you don t have the funds to by a bunch of high end serums and i find it to be as or even more effective than pca skincare  my skin always looks better after i ve used for about   days and honestly  with the price i shouldn t let myself run out as i sometimes do  the serum does last a long time though and it has an expiration date listed but you ll finish it way before if you use it day and night like i do  i d say one bottle should around   months my pores look much smaller and my african american medium brown skin is more even toned and smooth it has no smell or if does it s light and inoffensive      
165,3.0 ,                       i ve been using this twice a day as instructed for some time now and do not see any results   it does get good reviews so i will complete the bottle and take photos and show them again once bottle is empty   if results are good  will update my stars      
166,5.0 ,                       this is a review to the review below  the seller promptly got in contact with me and extensively explained why the product is cloudy and everything checks out for me  basically  they use a stable version of vitamin c   sodium ascorbyl phosphate  sap    which is best suited for the state of the product  in light of that  the prompt and considerate customer service  and the fact that serum definitely did not harm  i think it is a solid   stars  i believe my skin just did not need it but you should definitely buy it  you have nothing to lose                                      so  i got it cloudy  the first i ever got vitamin c  from a provider whose name i currently can t remember  it was clear and had a slightly zesty smell to it  this on is cloudy and has an off putting scent  the manufacturers note that the cloudy nature of the serum is normal and is to be expected  furthermore  they claim it doesn t affect the potency of their formula  i have read extensively online and the opposite seems to be the case  oxidation  the cause of the cloudiness  does reduce the potency of vitamin c  in any event  i have been using it for about   weeks now with absolutely no improvements  acne remained  hyperpigmentation remained  fine lines remained  the only  up side  to this is that i didn t breakout at the very least  i am currently looking into purchasing vitamin c from another provider since it seems this one can t keep their well preserved  or smelling decent  and just as a fair note to the providers  even if your claim that oxidation does not affect the potency of your product is true  which i now highly doubt  you should still invest in means to preserve the physical quality of unperturbed vitamin c  if anything  for the peace of mind of consumers  but most importantly  so it works      
167,5.0 ,                       i ve had the vitamin c serum for a few weeks now  it sinks in to the skin  despite my living in a subtropical climate  improving elasticity  clarity  and minor imperfections  i already decided to order more when something happened one of truskin s top executives personally emailed me to ask how i liked the serum  not a form letter  it was in reply to anything i sent  erica and i had a personal correspondence  in it  she thanked me for ordering and offers to consult with me about any other skincare needs  i was floored by the kindness and generosity so yes  i am ordering more  truskin s quality both in product and service makes me a customer for life      
168,5.0 ,                       the customer service is excellent  if you have any questions  the seller is happy to reply in a timely fashion  i have very sensitive  acne prone skin so i was nervous about this product  so far  so good  i started using a  couple of new products at the same time so i m not sure if i owe it all to this  but my skin has really cleared up since using it  i ll leave more feedback after using it longer update  like i said before  i started this product along with a few other ones but i think this saved my skin  i suffered from pretty bad hormonal acne and nothing helped  my skin hardly ever breaks out now  this stuff is amazing      
169,5.0 ,                       my dermatologist recommended a     vitamin c serum to reduce bruising from thin  fragile skin   i found that truskin was less expensive and more reliable than several others i tried   i do think it s reduced bruising on my forearms  but an entirely unlooked for benefit was that my face stopped breaking out in small  itchy sore red bumps several days a month for the first time since        i am in my late sixties  which means the breakouts are unlikely to have been related to hormonal changes  and was diagnosed with adult acne in      although it never looked like acne to me  just little red bumps  usually around my nose  lips and chin   i was treating it successfully enough every month with an antibiotic lotion my dermatologist prescribed  but noticed several months into my nightly use of the truskin naturals vitamin c serum for face that i hadn t had to use the the antibiotic lotion in some time  in the two years i ve been using the serum  i ve needed the antibiotic lotion about three times  a very noticeable reduction   i also think the serum has been helpful for skin texture  evenness and minimizing wrinkles i have recently been having the happy experience of new co workers expressing apparently genuine shock on learning my age  saying they thought i was in my   s      
170,5.0 ,                       i m pretty impressed so far with this great new discovery and will be adding it to my skin regime  not only has the customer service and followup been great from this company  but the skincare tips and helpful advice have been a nice added benefit too  i ve only used the vitamin c serum for a short time but love the way it soaks into my skin and the wonderful way it makes my face feel  it s very light  not greasy or oily  and is a nice base under my moisturizer and foundation  it only takes a small amount to see the benefit  i ve also tried blending a drop or two with my foundation as i m applying it and have seen amazing results using it in that way too  all in all  this is a great product at a very reasonable cost that you should consider adding to your skin care routine  it s good for the man in your life too  as it doesn t have a feminine scent and absorbs into the skin nicely after a shave      
171,4.0 ,                       i purchased this after noticing some dark spots on my skin after a recent pregnancy  i didn t want to buy anything too harsh for fear of hurting my skin  i have very normal skin  sometimes dry but no blemishes  i ve been putting this on at night when i can  and in the morning under my makeup when i can  i wish i were better about religiously putting it on but i m not  i think if i did my review may be more fair  so far i haven t noticed a change in my dark spots  but i do like the way it makes my skin feel and look after i ve applied it  i also think it goes under my makeup well and doesn t cause any issues  i have noticed however sometimes i don t like the smell when i wake up after sleeping with it on  i don t know why and i m sure there s an explanation but other then that i like it and love that it hasn t hurt my skin       
172,5.0 ,                       i have only had this for   days and i absolutely love it  i will explain about   months ago i started getting these really dry really red scaly type places where you wear blush and it started spreading further down its make my face feel so tight and my makeup would turn so ugly with white scales all over  i went to the dermatologist and nothing helped  i found this by chance and decided to give it a try it s only been   days and all the scaly flacky stuff is almost all gone the redness is way better i only wish i would have taken a before but i didn t expect results  ohh by the way i severely oily skin besides the rough patches and it doesn t effect the oiliness in anyway meaning it doesn t make it worse my makeup stays on all day  i put it on before i go to bed and before i put my makeup on       
173,2.0 ,                       so i just received mine yesterday   last night i tried it but i have to say i wasn t impressed with at least the look of it    it was thick kinda slimy and no real scent to it    i know there was an insert that said it may appear clear to slightly cloudy    i almost didn t want to put it on my face  just wondering if everyone else s appeared like this as well   can t really rate as far as results      
174,5.0 ,                       this is my  nd review  i just love this serum so much  it has shrunk my pores  makes my face glow  diminished  a lip and forehead line i had  minimized syringomas under my eyes and does not break out or irritate my skin  i use this all over my face and neck and under my eyes  i have sensitive skin and have had no problems  i also just started using the eye gel which i love and recently bought the toner and eye cream  i am excited to use them  it seems truskin products are starting to replace my old routine  it is because these products work and you can see that by the amazing reviews and their products are so affordable  i will be purchasing everything again and will be trying more truskin products  wish i could tell everyone about them    their customer service is the best i come across for any product ever      
175,1.0 ,                       i m so sad about this one   thousands and thousands of great reviews  and i don t have sensitive skin  but a couple days after using this i broke out in a very red rash all over my forehead and cheeks  i m embarrassed to go outside  it s the only new product i ve used lately and i m certain it s the cause  so please everyone be careful  and yes  i do all the right things with light facial cleansing  moisturizer  good quality  after it sets  and now i look too horrible to go out  i ve been putting on some of my cooking moisturizers and sheet masks and i m getting much better  but i m so sad i spent money on this only to have my clear skin completely turn red and broken out   i had only purchased it because it was supposed to help with skin tone         
176,2.0 ,                       i thought this would be great for my large pores and lines and my sun spot but unfortunately it s just drying my skin out even when i used all the time with my moisturizer but i have dry patches on my face  now and i didn t have them before using this and now i have wait for them to go away before i can wear makeup because it s making it look so patchy      
177,4.0 ,                       i never leave reviews  i ve been struggling with acne since having my daughter almost   years ago  i ve spent soo much money on various skin care treatments  decided to try this along with my daily moisturizer and after only   weeks  almost all my breakouts have disappeared  the only downside is i have noticed my skin is a little drier than usual  but it s also winter so that s as expected  really hoping to continue seeing great results      
178,2.0 ,                       this didn t work for me at all  i gave it about month and a half to try and see if it would work for mwe  but every morning i would wake up with more little pimples on my face  i ve never been one to have a lot of acne so it was a shock to me  i stopped using it about two weeks ago and my skin has cleared up and is back to normal  it s a shame it didn t work for me  but it looks like it works well for other people so i wouldn t count it out      
179,4.0 ,                       first of  this review was not sponsored by truskin  i purchased the product since i m    and my skin has been drying out   i put the c serum in the morning after showering for work  and in the evening  after washing my makeup off   i love how supple and dewy my skin looks after putting some on  but my skin is sooo dry the it just soaks in up  and i m back to drying face   i ve been using it for about   weeks now  and i will place a before an after photo after a    day since i want to give it a real chance      
180,5.0 ,                       this product is amazing  i am only upset i didn t start incorporating vitamin c into my skincare routine sooner  i m    and have noticed fine lines popping up at my smile line  i ve been doing my research to revamp my skincare routine  i noticed  universally  dermatologists recommended vitamin c both day and night i noticed an immediate difference over night  i tried not to get too excited though because i figured it could just be placebo  after using the product for only   days  i noticed an immense difference in both face and body  i mixed the serum into my facial moisturizer and my body lotion so i use it all over  i also wear sunscreen on both face body because vit c makes the skin photosensitive  when talking on facetime with my cousin he told me i was glowing  my skin feels  and looks  smoother  softer  and brighter  i had folliculitis on my legs from shaving and it s completely gone  too   i am almost in disbelief  put     drops on your face morning night  and mix a few teaspoons into your body lotion and use after your shower if you are on the fence  i seriously recommend buying this serum or any other pure vit c serum      
181,1.0 ,                       i read the reviews before purchasing thinking that this would be a great product  sadly  i was wrong  i have tried other serums before and this  unfortunately  is the worst one  i haven t noticed any difference in my face or complexion after weeks of use   it is very sticky so if you do plan on buying  i would suggest applying it to a damp face  also  it is mainly bubbles in the dropper every time i try to get anything out of the bottle so i have to keep dipping the medicine dropper at least   times to get a normal amount of  serum bubbles  to cover my face   i would not recommend purchasing this and i only gave it   star because it smells somewhat decent  but really  i could ve rubbed an orange on my face and gotten the same results      
182,2.0 ,                       not very wow ed by this  used it consistently  x a week morning and night and don t see any difference in my skin  when i did use it    it would leave like flakes over my face and dry it out a little where i needed to moisturize right away but had to wait a little while for it to absorb otherwise the flakes were bad  there really was no scent so that was good   and it didnt really bother my skin which is sometimes sensitive which was also good update on my review  after reviewing the product and how it hadnt worked for me    erica a customer service representative from truskins reached out and offered a full refund for the product as well as an additional item free of cost that she believed would work for my skin instead of the initial one  the customer service provided was absolutely amazing and i m shocked with how attentive and caring erica was with getting me a more useful product as well as giving instruction on it   totally recommend future purchases from here as well as maybe reaching out beforehand to ask about the products and what would work best for you and how to use the product correctly      
183,3.0 ,                       i used truskin serum for about   months  i wanted to love the serum  but unfortunately i did not  it goes on smooth and works well fighting lines and wrinkles  my skin felt soft and overall looked good  but it never looked better than when i started  just the same  after a few months i noticed age spots were appearing and getting quite dark  after   months the dark spots were the worst i ve ever had  so i discontinued use and returned to my old serum that has slowly helped the age spots fade  i like the serum  but it doesn t do everything i expect a serum to  i e  lighten and eliminate age spots  so i will not purchase again and do not recommend      
184,4.0 ,                       i have now been using this product for over a week  still no change to my skin and i have had more breakouts than usual still unsure if it is related so i am going to continue to use it for now so i can get a better feel  the reason i am giving it   stars so early on is not due to lack of results as i know it is too soon to tell  but due to the sticky  film like feeling it has on my skin  i have used other vitamin c serums and never experienced that  i am going to try to look past it to see what results i get and how my breakouts progress  i will update with my results in the future also other vitamin c serums have been clear and this on is cloudy not sure if this is normal  or if i got a bad batch and thats why i m experiencing problems with itupdate bottle   done mom  so i am at the end of the bottle and my mom finished hers  she is in her   s and even my father noticed and asked if she had been doing something different  so she is definitely pleased  says she noticed a glow about her skin me as for me i have definitely noticed that my face looks brighter and i ve gotten used to the weird consistency i m starting to kinda like it now  i have been using it twice a day morning and evening  and i use moisturizer over it which helps with any stickiness  as far as my acne ive had less pimples but my blackheads have not diminished  not that its targeting that just extra information   regardless i would not reorder as i have found others gave me better results     
185,5.0 ,                       i actually decided purchasing this product without much thought into it as i had received an amazon gift card and didn t have anything particular to use it on so i just ordered two random items as one of them being the truskin naturals vitamin c face serum and it has actually been the best thing for my skin  i didn t have many blemishes or much acne due to back in october when i started using curology for my skin as just a thin cream for my face at night just because i like my skin to be always looking top notch  i then coordinated this serum into my skin routine just after washing my face in the shower with aveeno regular face wash to clean my skin and then using this after the shower when my face dries  keeping it on my skin and neck for about     minutes and then washing it off and it has honestly been outstanding  i attend college in florida so after a long day at the beach this definitely refreshes my skin to the max and i can even feel it doing the work while drying on my face killing all bacteria in the most soothing way leaving my skin with the best and brightest complexion  especially while having a nice florida tan   i even got my girlfriend  friends and family to order this product because of how amazing it makes your skin feel and is always backed up by the best results thank you so much truskin naturals for your vitamin c face serum and i will definitely be a lifetime customer      
186,5.0 ,                       this is the second time i have ordered the vitamin c serum   i really like it   i think it has helped with the appearance of my skin   i am    and have sun spots   i think it has helped lessen the darkness of the spots   i think it also makes my skin look more plump and hydrated   i have had zero reaction  breakouts  to the product   the serum also does not have a scent which is nice  i am sensitive to smells   i will continue to order and tell others about it   i use it under my moisturizer      
187,5.0 ,                       i have used this for a little over   weeks now and there is a noticeable improvement   i had an eye infection which left one of my eyes a little droopy and the skin around my eye a little funky   this tightened everything up and smoothed all my skin out   i noticed the other day when moisturizing that my skin looked really good  more youthful  tighter  and smoother   this is the only thing i have been using that is different from my normal skin routine   it also has lightened some sun spots under my eye   highly recommend  especially at this price   there is no noticeable scent   it does not moisturize mature skin  but does allow for the face cream you use to be more readily absorbed   i will purchase again    i m also using it on my hands and it works       
188,5.0 ,                       i was very hesitate in purchasing this item due to the good and not so good reviews   i was so unsure of this product whereas i researched outside of amazon s reviews   so based on the professional views of this item outlined the ingredients which all i liked   so upon receipt of this item i first tested a small amount on my hands for about   hours   later that evening  i applied a small amount all over my face and immediately follow by face cream  once it dried    i first felt so light tingling in my face in certain areas   upon arising the next morning  i immediately looked in the mirror and i was very pleased of the results   i am glad that i purchased this particular vitamin c serum  because i previously was using tree of life vitamin c serum and was satisfied  however  i noticed that truskin vitamin  c serum is more potent and the results are extraordinary      
189,5.0 ,                       i absolutely love this product  i have already recommended it to all of my friends  i started to notice that my skin was becoming dull and my fine lines became more noticeable so i purchased this serum hoping for a small improvement  i was blown away by the increase in glow  better tone  firmness and reduction of the fine lines in my face  i have gotten countless compliments on skin after using this product  as a mommy with two small children and not very much  me  time  those compliments go a long way  it s great to know i m not the only one seeing the results  i can t wait to try the retinol serum  i also plan to sign up for the vip membership  if you re in the fence i would recommend you try this product      
190,5.0 ,                       i wish i had taken some before after photos but i did not  i kind of have sensitive skin most of the time and did not have any negative reactions   i noticed a big difference in the darkness below my eyes almost immediately  it s pretty much gone  my skin feels softer smoother overall  it is taking some time to see any results on the spots of sun damage  there is no odor smell that i have noticed  the serum has a cloudy appearance  it has a vague sting when applied that doesn t last long at all  i did notice that when i wiped my fingertips after application on a dark hand towel  the towel then had become discolored  i also use the serum after using a derma roller in the evenings  my skin almost feels like a sun burn with tightness after use but after a moisturizer is applied that tends to go away also  so basically  good product for sensitive skin  no scent  not very moisturizing but helped with skin texture and appearance  i will buy again      
191,5.0 ,                       i had been skinceuticals customer in the past  but wanted something a little more budget friendly and found the reviews on truskin products and thought i d give them a try  especially since i could buy the entire product line for the cost of a single skinceuticals product   i purchased the vitamin c serum  the ha serum  eye cream  face wash and the vitamin c moisturizer and began using them on      i was hoping to reduce the constant redness and get rid of the little bumps and fine lines popping up on this    year old face  these pics are dated      and       i have no products on in either picture  the redness has gone down a lot and somehow i didn t even notice that i had bags under my eyes  but that has gone down quite a bit as well  the texture of my skin is much nicer  i m very skeptical of reviews that claim to have dramatic overnight effects  i don t look radically different after a week  but i can definitely see progress   if this is a weeks  worth of progress i think i will be pretty happy in a month or two  i was very pleasantly surprised how well the serums absorb  i wear powder mineral makeup and i feel moisturized  but not the  wet  feeling some other products leave behind so the powder goes on smoothly i will note that after a couple of days i was feeling a bit dry and substituted a heavier moisturizer at night with the rest of the products and it offset it  it may have just been too much vitamin c to start off with will update in a month      
192,5.0 ,                       i m    years old and not very concerned about wrinkles at the moment  thankfully   knock on wood i purchased this product for the many health benefits it offers  as well as the hopes for minimizing some redness that i have in my t zone area  honestly  at first i didn t notice too much of a difference but then after about two three weeks of using this product  i ve been receiving a lot of compliments on my skin and how healthy it looks  one of my friends said my skin even looks somewhat porcelain  at a closer look  i have noticed that the redness in my t zone area looks more evened out and less angry  and i usually have dark purple circles under my eyes but the purple seems to have faded almost completely  which was an extremely nice surprise for me   di think my skin was desperately thirsting for these healthy vitamins  i now use this serum in my daily skin care routine along with st  ives timeless skin facial moisturizer  collagen elastin  to moisturize after applying the serum and it works wonderfully  i m so please and very curious about more of truskins products now      
193,5.0 ,                       let me start by saying i was not compensated in anyway for this product  i purchased it based on the reviews  i didn t expect the product to work as well or as fast as it did  i didn t take any pictures and wished i did  i bought the product a month ago  i used it when i remembered for about two weeks  then i got serious and used it every morning and night for the last two weeks  my hyperpigmentation on my cheeks has dramatically decreased and i haven t had any  new breakouts  even during my cycle   i only added this product and acure brightening scrub to my routine  and increased my water intake   this serum has changed my life  my face is clearing up beautifully and my skin tone is improving but consistently and patience is key  i can t comment on anti aging properties because i don t have any fine lines or wrinkles  i used only two drops on each cheek and one drop on my forehead  the only con i have is the ingredients are a bit sketchy  the first ingredient is organic herbal infusion  what the heck is that  because the ingredients are shady i m a bit hesitant to repurchase  i will use the rest of the bottle because it does work and i haven t experienced any sensitivity or skin issues      
194,5.0 ,                       i use this along with a b complex and emu oil on my skin   i cannot even say i use it daily since i am a bit lazy about my skincare   as a teen  i never had acne issues  so i never got into good habits   now in my   s  i am a bit bummed about that   my skin was looking dull and a bit saggy  so i thought i d work toward better habits   my sister had given me some platinum skin b complex and emu oil that was working well  and i was pleased  but when i added in this vitamin c serum  i swear it kicked everything into high gear   my face is brighter and tighter   love it  definitely seeing a difference      
195,4.0 ,                       update review the company has great customer service  they reached out to me to help resolve the issue with their product  while the product did not work for me  they did a great job in recommending products that might work better with my skin and even offered a refund  original review i was so hopeful after reading all the reviews but this did nothing for my skin     the liquid was cloudy when it arrived  i thought this was normal as it s mentioned in one of their pictures  but i used it diligently for over several weeks now   both day and night  and it did nothing to improve my hyperpigmentation  very very disappointed     
196,1.0 ,                       on my  nd bottle and still no noticeable results  i figured i d give it a shot by buying the  nd bottle and using it longer  both bottles came in an amber color glass bottle with a dropper  both bottles have crystal type fragments in the serum  no sure if it s supposed to or not but both came that way  kind of annoying when your putting it on and then use moisturizer  you can feel the crystals  little to no smell noticed  not greasy  i bought it since the reviews were good and i wanted something to even out or fade my sun spots  which are not real dark  for the small size and higher price  i expected some results  i will try another brand next time  very disappointed      
197,5.0 ,                       he comprado cantidad de productos para la cara y este te lo recomiendo con los ojos cerrados  tu piel se nutre y luce espectacular  no es graso  se absorve de inmediato  ya he comprado        
198,5.0 ,                       i ve only been using this a few weeks and so far i haven t had any additional outbreaks  i was reluctant to try because i was in the middle of a serious breakout and didn t want to cause my face anymore stress  but i decided what the hell it couldn t get any worse so i tried it once in the morning upon waking up and once fore going to bed  i would wash my face with clinique face wash for oily skin  apply clinique toner for oily skin  then apply this serum and last my clinique moisturizer for oily skin      well it did not make my skin flare up and it actually calmed my pimples  i have acne prone skin and it s very sensitive  again it s only been a few weeks and not quite a month and i feel like it has really helped my skin  my pimples don t hurt like they usually do  im almost done with my first bottle and wanted to try another bottle to see full results  i really feel like this has helped my face alot  i went from big hard bumps to small painless bumps and i m hoping this next bottle will completely make them go away update  i am halfway thru my  nd bottle and my skin has def approved  no more hard cystic like bumps  i wash  clarify  and moisturize with my regular products then i put their vitamin c serum all over my face  then once it dries  i put a small drop on my breakouts but i don t rub it in     i just let it dry  when i get up in the morning  the big bumps go down and the little boys disappear  i will keep using this because it really calms my skin from itching and burning and helps with my breakouts  and helps with my hyperpigmentation  now i need to find something to help with the acne scars and dark spots      
199,2.0 ,                       i went through   bottles of this hoping that by the end of the  nd bottle i d see a difference in my skin  nope  no difference whatsoever  very disappointed                                      update while my previous review of the vitamin c serum still stands  i must say that i am extremely pleased with the customer service of the truskin naturals company  this company  through its customer service representative  erica  really showed great initiative  integrity  and above and beyond service  just   days after i posted the review above  erica emailed me and honored the company s customer satisfaction guarantee  which i knew about when i purchased the products  but had forgotten   erica promptly and fully refunded both bottles i had purchased  without me needing to return the empty bottles   which i had thrown away by then anyway   additionally  she asked me what my skin care concerns are so that she could recommend a different product  after i shared with her my skin care concerns  she recommended the hyaluronic acid serum and offered to send me a full sized bottle for free for me to try  i received my complimentary bottle in the next week or so  we ll see if i see more of a difference with this serum  in the meantime  i will say that although the original product i had purchased didn t do anything for me  i am extremely pleased with the wonderful and attentive service this company offers and the dedication they have towards making sure their customers are satisfied  so while the original product garnered only   stars  the company itself deserves   stars      
200,4.0 ,                       i didn t see any of the results some of the other users did unfortunately   i think i even broke out more from using it but can t be sure   update  i originally gave this serum a rating of    the seller contacted me upon reading my review  their customer service is absolutely amazing  we exchanged several emails back and forth and she took the time to help me figure out which of their products would be beneficial to my personal skin needs  absolutely recommend purchasing from this company  i know i will certainly give them another shot        
201,5.0 ,                       it is about two months since i have been using this serum and my skin looks great and feels great  i use this in combination with some other products but i am able to single out the effects because i know what the other products target  i have experienced a remarkable reduction in the acne scars  and my skin feels supple and glows  i use it under my acne oil moisturizer in the morning and evening  i must tell you   i have tried other vit c serums and this one is really top quality and a little goes a long way so you are really getting your money s worth  great product  to be honest one of the things i love most are the natural ingredients  i am very careful about not putting in  any chemicals into my body   so i am equally concerned about placing chemicals on my skin  good stuff                              
202,1.0 ,                       i bought this product for its amazing reviews  i understand that each person has different skin type from another and each person may react to different products differently  but unfortunately when i use the serum  i first tried it on my neck to check if i m gonna have any reaction as guided and i did not have any skin reactions  when i started applying it to my face twice daily i noticed my face started to flush  i m becoming more red  and i also noticed more discoloration  which is opposite what the serum is supposed to do  i stopped using it immediately and went back to my previous routine and my skin calmed down and felt better  i don t understand why this happened and i would not be continuing to use this product  i understand that some people might find this to make wonders for them but to me it was a really bad experience  the texture of this did not feel good  the smell of this did not feel good and the way it felt on my face did not feel good  i will not be purchasing it again and i would not be using it again  actually i would be disposing the serum because i would not recommend it to a friend of mine  but maybe some people have different skin types and they reacted amazing to the serum but for me it was a complete no no      
203,5.0 ,                       this product is amazing  i ve been using it faithfully  in the am   pm for almost   months now   the results are excellent  my pores are smaller  wrinkles appear to be less noticeable   my skin is smooth   soft  i m      still have random breakouts but this serum seems to get rid of any breakouts almost overnight  i would highly recommend this product  at first i was skeptical about trying this but i read the reviews   decided to give it a try  i ve used more expensive serums in the past and this one does a better job than all the others i ve tried at a fraction of the price      
204,2.0 ,                       i used this product daily  morning and night  along with my normal skincare routine  i wanted to try this brand given the great reviews  but this did nothing for me  it seemed to be somewhat moisturizing but that s it  i lost all the progress i had made with my old serum i got on amazon after switching  so i m pretty bummed out  i used the whole bottle to give it a chance but i ll be switching back  it should be noted that it did not cause any bad reactions  only that the acne clearing and glowing skin benefits from my last serum seemed to disappear with this one  because it didn t cause harm and was a bit moisturizing  i m giving   stars  but this was a waste of time and money for me      
205,5.0 ,                       i have had troubled  acne  prone skin since i was       i am now     and still battle it  i had purchased a jade roller micro ball roller kit  and needed a serum  i read the reviews on the product  and decided to give it a go after the first application of serum with the micro derm roller  i was sold  saw dark areas lighting  small pimples vanished   now after a couple of weeks   my face has started a purge cycle  but expected  i will be definitely repurchasing this product again      
206,5.0 ,                       in one day my skin looks so much better  in a bit shell i had to change my bc and because of that i got acne allllll over my face  worse than when i was a teenager   i m    now   lol  i have super sensitive skin and dry easily  i was skeptical but i am very satisfied and can not wait to see what my skin will look like after a couple weeks  yahoo    sooo happy          
207,5.0 ,                       i m giving this product a   star because of their customer service   i really wanted to have this product work for me  but due to sensitive skin  it dried me out  the company reached out to me personally to see if everything was working out  gave me tips on future vitamin c serums as far as levels goes  i ve never experienced such amazing customer service like this before  i will definitely give them another try for any future products solely due to the fact that they really do care and want you to have the amazing results most people post on here      
208,5.0 ,                       i absolutely love this product here is what i was looking for since i turned     i ve been getting acne on my chin and cheeks  my skin is super dry and i wanted something that would brighten my face  help lighten the marks  and moisturize my skin   without spending       for drunk elephant or some other brands  i ve tried a lot of different products and combinations and nothing worked until i decided to give this a chance  i saw results within the first week  i am two bottles in and    days later and i have almost no acne marks in my chin  some in my cheeks  and after getting my facial last time  my esthetician said that my face has a lot more moisture than usual  nothing has changed in my skincare routine but the addition of this product  i am super happy with this overall then  the customer service representative  erica goes above and beyond  i wanted to add a different product to decrease the acne and she walked me through the products herself and made some great recommendations i absolutely love this company and i am so happy i found them i wish i had taken some before and afters for you all  but unfortunately  i didn t  instead  here is a picture with minimal makeup on  the acne scars are barely noticeable and my face looks brighter than ever  this was after three weeks of using the vitamin c serum      
209,3.0 ,                       initially i really liked this product  felt my skin looked refreshed and bright and had no side effects  within a few weeks  i developed a recurrent peeling burning rash around my lips that lasted two months  didn t know what was causing it because it would come and go in cycles every   days  eventually  by process of elimination  i found out it was this product i had an allergic reaction to even though i made sure not to let it get close to my lips  finally  after   days of discontinuing  it resolved and hasn t returned  had to throw it out  too bad  definitely skin test it first  has potential if you don t have too sensitive skin      
210,2.0 ,                       the color of the product was a little off putting  as others have stated it looks like spit  but i did notice after a day the bubbles did go away  i think during shipping it just got shook around   the temperature changes made it bubbly   cloudy  i really wanted to like this product  but it honestly didn t do anything  it dried my skin out actually  and after it dried  it would peel i guess you could say  like it didn t absorb into my skin at all  it just dried like a mask and would start peeling  i used this faithfully for just about   weeks  tonite i m just not even bothering with it tho  i ll just use my other skin care items i ve been using minus this serum the positive is that it does have a great smell  it smells like orange citrus      
211,5.0 ,                       i gave myself about   weeks before leaving a reviews after using this and i for sure had seen results way before that  literally in just a few days after my first application of the vitamin c serum my face had started to glow  my dark spots were noticeably lighter and my overall complexion was very even  i used to spend     on even better by clinique but this tiny     vitamin c has that beat  i make sure to have a washed clean face and apply a thin layer all over my face and neck  i do this in the morning and at night  you might feel a slight tightness but that s normal  this stuff seriously works and if you have dark spots from the sun  acne i recommend you do not hesitate and just buy this      
212,4.0 ,                       it s too early to tell as i ve only been using it about   weeks  i m in my    s but i do feel like my skin looks better  with a bit of a glow  it also looks like my age spots are fading but maybe that s just wishful thinking  not sure yet  the product is very easy to apply  has no scent that i can discern  it s not sticky and it seems to be clarifying and smoothing my skin  i ll probably purchase a second bottle soon and maybe review again in a few months  if you re on the fence about purchasing i recommend that you try a bottle      
213,5.0 ,                       this serum is not a moisturizer for people who have criticized it  it is amazing for your skin though  after a week i could see my skin looking more even and elastic  google the ingredients and how they benefit your skin before purchasing  the hydraulic acid in the formula has even made my eyelashes grow and thicken  i always use this product after my toner  then after using the serum i use a moisturizer  the product has also helped me with my under eyes  also remember that a product like this is more likely to benefit you in the long run  nobody paid me to write this but i love skin care so yeah this is a good product  don t use it if you are using any chemical exfoliants cause it can be harsh on your skin  i m not an expert  just a skin care guru  thank you   loved it     
214,1.0 ,                       i bought this after reading all the reviews and hoped for a  good batch    welp  that didn t happen  i got a bottle full of a cloudy  thick looking serum  i tried to look past the initial appearance   it came with a clear  safety seal around the top   that typically indicates a product is new and untampered with   but  just beneath the dropper lid  i could see what looked like dried up serum  so either it leaked out and hardened under the saftey deal  doubtful  or it was used and resold  i m beyond disappointed      
215,4.0 ,                          y o female nursing student i was skeptical of buying  even though i read a million great reviews  i hope my review can give you some insight and help you out like i wanted to be helped when looking to purchase a week ago  so far  so great  i have been using in combo with neutrogena toner before hand and neutrogena hydroboost gel afterwards  i also bought a    cm microneedle roller to use with this serum  i purchased truskin and microneedle a week ago and i was using the neutrogena products before with little change  i have used the microneedle roller twice before bed since purchasing every third day after the toner and before truskin serum  and i have used all other products morning and night for   days  i have normal skin with large pores around my nose and i am prone to breakouts and blackheads on my chin  after the first night using the serum and micro needle i noticed a drastic change in my skin texture it was amazingly smooth  a week later and my breakouts are near obsolete  i can feel a tightening in my skin that wasn t there previously and i noticed a reduction in my acne spots that are fairly recent  i am a picker   my pores in my nose area are noticeably tighter and my blackheads are diminishing  my skin remains soft all throughout the day whereas before it was rough  a little bumpy  and semi oily  before purchasing these products  i did not wash my face day and night  only night  this may be a factor  my skin tone seems more even and bright  i intend to continue using religiously and will update my review at the month mark  i recommend trying it  i cannot say that my wrinkles are less  as i don t have many  but if you are looking for a more even skin tone and a reduction in pore size breakouts  give it a chance  i would recommend buying the micro needle roller as well  best of luck      
216,5.0 ,                       i ve been using this for two weeks  it s making a difference already in my skin  i can see that some spots are fading  which makes me very happy  i don t expect to have spots disappear completely  but i ll take all the fading i can get  as some are from old sun damage  and some are age related i have two strikes going against me  i m     so dry skin and age related skin issues  and i live in the high desert  so no humidity at all  plus     degrees in the summer and cold in the winter  in the mountains   this  under a moisturizer  is making this winter the first one bearable where my skin doesn t chap and itch can t wait to get to the bottom of the bottle and see how much better my skin looks      
217,5.0 ,                       i ve been using this for almost a year now   each bottle lasts me about   days using it  x a day  everyday  i absolutely love this stuff   i was hesitant to try a serum off of amazon but the great reviews intrigued me so i gave it a shot   literally the next morning my husband said   wow you re skin looks amazing  did you do something different   not kidding  my husband literally noticed my skin   that s how amazing this stuff is   he continued to make comments for the first few weeks on how he couldn t believe how soft  bright   glowing my skin looked i cleanse my skin first  then use this serum   follow it up with rosehip oil  pura d or organic rosehip oil also off amazon  and i m amazed at the results   highly highly recommend  i also recently bought the sdara derma roller   used it after cleansing   rinsing my face  then applied both serums like normal   that made a world of a difference allowing the serums to soak in my skin has never looked better        
218,1.0 ,                       i developed melasma under my right eye during my first pregnancy   i was hoping it would go away on its own but after the second pregnancy  it s still there and even worse  time to do something about it  i wanted this product to work so bad on me  i loved the fact it s plant based  organic ingredients and of course the glowing reviews  the serum felt wonderful on my skin and i never broke out or had any irritation but my dark spot is still as visible as day   after using majority of the bottle  i m not saying this product doesn t work  it just didn t work on me  i think i will try a dark spot corrector with hydroquinone next      
219,5.0 ,                       first i should say that i paid full price and nobody asked me for a review  second  i am a    year old wife  mom of teen girls  and middle school math teacher  that equals stress on my skin  i also live in texas  read sun damage   i do take care of my skin  but lately it has been less than perfect  two weeks of using this serum  and my    year old tells me i look like i am in my    s rather than    s  fine lines are going away  acne scars fading  pigmentation evening out  even my neck and jawline are smoother  now my husband wants some for his  dad neck   will definitely reorder  oh  and despite my sensitive skin  i use it on my actual eyelids without any irritation at all      
220,1.0 ,                       i purchased this product to help fade my hyperpigmentation leftover from acne  i have extremely dry  sensitive skin  i use cerave hydrating cleanser every morning  used this serum  tarte maracuja oil  and moisturizer with spf  at night i would cleanse  use this serum  maracuja oil  and origins night a mins cream  the origins night cream contains vitamin c and helped fade my acne marks a lot  i wanted more results so i purchased this vitamin c serum  i used it for over a month and experienced breakouts on my cheeks and forehead  leaving me with more red marks on my face  i stopped using it a few weeks ago and my skin is starting to completely clear up again  i know not to venture away from dermatologist recommended skincare ever again      
221,5.0 ,                       not every vitamin c serum is created equal  i have tried quite a few and this by far is the best  i noticed a difference in my skin the first week  i also purchased the truskin retinol moisturizer and that was a disaster on my skin  i sent it back and was given a refund  but the truskin vitamin c serum works wonders    everybody s skin is different  the retinol moisturizer from truskin got rave reviews from some people  unfortunately it did not work for me  but their vitamin c did  it hydrates  soften lines and brightens  it will be a staple for me going forward  i highly recommend      
222,5.0 ,                       i ve only used this product for a month  and think it is an excellent choice for underneath foundation first thing in the morning  especially in summer when makeup tends to be more shiny and not sweat proof  i take care of my skin  since i am an avid gardener i wear sunblock   million and a hat  but even so  never forget to moisturize every morning and night since my teens  until last night  i never would have noticed the difference vitamin c serum makes if i hadn t forgotten to moisturize  should ve gotten the message  from skin that feels like dry sheetrock   hey  go moisturize   but no problems  i ve used      jars of stuff that couldn t pass that test  for the price  i recommend trying it for yourself      
223,4.0 ,                       update   their customer service reached out to me after seeing i was not happy   asked me what my skin concerns were  sun spots  and sent me their vitamin c plus  has retinol    have been using for a week now and do like how my skin is so soft in the morning  too soon to tell about the spots but sense that it s lightening a little  thanks for helping me truskin been using this for several months   it hasn t made any difference with my skin   stopped using and tried a few other things which have made more of a difference with sun spots  appearance and feel   so this make me think that this is not really doing anything for my skin      
224,5.0 ,                       this is my first review in all the years i ve been on amazon  i have several of the truskin products  vitamin c serum  cleanser  eye gel  and moisturizer   i absolutely love all of them and use them daily  i bought the vitamin c serum first and loved it so much i reordered  then i slowly began adding in other products and now this line is all i use i am    and i have noticed a huge improvement in my skin  wrinkles appear to be less noticeable and my skin feels and looks better overall  i am also a huge fan of the eye gel and have seen several reviewers complaining about the small size of the bottle  it is small but you don t need to use very much at all and a tiny bit goes a long way  all in all i love everything and will continue using these products everyday on top of being completely satisfied with these products  i had a bottle of the vitamin c cleanser in my cart i was going to order but hadn t  placed the order   i got an email from truskin asking if i was satisfied with the products  my reply was  so far i love everything i have been using   she replied thanking me for responding and asked if there was a complementary product i would like to receive  i told her i was just going to reorder the cleanser and she sent me a coupon code and i just placed the order and it didn t cost me a penny i would have written this review anyway but i m very happy with the products and the company  so i just wanted to share  i hope this helps anyone that may be on the fence about ordering      
225,4.0 ,                       after reading the reviews i was excited to receive the product seeing as how it s been in my cart for a couple months  i ve been using this product for three days and it s been a mistake  immediately after using it my face is dry  i can literally feel my skin tightening as the product dries  there are dry patches on my face that i didn t have before and nothing seems to help  returning this product   update   after posting my review the company has reached out to me and offered a full refund along with a different product free of charge  it s good to know that they really care about customers satisfaction and not just the money      
226,5.0 ,                       when i asked my dermatologist what her recommendations for skincare products were  a vitamin c serum was at the top of her list along with sunscreen  retinol  and a good moisturizer  this one had such good reviews  even though a few reviews threw me off with tales of breakouts and reactions  as i have sensitive skin i am      sold on this stuff  after using it for   weeks  i started noticing a difference in the evenness and brightness of my skin but thought it might have been all in my head  lo and behold  though  i have started getting compliments on my skin from family and friends during zoom calls  which has never happened before  it s got to be this stuff ultimately  this is replacing my     lancome serum  which i do still love but can t keep forking out hundreds of dollars a year when i can get this beauty of a serum on amazon for          
227,5.0 ,                       my skin has cleared up so much  i wish i would have taken b  and now  i did purge for   weeks  but i m glad i read the reviews and hung in there  i wash my face with pca gentle face wash then use pca daily exfoliate face wash  i use a spin brush with led light  i purchased from amazon  while the exfoliate wash is on    rinse with warm water and then cold water  apply my toner then use the serum  when dry i use a moisturizer from great skin and spa      
228,5.0 ,                       i have loved both products i have purchased from truskin  i have the vitc serum that i use twice daily and the retinal moisturizer that i use every other night  my skin feels softer and has a more even tone  i have been using the vitc serum on the backs of my hands and i can tell a difference there also  i will definitely purchase these products again  the customer service is better than any company i ve ever dealt with  they truly seem to care about the effectiveness of their product      
229,5.0 ,                       i have been using this serum for a while now   on my second bottle   and i love it  my skin is noticeably brighter and more hydrated  i am inspired to use it every night before bed because i know my face will look better the next day if i do   i like the consistency of it a thick liquid instead of a cream  but not greasy  it dries quickly  so i don t feel like it is rubbing off while i sleep  it makes my skin softer and smoother  i am enjoying it so much i want to try their c  serum next      
230,5.0 ,                        photos taken in same room w  same lighting  no makeup in both   i bought this in oct      and used it only one or two times a week   i m terrible about using stuff religiously   but  i started using it nearly every day starting in feb       it is how early march      and i would have never guessed i could tell such a difference in my skin had i not taken a before photo  i will say that in the last month  i have also switched from coffee to green tea  have cut most dairy from my diet  and have made an attempt to get more sleep  so  i can t say that the before and after is attributed to the product only  but my pores are much smaller  some sun damage has totally vanished  and my skin looks a million times softer  my redness had improved so much  too   i m getting to buy another bottle today  definitely worth the        
231,3.0 ,                       i used this produce fairly religiously for about   months   at around the three month mark  it started to greatly change in consistency   ex  some evaporation and coagulation of product  to the point that i quit using it even though i had half a bottle left   not sure if that is standard   prior to that i enjoyed using it   easy to use  no strong scent  no odd reactions on my skin   it s always hard to know if there is a significant improvement with skincare products   i won t use this again due to the consistency issue      
232,3.0 ,                       i have really oily skin  i m tan  central american  not acne prone or sensitive     yrs old  and i love skin care  directions say to put this on after you have washed and dried your face  once i put this on  my skin felt really tight  and it won t go away until i put some moisturizer on  i love the truth serum from ole henriksen and that doesn t feel like this one  but the ole one is much more expensive so i tried this one  value wise  definitely worth it  but i didn t notice a huge improvement in my skin  for some reason i can t upload a picture  it did lighten some acne marks i got in feb  but that was about it  so do i recommend it  yes  like i said for the value  but i wasn t impressed      
233,2.0 ,                       i had really high hopes based on the reviews  but it really dried my skin out a lot  felt very tight and as if every bit of moisture was sucked out of my pores  also  it wasn t full  it was sealed with plastic around the neck  but looks like someone used some  returned it  and then was sold to me update  the seller reached out to me regarding my review and offered a refund and suggestions on other products  which is excellent customer service  my skin may need time to adjust to the vitamin c so i will give it another go based on the information i received and the great reviews on this product  accidents happen  it may have leaked or something  which is no reflection on the seller personally  i am impressed with the customer service and would recommend this seller      
234,2.0 ,                       i was looking for something to treat the dark spots on my face since having a baby  this didn t seems to help i ve had this for a couple of months now and while trying it i used drunk elephant and tatcha moisturizers on top of it  i have dry skin already  and for some reason this seems to make my skin drier  if you have dry  dull skin like me and want to fade dark spots i highly recommend farmacy s glow serum  pricey but imo soooo worth it       
235,5.0 ,                       so far  i m a fan  i ve noticed more even skin and a reduction in the apparence of freckles  even my under eye is looking better    and it s only been one week      
236,5.0 ,                       please read prior to purchasing i was looking for a natural product  that would not only help the condition of my skin  but also make it feel more healthy as well  i have a very rare  very serious diseases for which i have to have chemotherapy regularly  and i take many  many medications   i m a    year old  who really hadn t started putting too much effort into skincare up until recently  i already have the vitamin c moisturizer and love it  so i decided to try the serum  along with the eye gel truskin offers  i think it s referred to as super eye cream gel  and it s amazing as well  my under eye area is so smooth and my dark circls have lightened so much  in only about a months time     and the results began immediately   both products feel amazing on application and absorb quickly  and fully no problems with makeup application after use    well  my skin did a  purge   i believe  which is apparently quite common when you begin any new skin care regimen  and i do already get cystic acne right before and during my monthly cycle around my chin  but i thought i d email the company and just ask if possibly i d chosen the wrong product for my partular skin type  i gave a little description of what my skin was doing  along with a little background information about myself to give them a better idea so they could advise me better  and i asked if maybe the tea tree serum would be more appropriate since i had the acne what i ve received from erica in return was so unexpected and so kind  the definition of above and beyond  before anything else  her first instinct was to have me ensure with my doctor that these ingredients were ok for me to use with my treatment  it was something i hadn t even considered  and on top of that it no was a complete shock  a wonderful person  who was much more concerned about me as an individual  rather than making a sale  as i m sure you all know  that s rare these days   i checked with my doctor and my care team  and got back with her to let her know they didn t see anything wrong with me using the products    infact they said they would highly recommend them because of how natural the products are  and though the company did nothing wrong  and i myself had mostly likely just chosen the wrong product for my individual skin type  or who knows  i m still entertaining the idea of using both  alternating days maybe    erica then offered me a complementary bottle if the tea tree super serum  which was more expensive than this product   and again  they had no mistake to rectify     they had done nothing wrong  she was just that kind  and wanted me to be able to try it   what a kind  honest and caring company  and thus far  all of the products are so amazing  and i hope to soon collect the entire line  i truly could not say enough good things about the products themselves  along with the unbelievably honest and caring customer service i have received  definitely purchase this product  note  i ve seen another brand on amazon being advertised  sometimes alongside truskin naturals  products  having very similar packaging and very similar names and claims  i didn t discuss this with erica  but i have noticed it and i did mention it when discussing with my care team to make sure they were reviewing the correct products  and they were in agreement with me  that whatever those products are     they are not the same as  truskin products and do not appear to be as safe  natural  or of high quality like these  so please make sure you don t add a knock off look alike to your cart  and this is not something i ve been paid to do or even asked to do     this is coming straight from my heart and the wonderful  touching experience i ve had with this company        
237,5.0 ,                       i waited a month so i could give an accurate review because i was very skeptical  at first it caused some dryness and flaking  but no pain and since we re wearing masks in public i just powered through  i didn t really think it was doing much  but it s now been a month and every time i look in the mirror i just can t believe it  my melasma and hyperpigmentation are so much better  my skin just looks so bright  i ve also been using the ordinary aha bha peel which i think is working so well with the vitamin c  i am impressed      
238,1.0 ,                       this product absolutely did not work for me  it made my skin extremely dry and accentuated all the fine lines in my face  i had to purchase several different potent moisturizers to help my skin become less try and itchy due to this truskin natural vitamin c serum  beware this product does not work and makes your skin extremely dry  it accentuates all your fines lines and wrinkles      
239,1.0 ,                       i m so upset this product didn t work out the way i was expecting  i was so excited when i read the reviews and saw how great the product worked for people  i guess my skin just doesn t work well with this concentrated serum  i don t have an issue with acne at all  but i was hoping this serum would lighten my previous acne scars and help with my complexion  but after almost   weeks of using this product  it s made my skin so bumpy and itchy  i rarely wear makeup  but even wearing make up doesn t look right  i really want a refund edit  truskin saw my review and immediately emailed me with an apology and offered a full refund with no return of this product  they also offered to send me another product  for free  that would personally work for my skin  they respond quickly and very professionally  a  for customer service      
240,5.0 ,                       during this time of covid    i m taking the time to work on taking care of myself a little better  as a mom it s not been a high priority   and while i m not into makeup  i m into skin health after reading all of the reviews  i decided to try this truskin vitamin c serum it arrived quickly and i was so excited to try it  i started with applying the serum at night and noticed results the very next day  my skin just felt  better  in a way that s a little hard to describe quick description  i m a    year old californian that loves gardening and being in the sun so i have some sun spots  some fine wrinkles aka  laugh lines  around my eyes and mouth  my skin tone is a little uneven and dull and my skin feels a bit fragile and thin  i have had occasional breakouts along my chin line  which is super insulting to have lines  and  breakouts    it seems like the older i get  the larger the pores on my nose got     oh  and the circles under my eyes  agh  terrible i ve now been using this vitamin c serum for three weeks  my skin feels less fragile  my skin tone is evening out  the breakouts i used to get along my chin are diminishing  and something i didn t even think was possible  my pores are smaller      i couldn t believe my eyes and i am so pleased after my positive results after such a short time using this serum  i wanted to try more of the truskin line  i was a little torn on what the next best product to add should be so i emailed truskin customer service and erica promptly replied back with wonderful  helpful information  and guidance i m so pleased to not only have a product that i love and makes my skin look and feel better  but a company that is responsive  kind  and helpful is a company i will return to and continue to support i ve since ordered two more products  the eye gel and the c plus super serum and can t wait to get them i m a shopper that reads all the reviews and i rely on them  though i ll bashfully admit that i don t write as many as i ought to  i m hoping this helps someone like me that is a little unsure or hesitant to make this purchase  just do it     and  i plan to update this review after i have used this vitamin c serum longer than   weeks      
241,5.0 ,                       i replaced this serum with a vitamin c serum that cost me about     a week  i was looking around on amazon for an alternative and saw the reviews for truskin and thought i would try it out and it does not disappoint  i get lots of compliments on my skin since i have used the vitamin c and the vitamin c cleanser  my skin is brighter  smaller pores and my skin looks tighter  i couldn t be happier with my purchase  it s nice they have a coupon you can use too      
242,5.0 ,                          update  after having left this review  the company reached out to me and not only replaced my product  but doubled the quantity i had originally bought  the replacement bottle arrived in perfect shape  i am beyond thrilled and feel absolutely cared for as a customer  i love the product to begin with  and now i love the people selling it  i am very grateful to them for their efforts and i intend to purchase over and over again original review  this is the second time i have purchased this product  and i couldn t love it any more than i already do  it is truly a five star serum and does everything it says it will  brightens complexion  evens out tone  reduces lines wrinkles  etc  it does not irritate my sensitive skin  either  my issue with this product is not how it is formulated  it is how it is packaged  i got my second bottle last week and the inside of the packing envelope was all wet and sticky  turns out the bottle cap pipette was unscrewed from the bottle and a third of the product leaked out  so i only got     of what i paid for     this product is the bees knees but i feel very cheated and would like my     bottle of product back  sad day      
243,5.0 ,                       i ve been using this serum every night for over a month  it feels good on the skin  unfortunately  it s not a miracle worker  my wrinkles are still here  my acne scars haven t faded much  and my large pores still appear the same   however when i stop using it  my skin does look duller  to me  update  i updated my review to   stars for the customer service alone  when they read i wasn t completely happy with the product they contacted me to refund me and offered to send me a different product to try out at no cost  i ve never in my life had a company do that  i think they truly care to keep customers happy      
244,5.0 ,                       honestly  i don t really want to review it b c if it becomes too popular it will sell out too quickly  this will forever be a part of my routine  i followed the rest of the reviewers and used the serum after derma rolling  my first time doing that  and in less than a week my under eye circles were noticeably less   can t wait to see after a couple months  so thankful i learned about the derma roller from the other reviews  thank you      i ve had under eye circles since childhood and i can t tell you how cool it is to not see them in the mirror   the derma roller followed by this perfect truskin serum has changed my life      
245,5.0 ,                       so i wanted to wait awhile before i reviewed this product  i finished my first bottle and ordered a second when the first was running low  i will be a continued user because i do think it works  the biggest thing i noticed with me was that it helped with the little white pimples you get under the the eyes  not sure why but it has helped tremendously with no more of them popping up  i think they are called milia  either way it seems to help with them not coming back   i use it once a day after i wash my face  takes a minute to dry and then i apply a moisturizer  the   oz bottle lasted me almost   weeks  love the product and the way it makes my skin look      
246,1.0 ,                       the only good thing i can say about this serum is that i like how it feels on my face  not greasy at all and leaves your face with a  tight  feeling  i see no difference in the wrinkles or fine lines  if anything my laugh lines are way worse  i had been using youthful surge before trying this and defiantly buying that again  i just tried this because of the great reviews  i read reviews that said it was supposed to be clear  mine is very cloudy and is far from clear  waste of money     
247,3.0 ,                       i was really rooting for this product  great reviews  great price   what more could i ask for  it working on my skin i guess   i attempted the product twice  the first time it caused a break out      pimples  i stopped using it and assumed it may be due to other factors  second time i stuck to using it for one week and boy i should have listened to my body the first time  it cause another break out  worse than my face has ever seen    pimples    puberty  heart break  stress  sleeping in makeup  indulging in fast food   none of these things have made it as bad  my goodness i blamed the pandemic  quarantine  and masks for it but nope nope just not meant for my skin  i stopped using it and within   days my skin was thanking me  so yep  careful my friend  i didn t give a terrible review being it seemed to be an issue with how it reacted with my skin is all  i d tell you the kind i have but i have no clue  prob combo skin  hope i helped some      
248,5.0 ,                       i have dry skin and i thought its a serum which i can use for skin elasticity and moisturizing as well  but it dries out so quickly  my skin feels so dry and tight after applying it  i just started using it but in my opinion  for dry skin like mine  its not goodedit  erica immediately contacted me after my feedback and i wasn t having access to my emails that time but she constantly followed up  she offered full refund and also help me to get me the right product  i am extremely satisfied with their amazing customer service  i recommend them to everyone  if you face any issue  they will be always there to help you      
249,1.0 ,                       this did not work like the others say for my sister and me  it made both our faces irritated  dry and inflamed  my sister even did a spot check  but seemed fine  this is the only product we used in common  my skin feels irritated and flaky  but my sister said hers feeling like it s stinging as if from a really bad sunburn  be very cautious before you use        
250,5.0 ,                       where has this been all my life  this stuff is amazing  at    i am trying to take care of my skin more as i noticed my face looks  tired   i started to use this and saw immediate results  i apply it after washing using a derma roller and follow up with applying moisturizer afterwards  my husband has even noticed a difference after using a week and has said things like  your face is glowing    your face looks radiant    you look different  younger    whatever you are doing is working   bottom line if you re in search of an anti aging serum  stop looking and buy this      
251,3.0 ,                       pros this serum effectively reduces the appearance of pores within seconds of application  it s a decent moisturizer that sits very lightly on the skin  it also makes you  glow  shortly after applying  use it on the backs of your hands if they get dry or chapped with cold weather cons clogged the hell out of my pores  i have new noticeable zits forming on my face within    hours of application  every time    update  this seller is wonderful  i was not pleased with this product and they promptly contacted me to issue a refund and even helped me to find a more suitable product for my skin  overall i m still a very satisfied customer      
252,5.0 ,                       if you re looking for a serum that isn t going to leave your skin feeling sticky   this is your product this serum has changed my skin care routine for life  i love the way it feels on my skin every time i put it on   especially after exfoliating  it dries in about a minute and leaves my skin looking firm and glowy  i ve been using it every day for about a month now and i have seen some major results in my skin tone  everything just looks so much more even and bright load on your favorite moisturizer after and you are feeling like a goddess        
253,5.0 ,                       i have been using this product for about three weeks and i saw a difference after only a few days   i was super skeptical but figured for    bucks it was worth a shot   now three weeks later  my skin tone is much more even   i have actually been leaving my house without makeup   i would normally put on foundation and a bronzer but haven t felt the need to   yes  of course my skin still looks better with some foundation and bronzer  but i feel like it looks good enough to leave the house as is during the day  without feeling like i look haggard   i feel like i look more  put together  now   i also have hyper pigmentation  which it did  not  help with   i still use a bleaching cream at night on my melasma  then wait about    minutes and put this product over my whole face   when i wake up in the morning  my skin looks great   before using this product  the bleaching cream would lighten my melasma  but dry out my face in those areas horribly and my face would be flaking all day   but not with truskin c   my skin looks brighter  more even and more supple   sometimes i don t even wash my face in the morning because it looks that good   i basically use this product at night before bed   rarely do it use it twice a day b c i pretty much only wash my face once a day now   at night      
254,1.0 ,                       this serum did not do well for me  first  it actually caused intense irritation in some spots and made my skin dry  then  within two weeks  it turned so cloudy and bubbly  it scared me  i guess it went bad with bacteria  i gave up and threw it out  it could be that i had an allergic reaction to it since other people give it great reviews      
255,3.0 ,                       i ordered this instead of a different vitamin c serum i had been using  my skin got so dry  i started getting dry red patches on my cheeks and chin and my skin was peeling  i would have thought it was my skin adjusting but i have been using a vitamin c serum for quite sometime so i don t think switching should be causing this big of a negative reaction  it is unfortunate because i really wanted to love this one  update  i have never had a company be so helpful  i was contacted by erica after she saw my review  she offered me a refund and also asked me about my skin concerns and found something that will be easier on more sensitive skin  i was so impressed  the company i would give   stars  the product for my sensitive skin personally was a   but only because of the reaction  i can t wait to try the other product  i updated my star rating to   due to the customer service      
256,5.0 ,                       i m almost    with oily acne prone skin due to pcos  this vitamin c serum along with the vitamin c moisturizer have made my skin go from oily to normal  i used to wake up w extremely oily skin in the am from the serums and moisturizer i would use at night  now when i wake up my face isn t an oil slick  it s just nicely moisturized without all the grease  it has also greatly reduced the acne scarring on my jawline  couldn t be happier w this serum  the customer service is incredible too  ericka will answer any questions you have  and fix any and all problems you might run into      
257,5.0 ,                        update to my earlier review  below  i can t say enough about this serum   i call it crack for your face  it is truly addictive  i vacationed with a friend recently and she had the same bottle  we laughed about how much we both love it  and we both were on our third bottle i bought this product to help with melasma  i have melasma in certain areas of my face and was told by my doctor that it would help to lighten the spots  i thought the spots were sun damage and when i went for an ipl  intense pulsed light   was told that if it was  indeed melasma  and not sun damage  they would darken  lucky me  this serum is unbelievable  it has brightened my skin  leaves it soft  and is helping with my spots  after ordering  the company sent me an email detailing the instructions for use and wanted to know if i was happy with their product  i replied to the email insuring i would definitely be ordering again  so they sent me a code for a free bottle      
258,5.0 ,                       i am truly amazed     i m in my early    s and in just a few days i see incredible results   i m thinking if this progress continues i will look like a teenager soon    i feel that i have wasted lots of time and money on everything else i have ever used on my skin   this serum really works and there is absolutely no comparison to any other vit c serum i have ever tried   i really love the truskin vit c serum and i am looking forward to try the other truskin products   sooo glad i listened to erica at truskin s customer service who helped me with the truskin product selection for my age   skin type   highly recommend   addendum  i did have to give it a couple of days for my skin type  very dry  to get used to the high concentration of tuskin s active vit c serum   at first my face felt very dry but i was able to tolerate it after applying hyaluronic acid serum on top of the vit c serum   within   days my face began to exfoliate really well and after shedding all the dry old skin  the results were fabulous         
259,5.0 ,                       i used to live in arizona and spent lots of time outdoor so got tons of sun spots  some were really dark and big  my dermatologist gave me a cream with    hydroquinone  which works great to lighten the spot  but i don t want to use it for long term due to health concern  so i tried this one  i have been using this product for one month  both in the morning and at night before applying moisturizer  i think it works as well as hydroquinone in terms of reducing and lightening sun spots  the added benefit for me is the skin tightening effect  it s noticeable to me that my skin looks smoother and more even toned  one bottle would last about a month so i just placed another order for this product      
260,5.0 ,                       i have struggled with acne most of high school and in college it got worse  i am    now  before i got married i was willing to spend any amount of money to get clear skin in   months for my wedding   i couldn t figure out the cure i thought kiehl s skin care line would do the trick but actually made my skin worse  i wasn t able to figure out the cure to my skin issues by my wedding day  now that i am pregnant with my  st baby  my skin was getting out of control even more and the harder i tried to clear my skin it was just getting worse even having what i thought was a healthy diet green drinks  oatmeal  almost no sugar and replacing coffee with green tea ect  not until i found truskin vit c while using a     derma roll for my face my skin has completely changed for the better  it s only been   week and my skin is no longer bumpy on my forehead and around my mouth and jawline i haven t felt this great in a long time  i can t stop looking at my skin  i glow more and feel so much more confident   of corse i still try to eat healthy and drink lots of water   my skin is very sensitive and will dry out easily but not with this serum  if i have a small breakout after washing my face  toner  serum  moisturizer i use calamine which is used as an itch reliever for bug bites for on the spot treatment for my pimples overnight  it doesn t dry out my skin but only the pimple  i am ordering more from truskin i am so excited to have beautiful skin and wear a lighter coverage makeup  if you are unsure of how  clean  a product really is download the app  think dirty   i hope i have helped someone with this review      
261,5.0 ,                       i love this serum  at     my hands looked as if i was     maybe     i wish i had taken pictures  but i did not  so very unfortunate  the backs of my hands had tons of age spots and were very dry and wrinkled  now they look firm  moisturized  and almost spot free   i can hardly believe the awesome transformation that has taken place  my face had   dark spots and a very uneven tone  one of the dark spots seems to have disappeared completely while the other is considerably lighter  the overall appearance of my face is now firm and even colored  i can t explain how elated i am with these results thank you for this product  i am definitely a fan and i will continue to use it  i feel young and beautiful again       
262,5.0 ,                       mi piel es con tendencia a acne ademas que es muy sensible y solo llevo   aplicaciones y se nota el cambio me encant      
263,5.0 ,                       i wish i had thought to take before and after pictures  i am    years old and i was skeptical like so many others and i wasn t sure that this formula would work for some of the fine lines i was starting to notice on my forehead as well as the sun spots that have been appearing on my face these past couple of years  i took a chance and went ahead and ordered it  i ve been using this product in the morning and at night for almost a full two weeks now and the fine lines have already softened out and the sun spots all over my face are absolutely fading  i want to say i have not been paid for this review  i just want to help others get the same results we re all looking for  we want a natural approach to reversing the aging process and for an affordable price  i am beginning to love the trueskin line  i had also ordered their rose water toner and i love it  it smells beautiful   i just received my eye gel and vitamin c moisturizer in the mail this morning that i ordered yesterday and i m excited to try those tonight  if i get the same results with those products that i experienced with the vitamin c serum  then i m a raving customer for life  thank you trueskin  i feel like    years have just been lifted from my face  give this skin line a try and i hope you re just as happy with the results as i am only    days in      
264,5.0 ,                       after having tried several supposed  medical grade    expensive  vitamin c serums  i like this one better   this serum works just as well to improve hyperpigmentation and brighten skin as the expensive serums   i ve also found this serum to be stable  that is  it has never changed color or scent over its usage   i use this in combination with other products to improve my skin  plus sunscreen   i will purchase it again      
265,5.0 ,                       i had originally went to get a facial and was told my skin was extremely  thirsty    i thought how is that possible if my skin is very oily   well  it was  she gave me a serum which was well over     bucks and it contained hyaluronic acid and well  my face never felt better  it was well hydrated and the oil in my face cut in half   of course  that was great news except for the fact that the serum cost over     bucks and lasted about   weeks  so i found this serum on here and let me tell you  it does the same thing as the     dollar serum   not only does it hydrate my skin  but it also is healing some acne scars   i have combination skin and it has helped bring down the oily parts of my face to a minimum  and continually hydrates my face   the price is amazing for this product   i have not broken out from it either and that s usually a problem for me with new products  highly recommend this     
266,5.0 ,                       i ve been using this serum now for   months and my complexion has transformed  i m    and just realizing that i m aging way too rapidly lol  i didn t think that slapping on some product is going to work wonders but a girl can wish  i have a pretty big age spots on my cheek that was getting darker and darker and after a few months of use it has faded and a lot less noticeable  i m still documenting so i m hopeful it will continue to get even lighter and maybe disappear lol my overall complexion is much brighter now and my skin feels supple and i ve gotten some glow back  in just   months  i have to say i m impressed and thank you truskin for giving me back my self confidence      
267,5.0 ,                       i have acne prone  sensitive skin  after reading reviews i decided to try this  i spend alot on skincare  my last vitamin c serum was ole henriksen  it had a wonderful smell    but i stayed a little broken out and it was     this is creamy  soft  zero scent to it and my skin is clear and glowing  i had to see what the hype was about bc at     i was very skeptical  well     i love it  try for yourself  and if you don t love it  you didn t spend too much  but you will love it  i only use in the morning  i wash  exfoliate then rub an entire dropper on my face and neck  moisture and then apply my makeup  it s perfect and easy  the positive reviews are accurate      
268,5.0 ,                       i have tried many skin products that are very expensive and not so expensive that claim to get rid of fine lines and renew skin that haven t worked   i got truskin vitamin c  e   hyaluroic acid and vitamin c with b  daily facial moisturizer   the fine lines around my upper lips and around my eyes have diminished greatly and my skin feels like silk  now that is really fantastic for a lady of    yrs  young sandra davis  palm desert  ca      
269,5.0 ,                       i have been using this for about   weeks and i am pleased with the results   i follow with the retinol moisturizer from the same company and my skin looks glowing and healthy   the loose skin and wrinkles around my eyes are gone   i only use at night because my skin gets sun sensitive too much during the day   i hope this company comes up with a daytime moisturizer with sunscreen      
270,5.0 ,                       i really wanted to like this product since it had such good reviews but it did not make my face any better or any worst  just stayed the same  i won t be buying a second bottle    update   the seller reached out to me and gave me a full refund  they also offered me a free item to try  although i declined   which was amazingly nice of them  based on that  i think this seller deserves a   star  thank you      
271,5.0 ,                       this literally cleared marks from my face after like   or days     
272,3.0 ,                       we are all reading about how vitamin c can help our skin and overall complexion   i was excited to try this reasonably priced serum  but i can honestly say it wasn t that great after using the entire bottle the product feels wonderful on your skin   it goes in nicely and provides great hydration and smoothness   however  that s about it   i have noticed my skin is a bit softer  but no other benefits with completion or skin tone   i didn t have any breakouts      
273,2.0 ,                       new  it didn t negatively impact my skin in any way  i didn t see as much of an improvement as compared to others a member from truskin s customer service team  erica  reached out to me regarding my skin care woes and offered suggestions for a new product  she asked for and understood my skin care needs based on which  she suggested products that would help me  i m getting a bottle of the tea tree clear skin serum to try out  i m positive that this serum will be much better for my skin type  i ll write a review again once i get the new bottle so  i would suggest you read up about all their products to decide which one would be the most appropriate one for your skin  though this is the most popular one  other ones like the tea tree serum  c plus super serum  etc might work better for you      no matter what  you re sure to get impeccable customer service  if and when needed    old  used it for   months  no effect  it didn t negatively affect my skin but i could ve done without the           
274,2.0 ,                       i gave this a try but if i saw any difference it was negative   i used it sporadically the first time   i didn t see any improvement in my skin and set it aside   then i decided to try it again  but this time more consistently  so i applied it after cleansing every day for a month   my skin did not look any better  in fact my rosacea looked a little worse  but that could have been due to other factors   next  i tried it on my hands and scalp   again  no improvement  the bottle and dropper are good quality and the ingredients look good  but the product just didn t make a difference for me   maybe it was too much of a good thing for my skin  or maybe i get enough vit c through my diet so this is overkill   don t know  but i m not a fan      
275,5.0 ,                       i used it for while    mos at least  now makes your skin soft but didn t help with the sun blemishes which was the main reason i bought the item update   customer service rep  erica contacted me in regard to the item above  she offered to give me a refund and also sent me another item to try  it is the vitamin c super serum  i have not had the opportunity to try it  but i am looking forward to  i am giving it   star due to excellent customer service erica provided me  thank you erica for all your help      
276,5.0 ,                       oh my i will never be without this   i use it every  rd or  th night and it makes my skin smoother and brighter   vitamin c is a well studied antioxidant that treats your skin right   taken orally it will also help the skin   vitamin c is not so stable and needs to be at a proper ph and this product does both   it is easy to use and has no fragrance or consistency issues   the four products that are essential for a good skin care routine are    retinol     glycolic acid     hyaluronic acid      vitamin ctrukskin is my favorite skincare line  the make excellent products at reasonable prices   do yourself a favor if you have texture or pigmentation issues  give this a try for a month   you will not be disappointed      
277,3.0 ,                       first of all it fell off the thingy and broke so it s all wasted  it has no scent  which is fine  but  it comes out like a foamy poorly mixed froth  and the dispensing dropper isn t the greatest  which is fine  but you have to repeatedly try to get more out which  the dropper looks full but only frothy white bubbly stuff comes out  my lizard brain can handle a lot of information  and from my research  i came to the conclusion i needed this  it s legal  it s over the counter  and even though i don t have a doctor s prescription  i can decide for myself that this is for me and buy it and apply it to my skin using my rights  so  i used it after micro needling and i also use silver gel with it  it feels good on the skin and doesn t burn or anything else  i would say it s an okay product   but  what do i know      
278,3.0 ,                       i was looking for a vitamin c serum with hyaluronic acid and stumbled upon this on amazon   i almost bought a      competing product but thought to try this out based on the great reviews   i m on the  nd bottle and i m not so sure if there is really any fading of sun spots dark spots   i ll use this until the  nd bottle runs out and decide if i should try the      competitor   overall  it didn t cause any skin irritation for me but i m also not sure if i see any improvement      
279,3.0 ,                       so first off i want to start by saying i have very sensitive skin   i bought this product thinking it was good for sensitive skin  and boy was i wrong  when i first applied this serum on my face  it started stinging like crazy  thinking it s just my skin acting up  and i wanted to give this product a solid try before i give up seeing as there were sooooo many good reviews  after     days of using this  this is what my face looked like vs what my skin looked like before using this product edit  changed my review from   to   stars because of their amazing customer service  not only did they offer a refund because the product didn t work out  they also spent some time asking about my skin type and recommended another product that may be more suitable for my skin type  i ve went through a fair share of skin care products as well as companies  since my skin so extremely sensitive x x   and truskin s customer service is by far the best and most genuine      
280,2.0 ,                       very disappointed in this  i have used other vita c serums in the past and seen results  however this product doesnt look  feel or produce any kind results as all the supposed five star reviewers claim  i have used for almost a month and the only noticeable thing to remark on is that this product as well as their retinol serum are pumped up with more hyralonic acid than anything else which in theory will fool you into thinking it is hydrating and skin firming and erasing skin issues i wanted to love this product but there has been absolutely no difference or change in the tone of my skin  a month worth of use should show some sort of difference if this product truly was legit  i feel dupped by the reviews once again on amazon      
281,1.0 ,                       this product has broken me out horribly  and is not my first vitamin c serum  so i do not have sensitive skin towards vit c h acid i know when you start a new skin product you can expect and initial breakout but it s been a month and my skin has not calmed down  it s horrible  i only have acne flair ups around that time of the month and this has made my skin worse than it ever has been  really upset as i do not wear makeup and had to go out and buy concealer to deal with the side effects of this serum      
282,5.0 ,                       amazing stuff  this is the best and fastest solution for my acne scars marks  i have dark skin and had a massive break out on my face from stress last year  the acne left dark  dark marks on my face  especially cheeks  that were just unbearable for me to see  i also had dark patches from things i tried when trying to clear it up  yeah  i looked bad   i gave up hope that my face would improve in the near future  it took months to see little improvement in the marks on my face without vit  c  but only took weeks to clear up with it  the dark patches are gone  my scars have drastically faded  i am not ashamed to show my face anymore  i m really impressed and use it two times a day  also  a little goes a long way  have been using it for almost   months and still half full  would definitely recommend and will keep in my regime also  mine came cloudy  but is still a good product  nothing wrong with it  still works  smells fine  not harmful  don t worry if yours comes cloudy  it s supposed to      
283,5.0 ,                       i m    and i ve been using the vitamin c serum for about   weeks  and i think i am seeing some positive results   i ve been using the serum once a day until my skin gets completely used to it  but eventually  i want to use it twice a day  full disclosure  i m also using a hyaluronic acid based moisturizer from another brand that i ve used for over a year   so far  my skin does look and feel soft throughout the day  and i think i am beginning to see a little improvement in firmness and tone in my cheeks  which used to be very full  apple  cheeks  but thanks to gravity and age  are now showing some signs of sagging   i am hoping that using the serum twice a day will  at the very least  keep the sagging in my cheeks from getting too much worse   looking forward to seeing how things are in another   weeks      
284,5.0 ,                       i was skeptical about buying a facial serum online  but i am so glad i tried this  i ve been using it for three weeks now in the morning and at bedtime along with the eye gel and i plan to purchase a bottle of serum every month  i m applying a thin layer to my face  under chin  down neck  and front of my d colletage  which is a little less than one full dropper  it looks like one bottle will last a month at this rate within one week i saw the lines in my neck beginning to disappear a little  i m almost    and i had very deep creases in my neck from years of looking down  the pores on my face are significantly smaller  the purple acne scars from my once a month cystic acne breakouts seem to be fading a little  and my face seems brighter and less red i ve had rosacea for over a decade and my sensitive skin usually responds badly to anything containing parabens  mineral oil  lanolin  chamomile  fragrances  and dyes  this product does not inflame my rosacea and sensitive skin  and i believe it is actually helping to diminish the redness on my cheeks and across my nose i don t notice any bad smell and the texture of the product is nice  it applies smoothly after i wash my face and after a few moments  i moisturize  it is not heavy or sticky at all  so far i haven t experienced any residue balling up on my skin when i apply products or cosmetics on top of this product after just over three weeks  the deep lines in my neck are so much improved that i do not notice them  last weekend and the weekend before  i was actually asked to show my id to get a glass of wine in two different restaurants  and both servers expressed shock when they saw my year of birth  it has been a long time since i had to show my id  so i do not think these two instances were just coincidence  my fiance says he feels like the serum is rejuvenating my complexion noticeably i m very happy with the product and can t wait to see how my skin will improve in the future with continued use      
285,5.0 ,                       this vitamin c serum arrived the next day through amazon prime  and was a good  competitive price with no shipping charge  it was better priced than some on amazon  and better priced than my local health store  so i am quite pleased with my experience through this seller  this brand is consistently good  it leaves no oily or dry feel to the skin  i put it on under my regular face cream  it really makes my complexion look brighter and more even      
286,5.0 ,                       ot only does my skin look brighter my pores are starting to shrink  the overall appearance of my skin is more even  not nearly as blotchy  my skin feels soft and i have to remind myself to keep my dirty hands off my face   i have not noticed any odor with this bottle  i love the consistency  i can put drops from forehead down to my neck and not have to worry about it running down my face i am very optimistic for future results after seeing what your product has done in such a short period of time      
287,5.0 ,                       no sent and has been great for my skin  i have sensitive  dry  red cheeks  and open pores  it s reduces my dark circles and brighten my skin after using half of the bottle  i definitely have to use a moisturizer after applying the serum because it drys up fast      
288,2.0 ,                       so  not too impressed  but it is more of a natural ingredient product  which is a win   my face is somewhat hydrated  i like it for that  its best used with another oil  otherwise  i think this just sits on top of the face   it has somewhat helped dark pigments fade   it does help even skin tone  however  its not amazing results that you can notice right away  i used almost the full bottle before noticing anything  it wasn t  a horrible experience its just not the best product in my cabinet to rave about  if you just want an even skin tone  this might be a great option      
289,5.0 ,                       i ve never used a serum on my face before  but i do have to admit i don t have sensitive skin and i ve been using different products on my skin  i ve seen reviews saying it wasn t good  thankfully for me it s been working  it s working beautifully on my skin  i see no rashes  no increase in pimples aside from the normal ones  it also helps soothe my skin after working on it  i m very satisfied      
290,4.0 ,                       the serum does not have any scent and was easy and simple to use  however because this is my first time introducing vitamin c product in to my skin routine  i encountered some sensitivity to the product  i had some spots that were itchy and slightly red  the serum did have a noticeable nourishing effect on my skin  made me skin feel supple and moisturized after a few days of use  customer service reached out to me immediately after knowing i had some itchy reaction to the product and offered me full refund without any hesitation  i really appreciate proactive and how understanding they were about finding the right product for a skin routine  even though i did have a reaction to this serum  i highly recommend this product to anyone who is interested in it  tru skin really stood behind their product and policies and i will not hesitate to try other products with them in the future  i am so impressed with their customer service      
291,2.0 ,                       i purchased this product when i was first getting into skincare and after doing some more research i learned this is not a stable vitamin c   as many for sale aren t  mostly because it is not formulated to be the correct ph  it did  and will do  nothing for your skin as it did for mine lol i used more than half the bottle and saw little to no changes  maybe a slight improvement from the simple act of paying more attention to  and massaging my face but that s it there are other well made formulas out there than this      
292,5.0 ,                       this with the dermaroller kicked my crepe necks button  no more crepe neck  at all      
293,3.0 ,                       i love the brand  but this wasn t the correct product for me   while it felt like it was tightening my skin  which is in pretty good shape except for a few deep lines and spots   i saw no noticeable difference after two weeks i switched to the super c serum  and followed it with a retinol moisturizer  and i m starting to see fading in my spots and maybe some improvement in the lines around my eyes do your research   this is a great company with quality products   figure out what s right for you      
294,5.0 ,                       i have never used a skincare product so effective at brightening my skin tone and adding vibrancy to my complexion  i wanted to start using vitamin c as so many dermatologists were recommending adding it to morning skincare routines  but i didn t want to spend a fortune on something at sephora  so i stumbled across this  and it has made a noticeable difference within a month  i also suffer from acne and oily skin  so i was using a topical cream to combat acne in combination with this  in the morning  first  i spot apply my acne cream  then apply this serum all over  then a general moisturizer  especially in the dry winter   and then sunscreen  this routine has transformed my skin  and i rarely wear foundation anymore  do not bother spending         bucks on other serums  this one will do the trick for far less money      
295,5.0 ,                       y all  i am    and have been struggling with my skin since i was     in    years  i haven t figured the trick out  changed birth controls for hormone levels  chug water  work out  doesn t matter  i tried the vitamin c serum and the daily facial toner and after   weeks  my skin has changed for the better  after the first week  i saw changes of clearer skin  but week two  the period hit  and i didnt break out  if i had before and after photos  i d put them up  but in my acts of defiance against millennial standards  i never really take selfies  my coworkers and friends have noticed the change in my skin and my friends are raving  my southern mother even noted on how clear my skin is saying   you re skin finally is clearing up  maybe that will help you find a husband    kidding slightly i digress  after spending some serious money on expensive products  cough r f  and never finding results  i ve found my affordable facial savior   also their customer service team is bomb      
296,5.0 ,                       i rolled the dice on this and am glad i did  i ve been suffering from random dry  dull patches throughout pregnancy and have very sensitive skin  i get breakouts easily  as well as redness  this has been amazing  my skin didn t react negatively and it s glowing now i ve used it twice daily for about a week now and love it  it isn t greasy at all and sinks right into skin  i still apply a moisturizer and do not feel that it s too much  in my current pregnancy state of weird skin  or that it prevents the moisturizer from absorbing i love how even it s made my skin  and has already revived a little of the elasticity and brightness  i ll definitely buy again and may try other items in the line      
297,5.0 ,                       i turned    and decided i needed to get serious on my skin care  this has been so helpful maintaining my complexion  it has been the only consistent variable to my skin routine aside from a    x weekly dermaroller  i am prone to cystic acne and this has alleviated any serious breakout and its great  i ve had a few scares where i feel some cystic acne coming on and within two or three days this has deflated what would have been a total skin eruption just for the record  twice a day i cleanse with la roche posay gentle hydrating cleanser  then tone with rose water        rose water only   use the vitamin c serum  then moisturize with am cerave moisturizer at night i do the same  but if i dermaroll  i do cleanse tone vitamin c serum dermaroll then a second round of vitamin c serum and an oil  peet rivko daily balancing oil   then moisturize with cerave pm moisturizer the vitamin c serum has been amazing  i will continue to buy this brand in the future      
298,5.0 ,                       since i began using it from the day of purchase        i have noticed positive changes on my skin  i started a new skincare routine so i bought it with the intention to use it with my derma rollers    mm     mm    i have a really sensitive and dry skin  so it is easy for my face to flare up in a reaction and become red my routine is as follows     cleanse    apply derma roller over face  frequency is every other night  starting with once a week or when my face has fully recovered     apply truskin naturals serum    apply hydro boost skin cream  eye cream  and vaseline  in the morning i would apply the hydro boost skin cream and sunblock  the only step i do not do every night is    i have noticed my skin growing lighter and my acne scars more shallow  before it was noticeably deep  since i m starting a completely new skincare routine  it s hard for me to tell where most of the improvements are coming from  though it probably is a culmination of all of these products  i would assume that the vitamin c has been partially  if not all  responsible for my skin lightening  which was unexpected but not something i oppose to  otherwise  no allergic reactions of any kind on my very sensitive face  and i m very happy with the product and will continue to use it  thank you      
299,5.0 ,                       i m    years old and my skin since the pandemic has gotten quite out of hand  the mask wearing and the feeling of being overwhelmed has really taken a toll on my skin  i m breaking out like a teen that just hit puberty  it s been rough lately i saw all the reviews and thought  what s it going to hurt  my cystic acne that s been the size of boulders has started to subside and my dark spots are clearing up only after a week of use day and night  i m really impressed by the product so far  plan to update after a month of use  but so far so good edit  purchased my second bottle and so far so good  the   days i didn t have this serum i noticed my dark spots didn t change at all  the first day i got it again the next day the darks spots were slowly fading again  again love this product        
300,3.0 ,                       i really really wish i liked this product  i have no doubt this is a great product  it just wasn t a great product for me  i have sensitive skin that clogs easily  this product made my skin flare on my cheeks in my t zone  i ve been using it for almost two weeks and it s just not doing it for me  i use it every night and use a derma roller twice a week and not even my scarring is going away  my scarring is pretty minimal to begin with  but it s just not giving me any results  again  i m sure it s a terrific product  just not for me        
301,5.0 ,                       i m just a regular person  out of all things  i really enjoyed this product  i ordered a small bottle of it to try  my routine is washing my face off  using some toner after that dries up  then i apply four little dots on my face forehead  both cheek bones and chin   i ve been doing this as soon as i wake up and before going to bed  i love it  i ve been seeing my skin clearing up and tightening  i have nothing bad to say  i m now just waiting on the bigger bottle that i just ordered  i suffer from dark spots and dark circles  i ve been trying to find something to make me look refreshed and this helped a lot  i ordered another product of theirs for a friend  my friend is old but i know she ll love this    thankful that i found this      
302,4.0 ,                       i was looking for a vitamin c serum  and the reviews for this product were stellar  so i though i would go ahead and try it  as for any skincare product  there is a chance that it will not agree with your skin  this serum  unfortunately  did not agree with my skin  it made my skin feel smooth and hydrated  however it created some irritating texture  it just did not work for my specific skin type  i do not have sensitive skin  so there was no rhyme or reason for it  the product and i just weren t compatible  however  the customer service was some of the best i have encountered thus far  i received an email that asked me how the product was working for me  as soon as i replied that it was not the one for me  truskin was so amazing about the process of helping me out  erica was so personable and helpful  it made the whole experience of trying and experimenting with different products extremely pleasant  hopefully i can find a product from this brand that does work for me because they are outstanding as an overall company      
303,1.0 ,                       i used this product before for dark spots on my face and it worked good so i ordered another one and started using it after    days of receiving the product as i didn t get the time as soon as i applied it i got rashes all over my face so stopped using it for   to   days and my face was normal so i again i applied to check if everything is normal but the same rashes appeared again my husband also applied to check and he even got rashes and some burning kind of sensation on his face so we both stopped using it i don t know what was the issue      
304,2.0 ,                       i ve been searching for a good vitamin c serum and was hopeful this would be it  based on all the great reviews  i used it up  wanting to give it a good shot  i did not notice a difference in my skin  i saw some reviews that said they didn t think it made a difference until they stopped using it   but i didn t notice a change even then  i found it pretty drying  but i live in denver where the air is already pretty dry so maybe that was it  i was always itchy to put on moisturizer immediately after applying this because it made my skin uncomfortably dry      
305,1.0 ,                       my skin is allergic with this serum  maybe it works for others but not with me  i m    yo  my skin might be too yound to adapt this product  and now my skinface is terrible now  there is too many small red dots and some areas are burned  it s not smooth as before i use  so regretted         
306,3.0 ,                       doesn t seem to be working for me  ive been using this for about  weekd now but iunfortunately im not seeing the difference  not everyone gets the same result i guess but im giving   stars because it gave me a minor burn on the left cheek area  other areas are fine  ive used very small amount because i was afraid of breakout  i put some aloe product for the past week and it is much better now  i recommand you to test the product on your arm first       
307,5.0 ,                       i received my order of the truskin vitamin c serum within a couple days  i read the reviews and was a bit hesitant because my skin can be sensitive  upon delivery in was packaged in bubble wrap and was completely sealed now i m    and for years i have ventured to find the holy grail in skin care products  i m just a regular woman who can t afford those high end department store creams  i spent my younger years sunbathing and even some tanning beds  i quit doing all that a decade ago  so as i age i really wanted to focus on my skin  it s turned dull and the fine lines are beginning to creep so i began to do a bit of research and read so many positive reviews about truskin c  and seeing pictures from women who were mature i was quite curious  the price was reasonable and i thought  what the heck  lets give it a try     well i ve used it last night for the first time  i m obsessed     i never thought i would see much results let alone so quickly  i woke up with such glowing skin this morning  and my face feels so soft  i can hardly wait to see the results after a couple weeks  i love this serum    i m definitely going to make this part of my daily routine  i m not even going to bother looking at other brands  why would i  this is perfect   thank you  erica for having such a great product  i m going for the retinol next  can t wait    customer for life      
308,5.0 ,                       i can t believe what i m noticing in just   days   complexion is more even   less oily through the day   crows feet are becoming more fine rather then crapy   i m   weeks shy of turning    and i ve never been more comfortable in my own skin then now   i m also experiencing melasma on my upper lip  but that will take more time to lighten   fingers crossed this will help with that as well   reviewers have said this has a bad odor  but i don t find that at all   someone mentioned it smelling a bit like leather  and i would agree   but it s very light and dissipates in seconds   i use   drops for my face and   for my neck in the morning   then put on sunscreen and moisturizer   i feel like there s a firmness to my skin that i haven t felt in a long time   also  no breakouts since using   i m really excited to have found this and hope all this good stuff continues      
309,5.0 ,                       the product is fantastic  it has tightened my skin around my jowels and the skin around my eyes has less wrinkles  my pores don t look as large and my makeup goes on better  love this product  the smell is even great  i was also begining to see fine wrinkles in my neck and this tightened the skin and made them less visable  i also recommend a good moisturizer after applying the serum      
310,2.0 ,                       i was so hopeful for this serum to work for me given all the positive reviews  i did a test patch for the first    hours as directed and had no problem  then started using it just once a day at night before bed  unfortunately i had an allergic reaction  after a few days  it began to dry out my skin and left it very itchy  additionally  i was careful to keep it away from my eyes  but because of the way my skin reacted it caused my eyes to swell and become puffy when i woke up in the morning   since discontinuing two days ago  my skin is starting to return to normal and the swelling around my eyes has come down significantly none of this is at the fault of the company  i do understand everyone s skin is different and what works for some  may not always work for others      
311,1.0 ,                       i was so excited to try this  i have had perfect skin since i could remember  currently    years old   i didn t necessarily need anything for my face but i wanted to start a skin care routine because i m getting older  unfortunately  this serum dried out my skin  it left me random dry spots in my face  my skin was so dry that if i applied just a normal face cleanser or face cream it burned really bad  i m so disappointed      
312,1.0 ,                       i purchased this product because of its raving reviews but wish those who changed their rating to give more stars because of  great customer service   wouldn t have  i am happy to see the positive results of others but i didn t have the same experience three things i have been dealing with for the first time in my life since using this serum  with it being the only change in my skincare routine    awful acne on chin   redness dryness and irritation around eyes   dry  flaky  red sunburn like skinread on    my serum was cloudy from the start  i know it s says that is expected so i tried it out anyway  i ve been using this product for two months now on and off and every time i use it consistently for about a week something goes wrong  i started breaking out around my chin like never before  see pictures  i saw some reviews  that were later changed to five stars  with similar complaints  i also read about it giving you red  itchy  flaky skin almost like a sunburn  same thing happened to me  at first i thought it was just my skin being sensitive to the cold air but after reading those similar reviews i m convinced it s this serum  another commonality in reviews   redness and puffy ness around eyes almost like an allergic reaction   i had to go to a dermatologist for the first time in my life after using this product and i couldn t figure out what was going on with my skin but after reading similar issues i am convinced it s this vitamin c serum  beware of this product because it doesn t work well for everyone  i would not recommend and i won t be changing my rating because i feel people should not be fooled into buying because of high rating  just because customer service is great doesn t mean product is great      
313,5.0 ,                       i have tried several vitamin c serums  and this is my favorite one   it is thicker and stays on your skin where you want it to stay  and it definitely works   here is what works for me  i wash my face with      olay regenerist cream cleanser  regenerating    oz                         in the morning shower  then immediately after i apply truskin vitamin c serum  allow to dry for     minutes  then follow with a high quality moisturizer  i use      olay regenerist micro sculpting cream face moisturizer  fragrance free     oz                           then before bed  wash my face with olay regenerist regenerating cream cleanser again  and re apply the truskin vitamin c serum  allow     minutes to dry  and follow with the olay moisturizer   doing this every day makes a definite positive impact  i am    years old  the picture attached is me   weeks ago      
314,5.0 ,                       update  i must commend erica  the seller  she reached out to me after discovering my disappointment in the product  she promptly refunded the cost of my purchase and sent out a new vitamin c serum  included with the second bottle was information  on what to expect and how to use the product  i m impressed with the customer service of this company  my concerns were dealt with promptly and i m excited to see the results from using this vitamin c serumthis is my first foray into vitamin c serum  i really didn t know what to expect  though i would have expected a bottle to be completely full  half of this bottle was bubbles and air      
315,5.0 ,                       i ve had acne for     years  leaving me with lots of scars  i apply this serum twice a day  after my morning shower  after washing face before bed  and it leaves my skin so soft and my scars have lightened a lot  on new acne  it helps heal them and the skin turns over noticeably faster  i tend to get very  weepy  acne  and this serum is great with stopping that and lowering oil production on my nose i don t think i could live without this now      
316,5.0 ,                       i see results and i am so happy  march    vs june        
317,1.0 ,                       i give   stars but i have to give one    so the product is responsible priced  dose smell nice  however i had a allergic reaction to truskin vitamin c serum  it got red itchy flaky  and one co worker said what s wrong with your face  did you get burned   no thanks sherri for your concerns    anyway i do have extra sensitive skin  it s like pepper  the serum is too strong for me   p s   was not going to leave a picture of my face as a reptilian creature  looked like off of land of the lost      
318,5.0 ,                       i have so many things to say about this product and customer service  please read for starters  i read most of the reviews for the product and all of them were quite impressive  i decided to give it a shot  i am a face care junkie  and have tried everything    i m     i do not have too many wrinkles  but i want to take care of my sun damaged skin from back in the day when  tanning with baby oil  was cool  after going to the dermatologist and seeing what was under my skin   a complexion analysis  i was horrified  all of that damage will make its way to the surface and expose sunspots and again by the time i m     prevention is key i ordered the facewash  serum  toner  and eye gel i have been using all   up to twice a day  my face feels baby soft  the fine lines around my eyes are vanishing  the puffiness under my eyes is gone  i don t wake up with bags at all  i m sold on all of these products customer service is outstanding  i have never received a personal one on one email from any company from amazon that i ve made a purchase from  i received an email from a nice lady named erica who just wanted to check in and make sure i was enjoying their products  she also asked if there was anything i disliked and anything she could do to help  i m blown away with the customer service at truskin let me also add that i was no paid for this whatsoever  i m just a country girl from mississippi addicted to taking care of my sun damaged skin and felt compelled to leave a review from my results thus far and the kind email i received after my purchase      
319,5.0 ,                       i just got this two days ago and i m loving it    here s really important info when it comes to using hyaluronic acid  it absolutely needs water to work  lack of it will result in drying out your skin  so if you don t live in a humid area then you have to use water with any hyaluronic acid  for me i use it when i come out of the shower  i don t dry my face but rather let it dry naturally a little until it s still quite moist  i add this hyaluronic acid to my fingers   then smooth   press all over my face  then after a minute i add another spritz of water to my face to lock that water in and let it work it s magic  if you don t provide it the water  it can t do what it s meant to do  after my face has almost dried i then press in a few drops of marula oil   at night i follow with a thicker moisturizer  glow city       
320,5.0 ,                       i bought this because my doctor said vit c serum is the best thing for your skin     she gave me a sample bottle from her office of a different product that is more expensive so i figured this would be a good alternative to not spending       unfortunately this product was not great for my skin type  maybe my skin is too sensitive  but i broke out around my eyes with painful bumps and had painful bumps and red dryness on my cheeks i know you might be wondering why id give something   stars that i had some sort of reaction to  i was contacted by erica  a member of truskin through email  she was more than helpful and noted that i was probably had some sort of allergic reaction to the serum  not only did she refund the total amount of my order  but she wanted to know more  we emailed back and forth about what product my own doctor had given me  the      serum i was trying to save some money from ordering  and she compared the ingredients to some of the products from this company  she then took it upon herself to send a different more fitting product after doing some research for me as a gift from this company i have never had an experience like this from amazon before  this company really went above and beyond to make sure i had a good experience with them  i wouldn t be writing this if i wasn t extremely impressed  i got a confirmation email stating that the gift product was sent out  i am really impressed  erica  thank you so much  you have restored my faith  i can t wait to try out this next product  thank you  thank you  and thank you again         
321,1.0 ,                       i was excited to try this product from all the buzz it has gotten on social media  vitamin c is a great skin care option for brightening your skin and serums are a great way to get that  but this product i found it to be not useful at all  it made my skin itchy and it did not absorb into my skin at all like i had expected it to  i dove into the ingredients list a little more after my bad reaction msm   while methylsulfonylmethane is relatively safe if you ingest it for no more than   months  inflammation relief  there is no studies shown what it does as a topical  no fly zone for me witch hazel   this can dry and strip your skin  it s not what you think it is phenoxyethanol   pretty much a fragrance and can chase eczema and issues in infants born to mothers who have been exposed i m really sad this wasn t a better product  really truly      
322,5.0 ,                       bought this item back in january and i wanted to wait and use the product for a decent amount of time before reviewing it  this product paid for itself within the first week i used it  i suffer from cystic hormonal adult acne so i m pretty much always breaking out and this baby dries breakouts up faster than anything i ve ever used and trust me  i ve used just about everything over the counter  for those wondering  i didn t notice that this caused less breakouts  nor did this fade out any existing hyperpigmentation  prior to this serum  i had been using     benzoyl peroxide to treat my acne topically and it works wonderfully to dry out blemishes  however it leaves your skin super dry and flakey to the point where your makeup looks flakey  even if you used a serum or moisturizer beforehand  that s why i love this serum because it gets rid of acne without drying out your skin  the only reason why i do still keep benzoyl peroxide onhand is because it kills the bacteria that causes acne and this serum doesn t have the ability to do that  i tend to breakout in the same areas over and over because of underlying bacteria  bottom line buy this  i just repurchased  but in the  oz size this time  love this stuff and i see myself using it for as long as it continues to be sold      
323,5.0 ,                        update  after i posted my negative review  truskin s erica reached out to me and asked me about my experience with it  and i told them the same thing as in my review  they apologized and kept true on their word for offering the refund  and sent me a receipt for them issuing the refund  so  if you do order this  you don t need to be afraid of wasting money  this five star review isn t exactly for the product but for them fulfilling their end of refunding unhappy customers  i can t say i recommend the product since it did nothing for me  but you re not losing either if you don t like it  original review  when i received it  it was cloudy and the company sends a card that says it can be clear to cloudy in consistency but it should still work  apparently  if the consistency is foggy and opaque  it s apparently lost most of it s benefits for the skin  and i feel like that s true with this product  i ve been using it for the last three weeks  and it goes on smooth  absorbs  but i ve seen no difference  i ve been using it everyday  and i ve seen no difference  no brightness or anything  and my skin feels pretty much the same as before  it s really disappointing  especially since the review are really great for this product  maybe if mine was clear it d actually work  but i m not going to spend another     to find out if it does work  maybe in the future  but for now i d give this product a pass on the bright side it didn t damage my skin and burn or irritate it      
324,5.0 ,                       amazing amazing product omg i dont even know how to express how i feel about this product is has done wonders i use to be so depressed about my skin didnt want to leave the house without make up and this product has really helped clear the marks   im soo soo very happy  for years i have been struggling with dark marks on my skin  i wish i was introduced to this product before spending so much of money on many different products that dont even work and are really costly     im so happy i purchased this vitamin c i started seeing results just after   days of use     
325,5.0 ,                       i found out about this product through susan yara s youtube channel mixed makeup   started implementing a real  simple    effective skin care routine for morning   night  i previously had no clue that i wasn t treating my skin right  which is why i had the problems i did prior  had sensitive skin   acne prone areas  fine wrinkles    surface dryness  i do this serum then my retinol  retin a soon   and then a moisturizer  then sunscreen during the day  right after washing my face   applying  my skin feels smooth  hydrated  and balanced   serum is not oily  you need to follow directions and let it absorb into the skin  i have no complaints about the smell the product works for me if it had perfume fragrances then i wouldn t use this product    weeks in and my skin looks luminous and feels the best it s ever felt  this company is so wonderful when you give them feedback too  so i m getting one for my bf s mom as well  will update with before   after photos  thank you so much guys      
326,1.0 ,                       so i wanted to use this product before i wrote a review  i got it originally because it looked comparable to the ultra glow serum from sephora  which is my go to serum  unfortunately i was only able to use this a few times before throwing the bottle away out of frustration  this made my skin so dry it was unbelievable  i tried it a few more times to make sure and yep  every time ended in the same result  if you re looking for a good serum i recommend the ultra glow vitamin c serum from sephora  it s around the same price as this and good for sensitive skin  i will be sticking to that from now on      
327,2.0 ,                       have used other c serums with fair results but this one didn t work at all for me  ive started getting pale brown spots on cheeks and thought this would nip it in the bud  i have decently good skin and used the full bottle over about       months  saw no lightening of spots  bummer      
328,5.0 ,                       i have bought truskin s vitamin c serum twice now and definitely plan to purchase once i run out again   it has been three months now  and this serum helps me hydrate my combination skin   when i learned about sezia co from watching one of hyram s youtube videos  i started double checking the ingredient lists from potential products i considered buying   this formula is definitely malassezia folliculitis safe and does not contribute to fungal acne   this little bottle met all of my requirements in a skin care brand   it s cruelty free  vegan  is free from malassezia folliculitis causing agents  it is helping me clear up my post acne marks and my biggest reason is that it is affordable   for anyone who is considering to venture to try a vitamin c serum  i definitely recommend this one from truskin      
329,3.0 ,                       this serum is very light but not moisturizing  it actually dried out my skin pretty bad  after application  i felt a slight burning sensation that i didn t think much about because i thought it would go away  but it never did  so at the end of the day when i realized the burning never stopped  i started running my fingers along my cheeks to see where exactly it was coming from and i felt scratches on my face  however  i hadn t been scratching my face  so i looked in the mirror and i didn t see any red marks  but my face was very dry and peeling  i m so bummed because of the great reviews  but i guess it just doesn t work for everyone  a lot of people seem to have benefited from it  so it s worth a try  oh  and maybe it had something to do with the fact that i use a     benzoyl peroxide face wash  anyways  it s a no for me update  i ve read that hyaluronic acid can have the opposite effect of it s purpose  moisturizing  when applied to already dry skin  when it s used on dry skin in a dry climate  it actually starts pulling moisture from your skin instead of drawing moisture from the air into your skin  i believe that s what happened to me  anyways  a lovely representative named erica reached out to me a week or two later and offered to help me find something better for my skin  which is above and beyond my expectation for any business  i am used to accepting refunds and being on my merry way  but it shows a genuine care for customers when businesses offer to help you solve your problems hope this helps      
330,5.0 ,                       first note  it s an effective serum and i saw improvement in some dark spots i had left over from acne that had healed  the most dramatic difference was that i saw a lightening of my under eye circles which was really cool because i wasn t expecting it  my only complaint was that the product didn t seem to last long for me  and when i got an email from the company asking how this worked for me  i mentioned my complaint and now i assume the length of the product use was because i was using more than i needed each night  so the bottom line is yes it works  but even better  the customer service is lovely and the company seems to care a lot about what people think rather than some companies i ve run across that you never hear a word from      
331,5.0 ,                       i am a licensed esthetician healthcoach  my understanding of product is pretty thorough  i have tested and used many over   yrs i ordered this product out of curiosity  i ve been using it for about a month and i do notice some textural change  i have post sun damage skin and it needs alot of support from both inside and outside  i found using this serum with the day creme truskin makes works great i use it morning and evening  it is very gentle even around the eyes  which tells me its a stable formula  probably  safe for the most sensitive skin types  its best to use after you cleanse and tone your skin  i am going to try both cleanser and toner from this line and will have more to tell i really like the customer service they are excellent  give them a try    for the quality   the price is excellent       
332,5.0 ,                       i love this product      not gonna lie they say a little goes a long way but i would use almost two syringes full of product on my face and neck  my skin is very dry  i could feel an immediate tighten of my skin then i made a bad decision  for whatever reason i decided to try a free sample of a different and exspensive  serum  well i must of been allergic to some ingredient in this other brand because my skin broke out really  bad   my cheeks looked like it was covered in acne   and like everyone    i was picking at my face making it worse  so i went back to using tru skin on my face   i notice how it reduced the red blotchy areas even reducing the pimples  after a week my face was back to normal i m    and my skin looks more radiant feels hydrated and very soft  i just placed another order  this is also great under makeup  this product convinced me to buy more trueskin products      
333,5.0 ,                       i didn t have much of a skincare routine prior to using this product  i was cleansing and moisturizing in the morning only  my skin is extremely oily and i d really given up on having good skin but i read up and watched several videos for skincare and decided to add truskin vitamin c serum and change my cleanser and moisturizer and have immediately seen a difference   my skin is nice and clear  plump and moisturized and the unevenness in my skin tone has regulated i also received emailed instructions for best use since i was just beginning to use it and a request to know about my experience after a couple of weeks of use   that type of service alone has me looking at all of truskin products to add to my skincare regimen moving forward      
334,5.0 ,                       i never do reviews  that being said  this product does exactly what it is supposed to do  my skin is already changing after a few weeks of usage  i had left over faded red spots on my face from a season of acne i had   years ago  no product has improved those marks until now  my marks aren t completely gone yet  but they are continuing to fade and i ve been using the product for about a month  i will keep using because i am convinced that this is the key secret to glowing skin  it feels light weight when i put it on in the morning and then i wear my revision intellishade moisturizer over it  along with my eye cream  i wish someone would have encouraged me to use this years ago  it s like a secret ingredient and i just feel so good about my skin finally  i have sensitive oily skin and so far i haven t had any breakouts      
335,5.0 ,                       just got my bottle of this  i actually found out about it on a bloggers page  she was recommending mad hippie vitamin c serum and someone asked for a more potent formula and she suggested this so i decided to try it out and i am soo glad i did  i get blemished skin from popping my blackhead and pimples and then my skin gets ruined and looks ugly for a few weeks and i have to use extra makeup to cover up my damaged skin  this serum literally took only   days to get to me  package was in tact and today is my first time using it and within the few hours it has been on my face  i noticed my blemishes are getting lighter  already  i can t wait to see what they look like tomorrow or in a week  people say it makes your skin dry and it does feel dry at first but you got to let it settle in on the skin for awhile  if it does make your skin feel dry or taught  mix it with a little bit of vitamin e  i mixed mine with vitamin e because i feel like my skin needs the extra help right now  this product works well  i am very surprised at how quickly it started working  very happy with it  so far   try it out      
336,1.0 ,                       i ve tried this for two separate periods of time now since i bought it  and i have broken out in small red pimples  especially around my eyes   both times  i am not pleased  i am also noticing that this product likely has such high reviews because a lot of people change their reviews to   stars after the company contacts them once they have posted a negative review  i searched  break  for  break outs  specifically and started to see this trend   i have sensitive combination skin  but i never break out like this      
337,5.0 ,                       i am a black woman with dark and sensitive skin   i was looking for a product to lighten or completey remove hyperpigmentations from acne on my face and back  i have tried many other products without success   the serum not only contains vitamin c    but vitamin e  hyaluronic acid and witch hazel  these ingredients are know to help reduce the appearance of dark spots   i was amazed that the dark spots appeared lighter after only a few days   i just ordered a second bottle and highly recommend this serum   note  be sure to use a moisturizer as it did dry my skin  thus i recommend only using a drop on the affected area s       
338,5.0 ,                       love this line mostly  i am east indian and pick at my skin line a nut  but this is clearing up much of my acne scars  it s affordable but as i get older i could use more hydrating products from this line i have the best vt  c daily facial wash  best retionol moisturizer   which i use twice a week    the vitamin c moisturizer  the anti  aging formula for under eye cream   and of course the vt c serum  i believe that using all these products in conjunction with exfoliating   and practicing some self  control  has faded my scars  slowly but definitely  good luck      
339,1.0 ,                       zero stars for this product  used it once and i got zits on my face after applying it  thankfully it was gone in   days  i tested it on my neck and there was no reaction  the return period has passed so i m stuck with it  i bought it after all the raving reviews   certainly didnt work for me  they have a vip member card included with  claim your first reward today before it expires    well   i m not looking for their membership this product      
340,4.0 ,                          update   i have changed my review from a   star to a   star  the customer service is incredible  a representative reached out to me and apologized about the issues i was having  they have offered me a full refund and advice on what products they have that might help my skin  they ve offered me a complimentary bottle on a product they believe will help my skin after me naming the issues i have want to resolve  a sincere apology  a refund  and a complimentary bottle of a product that might help my skin  i couldn t be happier with the customer service  this product has completely messed up my skin in just a couple days of use  i have worked so hard to improve my skin and this product has done damage  it s almost as if the damage appeared overnight  so sad  i am completely unhappy with the state my skin is now in  item feels more tacky on the skin than it is moisturizing  my skin is sensitive and this seems to have left my skin really red  not for sensitive skin  and it smells like chemicals  not a pleasant smell       would not recommend      
341,5.0 ,                       this stuff is like my must have holy grail product now  i always struggled with rough feeling skin and it would be overly dry and oily in different spots  i also had some minor acne scarring and zits along my jawline that wouldn t go away  this formula helped clear all of those things up  i wasn t expecting much from it at first  so when i say i was blown away i mean it  i saw improvements the first time i used it  my only warning is don t use to much in one spot of your face because it can make you break out a little      
342,5.0 ,                       i have been using this product for over   months  now   i am always a bit skeptical about beauty products  in general   however  i had read about the benefits of topical vitamin c for the skin  as vitamin c is used by the body for collagen production   i thought i would give it a try when i first used the serum  i was already pleased with the way my skin felt to the touch after application   then i noticed over time that my overall complexion was improving   i have been using a nighttime moisturizer for some time by a different manufacturer  and when i added this to my regimen  applying at first in the daytime  under my make up  i began to notice a visible reduction in fine lines i used the first bottle twice a day  i was very consistent and did not skip a day of application  i think consistency is the key  here   i have since gone back down to once a day application in the morning  but i will apply a little on my forehead at night since i have the most fine lines there    i went back to once a day application  not for any skin irritation or anything like that  but simply because it is a little more economic for me at the moment i am very pleased with the product and will continue to use it as part of my regimen   the company customer service is very friendly and helpful  and really appreciate feedback on their product      
343,5.0 ,                       i don t use it twice a day as suggested  i forget usually   i can only say it seems to be lightening age spots   since i don t use it as recommended  i really don t want to to say anything other than it appears to be working and has not hurt my skin at all   update    i have now been using the vitamin c serum for over a month now and using it correctly   my dark age spots are slowly lightening   with the help of a customer service rep from truskin  i have been able to keep my regime up more easily   with her help i am also using the retinol moisturizer  which i love   my skin feels so much smoother and the tone is beginning to even out   i am    years old  so i am happy about this   kudos to truskin for not giving up on me      
344,3.0 ,                       overall it s ok  but i think i have tried better vitamin c serums   i did not notice any long term difference in my skin  and i have used it for quiet a while now   it must be used within two months  otherwise  i have found that the vitamin c  or perhaps another ingredient in it  tends to become a white powder sticking on the bottle  the liquid will still be there  but the white sticky powder i don t get   i will be trying a different vitamin c serum      
345,4.0 ,                       this is a nice daily face serum  i have very sensitive skin and eczema on my face and  as i do not put it on my very dry areas  this is so nice for the rest of my face and does not dry me out at all  a lot of serums can make your skin feel like it sits on top and does not soak in  but this serum absorbs really fast  i always apply a moisturizer as well once it soaks all the way in  this product did not cause me any acne  did not burn my sensitive skin  and made my face feel really nice      
346,5.0 ,                       es dificil enviar fotografias o videos porque no tengo un antes del uso del producto  pero podria decir que me dio los resultados esperados porque tenia un piel extremadamente reseca tonto asi que tenia rash  peeo despues de una semana de uso de truskin naturals vitamin c mi piel luce tersa y no mas rash      
347,5.0 ,                       guys and gals  i cannot stress enough how much this product has changed my skin  i bought the bottle after reading several positive reviews and committed myself to using the entire bottle before giving up  i will never go back  i have suffered from acne most of my life so along with breakouts  i have always had discoloration and scars  after a few weeks of using this serum religiously at night  i can proudly say that my discolored spots are nearly gone  i have had no new breakouts  and my skin is as soft and supple as a baby s  i just bought my  nd bottle and i m seriously considering buying in bulk to make sure i never run out lol  do your face a favor and try it now  you won t regret it        
348,5.0 ,                       the best and most inexpensive serum i ve ever purchased  it works wonders  and the price is divine i ve used many serums previously and loved the results  but hated the price  this worked just as well as the super expensive products i purchased  maybe better  it s super light  with little or no fragrance and doesn t irritate my skin  i have very sensitive skin   it s extra effective when used with my dermal roller once or twice a month  i have very tiny milia  small hard bumps that look like whiteheads but aren t  around my hairline  they are impossible to extract at home  you must go to a dermatologist  i no longer have a problem with milia  this serum gently exfoliates them and they self extract i would most definitely recommend this product for anyone in the market for an inexpensive effective face serum      
349,3.0 ,                       i will keep this very short overall  fairmoisturizer  lightsmell  noneskin irritation  nonecolor  foggyacne improvement  no differenceskin lightener  noneuse  daily for a monthbody part used on  face   neckwrinkles  no differencedoes it work  honestly i did not see much of a change in my skin maybe it works for others but unfortunately i did not see a change of improvement in my skin  i would try it again just to see if maybe the batch i previously bought was a bad batch update     sep       this company sure knows how to make their customers happy  they offered me a full refund   a new product  thank you so much truskin      
350,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          on my second bottle i used to breakout so bad especially when my period were near  like in the video  but with this serum i get a glow so intense it almost looks like my skin is made of plastic plus after   weeks of constant use i don t breakout anymore not even before my period      
351,5.0 ,                       to be completely transparent this was the first vit c serum i ever bought but i have not even thought about any other  i have never felt the need to explore a new one  i go through a bottle in about     months but it is worth every penny i spend o a new one  about a week after i started using this product i noticed how it smooths my skin beautifully and how it brightens it and gives me a soft glow   here is my skincare routine so far cleanse vit c  hyaluronic acid  moisturize  spf  the only thing i this i should point out is that it does give me a soft redness as soon as i apply it but it goes away in about    minutes  to be honest i m not sure if it s the product itself that gives me the redness or the climate  hot shower and i live in the tropic  i also tend to have a bit of redness as it is  so take that with a grain of salt      
352,1.0 ,                       i thought i d try this instead of the teami brand vit c serum  because it had great reviews but was half the price  well  you get what you pay for  where as teami s vitamin c serum isn t oily and the effects are felt almost instantaneously  this serum is a heavy oil that caused breakout within    hours  it also did nothing to brighten or tighten my skin  my pores look bigger than ever  and i have pimples popping up all over my face  i guess it s a waste of    bucks and back to teami for me  don t waste your money  you get what you pay for      
353,5.0 ,                       ok  i heard great things about using this product and was very hesitant going in to it  my skin and complexion have never been better  i suffer from oily  red skin and enlarged pores because of the oil  i started using a clinique face wash and moisturizer over a year ago and that helped dramatically with my skin s texture and minimizing the oil  but it did not help with the redness and my pores i wash my face and pat dry it with a towel  use     drops of this vitamin c serum and gently rub that into my skin  once it is dry i apply a dime sized amount of moisturizer and ladies  my skin has changed  i get so many compliments on my skin now without any makeup because my overall complexion is smooth  even  and not red at all  i cannot recommend a better product because i will literally be using this until the day i die      
354,5.0 ,                       this is my first time ever writing a review but i feel like it is needed for this serum  i have suffered with acne since middle school  i am now    years old and have tried everything from      cleansers  countless trips to the dermatologist  acutane  medication  everything  nothing would clear my skin up i started using the serum and seen magical results    i use the burt s bees cleanser then follow with toning  a few drops of this drum then lock it all in with a moisturizer i woke up this morning and for the first time i had no breakouts and my skin looks and feels amazing  it s literally glowing i also refrained from wearing any foundation for this time  i applied makeup for the first time today and it looks airbrushed if you re looking for a solution   this is it   i ll continue to keep purchasing      
355,5.0 ,                       i have been using the rose water toner and vitamin c serum for a couple of weeks now  twice a day  and i am very pleased with what i am seeing so far  the pores on my nose are noticeably smaller and i am starting to see my complexion even out  a few of the more faint dark spots have begun to fade  i am excited to see what happens over the summer since i live on the southeast coast and frequent the beach during summer break      
356,2.0 ,                       i purchased this serum awhile back  worked good had no major issues  i again later in the future decided to order it again  i m not sure if it s a different batch or maybe my hormones but my face did not like it this time  i generally have pretty clear skin and even though they say you may breakout when starting a new product  i had to stop using it  i was starting to get acne and i don t mean an occasional whitehead here or there  like i was getting painful under the skin type pimples forming  it s a shame because i did have better luck the first time i tried it and it seems to be a great caring company  the price is great so give it a try maybe you ll like it like had before       
357,5.0 ,                       i bought this because i heard it worked well to use after derma rolling  this serum really helps to tighten your skin  i ve used it for about two weeks now  i have an oily t zone  and it dried my skin out in that area after about   days  to the point where my skin was flaky  i decided to alternate with a moisturizer for the day and to use this stuff at night  and now my skin looks amazing  i can t tell you how much i ve tried and spent over the years trying to shrink my pores as i have always been self conscious about my sebaceous filaments on my nose and cheeks  i ve done chemical peels  facials  enzyme scrubs  you name it  i ve come to terms with using face primer to spackle over them lol  within ten days they ve pretty much all dried up  i totally didn t expect this result and couldn t be more thrilled   i examine my skin in the mirror closely each time i go into the bathroom  seriously  this morning i woke up and my skin looked so good that i was upset with myself for a second about falling asleep with my makeup on  and then i remembered that i did wash my face  my skin just looks even and fresh now  freaking crazy  this serum is absolute gold  just make sure to not put it around your eyes as it will dry them out big time  and if your skin gets too dry  alternate with a moisturizer  i recommend their vit c moisturizer       
358,5.0 ,                       i m in my early    s and trying to find the best skin care routine for myself  which is great products but not several products for a routine  quality over quantity  this was recommended and i can see a difference in my skin brightening after   weeks of use  i will be buying again      
359,5.0 ,                       week    compliments everywhere i go    i simply refer them to truskin but for real     i have african skin  i am riddled with hyperpigmentation  large pores and occasional acne i added this to my routine  which previously had glycolic wash  toner  retin a and moisturizer  let me tell you    my skin is smooth  reduced dark spots  pores smaller   i just feel better in my skin will be doing a one month update  thank you truskin     
360,5.0 ,                       i ve tried many vitamin c serums and this one is my absolute favorite so far i ve tried banish  timeless skincare  seoul ceuticals  some other brand from walmart  and by far truskin and seoul ceuticals are my absolute favorite  the reason why i love this one is because of the immediate results literally the next day  beforehand  i had a lot of redness and dry patches and a few acne  my face now is so supple and clear and i haven t seen it like this in a while  it has a very dewy glow to it now and the redness has subsided and i no longer have dry patches after using the whole bottle i don t normally do reviews but honestly i am truly astonished by theresults  i read the reviews and thought it may have been too good to betrue and maybe the reviews were fake  but i was mistaken  i definitely would recommend and give this a   star side note  the customer service as well is exceptional  they emailed me just to ask for my input on the product and i normally would ignore that in my email but lowkey i responded because i was truly happy with the results try this product you won t regret it fenty skin is coming yall  be ready      
361,5.0 ,                       at first when i got this product  i was alittle skeptical about it and was scared to use it on my face  after a couple days the company actually contacted me just if i have any problems with the product and i told them my worries and they were able to help me solve them i apply this every morning after washing my face and this will like make you face feel dry but it s normal and after you can apply moisture cream with sunscreen  this works great for me i will update later on when i can actually see a change in my face  i currently have marks and acne and my face color is not how it used to be  so yeah  i will keep y all updated

363,5.0 ,                       i have spent a lot of money in sephora and ulta looking for a miracle serum to get rid of my dark spots for the last   years  something changed and i started out with mild adult acne that later turned into a stress picking systematic ordeal which left me with nasty dark spots  i ve also spent lots of money buying concelers to hide and not feel judged by anyone talking to me face to face  i haven t really changed anything in my diet really except eating papaya lol i wash my face   times a week with kate s somerville acne pink wash  its new and its pink i just don t remember the name  and i shake my little bottle of truskin and a few drops all over and massage in  i used to do a toner  i no longer do that cause i don t find it necessary  i also don t wear a lotion after it because my face gets very oily and i live in florida  i do wear a mild face sun block from clinique i think but there s been times i ve forgotten and my dark spots have not gotten darker with truskin  like i said i don t use it often or every night but it s doing something and i m super excited to keep seeing results  i ve also used it on my husband once and his skin was baby soft    the picture on the left  pink shirt  is from today  the picture on the right is from   months ago  the sides of my face were very bad      
364,4.0 ,                       i don t see any improvement after using this product  and after doing a little digging i found that truskin s products are mostly sketchy  i ll be spending a little more for a higher quality product edit  customer support reached out and followed through on their      customer guarantee  customer support goes a long way with me   it shows faith in their product  maybe i ll keep trying this one for a bit longer  there s nothing to lose by giving this product a shot  after all      
365,4.0 ,                       it made my freckles disappear which i didn t want so i m sad about that  i ended giving it to a friend for free however if you don t want freckles or anything like that this would be the product for you  i have extremely sensitive skin and this didn t burn  no smell  i don t have any thing to say about the anti aging qualities  i used it less than a week and noticed my freckles disappearing and stopped it immediately      
366,1.0 ,                       i never ever break out   about   weeks after i started using this  my skin turned into a disaster with cystic acne      
367,5.0 ,                       went on truskins website to find answers about the color of the vita c serum and here s what i found  p s i love this stuff      
368,2.0 ,                       i bought this product based in the good reviews  they said is a very good serum that almost do miracles  wrong  at least no for me  after a month of use everyday two times a day i don t see any change  in the opposite it doesn t feel like a serum  it s consistency is watery and after it dries out my face feels thigh and dry  it s like i m just putting egg whites over it  disappointing  i don t know why the excitement about it  it was just a waste of money  we get what we pay for   watery egg whites      
369,4.0 ,                       so i have been using this serum for a about a month   at first i was like  i don t see any difference    but now  after it s been a month of continuous usage  morning and night   my skin just looks better   it seems to not look as dreary or pasty   i have not noticed any decrease in wrinkles or any other miracles  but i will continue to use it because i do see a difference   i use about one full dropper full each time i apply   using a little more on my problem areas like my forehead wrinkles   whatever is left after applying to my face and neck  i apply to my chest   it absorbs really quickly  which is a huge plus      
370,1.0 ,                       ive been using this about a week or so i ve never really had horrible acne but this gave me under the skin pimples that hurt terribly   any one else having this problem  do i need to give it more time for my skin to get used to it      
371,5.0 ,                       update          the seller contacted me without my prompting   soley based on my previous review  i have to say that after several email exchanges i am impressed by this vendor showing interest in their customer s feedback and following up on it  i adjusted my serum usage due to my sensitive skin and the drying is no longer an issue  although the mosturizer is  heavy  i still use it daily for my neck and chest  thanks to erica for the great customer service previous review i decided to try this  have used a serum similar to this in the past that was recommended by my dermatologist years ago  but this one is too drying  i have adjusted that amount used and the frequency  will continue to test out my change over the next two months to see what happens  my skin is very sensitive and s when i switch things up it shows      
372,3.0 ,                       i have used this twice so far  i m    with some fine lines  i m using this as part of a  korean skincare  routine  the product seems to work  but it s slightly sticky and doesn t blend in as well as other serums i ve used   weeks of use  i have noticed little difference in my skin after using this product for awhile  i wouldn t necessarily recommend this for an antiwrinkle regimine      
373,5.0 ,                       my super dry skin loves this stuff  it soaks in quickly   leaves my face feeling like nothing s even on it  although i always follow up with moisturizer   i feel like all women have better skin days than others so i m not sure if my good days are due to luck or if it s this stuff helping  i do use it at least once a day sometimes twice  also it worked amazing for the day i went on the boat   my face got burnt  i always try to protect my face but waited too long to apply sunscreen  well this stuff had the redness gone by morning   my skin never peeled  i ve seriously never had better results one day after burning so i m absolutely convinced it was this stuff  been using for about   months   will definitely order more when i get low      
374,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       the results are unbelievable  was a bit skeptical because all the reviews were from caucasian women  i was slightly worried that my skin would not respond as well but i was quite mistaken with or without makeup  my skin is bright  smooth and my spots are disappearing one other result i am sure a number of people have not noticed is that your palms get softer too  i guess the residue on the palms makes it soft and supple      
375,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i wanted to love this  but unfortunately every time i put it on my face it would dry it out  i even put on moisturizer  but it would dry out my face so bad i would get dry spots on my cheeks and above my eyebrows  at first i was convinced it was due to the cold dry weather  but once i stopped using it took at least a week for my skin to get back to normal  i do not recommend this product edit although the product did not work out for me  truskin provides wonderful customer service  erica emailed me right away once she found out the product dried out my skin and offered a refund  she then recommended another product that might be better for my dry skin and is going to ship it to me free of charge  i was truly amazed by the quality of service and hope that the new product will work much better for me      
376,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       hello my fellow amazon lovers  first i want to say that i never write reviews    but i am just too excited to not share my results with you  a little bit of a background first  i am    years old  a medical student  with very tired  acne prone  and dull skin  i have struggled with acne throughout my entire adolescent and adult life  i have used many products all over the market  including proactiv  proactiv   birth control  and nearly every drug store product you can think of  some things will keep my acne at bay  but    the years of heavy chemicals trying to treat my acne has definitely hurt the integrity of my skin  i have had new fine lines  wrinkles  heavy bags  and dark circles  i started doing research on skin care and decided to completely re vamp my beauty routine  if you care about your skin  you should not hesitate in purchasing this serum  to be very fair with you  i need to explain my daily routine  and all the products i use  some from amazon  some from the drugstore  but all reasonably affordable   my skin is still not perfect  i do have a few blemishes that will pop up  but as for my skin overall    it has helped tremendously  these are my two week results using this serum  yes  i said it    two weeks  i do plan on updating this in a few months  now  i will list below my entire current routine  once again  don t hesitate morning     cleanse with burt s bees gel acne cleanser   drugstore     not my favorite  but it is gentle and it s not causing more breakouts  i will likely be switching this soon     tone with simple soothing toner   drugstore     nice  not irritating  i would recommend for those battling redness  i am thinking about trying new toners as well     truskin vitamin c serum       amazon       holy grail  i use approximately the size of a dime in my hand  allow to fully dry absorb     olay regenerist microsculpting cream with spf     drugstore       i adore the texture of this  it s a perfect moisturizer and make up primer  i would suggest it for all skin types     bae body eye gel  amazon makeup i do not wear makeup every day  however  i have permanently switched to neutrogena skin clearing foundation  drugstore   i apply with a new disposable makeup wedge each time  it is a medium coverage foundation  and it does not cause breakouts  at least for me  night     cleanse with burts bees     tone with simple     first layer of truskin vitamin c serum     dermaroller            ever heard of this  i was skeptical too  a dermaroller is a small roller that is covered with microneedles  you roll it on your skin to increase  collagen production and increase absorption of skincare products  the one i purchased was a      mm roller from the brand sdara   amazon   there are many to buy and many to choose from  i would recommend reading reviews first before your purchase  i roll for      minutes all over my face  it does not cause any bleeding  however there will be some slight redness and it might burn  no worries  it should  be gone by morning     second layer of truskin vitamin c serum  wait for it to be fully dry and absorbed  your face will be tight  with slight tingling or burning     truskin retinol moisturizer   amazon     bae body eye geli do not promise that this will work for anyone  but it has helped me tremendously and in a very short time  i do believe though that consistency is key i have not been in contact with any of the companies who s products i have reviewed  truskin has not given me a discount or anything for this review  i am just an honest girl hoping to spread the word on what has brightened me up  if you have any hesitation  don t  give it a try  i hope this helps someone xoedit  the second photo is my   month results    my skin is more even  brighter  and i m still seeing improvements  thank you truskin      
377,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this product saved my skin  i did not receive this at a discount and this is not a sponsored review  i seldom write reviews but just had to review this product  i ve been struggling with acne for years  i have very acne prone skin  i get a new pimple almost every day and it seemed like there was never a time i didn t have a pimple on my face  acne leaves super dark blemishes scars on my face  i do believe my acne is partly genetic   another reason may be stress from college and not getting enough sleep  i ve tried all different types of moisturizers and cleansers  nothing worked  however i bought this serum on a whim  omgggg  guys  literally my face stopped flaring within   days  i was pimple free for more than    hours  a new record   in the photo  the left side was day   of applying serum  as you can see i had extremely dark blemishes and active pimples   the photo to the right shows my skin exactly   months later  blemishes have faded drastically and i have no active breakouts  this hasn t happened in years  i truly and honestly think it is due to this product  if you are hesitant  don t be buy it   i cleanse my face every morning and night with burt s bees deep cleansing cream  then moisturizer and follow it with   drops of this serum  one drop for each cheek   chin and one drop for my forehead  it has also helped my under eye bags  use one drop for both undereyes  pat gently with fingers       
378,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i will post more pics when i notice a more significant change  i wanted to address the myth i ve seen blasted all over the reviews posted here i have heard for a long time that vitamin c and retinol cannot be used together  that they cancel each other out  it s completely untrue  my problem is that i ve heard it so many times  i believed it to be fact regardless of the sources i heard it from  which is basically word of mouth by other women who do not hold a dermatological degree of any sort  i did my own research  and actual skin care experts that hold a degree say the opposite  retinol can be used with vitamin c products  successfully  they don t cancel each other out  they work beautifully together  and vitamin c actually helps retinol work better by stabilizing it and extending its effectiveness  it turns out that using retinol without vitamin c or any other potent antioxidant is keeping your skin from reaping all the benefits of using retinol    which is why this serum is so important in your skin care regimen  you know all those expensive anti aging moisturizers you ve been blowing your money on  well        without using this serum or any other serum close to this that has vitamin c in it prior makes your fancy skin cream ineffective  and we all want to get the most out of the money we spend to make our skin look fabulous  don t we i ve also seen reviews on here about this product complaining about the color change in the serum  did they not read about the product  i states very clearly that it s normal to see variations of color  clear or cloudy  all depending on the time of the year the ingredients are harvested contribute  and it is very clearly addressed in the description of this product  pretty much cancelling out any of the bad reviews made on this product ladies  if you want to make the most out of your skin care products  read up on them first  that s why the info is there  so if anyone has any complaints on this product  they are not using it correctly     i ve included a photo in the first week of use  i will post more down the road  i am    years old  i smoked heavily for over    years quit january       and drank pretty bad too for    years before i got sober   years ago  my skin was terrible     i have absolutely no makeup on  just moisturizer and carmex lip balm  i use this product with a retinol moisturizer  i also take collagen daily as well  hopefully this review helps clear up the myths of using certain anti aging products together  and their  in effectiveness  us ladies gotta stick together in this war on aging and kick some wrinkle butt     lol         
379,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       have been using this daily for two months with sunscreen to protect against more damage  i m seeing great results      
380,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i bought this product about a month ago and i use it at least once a day  sometimes twice  i started noticing a difference in my skin within a week  for the record  i have terrible skin  it s red  blotchy  uneven  and on top of that i would get terrible breakouts  i chose to post some before and after pictures because even though my skin is still not perfect this product has helped a lot  it helped reduce the redness of my breakouts within a few days of using it and i m convinced that it has also helped prevent more breakouts  this past month i ve only had about   bad pimples  which is great for me since i used to get a new pimple every couple of days  but other than that my face has been doing great the top   photos were taken the day i got the product and the bottom two photos are the results after about a month of using the product      
381,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       my search for an amazing serum is finally over  i just purchased my  rd bottle and i am hooked  my skin looks flawless and i have been getting so many compliments about how great i look  my skin glows as if i just walked out of a spa treatment  a little goes along way  the bottle usually last me about       months  i use it every morning and every night  thank you for his amazing product      
382,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i got swept by all the good reviews of this product on amazon and by all the beauty gurus and influencers on youtube  touting the benefits of vitamin c serum  i caved and bought this product based on the glowing reviews saying how much this serum has changed their skin and brightened it  i have dry  sensitive skin so i did a patch test for a few days and everything seemed great  i was hoping it could brighten my dull skin and possibly reduce my dark circles  i used it morning and night  applying a few drops before my oils or moisturizer   i didn t see a beneficial change in my skin  instead  i developed a weird kind of skin condition that was acne like without the normal whiteheads of pimples  i had this for months and used every over the counter acne product that my skin normally responds well to  nothing worked i ve done extensive research on my skin condition and found out that i have malassezia folliculitis  fungal  acne   nothing in my normal routine could have been the culprit  other than this truskin serum  i m guessing since vitamin c is an antioxidant  this serum may have destroyed the reactive oxygen species on my skin but also got rid of the good  normal flora of my skin  leading me to develop an overgrowth of malassezia  in addition  who knows if the exact concentration of vitamin c in this serum  was my bottle contaminated with fungus  i deeply regret purchasing and using this product  beware of beauty gurus and aestheticians who are not board certified dermatologists  trying to persuade you to buy and use products that you don t need  i was blessed with good skin genetics and i ve ruined my skin with this product  now i am left with small  bumpy and resistant fungal acne that refuses to go away  i can t use my usual products since they are not considered fungal acne safe  thanks for nothing  truskin  do yourself a favor and stick to a simple skin routine  whatever you do  don t buy this serum      
383,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       apparently i m allergic to something in this serum because i had a major reaction to it after just using it for a couple days  i wasn t even putting it on my eyes and they puffed up and became super itchy and irritated  i m sure this doesn t happen to everyone  but i will not be buying this again and i m hoping to get a full refund  adding a super embarrassing photo as well just to prove that it really did swell up my face
