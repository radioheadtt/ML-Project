0,5.0 ,                       my mom loved this record player  she has collected records for years and my siblings and i grew up listening to records    since then she no longer had one so i was happy to get her this one for christmas and she was thrilled and played it right away  being a modern woman she also uses bluetooth now so she was surprised she could do both on this beautiful record player  this has now taken center stage in her bedroom and she uses it every day      
1,4.0 ,                       just tested this out for my    yo first turntable for xmas  sound quality is as expected for a portable starter player  reminds me of an old walkman type radio reception  music comes through just fine  we ve all gotten use to top of the line tech and this just isn t it  again  as expected  shipping was swift  no damage and item was very well packaged  protected needles  plastic wrapped the turntable piece is a little bit questionable as far as quality  cheap plastic  yet with care the device will be great for a child s first experience      
2,1.0 ,                       nice while it lasted  but after a few months  with very little use  it simply will not turn on   in fact i was using it  turned it off for a bit while i was doing something else  came back and turned it on   nothing   i do have an electronics background   the power supply is fine and power is making it to the main board but that s it  there is no power making it to the platter control board   there are no obvious signs of any shorts or burnt out components and since everything besides the capacitors are sub miniature components any further home repair is not an option you get what you pay for and this appears to be a hit or miss product   you ll either get one that keeps working or you ll get one that dies shortly after arrival   go ahead  spin the wheel    no  i would not recommend this product ps   due to other reviews mentioning problems with the electronics i highly recommend you do not leave this plugged in when not in use      
3,4.0 ,                       it s cute  it s very basic  and it plays lps  so it does what it says it ll do  four stars because the sound isn t great but honestly i didn t expect it to be  i think you could connect it to a stereo but tbh i don t listen to albums like in the old days  one after another after another  it s fun to pop an album on from the   s or   s and listen to it then flip it over and listen to the other side  one gets used to endless streams of music with all the digital stuff we have nowadays but there s something satisfying about playing an lp you used to play ages ago oh and the needle drops quite lightly on the album  not fast like one might expect on a cheaper turntable like this      
4,2.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          if you rarely play records or are not much of vinyl collector  then sure it s probably alright  it comes with everything you need to turn on and play records  and it s as portable as a record player can be but the record player is poorly designed and records will wobble quote a bit  if you buy a lot of records  you ll eventually come across a record that skips a lot or the sound sounds warped  even though the record is fine so a good record player for the rare vinyl listener  or someone who wants to see if it s something that will even gain their interest but if you want to build a vinyl collection  and keep your records in the best shape  you ll probably need to buy a more costly record player  or look into and buy attachments that will help protect the records or get them to play better on this one  if that is even a possibility so i d only recommend it if you really want the portablility  or of you just want something cheap and affordable  and aren t worried about potential warping or damage to a vinyl over time due to poor design of this player      
5,5.0 ,                       our unit worked as expected out of the box  the turntable rotates completely flat  the needle arm picks up well with the lifter and drops very quietly onto the record   at the end of the tracks it stops the turntable with the needle in the center of the record   the sound is quite loud enough for a single room very similar to the original units that we played in the       s   certainly not hifi but considering the tiny speakers it s very good  more treble than base   plugging in the rca or headphone outputs to another speaker system gives better sound with more bass   note that the bluetooth is only a receiver and so you ll need to plug in a bt transmitter into the rca or headphone jacks if you want to play records via bt to another bt speaker system the black case looks nice and  retro  on top of our wooden stereo cabinet and we like the idea that we can shut the case and keep the dust out or just snap closed the latch and pick it up like a mini suitcase and take it with us to someplace else   great value for the money  a good  novelty  gift for someone who has a stash of old    records that they haven t listened to for    years      
6,5.0 ,                       i was concerned because of many of the negative reviews on here  but i really like the victrola portable suitcase record player  first of all  the sound is great  i have played vinyl records and songs from my phone using the bluetooth feature  and the sound is actually pretty loud  the speakers don t sound tinny  the only downside is that there s not too much bass  but you could hook up more high quality speakers  but i don t feel the need to do so  this record player s sound quality is much better than a jensen record player i had a while back i also like that there is a knob to switch between bluetooth  line in  and phonograph  the light even changes color to indicate which mode you re on  my phone easily connected to the record player via bluetooth  and the sound quality is excellent lastly  the look of the record player is really great  the material doesn t feel cheap  and the turquoise color really pops  the suitcase look is very vintage  i highly recommend this record player      
7,1.0 ,                       i was so excited to give this christmas gift to my spouse  who is a true music lover  i could barely wait for her to open it and her eyes lit up like a little kid   she immediately grabbed it and set it up   the sound was great for a few minutes   then it started to skip   and skip   i had read the reviews and purchased an accessory to help with this problem but unfortunately it did not stop the skipping at all   the hardest thing was watching the light go out of my wife s eyes as she turned this thing off and moved on there are no words to express how disappointed i am in this product   i will be returning it for a refund and i guess now that i have all of these albums  i will invest in a more expensive model  as i should have in the beginning  this was such a cute product  i was really hoping that the quality would be as stated   so bummed      
8,4.0 ,                       remembering the album collection that my parents have and the record player from so many years ago that no longer works  left me craving the vintage sound from back in the day  this new school record player with bluetooth is a perfect mash up of old school and new school the sound is clear  the connection was easy  the only minor issue i had was the needle skipping in the beginning  i did a little research and just like my parents did back in the day  directly from customer support   a couple of quarters to weigh the needle down and no more skipping  i am very happy with my purchase      
9,1.0 ,                       i purchased his items as a birthday gift   the item stopped working within a couple months   it was too late to return through amazon but should have been covered under the manufactures warranty and amazon provided me with the contact information   i do love that amazon is helpful however  customer support for victrola advised that i should try to  use a different power cord with the same specifications if i had one available  and see if the unit powers on    if it did not work  they would  arrange to have a replacement power cord sent  however  since receiving that email on       they have not returned any emails i have tried calling a couple times but do not get to a person it is very frustrating      
10,1.0 ,                       this is my second record player from victoria   the first was a christmas gift  and i excitedly put on a brand new record   and it skipped   i tried an old record   skipped   it skipped on every record i tried so  i returned it   i ordered a different record player  it was so shoddy  and felt so cheap that i returned that one   but  at least it played my records in full then i started researching   i m not enthusiastic enough to spend over       so i started searching for  best record players under       and this one was the top of multiple lists   i figured my first one was a fluke  so i tried again  and surprise  i have the exact same issue   and even when it does play  the static is wild  and if i turn the volume up too high the sound starts to distort      
11,2.0 ,                       the sound that is produced is not in stereo  i thought i could connect external speakers but the outputs aren t working  bluetooth doesn t allow you to connect to a bluetooth speaker  but does allow you to play music through the record player  and sounds wonderfully mono  i was so excited to get this and i m very disappointed      
12,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          i absolutely love it   been trying to get a record player for a while now  i can finally play my records i got from my grandmother      
13,1.0 ,                       i had been using this player for   months and i started to notice skipping and scratches all over my vinyl records  note  i clean and care for my vinyls as i am a big music person  if you re going to invest in the price of the records themselves  purchase something that will last and give good sound quality  also safe to use for vinyls      
14,5.0 ,                       added a video   ice portable product  no tom control  nice listening to vinyl again  i did order some inexpensive speakers that r  quality along with a subwoofer   equalizer  when i did the demonstration in the video u u can t hear me for a few seconds  i got some great speakers woth a small sub woofer and an equalizer to take more control over the sound being produced outof this until   the way this one sits tho  the sound fills my very large bedroom  and itis decent sounding  but i am extremely picky in sound and record a lot of things and work with video production so that is why i want to add bigger speakers and a receiver this will go with me frlm placeto place when k get away for the weekend with my best friend  my english bulldog ethel mae   and yes  she digs the new portable player too this would make a great inexpensive gift  my daughter got one years back  it is fun to see her get into lp s now      
15,1.0 ,                       i had such high hopes for this cool looking record player but it is a huge disappointment  the sound is horrible this thing sounds like a       speaker system from a discount store  the record player arrived popping up from its mounted locaion  stayed away from this thing if they upgrade the sound quality and craftsman ship maybe but in tell then nope      
16,4.0 ,                       the unit came to me in what appeared to be open box  the player itself looked new and perfect  but there was an obviously torn open plastic insert in it that contained the power supply at one time  so to sum up  no power cord included  and i could not use the unit  contacted amazon  and they were prompt to return my money and even said that i could keep the player  thanks for that amazon  but i now have to figure out how to get my  free  player to work  i ordered an after market power supply for it and it worked perfectly  i am happy with the player  it works great  and i can now listen to my classic recordings the way they were meant to be heard  the built in speakers aren t anything to write home about though  please connect it via rca plugs to your music system or get some powered speakers  i didn t rate the bluetooth capability on this because i haven t tested it  and will probably not use it anyway  is this for  beginners   maybe  but it works exactly like the classic record players of old  so if you re a younger person and have never used one  read up on it and or get an older fella like me to help you      
17,5.0 ,                       so my trusty sony direct drive i ve had for years needs some serious repairs   finding myself in this pickle  i ordered an audiotechnica with amazing reviews  however  upon receiving it  the unit was not only faulty  it also damaged two irreplaceable records of mine  i was so furious  i immediately asked for a return  at this point i was just looking for something that would be a reliable backup for the time being and after i fix my sony pros  this thing is reliable as hellit has a ton of very intuitive featuresthe arm is manually operated  no more auto arm failures  and it has an auto stop feature all of the cables are replaceable  i use gold rca cables for sound qualityit s portable cons the needles it comes with aren t great but they re just as good as audiotechnica s needles  i was able to find an elliptical needle that s compatible on a bidding website for under     and the sound quality is even better than units costing  x as much ps  it looks way more classy and timeless in person than it does in the pictures  i got the black version so  whether you re a beginner or an enthusiast  i highly recommend this item  and i highly recommend getting an elliptical needle to replace the stock one also  you will want to cut out some felt to put on the turntable under your records  just to be safe      
18,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          love this record player  much better than i expected for the low price and i love that is so colorful  which matches my very colorful decor  i couldn t decide which higher price player to go with so decided on this as a temporary option     but think this is going to be a keeper      
19,2.0 ,                       i loved the idea of this product  i bought this for my   year old for christmas   it was and still is his favorite thing   seeing his love for vinyl records and music in general is one of my favorite experiences in life   i could never return it for that reason alone that being said  from a technical standpoint  the build quality is really bad  right out of the box  i noticed that the turntable itself isn t mounted properly on its base  almost like it s warped or something  the tone arm is super loose and makes it a bit tough to position it where you want it at the end of the day  it s a gift that my   year old loves more than anything   however  if i d known that the build quality was going to be so poor before i bought it  i would have passed for something better      
20,1.0 ,                       i hate that so many reviews gave this item  good  sound quality  it s the worst ever  you ll have to add speakers and the product listing should say so  also a silicon mat is too heavy and affects the speed  but it comes with no mat so i had to buy one     oh well  you get what you pay for  lesson learned      
21,4.0 ,                       this isn t a bad record player  it has decent sound quality and does what it was made to do  it is a pretty good starter or budget player for listeners branching out or getting back into vinyl  that said it does have its own issues  out of the box this record player would skip on older vinyls and there was a strange scratch noise when i played any of my collection  after a few minutes of scrutiny using an inherited scratched record  something i keep for diagnostic tests for any new player   i found that the skip was because the arm didn t lower enough to maintain contact with the vinyl  the fix was a rubber disc that i had left over from a broken record player  the rubber disc raised the record high enough to maintain needle contact even on slightly warped records  the second issue of the scratching noise turned out to be caused by a plastic guard at the base of the arm  this small piece of plastic would rub at the edge of the vinyls while spinning producing the scratch noise  that fix was simply using a fine fingernail emery board            grit  to remove just enough material to put a stop to the noise but not impede the function of the plastic guard  after those simple fixes i had no problems with the record player      
22,3.0 ,                       i had jumped off the vinyl train several years ago  but lately i got some    singles that have songs i can t find elsewhere  and decided i should probably get a turntable so i could actually hear them  if you are looking for something to occasionally play old records on  and don t care that much about superb sound quality  this is a decent choice  it plays just fine  but the speakers greatly limit the bass  if you are an audiophile and really care about great sound quality  be prepared to dish out a lot more money  and if you re buying new records  you should be able to afford that   so  for a  beginner  or someone who just wants to pull out a record every so often  this is a nice affordable choice  the one i got was just a little over           
23,3.0 ,                       so for the price  i guess it s ok  i ve read some horror stories about how eventually this player will wear down your vinyl  so i was wary of that  the purple color with the rose gold hardware is very cute  the speakers are kind of terrible  but that s to be expected  my main problem was with the sound quality  even when connected to nicer speakers i hooked this up to my soundbar and listened to a record  the sound was kind of rough and wobbly  i then played the same record on a vintage turntable and it sounded    times better  removing all the noise and strengthening the overall sound  then i played it on an audio technica turntable and again  the sound was even better  i decided it was worth a little more money to get a turntable that sounds better and has less of a chance of wrecking my records  admittedly i m not super concerned about damage over time to my records  since i don t buy expensive vinyl and mostly purchase from thrift stores  but it was still something to consider the sound just doesn t compare  if you really don t care about sound quality  record longevity  or just want something that will play records and look cute and vintage  by all means grab one of these  the price is good for a trendy piece of home decor      
24,1.0 ,                       do not buy this   i don t have much experience with record players but i know enough to know that the sound quality is      garbage  it sounds as if the needle is scratching the records  and the speakers are busted  not only is the sound bad  if you look at the record being played  you ll see it s actually warping your vinyl  this is the worst purchase i ve ever made and will be retuning it  update  i returned this item on the   th of this month and never received my refund  when i contacted amazon  they said they had refunded me and tried to pass the blame to my bank  the refund has still not been received nearly two weeks later  don t waste your time on this product because you may not even get your money back if you do decide to return it     
25,1.0 ,                       our teenage daughter  who is really an   s child at heart  loved the cool designs of the victrola record player   unfortunately this record player seems to be a very poor quality   we bought our first one at kohl s and it was this year s christmas present   after opening it we realized it was missing its needle   we bought replacement needles on amazon and tried again   with the new needle in place we spun a record  omg  the speakers were horrible   they played very softly and the volume knob did nothing   we returned it to kohl s after getting home  we went on amazon smile  everybody should shop via smile and support a charity such as the multiple system atrophy coalition     the reviews on the victrola were among the best so we decided to give it another try  assuming the first one from kohl s was a dud the new vintage victrola record player arrived quickly  our daughter was so excited  we unpackaged it and checked the needle  it was there  we put on a record and turned it on   the music came on at a nice sound level  the first verse was perfect   but then       the record started skipping   we tried a brand new record  more skipping  we could not get a record to play well   we turned it off and the music died two busts and we were done   we returned it hassle free and bought a different brand  similar style   the new record player sounds great and the same records that skipped on the victrola record player play perfectly on our new brand maybe we just got two duds  but we just don t trust the quality and are glad we moved on      
26,3.0 ,                       the victrola vintage is not the best record player out there  but if you need a functional record player with an aesthetic appeal and a no nonsense design  then this is your unit  i purchased this for my    year old son  who loves music  he instantly took to the marvel of how the records work and uses it regularly to listen to old records  the speakers are not the greatest but you do have an option to connect to better ones via rca cable  all in all a great buy for the price  i am only giving it   stars because comparatively to other units out there  this one is in the middle  great starter deck though

28,4.0 ,                       the sound quality coming out of this when playing a record is phenomenal that being said  using the speakers via bluetooth connection is absolutely worthless   playing music directly from my phone s speaker is indescribably louder than playing via bluetooth through the record player s speakers  even at full volume   i thought the bluetooth feature was to transfer the record s sound to another device  which would be awesome  though obviously unlikely      
29,2.0 ,                       the bluetooth function does not allow you to play a record through an external bluetooth speaker  you can only use the record player s speakers to input music from an external source  and the record player s sound quality is lower than a typical iphone  not knowing this  after unpacking unit  i switched it to bluetooth and paired with my iphone  the turntable stopped and music from my iphone playlist began  faintly  playing through the record player   thought it was broken until i read another review from a few days ago and realized that you cannot use this to transmit music from the record player to an external bluetooth speaker   might work with aux cord  haven t tried    the product description  obliquely  says so but i didn t catch this before buying   i will keep it as it s cute and only purchased to play some very old childhood records that have sentimental value only      
30,1.0 ,                       we bought this for a teenager that was super excited about getting into the retro vinyl vibe  super excited when she opened it until we played our first record   initially  we thought we had purchased records that were warped  as the newer vinyl  harry styles in particular   sorry harry   kept skipping  but found the culprit after a lot of googling  which revealed similar complaints about this record player  improper weight and balance to the tone arm  for those like me that aren t audiophiles  translation  the needle isn t pressing down hard enough to hold in the record groove  so it skips in certain spots   as i did more research  this seems to be more of an issue with newer records in particular maybe due to the way they are produced  several of the newer records we bought actually could be seen wobbling slightly up and down on the player as it turned  i now see that in several video reviews   if you really like the look and are determined to buy this  the  fix  is to add a small amount of weight above the needle  we added a penny right above the needle to test  apparently this was a fix in the old days when records skipped  and yeah    immediately eliminated skipping on all records for us  the new issue  you are now potentially adding too much weight and therefore wearing out your record faster  as well as a penny that may fall off ocassionally  bottom line  i would suggest passing on this and look for a record player that has a better balanced arm  or better yet  spend a little extra money and buy a player with an adjustable tone arm  which you set to a specific gram weight to hold the needle down   rock on harry      
31,2.0 ,                       i was hopeful  with a mix of good and bad reviews  i was hopeful that maybe for some it just wasn t up to their standard and they were expecting a quality similar to a       turntable once i opened this up and had a look at it  i quickly realized why this is a         turntable the entire top panel that contains the nobs and switches is a cheap looking plastic  this includes the platter  luckily there are soft rubber parts of the platter to keep the record in place  all of this was sort of expected for the price after placing a record on and lowering the needle  the most shocking thing about this product forced its way into my ears    the sound of this product is a b s o l u t e l y horrible  some reviews mention no bass  but i wasnt expecting no bass at all  the sound from this sound like the cheapest speakers they could have possibly placed in this  theyre like the type of speakers that would be on a fast food kids meal toy i dont know if i got a bad egg  but i cannot believe that anyone thinks that this is good quality sound unless they ve been paid or reimbursed to review the product  or have never used anything other than cheap speakers i honestly believe i could go find better sounding speakers at the dollar store this of course is not the end of the world  i just grabbed another bluetooth speaker that i had and plugged in an aux chord and that resolved the speaker issue in addition to the cheap speakers  the platter wobbles quite a bit  and on top of that  one of the rubber spots on the platter was lower than the others  making the record wobble even more  so the sound of the music was very unstable and was very warped sounding i managed to partially resolve this by placing a few pieces of electrical tape on top of the lower rubber piece for anyone looking for a beginner record player  this would be it  but dont expect miracles will be returning to hopefully get a better version of this product and will update my rating if it is indeed betted      
32,1.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          after about    hours of use  it started squeaking like crazy  loud comical squeaks    like i have all sorts of things in my home that turn  rotate  and have electric motors  none of them squeak  but this sounds like a fart every rotation update  i took it apart and discovered a small piece of plastic that had wedged itself into the turning mechanism  i was able to put it back together  but i had to look up tutorials on how to get the belt back on  a slightly complicated repair for something the size of a fingernail  it works fine now  but still keeping the   star review because of the hassle of having to fix a practically new record player      
33,4.0 ,                       while this is no means for an audiophile  it is a great record player for majority of listeners  it has great portability so you can plug up at a cookout or your friend s house  the speakers don t have amazing quality but that s not why you d buy this one  i use my audio technica and my stereo system for hq sound  but it has a headphone jack so you can listen in great quality  this makes a great player for anyone who doesn t care about audiophile sound quality so this makes a really cool gift for like     of people  i ve bought   so far  one for me and two for gifts to family members  the bluetooth function is great as it allows it to be used to play music from your phone  hard to carry    vinyls to a picnic   all in all  this makes a great record player for its price and makes a wonderful gift to anyone who maybe wants to play records but maybe doesn t want to shell out    plus bucks for a full blown stereo compatible player  my grandpa and mom loved these as gifts because they love the nostalgia of records but also don t know how to set up and hook up a stereo and speakers for a full player  i still keep mine for its portability as most full players are not portable by any means  great product      
34,4.0 ,                       fast shipping  i don t mine the sound being a little off  if you re having trouble with the cartridge making the record skip just tape   pennies on top      
35,1.0 ,                       our son used his two times  and on the third time  it smoked  smelling of electrical burning  and stopped working  luckily  he had not fallen asleep and turned the power off immediately  after contacting the seller to request a refund return exchange  the seller closed the request with a pat message about  the purchase being in the final stages so they re unable to process a cancellation    they did not address the issues presented  nor the refund request  leading one to believe that they knew they had a defective product  but could still keep the money  sadly  they weren t wrong  another reviewer stated that neither the first nor the second player she received some time ago worked   amazon cannot support a refund through their claim process as the item arrived  intact    we now have no turntable   no money  but do feel blessed to still have our family and home safe  interestingly  i was required to choose a star in order to provide a review   i would give zero stars to this product and to the seller  as they must know by now that this product is defective and catches on fire      
36,1.0 ,                       as is usual with most items on amazon  as soon as negative reviews creep up  the item is reposted and the score is somewhat  reset    wish amazon would fix this  but hey  they re making money so they obviously don t care record players are not usually made for travel use  or cheap for this case  because of the heft the arm a record player requires in order to have sufficient and tune able weight on a record   this is important because if enough weight is not placed on the arm  then you get skipping   what can you do   you can ghetto rig it by taping a penny or quarter at the top of the tip and see if this rectifies it   if it fixes it  then it means you have a cheap record player   aka a victrola record player   don t get this   just get a real one   this might be worth it when it drops to      but not any more than that      
37,3.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          like that its compact and comes with adapter to play    s   red and white rca outputs in back  i ll plug into a mixer then the skies the limit once i get the replacement  plugged a bluetooth transmitter into headphone jack then paired with amazon echo  be sure to play last song till the end on all size records as  auto off  feature can be defective as shown in video   built in bluetooth is a receiver not a transmitter and worked perfectly   built in speakers worked perfectly   all manufacturers sometimes produce lemons  i will lower rating if replacement is also defective update  replacement works great      
38,4.0 ,                       love this record player  it looks great in a room pretty enough to be decor and it sounds great  i ve received so many compliments from friends and neighbors who all want to buy there own  speaking of price it s such good quality for such a low price it s really easy to use  the bluetooth works great i love being able to play pandora from my phone when i don t want to listen to one of my records i also enjoy playing podcasts on it while i cook dinner  it s portablility is another great feature we like to sit on our back deck and listen to music while watchin the sunset  the white gold is beautiful the gold really stands out and goes with my decor vintage decor it doesn t look cheap at all only downfall is that the inside is like a velvet and i know its going to get dirty from any lil speck of dust and idk how i plan on cleaning it when it does  it s nice to be able to close the lid to keep that from happening it came with a couple small marks n spots on it being that it s white u can see very detail and i notice everything i definitely would not buy white again  i think the player gets loud enough i can hear it very well in other rooms but my husbands would prefer to get some other speakers for when we want it even louder     
39,5.0 ,                       i m happy with this little record player  it s exactly what i expected  it s not high end  the speakers aren t the best  but its imperfections add to the vintage sounding experience i wanted from a record player  plays my old records fine  vintage beatles  elvis  etc   as well as my new  it has jacks on the back that i m sure would allow me to hook it up to my stereo if i decide to go for a bigger sound at some point the turn table has a wobble to it  but i don t ever remember owning one that didn t  arm seems weighted fine  no need to tape a penny to it like the one i had back in the day      
40,5.0 ,                       it took me a year to get into vinyl because i was afraid that i wouldn t get the right products or i wouldn t be prepared to have a collection  while this was true and it was expensive to get started  i have found that this record player is perfectly suitable for people just starting out and even more so for people who aren t concerned with collecting and keeping quality on records if you just want to experience vinyl at a cheaper price this works just fine  there is some concern that it is damaging my records  but i ve also found that people who talk about vinyl s tend to have very personalized ideas of what constitutes good record maintenance and i m just fixing my process myself as i go along  i will say that something about it seems to be off balance  sometimes a record just wont play right without adjustments  otherwise it works fine      
41,5.0 ,                       great product especially for the price  very pleased with condition since it was well protected  works flawlessly without any problems  the sound from the speakers are clear from using records  when using bluetooth  bt as it s abbreviated on device  it doesn t sound as great as it should so that could improve a tad bit  maybe adding more bass into the speakers will make it improve better  as a whole  it worth the value      
42,1.0 ,                       my return window closed   weeks ago and the power quit working today  the speakers were the first to go and now the power won t come on at all  the charger is fine for other appliances  the turn table itself is very cheap plastic  it was cute and fun for the month that it lasted  but i would absolutely not purchase again      
43,5.0 ,                       i bought this as a gift for my niece for christmas  since i wanted to leave some sort of review i took it out of the box to check for functionality and repacked it to wrap for her  the record player comes very well packaged and has many layers of styrofoam to keep it from breaking  the needle inside is also very well protected with wrappings  the power came on and it appeared to function just fine  it also comes with a handle that makes it super east to carry around from place to place i have since asked my niece if she liked the sound and she said it works and sounds great  and loves playing her records on it  she hasn t used the bluetooth option yet  not even sure she ever will  but i guess it s a nice feature for those that will use it      
44,4.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          i have zero experience with records or record players  i love everything retro  and i got sick of buying all my music digital  even if it s convenient   so i thought why not try out a record player  this was the right price and a pretty color  so i went for it and picked up an amy winehouse album at my local half price books  i m blown away  i had it running in less than   minutes and the sound is awesome  no extra speakers needed  i m just listening to it in my living room   i absolutely recommend for anyone new to vinyl albums  i ve attached a video and a picture to give you a nice view   edit  the turntable on this is wobbly  it s not an even turn  i can notice that the records are unevenly spinning when i view it from the side where i sit on my couch  it doesn t appear to affect the music  that i m aware of  i don t know what s normal vinyl variance and what isn t  but it s really annoying to see and i m knocking off a star for it      
45,1.0 ,                       keeps skipping over records that are brand new out of package  makes zero sense  will be returning  i got a replacement and it does the same thing still  the tonearm needs to be heavier  this is a starter record player for our   yr old son so he can live with attaching a few pennies on top of the needle but the fact that we have to do this is ridiculous      
46,1.0 ,                       i love this record player and would give it a much better rating  except that it arrived without the    adapter   and one of the main reasons i purchased it  was to play the many  many    s i have collected through the years   it s got a nice sound and i love that the needle arm sets itself down  i ve tried contacting the manufacturer and got nowhere with them   amazon sells this  but they can t get me the replacement adapter   i m just so annoyed that i can t get a part they were supposed to have included  in the first place      
47,1.0 ,                       bought  things started skipping right away  returned in exchange for another  second one also skips every record  can t get through one song   if it s such a great turntable  why are there issues straight out of the box  will be returning for a refund      
48,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          review of   victrola vintage   speed bluetooth suitcase turntable with speakers  black  this is a very reasonable priced portable plug and play system that allows you to play your lp s in          rpms   the case is sturdy and light and the arm and needle are very sensitive   the sound quality is fantastic for a system this size and you have the option to line in using an aux cord or use bluetooth with the system to play music or sound   i am very impressed by this system   after having sold my multi component onkyo sound system and massive speakers years ago to include my turntable i can once again play my vinyl   it is wonderful   the sound and features of this small system rank high   five stars      
49,2.0 ,                       this is hand s down the worst record player i have ever heard  it would turn on  have a long pause  and then begin playing  the records would constantly skip and albums would randomly stop playing altogether  sound quality was subpar at best  for the times i could actually hear enough  the only thing i can positively state about this thing is that it is indeed portable  if portability is your main criteria here then you re golden  if you re looking for more than portability  i d look elsewhere      
50,4.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          let s start with the number one issue with this record player  the speakers on it suck  they suck bad  they sound awful and i was so disappointed when i first played it because i thought vinyl was supposed to sound good  however  that being said  the record player is excellent if you connect it to a good speaker system  and for the price  i don t think you can expect much more  i ll tell you why i decided to keep it  because it s damn cute i got the one with the british flag cover and it s a dor a ble   i mean i really wanted a retro looking record player and this is spot on  once i connected it to my kikburn speaker via an auxiliary cable  not included  i was thrilled in the end i ended up connecting it to a block rocker max system that i wasn t getting much use out of except for parties and i m very happy with the results i m a little concerned that you cannot close the cover while playing you records because i have young kids and i m nervous that they will bump in to it while playing  but i do think it would add considerable bulk to the unit  so i m not sure i d actually choose to change that the auto stop feature is great and pretty much necessary  it s a bit pointless that it has the option to turn it off because i don t see why you d ever want to turn it off the soft needle drop function is also very convenient and makes playing records extremely easy for anyone and again  the look of it is just so darn cute  i can t bring myself to return it for one that say  has a cover or a better speaker etc  over all for the price i think it s great  i m very happy with it  but just know you absolutely will need external speakers to go with your adorable record player      
51,5.0 ,                       i got this for my dad for christmas  he loves it  he kept saying he couldn t believe i found one  a record player  because he d been seeing vinyls popping up in stores everywhere but couldn t find a player  it s easy for him to fold up and put away when the grandkids come over  he also liked that he can hook it up to his phone and listen to pandora  and it s loud enough that he can play it in his bedroom and hear it in the kitchen      
52,5.0 ,                       i d like to start this off by saying i am not very educated on records or bluetooth  i purchased this because i love all things vintage and i ve been dying to play my mary poppins and sound of music records  i was a bit hesitant to purchase this record player because so many reviews mentioned the speakers being weak and needing to purchase a seperate bluetooth speaker  so i decided to purchase it from a store in case i was disappointed with the speakers and wanted to return it  i bought this record player   days ago and have played    different records on it so far  i am completely satisfied with my purchase  i have a   bedroom ranch and with the volume all the way up i can hear music in every room  i m sure if i had my loud family over for the holidays we would be able to hear the music no problem  also  even being    i m terrible when it comes to technology so i was nervous first setting up this player  it was so easy to do and i was able to listen to music in   minutes of opening the box  this record player completely filled my needs and exceeded my expectations    stars        
53,4.0 ,                       pros  great for beginners like meeasy to use and very portablea price practically anyone can affordgreat color choicescons  cheap feeling plastics on the insidebuilt in speakers suckyou need to hookup speakers to get good soundthe bluetooth is pretty much pointless because i cant use it with a bluetooth speaker and the record wont spin in bluetooth mode anywayswith all that being said the cheap plastics can be expected at this price point so i ll let that pass but i don t get the point if having a bluetooth mode if you cant play the music through a bluetooth speaker plus the record only spins when its in phono mode so even if you could pair it to a speaker it would be pointless anyways  that being the main reason i only gave it   stars  but for the price this is an amazing record player  i bought a mini amplifier and i used some old bookshelf speakers that i had and i hooked them up to the record player and it sounds great and is the perfect little setup  as seen in the attached picture      
54,1.0 ,                       i was super excited to get this as a relatively affordable turntable  i paid for   day shipping but received it in   days  when i finally got it  i set everything up  placed my record  moved the needle into position annnnd nothing  figured the belt came loose during shipping so i checked and reset it  still nothing  the table wouldn t even turn  i went through everything again just to be sure i didn t miss anything  still no action  i figure the motor was bad  i checked the bluetooth feature to see how it sounded and a majority of the reviews are right  the speakers sound terrible  not worth my time  i will be returning this and getting a audio technica one  just should ve spent the money on a nicer one      
55,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          i ve had this record player for about  months and i use it every single day  it worked every time  it plays loud and clear and doesn t distort when turned all the way up i also love the design  it s easy to use my kids have now grown a love for my passion of vinyl and they will be getting there own player soon as well easy set up  plug and play  perfect and easy to to move from room to room overall i love my little player   i was not paid or given discount for my review      
56,1.0 ,                       after having this product for   months  i am officially done with it and trashing it to buy the sony ps lx   bt model  i will say this  if you re looking for something to play the stash of records you found in your fathers attic  this will play beautiful  however  that is where the good of this device will end  if you buy new records  maybe you ll get a song or two that plays properly  but the rest of your album will skip  any new record is doing this for me  i am passed the return window so amazon agreed to return  but were charging me a restock fee  on a     unit   it s not worth it  i should have researched more into turntables before wasting my money   time with this unit  i suggest  if you want to listen to newer records  start shopping for new records  stay far far away from this cheap record player      
57,5.0 ,                       this little player is giving me a lot of listening pleasure  the sound wasn t quite good enough  so i hooked up the edifier g     speakers to it  i also got a diamond needle  and a silicon slip mat  the quality of sound  and volume  are surprisingly good  i made a few trips to goodwill for records  since i had none at all  i bought a few brand new  but the sound just wasn t as good as vintage records provided  apparently  new records are recorded from digital music  i haven t used the blutooth yet  there wasn t any difficulty in setup  i just plugged it in  plugged in the speakers  and turned in on  i now listen to records all day long  classical  jazz  big bands  british invasion  gospel  chorales  etc  such fun      
58,2.0 ,                       buying a  bluetooth turntable   you d assume that the  bluetooth  feature would allow you to stream the record player to another bluetooth speaker or headset  right  nope  the  bluetooth features  on this mean you can send things from your phone to the speaker on this turntable  even if the speakers on this turntable were good  this wouldn t make much sense  but the speakers on this turntable are trash  so it s a completely asinine feature i cannot recommend this product      
59,5.0 ,                       my grandson recently discovered my extensive collection of old vinyl and was determined to listen to them   when he realized many of them had belonged to my grandfather and pre dated vinyl he became more determined to hear them   classical orchestras     s    s old time country  big bands  plus my own    s    s collections   his mother refused my offer of letting him have our old glass fronted stereo cabinet so this was the smaller solution that made them both happy   the sound is not the greatest but he easily hooked it up to his own bluetooth speakers and is thrilled with the sound   i admit it makes me happy to know he appreciates  my music  as well as his great grandfather s   i think i ve created a new vinyl freak and it s fun to see his enthusiasm   the price was right on this product and he enjoys using it daily      
60,1.0 ,                       i wasn t expecting much as far as the built in speakers  as i expected it is poor quality  but when you plug in your own speakers the quality doesn t get much better  my phone speakers actually produce a higher quality sound  even if this were selling for half its price i wouldn t waste my money if i had another chance  i am going to have to get a new record player      
61,4.0 ,                       i had taken my wife for a date night away from the kids  and the place we stayed at had a similar record player  crosley cruiser    we enjoyed it so much  i decided to get this to surprise her   the first time i used it  it skipped terribly on a new vinyl  causing some permanent damage to the beginning of it   bummer   when i calmed down  i decided to change out the needle with the extra one included with the player   viola   it then played to my expectations  which were not too high   the sound is a bit tinny  but that is actually what makes it more endearing  along with the retro look   i contacted victrola via email  and the same day they said they were sending out a replacement needle for the one that was originally installed   i don t plan to use the bluetooth function  so i can t attest to that  but i did hook it up to a soundbar successfully using rca cables   overall  if you don t plan to start a huge collection and if you aren t concerned about top notch sound  you won t find better for the price   and if you like to open some wine and have a romantic evening at home every once in awhile  this thing is great      
62,1.0 ,                       this player has the absolute worse sound   everything played  new records  sounds like a cat fight  my granddaughter asked me to please get her something different so she could enjoy her new records      
63,1.0 ,                       first one came and didn t work at all   so we returned and ordered another   the next one worked for about   days  then the arm stopped working properly   now the arm won t electronically move   you have to manually move it and set in on the record  which is dangerous because you could accidentally scratch the record that way   so we are returning the second one  because we are afraid if we keep it we will scratch our records and worse  something else will go wrong with the player after the window to return it closes   to say i am disappointed is an understatement   i love all things british and bought the british flag design  and it s been since the late    s early    s since i operated a record player   the thrill of putting on a record was unsurpassed  for the whole day i used it   i now have to use my husband s record player and not have my own   really mad about this purchase  it s cheap and crappy   do not waste your time buying unless you enjoy returning things multiple times       
64,1.0 ,                       sounds awful  and scratched some of my records  i wasn t expecting a lot for price but i got even less than i expected      
65,1.0 ,                       this is my first time owning a turntable  born in the late   s  i don t know what i was thinking purchasing something with included speakers   a huge mistake  even cleaning and deep cleaning a new vinyl didn t stop it from skipping every    seconds  it s not very loud and the sound is crappy  i am not an audiophile  but i should ve known bare minimum money would produce a bare minimum product  this is only for people that want a device to just listen to the songs  not get lost in the songs  clearly i need separate speakers for that  yeah it s more money but     if i m gonna invest money at all   it won t be for this piece of crap      
66,5.0 ,                       i know this isn t a brand  audiophiles  like  but as a millennial looking to play my parents old records and make my own discoveries  this is pretty dang awesome  it only took about    minutes to get it up and working  it s nice and loud  and for the records that were in good shape  it played them properly and clearly  plus  it looks nice  it s not super heavy  and it satisfied an itch to be a hipster i never knew i had      
67,1.0 ,                       dead after   months and only a few uses  plugged it in to use tonight and smoke came out of the machine  smelled like burning plastic  wouldn t turn on eta  we had purchased the additional warranty with this product  we submitted that and it was refused because apparently the additional warranty protection is only good after the manufacturer warranty of one year  we have been emailing back and forth with the manufacturer providing forms and receipts as requested only for them to tell us that we are responsible to mail the unit across the country with an additional printed copy of the receipt  this would cost half the cost of the unit this is ridiculous hoop jumping and cost to the customer      
68,1.0 ,                       want to make  your lps sound terrible  then this is your device  streaming mp  through your iphone s mono speaker sounds better when a quality entry level stand alone record player costs       what do you think you ll get for     when the device also packages in a headphone amp  tiny little speakers  and bluetooth  you get a real crappy sounding  warbly sounding record player with horrible  horrible  all treble  no bass sound  oddly  mp  streamed into the device via bluetooth sounds way better than the lps which points to something horribly wrong with the record player portion of the unit i received      
69,5.0 ,                       it s so pretty and works so good  i was worried it wouldn t be loud enough  but it is and it sounds amazing      
70,5.0 ,                       i absolutely love this player   it is very nice quality  especially for the price   i m not sure why some of the previous reviews mentioned a dislike to the sound quality   i think it sounds great  and it is loud   a vintage style record player isn t supposed to rattle the pictures off the wall anyway   very pleased      
71,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          item arrived on time and in good condition  i am new to vinyl and just want something to start my journey   the low price was a factor in the purchase  i read good and bad reviews but thought i would give it a chance  i don t regret the purchase so far so good  i have only played a few records on it but seems to work well  like i said i am new to vinyl and am no expert but have enjoyed it  it amazes me every time i play a record to think something so simple can sound so amazing  with the new age of digital music you can lose track of where it started      
72,5.0 ,                       played it  all night impressive gizmo for under       even the price is historic has almost every bell and whistle   even  line out   rca  red and white  jacks in the back note  you know that popping sound people call scratches   they aren t from sratches at all dust got into the tiny miccrogroves  you can see the little dust bunnies under a microscope you could wash your record  just be careful not to get the label wet   i just used armor all original and then wiped it good with a dry tissue  sounds like new now      
73,5.0 ,                       i got this as a christmas gift for my parents who have a decent record collection but haven t owned a record player in ages  the outer design is super cute and i love the different color options  and the overall size is just right  not to big  not too small  setup was very easy  the design of the mechanism itself is simple to use and seems to work really well with both the smaller   s and the larger standard sized records that we tried with it  it has settings for   different types of records  the sound quality for both the actual records and the bluetooth option were excellent  but is not overly bassy  the volume is more than loud enough to enjoy listening to in the same room or from another  overall we had such a nice time listening to old records and making new memories with this victrola  and i highly recommend this product for folks of all ages looking for an affordable and easy way to listen to their records      
74,5.0 ,                       i bought this for the tune of        for a like new item  and pink camo was the cheapest  so i decided to man up and not pay more for red  or green  the lift arm has a nice glide over feature  and sit on a crib separate from the record plate  i used a mat to create more space for some of my wobblier records  the simple interface on is also the volume knob  you have a second for phono  line in  and bluetooth  i tested the bluetooth this works with my computer  but i don t own by choice a cellphone so can t advise you on that item  this player has a brighter tone  that at first i was like where is the bass  but then you hear the full range of instruments and   or vocals all at the same time  victrola is a name you can get behind  as the style  price  form  tone  and overall sound is really good  originally i noticed significantly less lower tones  but more middle and upper tones  and i thought because my other mono system used one really large speaker  you would then naturally get lower tones  however when using my over the ear headphones  i notices the same sound  more high and mid tones  so i am not sure this has anything to do with the speaker system  as the sound very bass heavy when plugging them into the computer  i tested all sorts of music on this player  classical a golden tone record that really had dynamics     s    s    s music  techno  classic country  pop  rock  electronic  singer song writer  i would like to hear what    s rap sounds like on this machine  everything you put on this sounds nice  and you can hear it at low volume  far away from the unit  what played the best brazil     naked eye s  strauss waltz  heart      
75,1.0 ,                       it worked well for a total of       of light use within   months   after that it sat for a year   when i went to turn it on again it was not working   i contacted customer service a year to the date that when it was purchased   they said it was the power plug   it took them   months to send another one   the turntable still did not work   they refused to work with me aside from saying   take it to a repair shop    buyer be ware   spen a little more for something that will last longer and get better service   i promise you  these machines are pretty on the outside but made with inferior parts and the customer service is evil      
76,2.0 ,                       partially my fault for not further reading but this player doesn t connect to external bluetooth speakers rather you can connect other bluetooth sources to use the speakers on this  but why you would want to do that i have no idea as the speakers are pretty sorry on this in the first place  now  victrola does make one that allows you to play your records on an external bluetooth speaker unlike this one  i purchased another so i sent this back  look for  dual bluetooth connectivity  or model  vwm    sb lgy you ll be happier      
77,1.0 ,                       so very disappointed to have to give this one star  first of all  i had to wait   months for it to arrive  when it got here  i was so excited  it is absolutely adorable  the color was perfect  and it was just what i wanted  except that it doesn t play a record for more than    seconds before it starts skipping  i tried it in several different locations    hoping maybe it just needed a really flat surface   didn t matter  the sound quality from what i could tell seems ok  i had read a bunch of reviews  both good and bad  and thought there were so many great reviews  i d risk it  unfortunately  i got one that seems to have the same skipping issue as a lot of other folks  i m not saying don t order it  if mine had worked  i d be giving it at least   stars  just buyer beware that yours might be one of the ones that don t work  sending it back      
78,5.0 ,                       measuring about the size of a small    to    inch laptop pc  but   inches deep  this is the perfect portable and stowaway companion for my    plus years of lps  yes  it also sounds just right through the two small front facing stereo speakers  this victrola is also a bigger eargasm when using my larger stereo speakers or extra bass headphones  to use my medium sized bluetooth speakers  i will soon buy a rca cable bluetooth transmitter for the turntable s rca output connector on the back the build and sound quality reminds me so much like the portable album and      players we had for pop up parties at school or hang outs at a girlfriend s house  yet  it s almost as light as my small laptop pc  this was truly a great buy that i will get a lot of regular use from playing all my    s  and    s  again  and buying some current artists on vinyl  even my dad s surviving    s  also sound awesome  but are rough on the easily replaceable stylus trust this for certain  uncompressed analog audio sounds much fuller and impressive than the compressed digital sound we ve gotten used to over the last    years  don t believe it  well  you ll hear the same distinct similarities that those mostly  old head  jurors heard and knew when listening to the blurred lines song  pharrell and thicke  while clearly remembering the sounds from marvin gayes  worldwide      hit and party jam  got to give it up   old head  ears  like me  are more attuned to hearing a much fuller spectrum of sounds  ranges and rhythms than people who have only listened to compressed digitized music  simply  it just sounds more full  real and live even the price on this   speed stereo turntable was under     perfect  it s well worth buying for all those middle and subtle sounds i ve been missing in my music and comedy albums  buy this victrola portable record player  and finally get your   st century musical head and ears right     at a low cost  your mind  body  soul and ears will thank you      
79,5.0 ,                       this summer i enlisted the help of my two granddaughters ages    and    to help me catalog a large amount of records left to me by my deceased mother and father  among the records were    s from the    s    s and    s and    s from the    ss and older  the girls were completely amazed with the  giant cd s   when they wanted to hear them i no longer had anything to play them on  as i told them things about the artists i knew and the times i had grown up in we found most songs on the internet so they could hear the records they were cataloging  how thrilled they were to hear the long  ago songs and the voices of the dead that will forever live  i had offered to pay them for the hours of work they were doing to help me on the project and instead they wanted this  record player and a few of the albums  i was all too happy to oblige them  it arrived in perfect shape and on time  the kids were so excited to hear the first album played   it was the sound of music  it has continued to work well  note  on newer albums purchased today the  vinyl  is a little different and you may need to put a coin on the tone arm to make it a little heavier so it doesn t skip  there has been no trouble at all with the olderalbums      
80,1.0 ,                       i bought this for my mother in law who is stubborn on having an all in one system  this is hands down the biggest joke for playing records i have ever experienced i have turntables that range from cheap    s plastic  to ion ittusb  vintage    s high end  a music hall mmf    and a       pro ject  i have cartridges that run cheap to expensive  same with speakers and amplifier  i m not a snob  i love music and i know how to reproduce vinyl at all price points  with that  this record player is horrendous the sound either through it s built in speakers or connected to a home stereo is weak and empty  there is no bottom end  clarity or separation  someone stated in a review that the speakers on their phone has better sound  hands down absolutely true lepai amp      dayton audio b    speakers      audio technica at lp             and you smoke the hell out this cheap crap if you are playing records that cost almost as much as this crap table and say  we ll its good enough for me  then so is a booger sandwich  you are bastardizing music  what the artist intended for you to hear and are just plain cheap and ignorant  do us all a favor  stop listening to music and hum or pick up whistling      
81,1.0 ,                       purchased to finally finish my home theater set up  even bought a bunch new records to add to my very old collection  had the worst experience pros  it s a cool looking red  easy to put together  seller refund was quick  seller has yet to even send a return label after months of asking for one so i basically got a free paper weight cons  took weeks to arrive  sound quality is terrible  ran mine via the rca jacks into my surround sound and also the actual built in speakers are absolutely horrible  still have it in box in garage after i got refund from seller  no return label sent so it s now taking up precious space      
82,1.0 ,                       this thing skips over the most minor dust particles and it s really really annoying  especially considering you can t close it with the record inside which means while you play the record more dust or hair has a chance of falling on it and makes it skip a ton  i ve wiped every record down before playing and they still skip if there s even one hint of dust  the bluetooth part is nice but definitely not worth the price if you re trying to just play records  complete waste of money      
83,3.0 ,                       i haven t had a record player in about    years  so i was looking forward to digging my old vinyl out of the closet without spending a ton of money on an expensive player  i m not so disappointed in this one that i intend to return it  but it does leave a lot to be desired likes  the sound quality is very good considering the price and considering that it has tiny speakers  the whole player is smaller than i thought it would be  it s very compact  and it plays my records well  the rotation on my unit is smooth  not wobbly as others have reported dislikes  there are two modes of powering on the turntable  in the first  the turntable comes on whenever the stylus is moved from its holder toward the edge of the record  unfortunately  in that mode  the table is supposed to turn off when the record is finished playing  my unit turns off with about    seconds of music left    extremely annoying  imagine pulling the power cord out of the wall and hearing the music slooow down and stop in the second mode  the table keeps turning no matter what  that means you can t walk off and forget it with a record playing  or you ll come back to a worn out needle i guess i was expecting the type of record player we had back before compact disks    one that would mechanically return the stylus to its holder when the record finished  no such luck  and i m disappointed that i have to pay so much attention to turning the unit on and off  oh  well  you get what you pay for  at least i have something to play my records on  even if i do have to get up at the end of each    and fiddle with the player      
84,1.0 ,                       this item worked the first time i used it  then  i pull it out a month later to use it with the album i had preordered  and the whole reason i bought this record player  and it won t even turn on  if anyone knows how to fix this   please let me know  thoroughly disappointed      
85,2.0 ,                       arrived in originally unopened box packed just fine  however inside the box was totally useless  the only thing that worked was the led lights indicating what setting you re on  long story short  ended up taking it apart and finding the speakers not even plugged in  but wait  it gets better  the rubber band like belt that turns the table wasn t even on  there was electrical plugs not even plugged in  after a little messing with it  finally got it to work  speakers suck  but you can always buy new ones  works fine now      
86,2.0 ,                       i understand this isn t most expensive model of turntable you can buy on amazon  but there still should be some quality  it s like it pick and chooses which vinyl to play without skipping jumping  am almost to the point well am ready to return it  i tried to put extra weight on the needle and it doesn t help it  in fact it has scratched some of my vinyl  brand new vinyl i have just open you can look at it and see there is nothing wrong with the vinyl  i guess it s true they say you get what you pay for  but this thing barely plays any thing so i don t understand what your paying for      
87,2.0 ,                       don t buy this if you think you think you can connect your bluetooth speaker to it to play your records and hear them on your bluetooth speaker  this stupid thing has bluetooth so you can stream your music to its crappy speakers why would i buy a record player with bt just so i can stream music from my device on super low quality speakers why would i lug around a record player just to use its super lame speakers  and not play records   you can spend the same amount and buy an awesome jbl portable speaker  this product makes no sense  yes  it plays records  at least that is true to form  also  the case top when open has not latch to keep it open so it can fall shut right on top of your record as it plays  we will have to unscrew the lid to keep it from falling down      
88,4.0 ,                       i ordered one of these players  when it came the ups box was fine  but the victrola box inside had a huge hole in it  however the packaging inside the victrola box looked okay so i went with it  at first every record i played skipped  this was my first record player so i thought it was the records and not the player that was the problem  there were tears  i was so heartbroken  the player came with an extra needle  so after every record constantly skipped i tried the other needle  that helped  but the records still skipped some of the time  i finally taped a penny to the top of the arm where the needle was and the records stopped skipping  but i thought the record player shouldn t need all of these changes to work right  so i asked for a replacement from amazon  worst case scenario  i d send the new one back and live with my  penny player   the new player came in a different box  no damage to the box  the new player works perfectly  no new needle needed  no pennies either  and every record plays perfectly now with no skipping  the second player is a nice one  easy to use and understand and the sound is excellent  i find myself listening to records all of the time now  and can see myself falling down the vinyl rabbit hole  i look forward someday to having a corner of my home with a beautiful sound system in it including a record player  i registered my first player  the damaged one  with victrola  and they sent me a free needle as a welcome gift  that was nice  they seem like a quality company  first record player aside  i give the product four stars  i m happy with it      
89,1.0 ,                       worked a week  then speed was erratic   contacted manufacturer under warranty and they require     to look at it  they asked for receipt and then never responded again   you get what you pay for i guess  thanks for the junk record player and no customer service   buyer beware      
90,4.0 ,                       if you re looking to play records and don t particularly care too much for good sound quality  then this turntable is for you  don t let self proclaimed turntable  experts  steer you away from this novelty purchase  or make you feel bad for already owning one  this is a perfect novelty record player that plenty of newcomers can enjoy to start off their journey into this side of the music world  in the end  records are meant to be played  enjoy them while you can my recommendations  purchase a diamond needle to replace the stock one it comes with  don t worry  it s easily replaceable  the needle it comes with is very low quality and has a high chance to skip and sound  hissy   if you plan on wanting good sound out of this thing  purchase some powered speakers  that partially ruins the  portability  gimmick  but not by much how s it feel  it feels well constructed  it doesn t feel luxurious  mind you  but it also doesn t feel extremely cheap how s the setup  easy  it s all set up and good to go  right out of the box  practically plug and play hows the sound quality  bad  lol  it s very  tinny  and lacks depth  bass is imperceptible  mids and highs sound okay  the same can be said no matter if you re using the speakers or the headphone output  that s what should be expected at this price range  it can get very loud however  which is a good thing  it can fill a medium room with its loudness how s the bluetooth  fine  works as it should  easy to connect  no problems so far how s the portability good  it s got the body of a suitcase  perfectly portable in that regard  one complaint i have however  is the fact that it doesn t have some sort of battery it runs off of  it  needs  to be plugged in  so its portability is only useful if you ve got an outlet to plug it into      
91,2.0 ,                       bought   months ago as birthday gift for daughter  nice style and design   some of my old lp s played  other s didn t   i figured the records were old and scratched   fast forward to december   daughter received a few new vinyl records for xmas and two wouldn t play without skipping   again  these are brand new records   i tried the same lp s on my vintage player and they played perfectly   i assume the included stylus  needle  is too crude to play the records properly   i ve tried to contact victrola via both email and telephone and have received no answer two stars is generous for this player and the company   i m giving it   stars for customer service    for playability and   stars for the tie dye finish      
92,4.0 ,                       i bought this refurbished by the seller  which came out to be essentially like new  the sound quality on the phonograph is alright  it plays records in a lofi sound quality  but it s still perfectly fine listening to it  if you re into listening to your records in the highest quality possible  you already aren t looking to buy this  this product is aimed at people who simply want to have an inexpensive way to listen to records  or even to get into the hobby the build quality is alright  i m not taking it traveling  so i m not to worried about it holding up to force  mine was pretty tough to get to the insides for tinkering  i had to take a razor blade to split the seams enough to lift the wooden panel up  the tonearm on mine came down pretty fast  which threw me off since the same model i replaced with this had its tonearm take a comfortably slow lowering to records  i had to add elmer s glue to the tonearm mechanism to get it to ease on the speed  and now it falls much softer what really surprised me about this player was the bluetooth functionality  it s an okay phonograph  but a surprisingly amazing sounding bluetooth speaker  with the lid closed  i was shocked how good music sounded from its built in speakers  the speakers don t really do records justice  but with spotify and youtube connected to it through it from my phone  it s a full  high quality sound  the size of the entire case really helps give it that quality sound  when the lid is opened  it still sound fine  but not as good as it is closed i paid around     for mine  and at that price i think it s fair  don t pay much more for it though  you can get better players than this      
93,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          i love it the sound quality is pretty good to my standards  ships fast  volume is great  to future buyers be careful with the tonearm on any turntable  always use the life and lower feature as well as the arm lock  and there is no slip mat so make sure you have one before playing records  there is also a replacement needle  and don t touch the groves of the records so they ll stay clean     
94,1.0 ,                       bought this record player for my bedroom as my current record player is being used by a friend  product arrived without a power cord and damaged  hinge for the front of the case wouldn t close and then proceeded to fall off   while i was annoyed it didn t come with a power cable it wasn t a big deal as i have plenty of others around that i could use  as soon as i plugged it in  a popping noise took place and then smoke started pouring out of the headphone jack and bottom of the case  player is adorable but do not purchase  i ve never returned an item so quickly      
95,1.0 ,                       my most recent purchase was the second player i had ordered  the first player did not work straight out of the box  no phono  no line in  no bluetooth  no sound  nothing  i purchased another one and it actually played for about    minutes before it stopped working too  i thought it had perhaps come with a faulty ac adapter but i tried another one and still  nothing wait  i thought i heard some static coming from those speakers  great  nope  never mind  it stopped working again  ugh i love the look and the portability but i am a bit of a utilitarian  i don t want to carry around a neat little box for no discernible reason  it needs to have some sort of function and unfortunately it s not heavy enough to use as a door stop      
96,3.0 ,                       great for the money  but it s true it lacks greatly in the sound department  the speakers belong to a    toy radio but it ll play records just fine  just don t turn it up more than half way and you won t blow out a speaker  invest maybe in separate speakers cause you can t use this for gatherings or everyone will comment on how awful the sound is hahah     
97,1.0 ,                       these things are nothing but junk  i order two of them  the first one had a bent turntable that ruined a few records  the second had a turntable that didn t even work and came in a smashed box with nothing to protect the item from shifting around  in not sure who is in charge of qquality control or testing these items  but someone needs to do better  would have really liked to own a working unit  but at this point these things will only be regarded as trash     
98,1.0 ,                       i ve been an amazon prime customer for around   or so years  maybe even     i ve never returned something before  until now  this thing is utter garbage  i m new to the vinyl scene  and thought this would be a good entry level buy  i was wrong  i got it yesterday  but didn t have any vinyls yet    of which arrived today the vinyls i received are brand new  not used  they have no scratches  i cleaned them beforehand  pop one in and first thing i notice is it s constantly slipping  one of the albums i ordered is a   disc vinyl  the other a one disc  i tried all four discs to make sure it wasn t the vinyl records themselves  it wasn t  they all were skipping constantly  frustrated i turned to google  after some investigating i found out this is a common problem with this turntable  i read it you continue to use it it will lead to the needle actually scratching and permanently destroying your vinyls and possibly even warp them to say i m beyond disappoint is an understatement  i m really hoping the my vinyls aren t damaged already  i ordered another turntable  but it won t arrive until thursday due to coronavirus and the extended delivery times for nonessential items  guess i ll find out then if the vinyls were permanently damaged by this poorly conceived product in the end  imo  it s worth paying the extra fifty to a hundred bucks to get a better low end entry level beginner turntable  when it comes to this monstrosity just don t do it  it s not worth the gamble      
99,3.0 ,                       out of the box  this record player was limited in the records it could play  i attempted to play records by amy winehouse  radiohead  and ariana grande  but all of them skipped horribly  i was able to play a few classic albums  sgt pepper s lonely heart band and kind of blue  as well as an album by a now defunct local band  when looking through reviews  i found that some people had to replace the needle to something higher quality than the one that comes with the player and that fixed the issues  i ordered some new tips and now the records are all playing without skipping  they are pretty easy to replace  the sound quality from the player is horrible  but i expected that and i have been using my own speaker  the playback is dynamic though at times it distorts a tiny but with some records  especially at louder parts  it really is only a tiny but distorted   if i were an audiophile i would probably hate it but it s not enough to bother an amateur like myself   but honestly i got what i expected   a cute but practical decoration that would hold me off as far as records go until i can find a higher quality player that adds to my home s aesthetic as far as appearance goes  i got the light blue player and it looks exactly like it did in the picture  it is a cute addition to my home office that helps the space feel more relaxing and provides a nice color pop to the room      
100,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          mine came in perfect condition  some reviews list some  common  problems but mine is just fine and i couldn t be happier  comes with two needles  i m including a    second video  listen to that audio quality      
101,5.0 ,                       this little record player is fantastic and has returned me to the joys of collecting and playing vinyl lps  it is sturdy  has a small footprint and very simple to use  highly portable but i have mine in one place and have connected  nicer speakers via the rca jacks on the back  it comes with pretty good dynamic range speakers built into the cabinet but you are not going to get the full sounds that you probably want unless you hook up other speakers and a sub woofer  i bought the logictec z    system for mine and i now feel like i have the best stereo system i could ever want  rich  warm sound and thanks to the huge number of cheap  old lps out there  i have access to music that either never made it to cds or is too expensive  i really feel like a kid again with this turntable      
102,5.0 ,                       great sound  cool design  awesome product  totally worth the   month wait  although they should speed up production with the popularity of records      
103,2.0 ,                       i bought this turntable thinking it d be a good starter for me  something to have while i saved up for a really good quality one   i might as well have saved my money and just waited longer to get a turntable i m fine with all the plastic since this was supposed to be a temporary starter one for me  but the low quality sound is ridiculous      
104,1.0 ,                       this   speed victrola portable record player arrived in a box that was not taped shut  that was my first clue that this could to be a  return  that got sent out as good merchandise  i hope  when i opened the box the power supply cord was tossed loosely on top of the player with the twist tie undone  the cord was not even nicely wrapped up  i took the player out of the box and removed the styrofoam protectors and undid the latch and open the player to discover that the plastic needle protector that was so suppose to be on the needle  to be removed before playing a record  was missing  another clued that this could be a return that got passed on to me  then i discovered that the drive belt was lose and hanging out from beneath the turntable  okay  i figured that i could reattach it around the turntable and then around the drive shaft and i did so and was successful  next i connected the power supply and turned the power knob  the turntable spun  so i obtained one of my old lp s and placed it on the turntable and settled the needle down gently upon it  using the needle arm control  and the record started off fine  the sound was perfect and then the sound stopped  i turned the player off and then turned it on again  still no sound coming from the speakers  well  i m not that disappointed because anytime you purchase electronics from amazon  it s going to be a gamble  so  i will be returning this item as usual      
105,3.0 ,                       i ve only had this item for about an hour and a half and i m not satisfied  i watched some other photo reviews and the sound seemed so much better  but now that it s here in person  the sound quality isn t all that great  now it s not terrible   but let s just say my crappy iphone speaker sounds better  the bass isn t captured well  the item itself is a tad flimsy on the inside  don t push or pull anything too hard or it will probably break  as far as the look   it s lovely  if this is something you re buying for decoration  then it s probably a good fit  the color is nice and the record player buckles up well  i don t use headphones but there is also an aux and headphone jack in case you want to connect it to other speakers or your headphones  but honestly  i bought this thing in hopes it could make it s own decent sound  so i will be asking for a return as the quality of sound and music is not good  also  the speed goes up and down during the songs  so it will play super fast and then super slow randomly        
106,1.0 ,                       delivered      power stopped working      of course my amazon return window ended       no worries  i wisely bought the warranty   well it s still under manufacturers warranty so they won t help  so now i need to box it up  drop it off at ups  and then once it gets to them wait       business days to inspect and process my return    quite a pain and other reviewers also had short lifespans as for the product itself in the    days i had it  it is easy to use  sound is good for the price  i would avoid buying this for kids or actually trying to move it around  mine sat in one place and broke  can t imagine what any wear would do to it      
107,4.0 ,                       i ordered this as i ve had a much larger  higher quality rca cabinet in the past that my dad sold out from under me  finally was able to get back into vinyl after years of wanting too  so i picked this little player up as a good starter  victrola has always been a bit of a budget player  so this fits their usual build it s very much a basic  starter player  it does have bluetooth  which is a nice feature  the headphone and line in out with rca hookups were a nice touch  once i finally manage to find the same cabinet i had before  i ll likely move on from this one  but it makes a decent bookshelf player  the speakers are tinny  but aren t awful for their size  would recommend singing wood speakers with rca if you re on a budget  and rca vintage wood housed speakers if you re willing to do some leg work and edifier bose if you have enough to shell out  even with the tinny speakers  it still flat out beats mp  quality for some reason  the player works just fine with all of my lps  except for my new copy of david bowie s  no plan   i checked and the vinyl is pressed flat  not any thicker or thinner than bon iver  flogging molly  etc  taped two pennies to the top of the needle for a little extra weight and that did the trick  otherwise  without the additional weight  no plan  keeps skipping purchased some additional replacement needles and will grab a cleaning kit in a bit  works like a dream with the wooden over ear victrola bluetooth headphones  would recommend using them with their headphone jack if you want the best sound quality      
108,1.0 ,                       bought this as my very first vinyl record player experience  i guess that i just expected too much for the price the build of the item itself is plastic  so it is lightweight  as expected and is rather convenient for portability  the tonearm and needle are rather flimsy and the plate that you lay the records on is also made of a cheap plastic i did however expect it to work with integrated or removable batteries  considering that it does have a suitcase form factor to allow it to be more portable  you are forced to use the included power supply now regarding to the main functions of the device  the included speakers are bad  and i mean really bad  there is no depth in them  whatsoever and the overall distortion makes it impossible to enjoy the player suffered from frequent skipping  which initially seemed to be the lp s fault  but after playing back a few more records  it became clear that the tonearm and needle are too light to apply the needed force to avoid such a problem  i stopped using this product immediately after realizing this to set the icing on the cake  it died on me a few weeks ago    i guess i ll be switching to sony s newest ps lx   bt belt drive turntable that is much better built and has a great minimalist design  they re pros when it comes to the good old record players and vinyls resumed  save up some more cash and go with something that cost      or more  anything else just isn t worth it      
109,3.0 ,                       i am giving this three stars because of the ease of returning and getting refunded   if it was difficult my rating would be lower   apparently  records are coming back in style  only now they call them vinyls and they keep them in sleeves   whatever   my daughter is into them so i bought her a cute  cheap record player   it is really cute  but the sound is pretty bad from the getgo   then after the third use  the speed started messing up and began warping the records   fortunately  i was within the    day return period and sent it back   it s disappointing because she was so excited when it arrived   her boyfriend replaced this with a real record player so she s happy again   i would suggest you spend more money for something better      
110,1.0 ,                       works  but it sound quality is horrendous  i m not an audiophile snob either  i d be satisfied with  passable   this is unlistenable  there is no low end at all  even with decent external speakers  it s all high end and extremely harsh to listen to  when using bluetooth  the sound is passable with the external speakers  but do not buy this for playing records  it s awful  if i could return mine i would  but it s long past the return date      
111,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       absolutely disgusted  and disappointed   i have purchased other  modern  record players  and found there to be poor quality sound  and even worse components   yet i had hoped that a record player with the name of  victrola  behind it   an absolutely  legendary name   in the phonograph industry   would be the exception      my hopes are for naught   the speakers are horrific  and the    speed is too fast  and something that is all too common in electronic devices   the headphone jack does not work properly   if i had a dollar for every time this had happened when i have purchased electronics with headphone jacks  i could put myself through school and learn in depth electronics  and create my own jacks  that actually work   do not purchase this record player  or any other modern  lower price  record player  especially the  retro  looking nostalgia types   they are junk   i want my money back  victrola       
112,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this is not the highest quality record player you can buy  but it s still real good  this is a nice  inexpensive little turntable that is more than enough for those of us with small home collection of vinyl albums  i chose pink because it was the cheapest color at the time of purchase  it has built in speakers  which was a requirement for me  but it also has an output so that you can play it through external speakers  this can t be connected to computer like some record players  but it is portable and very nice looking  it has three speeds and it will automatically stop playing once it reaches the end of a record  which is really  really nice  the built in speakers aren t the greatest quality  and they don t get as loud as i d like  but they re still good and more than acceptable  it comes with a back up replacement needle  which is really cool  the biggest complaint is that the record hangs off the side  and it s designed in a way that you can t directly place the record onto the player  if you tried to place it directly down  it would bump into the needle arm  so when you place records on the player  you have to kind of angle it to go underneath the needle arm  but this is just a minor inconvenience at most  i would still recommend this player as it is great quality and relatively inexpensive

115,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       wish i had read the reviews for this product  jeezzz      read reviews later after this happened   plugged it in  red power light did not come on  went to read the instructions in the living room and came back    minutes later to the record player on fire  my classic beatles  st edition sgt  peppers album melting and smoke everywhere and curtain by the window just beginning to smolder  glad i did not leave the house with this  frankenstein  of a product still plugged in it s impossible to make an electronic product this bad with the technology today   what just happened i don t know victrola company  look into this now      
116,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this record player is amazing  i was hesitant to buy because some of the reviews were saying it was broken or the speakers sucked but i got this for my boyfriend who is a musician and he is in love with it  it sounds great and plays the records great  so happy with this purchase  i      recommend it      
117,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i already had the victrola vintage looking radio with a cd player  radio  vinyl record player  etc  which had a bad needle that would skip relentlessly  so i bought this in hopes that it d be different it sure was different  it was worse the needle skips all the time on all of my records  new and old  it s seriously annoying  also  the speakers have horrible quality and defeat the purpose of buying a record player in the first place      
118,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       sound is fine  no issues  portability is not great  it requires a plug in and no where to carry it  dumb  my main issue    the genius design team decided the flag should be upside down when carrying and playing  fail  thanks  but no thanks  research what the american flag distress signal is victrola  it doesn t go on your music box      
119,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,              your browser does not support html  video                          first off before i write this review let me just say i did a lot of research on this kind of record player and even a few of my own experiments so i would consider what i found to be pretty credible  i wish someone wrote a review like this for me when i was considering buying it    is this a good record player for beginners or people who only want a few records to play for the aesthetic  absolutely  the sound quality is meh  but i mean what do you expect for      it plays the records no problems  and the bluetooth is great for just whenever now here is how you can upgrade your setup with minimal spending  get an rca to mini jack cable  plug that into a speaker you already have or if in my case you have a practice amp cause you play an instrument  get a mini jack to     converter and plug it into the amp  it works great    will this ruin my records no  it will not  i made a little scale and using pennies weighed out the tracking force to be around  g  now compared to      record players that track at  g this seems like a lot  but be aware  when records were made  they were made to withstand up to   or  g of tracking force cause lots of old players tracked at around   or  g  now tracking heavier like this will yes  wear them out faster  but it will not ruin them  the needle is also a diamond  so the needle is pretty decent actually now you can actually fix the tracking force on this thing  get a small scale  like the kind to bake with  put your tone arm on it  get some pennies and nickels and start stacking them at the back of the tone are where the counterweight should be  one your tone arm reads at about      g  take those coins  tape them together  and tape them to the back of that tone arm  maybe even go for around      g because in my experience these cheap ones skip very easily    is it portable absolutely not  you need to plug it into an outlet  and it could totally break with some throwing around  also the lid is completely useless i took the lid off by unscrewing the screws on the back hinges  the lid is not big enough even when open to run     vinyls  the edge is right under your record  like millimeters under  and if you have any warping  at all it will hit the edge and cause it to skip  this is likely the problem a lot of people have when it skips and just don t know it  just take the lid off its useless    does it skip  does it sound weird no  not at all  i had it skip on me once  and after replaying that section it never did it again  probably was just my fault since i accidentally tapped the vinyl i was playing when getting it out of the sleeve  also i tested the wow and flutter using a phone app  let me tell you that it is bad  like the wow and flutter is really high  but  even so  i didnt notice any sort of distortion in the sound  it might be worse when playing above   rpm but at least for     its fine    is it worth the price      as long as you know what your getting  i didn t expect this player to be good or even great  its okay at best and i m fine with that cause its      if you are looking for a very nice player that delivers great sound quality  dont get this  if you want to really get into vinyl  dont get this  if you want to experience the most you can from your records  dont get this  if you want to just play a couple of records for cheap and have them in your room cause its cool and aesthetic  go ahead  im doin it for that exact reason  also  i purchased an amazon return and found no problems with it  dont be afraid to purchase a used one for less  you can always return it if it is actually broken  but it will probably work anyway      
120,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i am so pissed off about this record player   i was sooo excited and wanted to jam out my old records   and i did    day   i didn t use the record player for about a month after that cause i went on vacation and forgot about it   but when i got back  i was pumped to listen to tunes    so  i went to go play a record   and  i swear   i smelled smoke   and    it didn t work at all   the little light didn t even come on   i mean   i didn t even move it from it s spot at all   it had been too late to return it   i never write reviews good or bad really  but heads up on this one   it really made me sad it didn t work after   time    boo to the manufacturer   boo
