0,5.0,                       fits wells good material a little worse for wear in that i work in a more heavy duty environment and the everyday riff raff has torn a small hole in the abdomen area like my other shirts  which is why i ordered these   in much less time  these would be good shirts for everyday wear as opposed to heavier environments like sports and work  they re cheap  fit well and are made of a nice material  i d buy them again for sure      
1,4.0,                       i ordered black and gray shirts  when it got delivered it was red and black  my bf likes the brand and everything  but it s was such a hassle to return for the right color  so we decided to keep it      
2,5.0,                       perfect undershirts for the money  if you re like me  i always wear an undershirt  it s just more comfortable that way  i wanted to replace my large aging collection with some new crisp white tshirts   being able to buy    at a time  i bought a total of     to replace them all sure made my wife happy  they fit well    i did buy xxl so with a little shirking in the dryer  they re a perfect xl fit  the quality and construction is on par with hanes or any others i ve had before   they seem thick enough to even wear on their own too      
3,4.0,                       i ordered this pack of shirts for my boyfriend as a christmas present  he loved the quality and the basic colors but the shirts ended up being a little smaller than expected so i had to return and order a larger size  i would recommend ordering a size larger than normal but other than that they are wonderful quality and are amazing everyday basic options      
4,5.0,                       it s a white t shirt  it fit s well and didn t shrink a lot on the first wash  so far a good buy  from my days as a purchasing assistant i remember gildan as being a good company that makes quality products  especially shirts  which is why i chose these shirts over the others      
5,5.0,                       i saw a good deal on a   pack of these shirts so i went ahead and pulled the trigger  i prefer men s cut shirts because they normally cover everything i like covered and was hoping these would still do that for me although i couldn t try them beforehand   i ve worn two of the shirts so far and they are excellent quality  they don t feel scratchy at all straight out of the pack  they do definitely cover what i need them to and they are in a color scheme i prefer to wear  dark colors   they would have fit perfectly had i not gained some extra weight during this quarantine period  but aside from that these shirts meet all expectations      
6,5.0,                       my dad loves these  never thought it d be possible to be obsessed with t shirt lol but he really is obsessed  he loves the material and it doesn t shrink  thank goodness    extremely soft  no fuzzies      
7,3.0,                       hard to complain about shirts this cheap  they get the job done  colors are as represented  dark saturated with no bleeding in wash however a few issues     the stitching is not great  one of the five has a few areas of stitching hanging loose and incomplete  the rest seemed fine      the sleeves are way too wide  for my taste i suppose   a bit short and almost flared out     if you are under    and can do a     lb bicep curl with each arm  then the medium probably will fit nicely as an undershirt  it s a solid buy  just donate the one or two with bad stitching  and don t worry about the aesthetics  if you want to wear it on its own  i would probably look elsewhere      
8,5.0,                       golden work shirts are typically a better fit  for whatever reason the sleeves on these were a little shorter than usual  maybe it s how i washed them  overall good fit  i prefer a little looser fit but these worked out well  i m not a fan of the super fitted so this is the perfect compromise  for size reference i m short     and about    lbs  muscular build      
9,2.0,                       i was unimpressed  even a bit disappointed the ts are lightweight and thin  the neck seemed to stretch out as the day went on  while i didn t return them i will not be buying more  i thought from the positive reviews they would be of better quality than the f of the l type t shirt  they aren t any better but about the same and that isn t good enough      
10,5.0,                       i ve gotten gildan shirts before  they ve always been fine  but not amazing  well  i don t know what they ve changed because these new ones are amazing  perfect fit for what i need and very soft  got these a little loose to wear for outdoor work and hiking  highly impressed  highly recommend  oh and did i mention the incredible deal    shirts for      can t beat this  no wonder they re the    best seller  will buy again      
11,3.0,                       i m          lbs and wear a medium  my biggest issue with undershirts from hanes and fruit of the loom is they have a collar you could drive a truck through  me personally i like a tighter fitting collar and the gildan s are better than others i ve tried  however  as with other similar undershirts  these shrink a lot and now some of them do not stay tucked in  the quality is on par with hanes and fruit of the loom and other undershirts i ve tried but at least it somewhat solves my collar issue      
12,4.0,                       these were very inexpensive shirts   the cloth is ok  lightweight  but the sleeves are too short for my taste   i d rather pay about the same price and get hanes or fruit of the loom shirts at walmart that have longer sleeves  but these were by no means bad shirts   don t pill up too much   no defects      
13,5.0,                       i got these for my father  he is old school so likes plain white shirts  that are good quality  perfect fit  and style  yes white shirts can make you look stylish     well these shirts  are perfect he said there soft  perfect fit   we will definitely order again  also seller was  fast         
14,4.0,                       i m satisfied with this purchase  the sleeves are a bit shorter than i would like  but other than that it s pretty good considering the insanely low price      
15,5.0,                       i bought two   packs for       each  they are a little bit long and will hang below your outside shirt  i m      and have a belly so i bought xl and they fit me well  not as tight as the fruit of the loom xl that i usually buy  i ll wait until they go down in price again and buy more      
16,2.0,                       i m not sure if i got the wrong package but the first thing i noticed on multiple shirts are the loose strings around the neck  i hate to complain and honestly very rarely leave reviews but i was fairly excited to gets these since they claim to be soft and comfortable and i needed some under shirts for work but these are kind of stiff and not very soft  i gave a   star because the price was decent and i should know in most cases you get what you pay for but i am debating returning  sorry for the rant if anybody even makes it to the end      
17,1.0,                       bad  bad  bad  very bad quality under shirts with extremely thin material  all shirts came with defects and loose threads everywhere  never again any product from gildan      
18,5.0,                       i m not sure when plain white t s became so expensive but they are a bit over priced at places like target  kohl s etc   these shirts were a better value to me and had good reviews   i am familiar with this brand since i used to own a screen printing business   they have quality products which made my decision a little easier   initially when i opened the package i thought these shirts were going to be too heavy as an undershirt so i was a little disappointed  but  once i washed them they softened up so i decided to wear one as a test   i am now completely satisfied with these shirts and will likely buy another pack      
19,5.0,                       white shirt is white is good     
20,5.0,                       very soft   roomy fit   at  x  i appreciate that   no pocket  but hey  i don t smoke anymore  so i don t need one      
21,5.0,                       i m highly impressed  the shirts are well made  they re durable and  if any discrepancy in size  they fit maybe just slightly large and noticeably long  and that s preferable  in my opinion  to being just a little too small  i like getting more for my hard earned money and gildan undershirts seem  to me  an absolute no brainer of a high value bargain  the value is really just that impressive  great product and great value   thanx      
22,3.0,                       first off i want to say that the first pack i ordered are absolutely amazing  the gray and black pack is a great thick but thin and soft but stretchy material    stars for sure  i ordered the second pack of these shirts because my husband loved the first pack  gray and black   the second pack i bought  the pack with the blue  red  and gray shirts are way worse quality  the first   shirts that i opened out of this pack were fine       although a slightly different material than the other colored pack i bought  the material of the other pack was awesome   they still seemed to be decentish quality  the last two shirts that came in the pack look like the machine that sewed them screwed up  there is stitching out of place everywhere with long strands hanging off and stiching crossing from the front to back  i wouldn t purchase the specific pack i got this time again      
23,5.0,                       i m a pretty tall guy       these shirts fit all around and i enjoy them greatly  i use this for around the house or going out  i don t care to dress up and am more oriented around comfort in wearing what i do while going out or lounging around the house that said  the only ding i give this product is the tight neck  it s not choking tight  but it is the tightest part of the shirt  other like shirts have more neck room  i don t mind this too much and the above pros beats this  to me at least      
24,5.0,                       my boyfriend got the shirts to wear under his jacket at work  so he had to have the right fit  he likes t shirts better than the calvin klein ones i bought him before this  he feels that these are more sturdy and are stronger     
25,4.0,                       always expect some shrinkage with cotton and especially in the length of the torso and sleeves  i want large  so i order xl in cotton   standard protocol  however  the fit would be much better for me  and for most men  i would think  if they made them longer  so that when they shrink  and they always do   they would not end up with that boxy square shape  and they would be long enough to tuck in when i want  gasp   sure  nobody wants them too long  but with the inevitable shrinking  that s not going to be a problem  just a couple more inches is all  insert michael scott line here       
26,5.0,                       these ts are really comfortable  fit me well  and after several washes have a stable shape with nice even slight shrinkage after med high heat drying   just what i was looking for  most l ts are too big and most m ts are too small for my med slight frame  the length of these is perfect for me too   below the belt line by a few inches but not below my crotch like a miniskirt  stays nicely tucked i liked these so much i bought a pack of v necks   again  perfect  i like these better than my last batches of hanes and fotl and hope they ll be as durable as those brands      
27,4.0,                       genius design  it has two short sleeves that partially cover your arms  and a large hole for your head to poke through so the shirt doesn t obscure your view  if you put your arms through the head hole or your head through the arm holes  it doesn t work as well  but when worn as intended it works as advertised  it s great for covering my torso in warmer weather and in a pinch it can be folded and tied to look like a ninja mask they re t shirts  folks  that s all  i don t know how long they ll last  but at this price i don t care      
28,1.0,                       the t shirt is medium   i m          pounds   the t shirt comes out of my pants  the sleeves were short  and both the sleeves and the neck were stretched out of shape after one wearing  i gave the rest to good will  it s a shame   because the boxer shorts i got from them were great      
29,5.0,                       so  a few things to keep in mind when buying shirts  whether you re going to buy them to wear on the outside as a stand alone shirt or your buying to wear under a uniform  i e  security  law enforcement  firefighter  etc   if you re using them as a stand alone shirt  you can get whatever size you normally wear and it should fit you fine if you need them to wear under your uniform  get a size smaller and it won t be so small that it won t fit   it ll just be snug enough so it doesn t bunch up under your uniform blouse once it s tucked in the quality seems great  solid shirt and you can tell they used good quality material      
30,5.0,                       very good quality t shirts  they look nice  and fit perfectly  including the length  i purchased the xl  i am  ft  in     lbs  i personally wash my clothes cold wash  no fabric softener  and i hang dry my t shirts      
31,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          it fits perfect     
32,5.0,                       i am a butcher  meat cutter for one of the larger grocery stores in our country  i just recently purchased some compression thermals that i wear for our cutting room and our meat cooler  my gildan black t shirt s are part of my layerings that i use for my job and they  fit on top of my thermals extremely comfortably  i recommend this product for the men that work hard as i do and need to be comfortable while doing our jobs  thank you gildan for a great product at such a great price  your customer vincent gutierrez         
33,5.0,                       over the past few years  i have tried to buy only gildan t shirts  both long and short sleeve   they fit perfectly and are very comfortable   also they do not shrink when washed      
34,4.0,                       due to some negative reviews about the quality of this gildan tee shirt and the short length  i was hesitant to make this purchase   i made it based upon the quality of past gildan products   the length was better than expected  i am        with a longer torso and i found plenty of material at the bottom of the tee shirt to tuck in   there were negative reviews about the shrinkage   after washing these tee shirts and putting through a normal dryer cycle  i did not find shrinkage to be a problem   the one key element of the is tee shirt is that the collar lays flat   this allows for a good look under a work shirt  i am pleased with how the collar lays   it looks good   i would buy these again  and i plan to buy more gildan products based upon my experiences with gildan clothing items      
35,2.0,                       these tee shirts are just horrible   it s my second purchase of this brand  same size and color   my first purchase was spot on comfortable   my recent order are tight fitting  especially the arm sleeves   almost like extra small sleeves were sewn on a medium size shirt   this isn t anything like the gildan tees of the past      
36,4.0,                       for the price these t shirts are a pretty decent product   i bought some hanes t shirts at the same time and i would rate them better for comfort   slightly thicker without being uncomfortable under a shirt or sweater they are quite well made but on   of the   the seam under the sleeve was not finished very well   as it was only on the inside i am not too concerned  however  the fifth shirt the seam actually finished on the outside as a    tag   more funny than anything but qa could probably be tightened oddly  one of the five has more polyester and is described as  moisture wicking    it is actually a nice t shirt but i think i would have been happy with all cotton i would buy again      
37,4.0,                       bought t shirts because the boxer briefs purchased earlier were top notch used the size chart to determine size  ordered large  i can wear them butfeel snugger than my other t shirts marked l  i prefer looser fit  not snug quality of workmanship and materials same as underware  next time thinki ll try the xl     
38,5.0,                       the t shirts seem to be of comparable quality to the hanes shirt i usually get  i haven t washed them yet to see how much they ll shrink  i m sure they ll shrink some because they are cotton  i consider myself to be a careful shopper so i was worried these shirts weren t going to be good quality because of the price  i ve now learned that hanes charges too much for similar quality      
39,1.0,                       this was the first time i bought a gildan product the product was delivered before the given delivery date  a plus   i opened the package and tried on a t shirt for fit and it felt great  just right   length  shoulders  armpit  etc  so  i put the t s in the washer  cold  with other similar colors  normal wash and dry process  when i removed from the dryer to fold they looked significantly smaller so i tried one on  they don t fit anymore  they shrunk so much they are not long enough to tuck in my pants and are very tight around the armpit stitch  unwearable  please be forewarned  if you buy this product make sure you order at one or two sizes larger  i would recommend going with hanes  fruit or another brand      
40,2.0,                       i m          athletic build and just wanted some white shirts for the gym  these are white yes  they do fit yes  they did shrink in the dryer  i bought a large  and they still fit  i just hate the neck on these  it looks bad  again who really cares if it s just a gym shirt but    the neck is pretty ugly  it has a big hem on it and is still rather more loose than i prefer  my neck is a            just isn t like other gildan shirts i have      
41,5.0,                       the black shirts that i purchased fit really well   they have a longer length  which is great when you have to bend down   no one needs to see a full moon  a half moon  or even a crack of the moon i m sure the white shirts would fit just as well   update  the white shirts  that i also purchased  fit perfectly with the same length as the black shirts stay safe        
42,5.0,                       good quality t shirt      cotton  runs a little bit on the large side  i ordered a large and it s more like an excel but it is a hundred percent cotton so after the first wash in the dryer it s going to shrink  and it s a good package deal you really can t get   shirts for this price     
43,1.0,                       the shirts say they are      cotten but i don t believe i have ever felt such rough scratchy cotton  i have had these shirts for a few weeks now and they have been washed multiple times and are still scratchy  i also put one on this morning and it has a hole in the arm pit  i would not suggest buying these and i will not buy them again      
44,1.0,                       few items to note here  first the cost of these shirts are super cheap so i expected them to not be the greatest quality or to last a super long time either  figured i would buy these for an upcoming vacation and if they lasted after that  it would be a bonus  two of the four shirts were not even stitched at the sleeve and one had some threads that if pulled would pull apart the collar stitches  there is a difference being of cheaper quality and not even assembling your product properly to sell  with only one good shirt in the bunch  the deal for       for four shirts really is    for one wearable shirt  beware as you will get what you pay for here      
45,5.0,                       i like this company  great price for good quality  relatively thick compared to other brands      cotton shirts  these work as undershirts or for going out  recently i ve gained weight because i been stuck inside and had to go up a size so i bought all new undergarments like boxer briefs  the white version of this shirt  and this  the black one  and all of them are great i wear them preferentially  so if you re in between brands  or these are sitting in your cart  look no further  especially if you hate shopping for clothes and your a simple man looking for value     
46,5.0,                       glad i found at such a good price   only concern was shrinking after washing and drying   seems the all cotton ones got a little shorter but that doesnt matter   a ok   may order a smaller size for myself because prefer the mens tshirts for sleeve lenth and neck fit   hate low cut anything   i am a prude      
47,1.0,                       i am very disappointed with this product  i followed all of the directions to iron it onto my tshirts and it did not work at all  the paper was very difficult to get off and when it did come off it ripped in half and ruined my shirt  i couldn t even get it all off  the design was ruined and i could not fix it  i will not be buying this product again      
48,5.0,                       i went to buy some more t shirts and was shocked at the prices  my wife had always resupplied me at christmas so i had no concept of price  searched and these popped up as amazon s choice  they re great  just the right weight  they fit well  and the neck is tough enough not to stretch out  i paid good money for some hanes that never recovered after the first wash  these are holding up great edit after   washings  the sleeves are a little short  which i like but others may prefer sleeves a little longer  they shrink slightly when machine dried so if you re between a large and x large go with the xl unless you like them snug  still very happy with them      
49,5.0,                       i buy these for my son who i am sure will one day be on national tv for something horrible  he hates them and expects me to spend the money i work for  on expensive labels      t shirt doesn t hold up to a life of homelessness and couch surfing like these do  they are tough i tell you  i like the multicolored pack because i can generally gauge how long it s been since he s showered or bathed yep  never have just   child  have    at least with   your chances of having   that succeeds is            
50,5.0,                       i am a disabled veteran  i ordered a five pack of gildan tee shirts  i love gildan tee shirts for their quality  comfort and perfect fit  but most of all my family loves amazon  when i received my tee shirts  two were not the correct size  i went on line and filled out the return for the exchange   amazon sent me an email letting me that they would correct the order  today  sunday my usps delivery lady rang the door bell and my five new shirts were here   no one in my life has ever given me service like amazon  to me they are just the best on the planet for quality merchandise  excellent service  super fast shipping and caring for their customers  my family now uses amazon for about seventy five percent of our daily shopping and that will increase soon in time  amazon thank you and your entire  staff  for the wonderful work you do  may god bless your company and these united states of america  many  many thanks al   jane in the great northwest     
51,2.0,                       not that i bought these to wear alone but you would never wear this t shirt alone  a supper cheap cut  i think they used a box to create the pattern  also  one shirt arrived with a hole in the back of it  if they weren t so cheap  i would return them  very disappointed in the brand  won t purchase again  i understand they are inexpensive but to be complete garbage   unacceptable  the brand obviously lacks integrity      
52,3.0,                       i love gildan t shirts  they fit perfect and are very comfortable  when i received my shirts  i opened the package with my hands no scissors and took one bundled t shirt and took the piece of tape off  when i unraveled it i noticed a hole on the left bottom side of the t shirt  it was very disappointing  guess i will just have to use it for yard work now      
53,4.0,                       love these shirts  however i occasionally get them with what looks like bleach or something that has discolored the shirts in areas  see picture  this stuff should be caught during inspection  this is my second order  just not worth the trouble to return one of   shirts  but its annoying      
54,3.0,                       the material is cheap and doesn t wash well  i was also sent the wrong shirts and missed the red ones i was expecting  i will use them for cleaning soon      
55,4.0,                       good quality non white undershirt for price hard to beat  im     and wear a large shirt  but wear xl of these  fits like a large once washed  don t draw up like the white t gilden sells length is perfect to tuck or not thin is ok for an undershirt for under polyester work uniform that feels like its sanding your nipples off  these are a       
56,4.0,                       item purchased   of  gildan men s crew t shirt multipack  assorted black grey    pack   xx largereview good for regular height person  not for      tall person  cotton shrunk up after wash  is too short  again would probably be fine for anyone around   foot tall or shorter  because there is not a lot of shirts for tall people have to constantly try regular shirts like this and hope   in    will somewhat work for height  length just barely went below my belt line on initial try on  and unfortunately shrunk up too much after wash  material is comfortable  shirts feel nice  gildan seems like a good brand for regular height people after trying many of their shirts from amazon unfortunately no tall shirts  this one is not for      tall person  one day shipping  arrived on time      
57,2.0,                       the initial fit of these shirts was as expected  tag free neck is great  the packaging states that the shirts are made from  premium soft cotton for all day comfort   but these are some of the roughest feeling t shirts i have ever worn  they are not  moisture wicking   or maybe i don t know what this means  because after a light workout  the shirt looks like i ve run a marathon  which never happens with my other t shirts  after the first wash  machine wash cold and tumble dry medium as stated by the instructions   the shirts all shrunk by       inches  but only lengthwise  i am worried to wash them again  otherwise i may end up with a midriff baring crop top  note  i am a male  and this look would not suit me very well   i can try and update this post if possible after my next wash  for those that are interested  overall  i would recommend a different purchase if you are in the market to replace your current comfortable t shirts     
58,5.0,                       these shirts fit nice  but a little bit long  which i like   when tucked in  they do not come out they are a bit thicker than average  and appear to be made well i wear them as undershirts  and also by themselves there are no weird seams  or overly thick stitching they are made from soft material  and are very comfortable i would recommend these shirts to anyone without question  i will buy more of these in the future      
59,5.0,                       i purchased these for my husband as undershirts  he wears these under his polos and they fit great  the price is a affordable and matches the quality  i have washed and dried these many times with very little shrinking  i only hang dry these   no dryer    my husband is     and     pounds  i ordered a large and these fit well  highly recommend      
60,5.0,                       finally a basic tshirt that doesn t shrink to a belly shirt when washed  i ve bought other t shirts online that i have to re stretch and line dry in my basement to have a chance at still fitting length  i m tall       but average body build and length  these shirts are soft and retain length below the belt line      
61,5.0,                       t shirt feels made of good quality  fit perfectly and comfortable to wear   i ve already washed put in the dryer and did not shrink   i ll repost again after i ve evaluated a longer period   for now i m satisfied with this product second review   been wearing these daily and have washed them multiple times and they re holding up nicely   material still feels good and they maintain their size and shape   i ll purchase again later and i do recommend these t shirts      
62,2.0,                       the first thing that i noticed was the thinness of the material so i held the fabric up to the window light along with a   yr old worn jockey t shirt   the older t shirt was twice as thick and the new ones from gildan looked half the weight almost reminding me of cheesecloth      
63,1.0,                       i always wash my clothes in cold water and dry with very low heat to minimize any shrinkage   these shirts shrank so bad i can t even tuck them into my pants   i have other t shirts made by gildan that do not shrink but i would stay away from these unless you wash in cold water and air dry your t shirts   i realize these are cheap but i have similar cheap hanes t shirts that barely shrink after washing and drying      
64,2.0,                       all shows in comparison  when i bought banana republic soft tee  yes  it is       i realized that i was wasting money on guildan t shirts  day and night   now i cannot even put on guildan t shirts and will be disposing of them  since i see no use for the product  after using banana republic for few days  guildan t shirts seem harsh and deformed  not soft on skin  heavy  and very uncomfortable comparable to banana republic soft tees  the difference is obviously in much much quality of fabric and i guess we need to pay more for higher quality  the feel is more like underarmour  another good option  but also more expensive  i wish amazon focused more on quality vendors  reviews often don t tell much since they are often produced by people who did not have a chance to try high good quality products  it s all about price      
65,5.0,                       loved the fabric and the fit  they fit as expected  not having a tag is great  no itch  colors stay through multiple washes  size stays after wash too  since they are pre shrunk  shoulder seal is where it should be for size so the short sleeves are correct length too   great overall      
66,5.0,                       i have now officially moved over to gildan after these  this is now my second set of a new    pack of shirts   fit is great  as i wear an under shirt under everything  even other t shirts   so for me one of the biggest things is sleeve length   i hate  hate  hate  an undershirt sleeve going past the sleeve of whatever polo  t shirt  etc  i m wearing and these are perfect      
67,5.0,                       i have had these shirts for   months  and i primarily wear them under my police uniform  i have the black  crew neck  size large  they are perfect  the neck line is snug without being too tight  and it doesn t stretch out throughout my shift like other brands have  hanes and fotl   the shirt has a soft feel and is very comfortable  to the point that i often times wear it when i m not in uniform  the sleeve length is proportionate to the size of the shirt and i have no issues with the t shirts sleeves being too long to wear under a short sleeve uniform shirt  they have stood up to frequent trips through the laundry without losing their quality  as someone who is particular with t shirt style and fit  i can say i highly recommend these  and the price can t be beat      
68,4.0,                       low price for great shirts   fit was just right   cotton is medium weight   personally not too crazy about the light gray shirts and i m not sure i d wear them much  but the black and dark gray look great   not too heavy for a workout   gildan is one of the big players on t shirts   you ll find them behind many logo and graphic design shirts   will definitely buy again      
69,5.0,                       fits like a dream  especially around the neck where a lot of crew necks let me down  fits close to the neck  is roomy and comfy at the base and the shoulders and arms fight great as well  i ve nothing bad to say about these  when my current batch goes bad i m ordering these again  i ll keep buying these for life as long as they keep being made like this      
70,1.0,                       i was looking for high quality t shirts and  ordered these based upon amazon reviews   the reviews are wrong   i have a short torso  and these t shirts run short  so the t shirt is always escaping from belt and i have to tuck it in   also  i was expecting a heavy weight cotton t  but instead this is a thin  light weight t   all in all  it s pretty uncomfortable these shirts were so uncomfortable  i finally wound up throwing them out  replacing them with fruit of the loom stay tucked in t shirts   the fol shirts   really   stay tucked in      
71,4.0,                       i decided to try these out  bc my husband usually wears hanes or fruit of the loom  i bought these bc of price so why not  the material is thicker than the hanes or fotl and have a much better fit  so my hubby has found a new undershirt  i do reccommend these for quality  fit  price and prompt shipping     
72,1.0,                       one of my shirts came with a big rip on the sleeve seam  neck seems very tight as well      
73,5.0,                       i have purchased similar shirts like the black pack of   i purchased for this review  my shirt size is typically xl and i learned from my first purchase to buy a size bigger especially if i m buying the black shirts  i can t say this for all colors but for some reason the white shirts didn t shrink  however  the black shirts will shrink a size  i m       lbs and after washing and drying these shirts i can say that you should buy one size bigger  i see a lot of people bought these as undershirts  for me  i use these as everyday shirts  they re thin enough so i don t get hot yet they re thick enough to last a few months when using them for work shirts      stars      
74,4.0,                       these are honestly the greatest shirts i own but i just don t like the fact that they shrink  they shrink a good amount as well  out of the box shirt length is long  pass the belt line and usually after the first wash and dry they shrink and sit right above the belt line  out of the box i can lift my hands up and it won t show my belly  after wash i can lift my hands up and it defiantly shows my belly lol  but overall great undershirts and shirts to lounge around the house with      
75,5.0,                       i ve been wearing these shirts for so many years now i ve lost count  they are great for wearing around the house  they re super soft and fit just right  they also withstand the washing machine dryer without much shrinkage  the color is a nice solid black  for anyone looking for a nice basic black t shirt stop looking and just buy these  you won t regret it      
76,4.0,                       nice fit  good pricenot particularly soft but the fit is great not super tight on the arms or stomachpurchased large     
77,4.0,                       shirts are fine and fit well  what disappointed me was that these are made lighter than the previous golden s i bought a year or two ago  maybe it s considered progress but i expected thicker material  that s why i bought these again  will try another brand next time      
78,5.0,                       i was a bit skeptical based on the price  but i was pleasantly surprised  overall quality is good and the shirts hold their form  especially around the neck area  would purchase again      
79,3.0,                       this is a good multipack of standard undershorts  as far as size goes  it s a standard medium you d expect  the product images clearly show a much more tapered fit that some brands would call  slightly fitted  or  tapered   these are not  they are standard straight sided tees  which is fine  these don t claim to be  but the image used is plainly inaccurate      
80,5.0,                       i m a bigger guy with     shoulders and     waist   bought these for my daily uniform and was really impressed after having them for   weeks now   they have kept their shape very well after   washings and dryings   and the length is very much appreciated  as a taller guy  these come down past my waist and stay tucked in all day   well worth the money      
81,5.0,                       i have worn a competitor s t shirt for years and been satisfied  but when the pandemic hit their availability became rare to not available  all i could find were the loud  bright colors that i wouldn t ever wear  so when i found these i promptly ordered them  the first order was lost by the usps  but amazon promptly sent me a replacement order no charge to say i am pleased is an understatement  they look great  fit great and the price was very reasonable  highly recommended      
82,3.0,                       these t shirts fit so awful  it feels like the person who made them has never actually seen a human in person just a quick sketch of a rough estimate of what a human looks like   very tight under the arms even though it s actually a size larger than i normally order   i will never purchase this brand of t shirts again       
83,5.0,                       bought them as a cheap alternative for work clothes  construction   but i ended up falling in love with them  they are super comfy and fit great  i now use them as workout clothes or a lazy day in the house   i ve used them several times and they are still holding really well      
84,3.0,                       i read the reviews and i m glad i sized up to xl for my husband  he would normally wear a medium and we usually buy large for shrinkage  but i m glad we went xl cause these shrink big time decent material so it s not a bad buy just size up  although it did come packaged weird just   shirts taped together and placed in a plastic bag  nothing ripped or damaged      
85,5.0,                       i was worried about buying these for my son  however they are awesome  he loves them  soft to wear  color perfect  perfect size  do not look boxy like hanes  fotl  i will be buying more from this seller excellent price for    highly recommend   fyi  they shrink buy   size up      
86,3.0,                       i always like to wear undershirts  and i usually buy them at the wholesale warehouses  but sometimes i buy them for a premium  honestly i would spend more money and buy them elsewhere  these feel very cheap and they get dirty right away  even after a wash  they look like you got dust on them  would not recommend nor buy them again      
87,5.0,                       well first off im a girl not a guy but i wanted comfy t to wear at home  i don t particularly care for women s shirts for comfort as sometimes they are see through and i have to wear something else under and i am not about to do that with the weather already in the    s  the material feels good for the warm weather  im currently wearing a fruit of the loom t and the material does feel slightly thicker  however again for the heat i wanted something less thick feeling but it doesn t feel cheap either  the colors i received are the exact one s from the picture  i checked every shirt for holes because i did see in some reviews people said they were messed up however none of the shirts were messed up  as far as them shrinking i am not sure i have not washed them yet      
88,3.0,                       i guess i should have gotten a larger size but did not know that they did shrink about a half size  if i reorder i will order xl instead of large  other than that they are great for the price  i did wash in cold water also     
89,4.0,                       i normally wear size large t shirts          lbs   but after reading the reviews i decided to buy xl and wash them in hot water  pre wash  they were just a tad long at the waist  post wash  just about perfect  very comfortable  not too thin so that you can see thru the material  not to thick as to feel heavy   quality  no loose threads  only reason i didn t give them   stars is the company said  pre shrunk  but they did shrink more after washing  with hot water       
90,4.0,                       these shirts are okay quality  can t complain because they are priced well  i wear them all the time around the house  going to the gym  running errands etc  the fit isn t perfect if your skinnier and taller like me but it s good enough  i never dry them and suggest you do not dry them either as they will last much longer and fit better if you don t      
91,5.0,                       the t shirts fit perfectly and had the feel i expected them to have  especially after the first washing   they re sturdy and retain their shape and color after washing   the tagless feature is awesome  although that s pretty standard now across most brands   and the price was extremely good compared to other brands   i ll be buying these again for sure      
92,5.0,                       i got a good batch of    t shirts  few strings hanging  but no holes nothing major  the shirts aren t super soft nor too scratchy  which is good  for ironing out wrinkles   i think theyll shrink on high heat  but if your know how to wash clothes  u shouldnt have too many issues these shirts aren t too thick nor too thin  so u can wear them like a normal top shirt  you won t be able to see much through the shirts  e g   your orangutan nipples etc  unless the shirt becomes wet  or u have some other color  besides white  underneath  i have a fat waist and gut  the xl size fits me perfectly  shirts aren t super wide  but roomy enough whereas they wouldn t be tight around my fatty parts my shirts were    inches long  so u can tuck in or not  if u want less length  just dry for a few mins on high heat to shrink  only flaw might be the sleeve length  only around   or so inches long under the arm  so if u raise your arms too high  your t shirt temporarily turns into a sleeveless shirt   overall  it s a good year round t shirt      
93,5.0,                       excellent t shirts  nd buy  red color does not bleed on first wash in cold water not like other brands  i highly recommend this product i was concern of poor quality  however person wrote that renark was      wrong the quality and texture is excellent  and the price you pay is much less than ad at big box store  my wish mfg add more colors to existing line  i would buy more tshirt      
94,5.0,                       husband loves the thickness of the t shirt  we live in fl and he does not like extra thick t shirts  this is a perfect fit for him  i purchased two more packages of them after he received first pack  he liked them so much  i bought two more packs to replace old t shirts  nice and white and looks great on him      
95,5.0,                       i previously wore calvin klein slim fit shirts  but they apparently changed the style to something a couple inches shorter  and the new ones don t stay tucked in  these are made of thick material  the fit is what i would call semi slim  and they are long enough to stay tucked in better than most shirts  i bought two more packs so i have several years worth  in case they decide to change the style  i ll be covered      
96,1.0,                       i don t typically write reviews but feel compelled as this is a horrible quality product i don t know where they sourced the cotton on this  but it gets worse wash after wash the denier  or density of thread    a unit of measure for the linear mass density of fibers in simple terms level of quality   think     thread count sheets vs       i wouldn t use these t shirts even as rags in my garage as they will scratch what ever i wipe with it the collar materials is even worse   they actually created rub skin tags on my neck   and yes  i use name brand laundry detergent  persil  and fabric softener  downy  on a front load washing machine i decided to try these instead of my go to  kirkland signature  brand  what an unfortunate experiment the kirkland held together for longer than expected  didn t pit  and didn t get holes   the more i washed  the softer they became if you have skin of steel and     bucks to waste   go for it      
97,5.0,                       i am satisfied with most everything i have with the gildan brand  the cotton in these tees is soft and although i haven t washed them yet  i expect that they hold their size well as other gildan products do  remember  cotton will shrink some like it does in all products  the fit is perfect and to size      
98,5.0,                       these shirts are so soft  that s what i wanted i ve been looking for soft black undershirts for over a year  very pleased with this purchase  the shirts are so soft  past purchases from name brands in the past  that were listed as      cotton and branded  comfort soft  were heavy  stiff  and scratchy  these gildan shirts are just what i was looking for  very happy with this purchase and will buy again from this seller and recommend this item  thanks      
99,5.0,                       there are tons of tees out there that are softer     but not lets be honest do you want to pay the       increase for something like that   these are not the softest but they are soft   they are also comfortable and fit just as expected  but what would you expect from one of the major suppliers of basic tee that we use for customized tee shirts   it looses a bit of it s new look luster after the first wash but maintains that first wash looks going forward   i have washed one at least   time since i have had this batch and it still looks good  is comfortable  and fits properly      
100,5.0,                       im a short slender dude that likes a baggier fit especially around the chest and these are perfect for work  not too thin or too thick and hold up well in the wash  i havnt experienced any bad wrinkling or shrinkage and no holes tears stains or anything so far  would reccomend especially if you need stuff for a uniform that youre moving around a lot in   i work at a grocery store for refrence      
101,3.0,                       the shirts are comfortable  but the quality control is bad   one of the shirts had a little white sticker with a red arrow that pointed to a hole in the shirt  clearly the qc department marked that as a defective shirt  but it was still included in the package even though it was marked as defective a couple weeks ago i had bought a pack of the same gildan shirts at target and one of the shirts had a    diameter hole in it  so apparently this is an ongoing problem with quality control      
102,5.0,                       i absolutely hate undershirts that fit and then after a few washes shrink up so bad that they won t stay tucked in  these come very long but shrink up true to size after a few washes  the material is also lighter weight which i prefer  will buy again      
103,5.0,                       gildan men s crew t shirts are very comfortable very well made and i would highly recommend them i wear a lot of white shirts and comfort bility and the style and fabric of the shirt is very important to me i  used to always  hans but they ve got to be very expensive and i don t mind the price but the quality has also been reduced but gildan men s crew t shirts  suppress my expectations and if i could give them a    star i would i would highly recommend     
104,5.0,                       if it were up to my sons  they would wear the same shirt for days on end  they proved this to us during the long pandemic where they wore the same shirts for weeks at a time  they have poor hygiene habits and regular bathing is optional in their opinions   we purchased these shirts so they might change into them since they were more like undershirts   they complied and wear these regularly  however still dealing with poor hygiene issues      
105,5.0,                       for some reason  i can only wear and wash white t shirts a small number of times or so before they are noticeably yellowed   it s probably a combo of my sweat and the very hard water here   bleaching doesn t help much  so for me  white undershirts are somewhat disposable  i wear them until i retire them to dirty work or rag duty  these are a perfect cross of price and quality for my needs  as for fabric weight  i d say it s medium light      
106,5.0,                       i ve bought gildan s underwear  their colored t s and these white t s they are fine products at a very good price  my only issue with the t s is they shrink in length about     and overall about      but that s not an issue  the length is still long enough to tuck in or wear outside  all the materials of the various products are a couple of notches above the mass produced products  i will buy more as the need rises      
107,5.0,                       i gotta tell ya  these shirts are great   i was leary but they are great shirts   i bought them to sleep in   the reviews said they were soft  which they are  but many said the quality wasn t very good   the five that were sent to me were perfect i will say though that i saw a few reviews saying that they shrink a little   recommended ordering a size larger  which i did    i m a large   i ordered xl s   after   or   washes  i m happy to say that the reviews were correct   they now fit me perfectly highly recommend these tee shirts  just go up a size      
108,2.0,                       i have never batted an eye at paying a higher price for the quality of gilden t shirts  but it seems that quality is no longer what i had appreciated   my latest package of gilden  x t shirts were thin  tight and not as comfortable   this product is now mediocre at best      
109,4.0,                       just bought for the     time  going back   years  quality has not changed        cotton  except for gray heather            more heavy than other name brands  seams well done  especially shoulders  i m still using the tee s i bought   years ago  no holes  haven t gotten thread bare  i m just too lazy to do laundry sometimes in the past few years  hanes and fruit of the loom have gotten thinner and moved away from      cotton   breathable  seems to be their excuse to make their tee s thinner using less material and not use      cotton  gildan tee s are just better in every way      
110,3.0,                       it s much thinner than past gian t shirts i ve had  i didn t see  lightweight  anywhere  perhaps i missed it  but these are definitely not medium weight or above lots of long loose threads on   of the shirts makes them feel like not a lot of care or quality control was put into the manufacturing if you can manage your expectations as such  you ll be fine they are cheap shirts  functional  remember that  so expect that s what you ll get      
111,5.0,                       great fitting shirts   i ordered a size larger  xxl  because of past experiences with tshirts being too short from different brands on amazon   i washed these in cool water first washing and dried them  i know  on the low setting in my dryer   very little shrinkage in the length   sleeves could be a tad longer fit me  but hey  they re tshirts to wear around the house   very pleased and will buy again      
112,2.0,                       the description clearly says some colors are      cotton and others are     cotton and     poly and the tags say differently  more like     cotton     poly  not a good fit compared to other brands and not comfortable  i have bought the straight white ones in the past and they are fine      
113,4.0,                       they are well made but the cloth is thinner than i am use to  will see how the hold up under laundering   really hard to give a truthful evaluation when they have not been tested under normal use      
114,5.0,                       i m going to be completely honest  i was extremely hesitant to make this purchase because on the reviews people were receiving red in their pack which wasn t the the color on the advertisement  despite my better judgement i ordered and figured if it was wrong i could send them back for a refund  to my pleasant surprise  they came exactly as pictured and they re really nice  thick quality at a great price  my son is extremely picky and will only wear shirts that fit loosely but not baggy and are not bright colors  hence the reason i bought these  and he loves them  they are true to size as well  i washed then and he put one on immediately after the dryer was done so i d say he s a happy customer as am i  i definitely recommend        
115,2.0,                       i washed one time with cold water  tide  and normal wash  dried on extra low heat  i dry everything on extra low   i ordered like    of them and they all shrunk horizontally so bad  probably     inches  that they would not stay tucked and i was uncomfortable in them  i had to return them  weird thing was they didn t shrink vertically  they just lost too much heighth so it s not like buying two sizes too big and letting them shrink would even be feasible      
116,2.0,                       i bought these because they looked like a good deal  i usually buy a different brand  but they increase in price and added their name on the front of the shirts  so i bought these  while the fit was ok  they don t have a good feel on the skin and i probably won t wear them much  if amazon keeps pushing such lousy products  i m going to have to go back to shopping at department stores for everything      
117,3.0,                       ordered a large size  i am     pounds positives   the cloth is cotton and therefore  quite comfortable  price  no color loss when washednegatives   it came out too big for me  though i personally like slightly loose fit  this didn t  fit  well  sleeve size is too small  it made me uncomfortable  it just didn t  look  new after the first wash  had this faded lookdecided not to return it  but not using it either  will look for a different brand     
118,5.0,                       just like the title says  for the money  these are a great bang for your buck  i m sure amazon wasn t happy with me buying and returning a bunch of shirts but after   or so returns i ve concluded these aren t just perfect  these are probably some of the best undershirts i ve purchased in my lifetime they re not too thin see through  especially compared to similar shirts on the market  eg  hanes fruit of the loom   the neck opening is just right  not wide and droopy  and the overall look and feel is very quality for the price  they re obviously not good standalone tshirts but i d say they re very good undershirts  especially for       a piece      
119,5.0,                       walmart quit carrying the gildan crew neck shirts so i had to resort to buying them on line  gildan as always been my favorite as the sleeves are a perfect fit  not too long or short  and they aren t overly thin see through like other brands    gildan has been perfect  although the one s i ordered online were longer  body of the shirt  than typical  more like the length of an actual t shirt  if not longer  rather than an undershirt  but i can t complain  they are great to wear around the house  doing yard work  painting  work out in  etc and priced to where you can just throw them away when they get stained      
120,5.0,                       i am a woman and wear these as a work shirt  i like that they are cheap and i can bleach them if i get very gross or am dealing with a sick animal  then when they are totally ruined they make great rags  i am      with a pretty big chest and they aren t too tight at all  i like the cotton fabric too  it doesn t stretch out too much      
121,5.0,                       i can t believe how much i like these shirts   i retire a couple years ago and because i m less active i packed on some pounds   i noticed when i wore my normal shirts my belly would stick out the bottom a little  very embarrassing    i bought these and   other brands but these won out   they are much longer than the others   i actually bought another pack of  these   i haven t given up on losing weight  but these are a great temporary solution until i do      
122,1.0,                       who can rate comfort  softness  and moisture wicking when this t shirt shrinks one size in a gentle  cold water washer and a dryer set at delicate cool  on first inspection  they appeared small and were tight fitting  after being laundered  way too small to fit  nice theory  poor practice      
123,5.0,                       for less than three dollars per shirt it might even be cost effective to use them as spill mops  the quality and colors are much better than i expected  great for wearing under my quarter zips for an extra layer  the poor reviews on these shirts begs the question  what do you want for nothing i will re post if they dissolve after washing      
124,2.0,                       finally a long crew shirt tht fits great  great price and will be buying more in different colors  i recommend this item to anyone that wants a long crew shirt  thanks  joe harris well i thought i liked them but after washing them  in cold water  the length shrunk about   inches  you won t be happy if you purchase this item  i m not      
125,5.0,                       these t shirts are longer than any i ve worn from other manufacturers   they are at the least    longer and remain long after washing   my only suggestion is that they produce their boxer briefs using the same colors   greys don t match  reds don t either   the only ones that match are in black   i also would like additional colors  blue  green   if you are purchasing their boxer briefs  as well  note that they are just the opposite   they are extremely short from the crotch to the waistband      
126,5.0,                       i was looking for a shirt to be my base layer for a martial arts uniform  this shirt is just the right length to stay tucked in through twists and flips without giving my partner an eye full  it s also very comfortable and feels good on the shoulders with no seams to chafe      
127,5.0,                       i am          pound  stocky  male  i usually buy xl because i like shirts to be a little loose on me for comfort  these shirts do the trick just fine  i needed some new work shirts and these are perfect for a    hour shift  they are comfy and loose and not too tight around the arms for them to slide up  i work in a factory so walking around and moving is constant and these absorb sweat well  perfect for the price in my opinion  they are also not too loose to the point where they look very baggy  at least for someone with my body type      
128,4.0,                       i am         lbs  the medium fits me very well  maybe just a tad looser than i wanted  but      here s my issue these are no different than the shirts i ve always bought  they re not long enough for my lanky build  one of the pictures led me to believe that these had a little extra length than normal t shirts    it s my fault for not checking the size chart i can t stick these in the dryer if i want them to suit my length  hang out in the sun to dry only  they re borderline long enough when i got them  one machine dry and that s over with the shoulder sleeve chest area is actually very flattering to my physique  if you have even just normal active guy muscle  these will make you  pop   the sleeves come down to a little less than half bicep coverage the shirts are well worth the money  and they re true to size  i could have sized up when ordering just to get my length  but the shirt would have been baggy  i hate being tall and skinny sometimes order your normal size  you won t be disappointed      
129,4.0,                       got these for my teenager who wears a  xl at old navy  aeropostale  american eagle and other brand name clothing stores  but the  xl in these tshirts are much larger than we are used to in brand name clothing  we are going to wash them in hot water and dry them to get them to shrink up a bit  other than that they are great  good quality and excellent pricing  and we would always prefer a bit too big than to small

131,1.0,                       bought   size large  xl  planning on some minimal shrinkage on washing   tried them on before laundering  black were noticeably longer than gray  but all were ok   washed once in cold water  dried permanent press low heat setting   all shirts were at least    shorter after laundering  and no longer are wearable for me   missed return window  but won t be ordering this product again  unless it s in a tall size  which isn t offered on amazon    too bad  as they re a great weight to wear under a sweater this time of year      
132,3.0,                       it is weird  kinda fits at some point but not below chest level  but my main complaint it when you raise yours arms whole chest area has to come with you  not flexible  not well design  the underarms cut be deep cut and be independent from the whole t shirt  i will be using it actively in my work and already thinking the problems  started to bother me from the first moments i tried price is quite reasonable and material quality is nice  i would like to thank for that  probably it is american cut for big bellies   if you have elegant european sporty body definitely don t recommend  if you have a chunky  belly then it is going to be good fit  and arms should be definitely corrected  did pattern maker of this t shirt ever tried it after it is sewn       
133,1.0,                       ordered these t shirts for winter  they arrived on time  great  top marks for that  but  i put one on out of the packet  not so good  i itched all afternoon   evening until i took the damn thing off ok  could be a stupid move on my part to wear something straight out of the pack    washed t shirts as we normally do here  no changes in any laundry products  dried on low  some shrinkage not much  used fabric softener and still itchy as all hell put thru on another wash   dry cycle a few days later  put on the t shirt and still itched all darn day  tested by wearing one of my ratty old calvin t shirts  no itch  no problem  there is definitely something wrong with my batch of t shirts  sending them back  watch out you may just end up with some of these t shirts  not worth the low price or the high aggravation  see these   move on to the next one         
134,4.0,                       these are some nice quality shirts  they feel nice and soft  and the size that i picked out fit pretty close to how i suspected it would  even if it s a bit looser than i thought  but that s no problem  i d rather have something be a little bigger than too small  the only sort of problem i ve seen is they re a little on the opaque side  the fabric is pretty thin  still not a bad purchase though      
135,3.0,                       i ordered these specifically because it says pre shrunk and while i m not new to the cotton game i took the chance  i m     and thin so i don t need the width of a large but the length is necessary  i washed these right away and tried them on after a tumble dry on low to find these are almost belly shirts now super wide and barely down to my belt line   perfection      
136,1.0,                       i apologize for my previous recommendation  this was made without consideration for use of the product over time  as soft as the shirts are  many developed large holes inside of   months of use  they are now used for polishing clothes for my cars  by contrast my much more expensive jockeys have lasts for years  my take is the cotton is not wound nearly as tight as the jockeys used jockey all my life  but they are expensive  this pack was a bargain for sure  but  they run a little small  mainly because of my excessive paunch    will stick with the product but will order xxl instead of xl next time      
137,5.0,                       i like to wear all black at all times  that can be challenging during the summer months because as we all know  black attracts heat  that s where these t shirts come in handy  they re a dark shade of black and they re the perfect thickness and size too  the shirts are thin enough to keep you cool and thick enough to not dissolve into dust when the wind blows on you  it s the perfect black t shirt for those of you who like to wear all black any time of the year  why should hot weather stop you from wearing a black tee  these shirts are perfect for the summer and the sun can t do anything about that  they re also sold at an amazing price too  stop reading my review and buy the damn black tee shirts already      
138,5.0,                       nice shirts  not very thick  but not cheaply made   i got one size larger than normal for a good fit  after wash and dry    very happy with this purchase      
139,5.0,                       i purchased the fruit of the loom stay tucked shirts   junk  i tried the gildan and they are perfect  the quality  sizing  and fit is outstanding  the sizing of the shirts is consistent  while the fotloom shirts were dramatically different in sizing  highly recommended gildan      
140,5.0,                       i usually purchase hanes for my husband  but he goes through white shirts like water since  he manages to get stains everywhere  i believe he thinks they  nd as a napkin   im the miracle stain remover   so using bleach   soaking in stain removers all white tee s start to wear down  get tiny holes  and the collar starts fraying  figured i d give these a shot for the price and we both love them  i ve washed many many times and so far so good  yes  they do shrink a little after the first wash but i expected that  much better quality than i was expecting   a great value    remember this is an undershirt  they re supposed to be a bit thinner  if you re looking for a thicker   longer white shirt kirkland s pack of white t s are super thick  durable   longer in length which is great for wearing alone but my husband found them to be too thick for himself in the summer or underneath his work shirts  if you re looking for an undershirt this pack of gildan s are perfect  i ve purchased these a few times now and prefer them over hanes for the price  they ve held up much better after being washed with bleach many many times compared to others i ve washed the same  i don t mind throwing a few out that i can t remove the stains from  you can t expect a luxurious cotton shirt at this price but you can buy   higher end white t for a little more than the entire pack of   here  if you have higher expections for white undershirts at this price  highly recommend for undershirts or those who go through white shirts like we do  size up if you re tall or need extra room  they shrink a little after the first wash dry but so did the hanes i always used to buy      
141,5.0,                       perfect for my old resturaunt gig  bought them so cheap and had a standard shirt to wear every night  they aren t fashion shirts that are tight and perfectly soft but they cover my back and they re not ripping at the seams  get what you pay for  i m wearing one now after   months and no fading  they shrink a little  good value  i prefer gildan to any other mass production garment company      
142,5.0,                       why are you reading the reviews  it s a t shirt  it s just a buncha white t shirts  if they were bad quality  they would have a lower rating  it seems pointless to even read a review  let alone write one  if you need a white t shirt or five  buy this  if you don t  then don t do it  also  men only as the name of the product suggests  sorry ladies      
143,3.0,                       when the shirts arrived  i took one out to try it on and it fit perfect   but once i washed them  they went from a  xl to an about a  xl   they now fit like a muscle shirt  i wash all my clothes in cold water and hang dry them so no hot water or dryer to shrink them   these are nothing like the     oz  heavy cotton adult t shirt gildan made   i ordered those   years ago and  the ones i haven t stained or ripped  are still going strong and haven t shrunk or stretched a bit      
144,2.0,                       i bought these to wear as an undershirt for button down dress  shirts  unwashed  they fit perfectly  after one cold wash  and a dryer cycle set to low temperature  what was a nice length had shrunk considerably  making them unwearble  or more accurately  untuckable this is really unfortunate  since the material and  craftsmanship seemed quite decent  particularly considering the price gildan  add three inches of fabric to the length of the shirt and they ll be  a winner      
145,5.0,                       gildan shirts are great  cost effective solutions for undershirts  my primary wear   they feel fantastic but what s even better is how they snug your arms after a wash  the fit is better than most any other shirt i ve worn  i own     packs of white and black for    total  great for a minimalistic wardrobe  comfortable to workout in  easy to wash if you re buying these and are worried if the all white shirts are transparent and might reveal your nipples  the shirts do not reveal through and are great to wear alone      
146,5.0,                       shirts seem fine and a great price for   t shirts  they are     cotton and will shrink a bit after  st wash  let s face it  measurements are not equal when it comes to clothing  so i ordered the large size  it fit fine but definitely felt more snug than other large size shirts i have ordered  after  st wash the t shirt is far to snug  so really not wearable anymore  so i would recommend getting the next size up  this what i am doing      
147,5.0,                       i like these t shirts because they re slightly thicker than your average t  but great work or casual shirts after about   washes you can start to see the color fade  but to me that s where it s great for the price      
148,4.0,                       really no complaints with the product  other than the ad on amazon does not convey what was delivered   the colors that i thought i ordered  and as are still depicted for the order in my account  are not what was delivered   i m not returning them  because the colors are ok  except for the two red shirts per package  which i ll still wear  i wanted the package depicted with black  grey and white shirts  the other issue is that it took a relatively looonng time to get here   this might have been due to weather in the east at the time of my order and initial shipment  but it seemed unusual  particularly since other items ordered through amazon while waiting arrived sooner   granted  the items are different than the clothing here  although my wife ordered several articles of clothing after i ordered these  and all three packages arrived within the expected prime timeframe   but  overall  the quality is good  the price is great      
149,4.0,                       tl dr   buy a pack of these shirts  good quality  great valuei am pleasantly surprised by the fit of these shirts  they are thicker heavier weight fabric than i expected   it feels like a substantial undershirt  even after a couple of washes   the fabric is comfortably woven and properly soft i used to be a big fan of stafford brand heavy weight t s for their fabric quality and fit   i am just shy of    even and wear a    long or    regular jacket depending on actual cut   seriously  though  how can there be so much variation when the size is literally in measured lengths rather than s  m  l  etc     but lately  with j c penney declines  i ve been trying other brands  hanes   fruit of the loom are readily available  but the shirts are shorter and much thinner lighter weight fabric these shirts are long   well below my belt  not too long  matching the length of most of my oxford button down shirts and better quality polos   i don t feel like they ll come out of my waistband and bunch in an unsightly lump under my tucked in shirt   the sleeves are a good length   long enough they don t wad up in my armpits by midday and short enough to not stick out when worn under another short sleeved shirt i was a little skeptical about these because of the excellent price point   i have had graphic t s  from local shops  that were on gildan product  and been pleased with the quality   but i thought these might be something different   my doubts have been assuaged   the neck and hem are holding up well after a couple of wearings   the neck holds up remarkably well at the end of the day  especially when compared to other brands i have been wearing recently finally  overall i think the fit is excellent  probably what an  l  should have been all along   i m right on the line between m   l sizing and so getting a good fit is sometimes tricky   almost always the m is too small  short    tight in chest and often an l in the same brand style just feels too big   over the past few years  l s have been getting smaller  no  not because i m getting bigger  especially in body length   but these shirts are just right  for me    if i lose    lbs  they might be a little loose in the waist  so if you re the athletic type keep that in mind  one thought on price   do the math  and i don t think you ll find many offers to compete  i get these for like two sixty each and that wasn t even a  deal  price   that makes these not only a good shirt  but a good value      
150,5.0,                       i have   different type of t shirts now  the hanes are like belly shirts on my average height frame and are the thinest and worst of the bunch   i have three different type of gildan  one long but thin material  one thick but mid length and this one which has the same product number and thickness as the mid length gildans  but is long and stays tucked in   these are my new favorites of all of them   when i first got them i could not believe how big they were  but they shrunk considerably in the wash   i am glad because they would be too big if they didn t      
151,5.0,                       i needed some plain tee s to wear with scrub pants at work and these are perfect  they are comfy and durable  i am a     female around     pounds and typically a size    i ordered a medium anticipating them shrinking a little in the dryer  they did  and for a little bit of a looser fit  definitely recommend     
152,5.0,                       lovely cotton quality  and the range of sober colors i wanted  i needed home shirts i can wear or sleep in comfily and the cotton fabric of these are really good  very soft and fits exactly as expected  no tag hassle as the info is printed directly on the inside back of the shirt  washed one already without any trouble  i usually go for known brands like hanes or such but i gave this one a try and was pleasantly surprised  a totally recommended bundle especially at this low price      
153,5.0,                       i was expecting this shirt to be nice and tight since it s a small and i order for something more form fitting  but the shirts hang a bit loose around the chest by an inch or two and the sleeves about an inch as well  otherwise  it s a great pack for that price anyway      
154,5.0,                       my husband goes through shirts left and right  mainly because he works in every shirt i buy him regardless of how many times i tell him that are not for work  he s a mechanic and the uniforms they wear are scratchy so he always wears undershirts  these are great especially in summer since they aren t as thick as some t shirts  he likes to wear them as every day t shirts to and not just layered  he is typically a large but we always order a size up because after a few washes and dries they shrink a little and he likes to keep the legnth on them  as reference he likes his clothes loose but not baggy  larges fit but he prefers xl and they fit as expected either way  i will be buying these again      
155,5.0,                       the shirt is for people with a       inch chest and i am at about    inches yet the shirt still hangs a bit loose on me by a few inches around the chest and a bit about the arms  otherthan that  still a great relatively form fitting shirt and for that price it was a no brainer      
156,3.0,                       i was excited about the seemingly good quality of these for the price  but upon reciept  after i had already used   of them  found that the third one had a hole in the front  there was no piercing through the package  so it must have been a manufacturing defect  i was a bit disappointed because it was one of the black ones which i already had a plan for using  and now that i have already heat pressed on two of them  i cannot return them and get replacements      
157,1.0,                                  lbs   size  mediumi don t think i ve ever hated a shirt more in my life  i don t think i ve ever hated any shirt before  actually   but these shirt are exceptionally garbage  i put one on right out of the package  it was too big       cotton  it ll shrink  lit washed and dried them all  and i m writing this after wearing each of them once  overall  i am like   angry at these shirts  i mean it  these shirts suck so bad that i just want to kick something small and defenseless to let off some steam  every single collar shrunk and is too tight  but the back still manages to hang down uncomfortably far  and i have a decently thin neck  i think it s like    inches  iirc  i ve never worn a medium and thought the collar was too tight  every medium i ve ever bought has fit me  some better than others  sure  but this is my first time ever writing a passionate review about shirts  anyway  the sleeves poke straight out like little goblin ears  right at the bottom of your shoulder muscle  and speaking of shoulders  the top of the sleeve  where the seams meet up   that s like       away from where it should be  and lastly  i hate gildan so much for forcing me to write such a long review  i m busy  i don t wanna be doing this  but you forced my hand gildan  you son of a bitch  you made such a terrible shirt that i felt forced to make time to let you know that i hate you and everyone else who was involved in the process of making these shirts   the bottom seam flips up    our of   shirts  i could not make that bottom seam lay flat for more than    seconds love jonp s  gildan  the fact that you thought i might enjoy any aspect of any of these shirts is offensive to me  and i consider it significantly disrespectful that you thought my standards were so low  i will fight you in a parking lot just to preserve my honor  also  i m not even going to donate these to goodwill  poor people are honestly just better off naked      
158,2.0,                       quality wise these shirts are hit and miss  some with rolled collars    shirts with holes straight out of the package  almost makes me believe these are a cheap reproduction  for me these shirts are just going under my turnouts so they ll do the job  i would absolutely not wear one of these shirts solo  odd cut and sleeve lengths that are inconsistent between shirts      
159,5.0,                       so first  these are not hanes or fruit of the loom   these are quality shirts that i ve been very surprised by over the past few months   they are my best white tees  and i have a whole lot  with different brands   i d definitely buy them again   they re the perfect length for under my button downs at work or atop blue jeans on the weekend   they re nice n  thick and stay that way after repeated washings   and perhaps best of all  i ve never had one of the collars roll on me like i ve had hanes or fruit of the loom do   good  quality merch   buy with confidence        
160,1.0,                       after a few months of owning these   they have stretched out to the point they look and fit like an xxl   and i ordered mediums   they are not slim cut at all  wearing a sail would be more for form fitting   don t buy   listen to all the recent reviews   i m severely disappointed      
161,5.0,                       we print up quite a few white t shirts each year for family events using joleen iron on transfers   we have tried using other brands of white t shirts but have found that the gilden shirts take the transfers better and tend to retain the transfer for  longer time   we have gilden shirts still in good shape after   years and normal washings   same can t be said of other major brands sourced at big box stores   we had a disaster with some no name bulk shirts sold from some on line outlet for less   don t go that route unprinted leftovers have also served well as a normal undershirt   i don t know the exact fabric composition but whatever it is  it takes iron ons well and wears pretty good too      
162,5.0,                       purchased these for my son since he seems to be out growing his clothes  im not sure if its because he is growing for because he has been couped up due to the pandemic  either way he says they fit just right and he likes how the fabric feels compared to his other shirts  they have not shrunk much that we can tell after the first couple washes  overall for the price i would definitely recommend these      
163,5.0,                       undershirts are undershirts   they re not made to look cool  but to prevent your good shirts from getting dirty   as such they re okay one thing i wish was different about these shirts  was that the neck on them was wider than a normal shirt  and the sleves slightly shorter than a normal shirt  so that you wouldn t be able to see a bit of the white undershirt when i wear other shirts   aside from that  these are okay      
164,2.0,                       not sure why  but the shirts were sent just stuffed in a mailer   no way to know if they were new  not previously worn  etc  as there was no packaging   for all i know  they could have picked them up at goodwill and sent them to me   i will run them through the wash and probably keep them as they weren t that expensive  but i won t buy again      
165,5.0,                       perfect fit for an avid t shirt user  great material so they can be worn daily and doesn t look like you just got out of bed  i really like how they feel and the fact that they re tagless make them even more comfortable fit at chest perfectly  length is a little bit below the belt so there s no issue showing your belly when raising your arms and that s a huge plus for those of us who aren t fit      
166,5.0,                       pretty good shirt  i stained it by accident on my second day but that s on me  really nice shirt and the go to for the world s greatest white t shirt connoisseur  critical      
167,5.0,                       this is my second set of these   great product   great price   wash well  do not over shrink  and have worn very well  even when wearing as just a tee shirt rather than an undershirt as with all white shirts around your collor  they are subjuct to staining  depending on your skin type   oilly italian here  so i just use a mixture of dawn  hydrogen peroxide and backing powder  found on pintrest      put on any yellowed areas with an old toothbrush   scrub it in some    try to let sit for at least an hour  or preferably over night  and then just wash as normal with other whites  hot water     ps  have a high efficency front loading washer  where you can not use liquid bleach  or the rubber seals will begin to prematurely fail   i find  borax  or  arm hammer baking powder laundry booster  works great as a substitute   to like to use the extra rinse cycle when using these harsher chemicals      
168,1.0,                       okay let me start by saying the tshirts feel nice and fit the body well  my biggest complaint is the sleeves  they are missing about   inches in length  looks ridiculous so now they are for bed  i say if your looking for a casual tshirt to wear with jeans or chinos    do not buy these shirts  save your money or spend a little more and buy good shirts such as calvin klein or tommy  but you can t compare this brand to those so again   if these are for leisure around the house or bed then they may be for you  in my opinion not for jeans and tshirt day  again this only my opinion and these may be a great fit look for some  but not for me      
169,5.0,                       i could care less if there a cheaper brand  there as good if not better than the nationally known more expensive brands we all know  these tshirts are great  they re thick  well made  in fact i was so impressed i bought a  nd package  i haven t ever had anyone come up to me to check the the name of my tshirt  i used to work in manhattan  where it ran the gambit of people  very pleased      
170,4.0,                         star only because they are not made of egyptian cotton  or the closest in quality  pema cotton  of course  egyptian cotton would have quadruple the price  but would have also given them   star rating the feel is definitely smooth first time use  but once washed  that will change  that is the difference between egyptian cotton and the rest of the world s cotton  i have purchased t shirts while on a trip to egypt  i have had them for   years now  and they are still as soft as the day i bought them from stia in a cairo suburban mall  they were ridiculously cheap  and will probably last another ten years  had i known  i would have purchased the entire stock at the time these shirts are perfect fit  made in honduras  one will not expect them to last more than a year  but they are inexpensive and replacing them should not bankrupt me  i bought two dozen this time just because amazon had them on sale      
171,1.0,                       the description of the colors are wrong  originally ordered two red  one black  one grey and one blue  received two black  two light gray and one dark gray  very disappointed  i wanted this set specifically because my boyfriend looks amazing in red and blue  he s  my very own superman      
172,4.0,                       i really like gildan t shirts  they hold up well and are not overly thin  i am a woman and i like the large  size shirts to wear with my jeans  but when these arrived  they were more like an extra large size   i will probably just wear these shirts around the house with leggings   i feel that it is hard to beat this quality and price      
173,4.0,                       i wear an xl bit often the xl is not big enough after washing drying  but sometimes it is  i got these in xxl   they were too big but after i washed and dried them they fit better  but still they look clunky but are good for working in  i dig graves so i am not concerned with fashion for the money these are a good deal for work clothes but go with calvin klein for tee shirts with a  better looking cut      
174,2.0,                       would have rated higher but the colors in the picture are not what i received  as you can see    black  one gray    light gray  what i received was   red    blue    black and   orange  shipping was fast but am very disappointed in colors  i wanted what was pictured  not what was sent  if ordering  make sure you get what you want before ordering      
175,4.0,                       so this shirt was amazing i love the length the feel  it s really comfortable  until i washed and dried two of the shirt and they shrunk a whole lot  that s the only reason why i gave it such low stars because everything else is perfect and maybe i just dried those two shirts with too much heat  i definitely won t be doing the rest like that     
176,5.0,                       was a hanes wearer for years then their product changed  they shrunk too much  loved fruit of the loom tall  they were my go to  until i ordered these  these are perfect   have not had an issue with shrinking  these are great      
177,5.0,                       this pack of shirts beats spending massive amounts for the department store undershirts  i mean they re undershirts for pete s sake  why are stores charging     for their comfort fit  ultra soft  relaxed wear  casual marketing wank  i just needed a pack of undershirts  i was surprised by the band for your buck on this deal  i expected something that felt like those rags you buy at the hardware store  but these shirts feel great  the fit is good too  i could complain that they are a bit loose around the waist for a medium  but maybe that s just the american style        
178,2.0,                       these shirts are boxy looking on me   i m     with an average build and i love wearing slim fit black shirts because they look great on my body   these shirts are not slim fit  they re very loose around the waste and arms and are a bit too wide in the shoulders  they don t give that aesthetically pleasing  slim  look at all   i ll use them for layering this winter and as yard work shirts in the summer but won t be puchasing anymore      
179,5.0,                       i got these shirts in several sizes to put on iron on designs for a fundraising run  they were very suitable  the iron on for dark fabrics went on without a hitch  i ran into trouble with a kid s shirt  not this brand  that had polyester in it  and the decal got too hot and turned brown  with these      cotton ones i had no problem whatsoever      
180,2.0,                       material is ok for a work shirt but they are a sloppy fitting shirt  sleeves are very short and too big in the stomach area but they are long enough            lbs and i wear an xl in shirts but these don t fit well     
181,1.0,                       i found the sleeve cuff stitching to be very scratchy and irritated the areas around by biceps  collar was fairly rough as well you re definitely buying cheapest on the market with this product  but keep in mind it s at the cost of any reminiscence of comfort i bought a shirt from two other fairly cheaper brands  about    a shirt  and they were much more comfortable  if you can afford that  get one or two of those other brands instead      
182,5.0,                       the quality seems really good  especially at that price  or for that matter  any price  but like a lot of previous reviewers have stated  it shows   dark gray   light gray and   black m and i received two reds in the   pack  o well    i will still wear them      
183,5.0,                       normally i believe that you get what you paid for  but in this case i got   t shirts for only     so i wasn t expecting much  i wear t shirts as undershirts and for working in the yard so i am not looking for something pretty  at      and     lbs  i normally wear a large tall  but when no tall option is offered an extra large usually works if it shrinks a little when washed  that is what happened with these and they fit perfectly now  i was afraid these t shirts would be  seconds  or defective in some way at that price  about       apiece  but so far have found no flaws and they are not thin or cheap looking as some reviews claimed  i am usually skeptical of great reviews on amazon and rarely give   stars to any product  but for the price  these are great      
184,2.0,                       i am      about      i ordered these shirts because of the price  i wear a large to xl normally  i got them and they fit good but the more i wash them the smaller they get  after   washings they don t fit at all  way to short to be tucked in and real snug  if you buy them  soon after you will be using them to clean and dust with or be giving them to the    yr old kid across the street  be warned don t save money by purchasing these     
185,2.0,                       i like the weight of the t shirt  however i was disappointed with the amount of shrinkage  after wash and dry they are closer to a small size  i find that i have to phuysically stretch the chest and arm holes to get a  somewhat  comfortable fit  but still too small  i purchased two of the   packs and unfortunately washed them all before drying so no opportunity for return      
186,1.0,                       got the shirts because i make custom shirts and pulled it out and undid the tap   noticed one has a hole in the sleeve     
187,4.0,                       their sizing chart is pretty accurate if you pay attention to it   if you don t want to measure  then i d say buy one size smaller than you would either of the two major american brands  hanes fruit of the loom  as these seem to be larger by named size   i usually where a men s medium in those brands but this medium is bigger so i ll order a small when ordering next time   but i wear them as undershirts so i like them a little snugger      
188,4.0,                       these gildan t shirts are a good basic layering shirt for under an oxford or a sweater  the fit is spot on and matches my higher priced calvin klein undershirts  i m          pounds and large is just right   the quality is not quite as good as my cks    the fabric is not quite as soft and construction looks cheaper  but for the price they serve their purpose  also  after one wash there is a bit of shrinkage in the sleeve length and overall length  and there was a minor amount of pilling to the fabric  the length after wash is about the same as the ck and i think they would stay tucked to a pair of chinos just fine   overall  a good undershirt that meets the need for a fraction of higher priced alternatives      
189,5.0,                       buying shirts online frankly scares me  i am a bigger guy and sometimes   well these shirts just don t work  however these were by far the best i have bought in ahwile  they are true to size so feel confident in buying the size you normally do      
190,5.0,                       i like them so much i have bought   packs of     about the thickness of a drifit only it s a soft cotton   i like to layer wearing two shirts when running or as it gets cooler   they are so soft they layer well   i think colors are rich for cotton tees also   best value i ve ever seen on clothing   like the hoodies too      
191,5.0,                       the price was so cheap  it feels like i robbed the bank and got away with it   these shirts are quite nice and feel every bit as good as anything you d buy at the store   nice color combo  the charcoal gray color was unexpectedly cool    i washed them on cool and dried them on low and didn t have any noticeable shrinking compared to a brand new shirt that had not yet been worn   i did this just to ensure an accurate way to measure for shrinkage   great shirts   i m going to buy at least another round of them   at this price  you d be nuts not to stock up   going to get some white ones  too      
192,5.0,                       i ordered the all black pack of xl shirts  i usually get xl anyway and when sizes run small a  xl  these fit perfectly  they re not too hot at all and not too thin either  i can tell you  if you work in warehouse or construction and usually get a lot of holes in your clothes  these won t last long but you gotta remember these are cheap shirts and usually meant to be an undershirt    also  i have been working warehouse and roofing and i prefer these so i don t get as hot as i do in more durable clothes  i don t mind spending a few bucks every     months for new shirts      
193,2.0,                       this is not an undershirt as they are way too short  i am only      and these don t stay tucked at all  the arm holes fit better than jerzees and fruit of the loom  these are nowhere near as soft as the hanes  but are cheaper and thicker which is good for colder weather  i m considering cutting one up to sew pieces on the bottoms of others to make them longer and stay tucked      
194,2.0,                       if this is heavyweight  then i don t know what that means anymore  both sleeves and tail are short to begin with  even shorter after first wash  will probably be okay under a shirt or sweater  unsuitable for wearing alone  mine were in perfect shape  no loose threads  etc   but i wouldn t buy them again due to the shrinkage and the sleeves were too short before washing  well  they were inexpensive           
195,1.0,                       so  i ordered these shirts  it is not possible to return them  at least not in the normal sense   they were sent via fed ex  i realized i ordered the wrong size and immediately tried to cancel the order  i ve been waiting on an  email  from  fantastical group  that will theoretically allow me to get my     back i am zero happy      
196,5.0,                       these shirts seem to be nice quality and well made  especially for the price  they re longer than other ones  at least i find them to be  which is what i wanted because the other ones couldn t even be tucked in they were so short  i would recommend these if you need good undershirts and need them longer than what you seem to find in the store      
197,1.0,                       i bought these shirts because it is a brand we have been buying and love  but unlike all of our other gildan shirts  these shrunk and took lint in the dryer and feel thin and cheap  i was expecting the same quality we had before from gildan of the strong long lasting cotton  and these shirts felt like dollar store quality      
198,5.0,                       i like to wear men s undershirts for working out and everything in between because it s hassle free  i usually go for hanes  but i m glad a gave these a try  they are so soft  way better quality than i expected  as far as fit  they seem to be a bit more roomy than hanes  but nothing too noticeable  the sleeves are a little longer  but they are also longer in general which is nice to stay tucked  there wasn t any shrinkage in the wash either  bottom line  i m pleasantly surprised by the quality of these shirts  they are crazy soft and my new favorite      
199,5.0,                       i am a woman        and normally wear a women s size small  i was looking for some comfortable sleep shirts  and since they re only offered in single or two packs for twice as much money  i decided to try these instead  they are perfect  they fit like a true unisex small  i purchased the black and grey set  and they are fairly heavy weight  the neck on the black ones is slightly tighter  but easy enough to stretch a tiny bit out  the value for price on this is great  i plan on buying another pack for use when doing yardwork      
200,4.0,                       these run a tad bit small and do shrink so order accordingly   if i buy again  i ll go for a size up quality seems very good   been washed multiple times and holding up well   only other issue was i wish the label was printed a bit darker   takes a few to determine front vs back  especially early in the morning      
201,2.0,                       was really looking forward to some new tshirts for work  i am always wearing out the collar fast than i like  saw this multi pack and was willing to give them a try  right out of the sealed package   of the   have manufacturing flaws holes  maybe i got a bad batch  but returning for a different option  the material is light weight and looks comfortable  so they may be good enough for some others      
202,5.0,                       i cant say enough about these shirts  they are extremely comfortable  i feel cooler wearing them during the summer and being from missouri that is saying something because when you step outside and it feels like you have just bathed  having a shirt that wicks moisture off you so you do not smell is important  you can wear them casually or wear them while hiking etc  i love them      
203,5.0,                       the t shirt is nice good quality  i ve had other shirts from this brand in the past and they ve all treated me well  the one issue i have with these shirts is the length  they are so long i do not need to wear pants anymore  they fit good around the chest and stomach but the length seems a little bit long to me  i don t think anybody s going to say anything about a guy walking around in this long black t shirt with no pants wearing tube socks and tennis shoes  so that s my style moving forward  it even covers my dangly bits   i do have to say though because i live in arizona it s good that this shirt is so long i don t have to wear pants for two reasons  i can save money on pants in the future and it s so hot here in the summertime it s like i m walking around in a summer dress      
204,1.0,                       i bought these for my bf and they are horrible  i just washed them and they shrunk like a whole size and the stitching is coming undone  he didn t even wear them yet  i wanted to wash them  st before he did  i will definitely not buy any other shirts like these  why is it so hard to find a nice t shirt for a man      
205,2.0,                       these t shirt s are soft and stretchy  at first they were great but after two washes they shrunk so much they no longer fit  we ordered a men s medium and they fit more like a small now  it s too bad as the material was soft and comfortable until they shrunk  i would not recommend unless you buy a size up from what you normally wear      
206,4.0,                       they are decent tees to be around the house or under shirts  i would not necessarily wear these to be out and about  they are light  not very thick like the staford brand or kirkland  again  great for around the house and such but if you are looking for something that goes great with a pair of jeans while out and about i recommend you stick to the department store tees     
207,1.0,                       beware go to the website for gildan crew t shirts or just look at the picture here   i received stitching falling out of shirts almost transparent can see right through them the real shirts from this website picture show the name tags embroidered  the one i received has hanging tags looks like it came from a fleamarket not factory sealed in a bag and was just thrown in a shipping bag all dusty wrapped up in a ball       better off buying haynes      
208,5.0,                       i bought these for my husband  and they re perfect  he wears his shirts out quickly and always gets holes in the arms and shoulder area  these are great quality  material is a bit heavier  in a good way   not too heavy   it isn t super thin like some undershirts out there  and you just can t beat the price  i d usually buy fruit of the loom or hanes  and the color gets dull after one or two washes  these wash great  still looks brand new  they fit true to size      
209,5.0,                       as t shirts go  i m pretty forgiving  as long as the cut isn t too odd  such as the length being too short or the shoulders being oddly fitted   i m happy  these t shirts exceeded expectations  providing one of the best fits i ve had  as well as excellent texture softness  while i only purchased these as work shirts  they are suitable for daily wear  as well  i would definitely repurchase  assuming they hold up well  as they should  since the stitching looks to be of high quality  as well      
210,1.0,                       ordered because these shirts were listed as being made from polyester  however  they are      cotton and i cannot use them for sublimation very disappointed and will have to return      
211,2.0,                       the  crew neck  is too large and does not fit like most t shirts i m accustomed to  it looks sloppy around the neck even when worn by itself   there are usually   reasons i get rid of t shirts after awhile    deodorant use causing the underarm too get stiff and   the neck doesn t fit well or is worn out these arrived meeting    don t waste your money they are poorly made      
212,5.0,                       absolutely a perfect fit  i ve been trying to find a t shirt that got me right for years  with a     chest and     waist    it s really hard to find shirts that for me right  these taper perfectly  they re also a little longer than most t shirts  i m ordering these from now on  oh also    they re a really good grade of cotton  super comfortable  breathe right  and really good stitching  nothing that will come apart for many washes      
213,4.0,                       love these shirts    shirts for only      i was a little hesitant from the reviews and wondering the length and thin thickness of them  the length is great  goes down to the crotch area and i love that  hate short length shirts  very bad  especially if you have a belly  the sleeves aren t that bad either  obviously these are top quality shirts but for the price and the amount you get is totally worth it everytime  good casual regular shirts  used for work or gym     recommend themupdate  still like them but they shrink  the length fit was perfect until they got in the washer and dryer    now it fits like a regular t shirt  little short  i like my shirts with some extra length      
214,5.0,                       i purchased these shirts for work  i ruin shirts at my job almost on a weekly basis  i have had these shirts for       months and haven t had to throw   away yet  very durable  very comfortable  an amazing price      
215,2.0,                       would be a perfect undershirt if it was    longer  i know this is relative to a body size and how pants are worn but i m a      man who wears normal rise pants  this undershirt works great brand new  wash and dry and the length shrunk such that i have to endure an undershirt bunched up under my tucked in shirt  too bad  this shirt was so close to usurping a    year stafford  jc penny  run      
216,5.0,                       i am a plus size woman and i bought the grey and black selection in a men s size  x   i wanted a loose fitting  soft t shirt for sleeping   i have very sensitive skin and send back more items than i wear  but these are perfect   very soft  and no itchy tags to remove   and at a great price      
217,1.0,                       i don t leave many reviews on products  especially bad ones  but i feel morally obligated to warn people about these shirts  they are terrible  if they re actually made from cotton as they claim  it must have been from the absolutely worst part of the cotton plant  or maybe the dirt they were planted in    i ordered two sets and decided to risk washing one of them to see if they would soften up  they didn t  they literally feel like sandpaper  if you re someone who has sensitive skin issues  eczema  dermatitis  allergies  or whatever  and are looking for an inexpensive cotton shirt  do not buy this one      
218,5.0,                       after getting some of these i won t go back to hanes again  the material is a bit thicker  the fit seems better  and i m pleased with the overall quality  i have a couple shirts that took on a  very  light tan tint but i think that may be related to me forgetting to separate lights and darks  overall though  these t shirts are continuing to replace others as they  more quickly  wear out      
219,3.0,                       hopefully these continue to shrink as they are quite a bit too large on me now   i bought these for something comfortable to wear while working from home   given the neck is so small relative to the rest of it i do not think getting a smaller size would work for me   overall the sleeves are too long   i think the large is closer to an xl i do not think these were meant to be worn as anything other than an undershirt in public      
220,5.0,                       perfect my husband always orders xlarge bc he wants them longer he wears them under all his other shirts fit is just like hanes and a fraction of the cost cheaper then the sales at the stores bc they never have a good price on them even after wash still fit great     
221,5.0,                       ok i read reviews and made decision to go up a size  basically if your man is a medium like mine order up  at first i was like this is too large for a large and really thought i was going to return and exchange for a medium  but then i decided to try and wash it first  it shrunk to a medium so no need for a return      
222,4.0,                       fit well and are soft  i expect that they will wear as well as the last one s that i bought in my own comparison wearing with other brands they are as good as the big name brands give them a try        
223,1.0,                       took one out and tried in on when i received them  felt a little small for a medium  ia m       and     lbs  the biggest concern was the fabric  the label says      cotton  if it s cotton it has to the lowest grade of cotton  fells like you are wearing burlap  very itchy   decided to wash all   in cold water to see if the itchiness would improve  they still are very itchy  they are really like you are wearing burlap  also after washing them they have shrunk  i feel the collar on the front of my neck and they are also now tight in the arm pits  i have decided to use them for rags      
224,4.0,                       i ordered the black white gray set as well as the white   the white was of a slightly thicker fabric but otherwise both sets were a good buy for the      the fit is correct  xl   the color is solid  the seams and hems are well finished  and the fabric is soft and comfy  just a little thinner than i would prefer  overall  these are a good option      
225,3.0,                       so there s a little hole for people to feel the shirts when shopping at the store  i guess it s convenient when in the store but when in a warehouse a block of dust gets on the white shirts  luckily these are going to be work shirts so they re going to get nasty anyways but if you re buying the white be aware of this issue lol      
226,4.0,                       i think i got what i paid for so no complaints super thin material but fit well and is a comfy weekend around the house shirt        
227,5.0,                       my husband loves these shirts  he is very picky when it comes to comfort especially with undershirts  i have only heard good things come out of his mouth while wearing these  they are soft and true to size  he wears them under his work shirts and none have stretched or gotten that  bacon neck  even though he works in manufacturing  i m impressed      
228,5.0,                       some people will say and probably leave t shirts or t shirts but let me tell you something for the price of these  they are not the cheap shirts that i bought in the past from china in fact which is where these are from but they are much heavier and the price cannot be beat i plan on buying many more i do have one not a gripe just a concerned  i am a great patriot of this nation and i love the warrior    line of patriotic t shirts however on their own website they offer and not all the time but for a great amount of time they offer     off and sometimes you can free shipping and even though i don t mind paying the       for a shirt just the    shipping is an issue however petty and small you might think i am but i keep an eye on things like that the actual manufacturing website as opposed to amazon and a lot of the times amazon when but this time you don t but that won t dissuade me from buying shirts in the future by any stretch of the imagination so keep up the good work fellows  and god bless      
229,4.0,                       i was tired of the fruit of the loom and hanes brands  just seems like the quality went downhill and now they have different thread weave  etc   tried these and love em  seem like good quality cotton  length was nice for me  i m retired now and don t need to worry about butt crack so much   these are not thick or long like the duluth long tail tees so if you got the beer gut thing going on stick to duluth   i m buying another  pk of these      
230,4.0,                       these are ok  so far so good    they are long and i would say  shirts to wear under shirts  i ll wear them around the house but wouldn t wear them to go out to a bar etc  because they are too long for that  black shirts have more polyester than the other shirts  i bought large and fits nicely  i m           lb   these are      better than hanes etc  material is heavier but not too  comfortable  but i haven t worn the black ones yet and having polyester they could feel different   haven t washed them yet but not too worried as i don t  put any shirts in dryer   i m happy with them      
231,2.0,                       i liked these shirts quite a bit out of the package  they aren t especially soft but not that cardboard feel of some cotton shirts either  i m            lbs   and usually i m somewhere between a medium  tall  or a large  slim  in a lot of brands  especially with cotton  i err on the side of large  so that s what i ordered with these  the fit was fine until i washed them  i dried on low heat and pulled them out before they were completely dry  unfortunately  they shrank enough that i can still wear them  but it s borderline   the exact type of shirts i was hoping to replace  the hem at the bottom now folds up like many cheap shirts  and i can t go up to an xl or it will be too boxy  the main thing i look for in tees is fit  and these just don t fit well now  i had a package of black ones in my cart ready to buy but that s off the table now  buy at your own risk      
232,5.0,                       so i began working full time in sales and i was constantly needing to wash my undershirts  i started looking for the least expensive shirts i could find since they were only going to be worn under my collared shirts  these were a great value as they hit all the marks on wjat i was looking for  these are lightweight  inexpensive and breathable  they are      cotton so expect some shrinkage  they fit a bit large initially  but fit me perfectly after they were washed  the material is very thin and there are a few defects so i would avoid wearing these by themselves unless you are doing something where you want to wear a shirt you don t mind ruining      
233,1.0,                       well i usually buy from your site and have good things to say  however this time i m not so happy  first the shirts you had sent aren t even gildan shirts  they are some random shirts you got  that don t even have a name  they are suppose to be tagless however again disappointed  the material is cheap and not worth the price i paid  i m sorry i have to choice a new place to buy from  as i have bought from you numerous times          
234,4.0,                       these looked huge when we received them   they also seemed a bit see through  i put them in the washer and then dried them in the dryer and they shrunk dramatically  which i was hoping for  since it shrunk so much  it also made the material feel thicker  they are pretty lightweight and not something my son or husband would wear by itself  but they like them for under shirts  overall  they are happy      
235,4.0,                       i m          lbs  in decent shape  and wear medium for just about everything  reading other reviews  i went a size up  l  thinking they might be tight or shrink  while i m happy with the large  i wish i went with medium the large were a bit big out of the package but were not uncomfortably large  after a few washes  they did shrink  but are still larger than i would have liked for a few dollars a shirt  i think it was a great purchase  no damage or misprinted labels  just need to order a medium and check the fit just time      
236,5.0,                       i was circleing these shirts for awhile because they come in packs of twelve  i was afraid that would mean they would be flimsy  paper thin material  i was wrong  they are actually thicker than my hanes undershirts and just as comfortable  and they don t bacon neck  i d buy more but these are holding up really well and i have    so i think i m good for awhile  but when they get old and faded  i ll be back      
237,5.0,                       i an     lbs and      and fit  i usually wear a medium  these shrunk a bit in the wash but still fit the way i like  slim fitted snug in the chest and shoulders  if a medium is tight on you order a large  otherwise i love the material and the neck opening is nice and snug with a wide collar stitch like a quality shirt should have      
238,3.0,                       this product is pretty much what you would expect for    bucks  it s thin and somewhat see through  it is just slightly undersized which means if you get a x large it won t fit but if you get a  x large it will be way to big  really wish there sizing was more accurate  its worth buying for diy or an extra t shirt for working on your car that you don t care gets distroyed      
239,3.0,                       i ordered the  xl and they looked great out of the package  i immediately washed them and they shrank so much  the neckline also looks horrid and i washed them separate with no other clothes  so i don t have any idea where this dirty look comes from  i won t order again      
240,5.0,                       breatheablesoft on skincomfortable for work shirtsdoesn t ball up after washesnot thin or thicksoft fabriceasy to move inwash in cold water n hang dryunisexwould purchase againbought largebought a pkg for boyfriend and i for xmas                 
241,5.0,                       like to wear something comfortable around the home and these shirts are perfect   bought these for the low price but the quality is right up there as well and the fit and style is perfect too   the fabric is thick enough enough so they don t feel cheap but thin enough so they re cool and comfortable   definitely recommend      
242,3.0,                       this is a good shirt to workout in but not a t for kicking back  it is      cotton but it is extremely hot    i m a woman and weigh between          my comfort size is large and my fit size is medium small and this t fits more like a medium and like i said is extremely hot    t was a very black color and i washed  like you re always supposed to wash your new clothes and the color faded a tad  on a good note you get a lot of good quality shirts for cheap but i d go bigger  unfortunately i won t be purchasing again but i did get some good causing sweat tshirts for working out      
243,3.0,                       i m used to hanes shirts  and these are very comparable in quality and fit  the large fits my      frame correctly my minor complaint is that the arm holes and girth around the belly is ever so slightly larger than the hanes  which are also too large  my arms are not small  and there is so much material in the arms that they flare out and minimize the appearance of my physique  the length could be just a tad longer too  perhaps half an inch   i realize these are undershirts and wear them as such  but i would prefer that they were more form fitting  i realize they are necessarily made larger to accommodate heavier guys  i m    lbs   but they just aren t quite what i was hoping to get for the price  these are a fantastic buy      
244,1.0,                       steer clear  these are waay too long    by like   inches  also very poor quality  the first one through the wash got a hole at a seam  the second one shrank maybe    around the chest  where it was overly snug to begin with   the rest went to rags and a donation box  oh well      
245,5.0,                       bought these a couple of times now and they re becoming my favorite t shirts in my wardrobe  i usually buy whatever is cheapest or on sale do i have a mix of hanes fruit of the loom and other brands  lately i ve noticed that most brands are starting to use less cotton and more polyester  that s great if you want a shirt that washes and wears well but the pure cotton shirts are a lot more comfortable  these are      cotton and because of that they do shrink a bit  i buy my size and purposely shrink them in the wash because i like a snug form fitting undershirt  that s the way we wore them when i was in the service and i like a neat tight collar  these are great for that  if you like a looser shirt i recommend buying a size larger and shrink them  they will only shrink once and after that you have a great looking comfortable t shirt  these look and feel better than the rest of the brands i have and notice when a fresh load of laundry is finished these are the first tshirts i grab out of the closet  i also think the elastic in the collar last longer on these shirts and the collars themselves are better and more comfortable that other shirts      
246,5.0,                       ordered     sizes larger  to allow for washing and machine drying  and glad i did  as  regular  size would have shrunk too much  i use them for painting  and the    pack was an excellent price for work tees that become ruined in a short time by paint splatter  but make excellent paint rags after several washings  very lightweight and comfortable for warm interior work      
247,5.0,                       i used to buy the hanes ones   their prices have gotten crazy   tried these and could not be happier   i have to wear these under a work shirt and they are great   soft cotton that doesn t get annoying if worn for    hours   now  all cotton shirts shirk just a fact of life   i ordered one size bigger than i normally wear knowing that they will shirk after repeated washes   i use the whites setting  hot water  so that i keep them nice and white but does cause shrinkage   new these were just a little to big   after the third wash they have shrunk to a perfect size and have remained there      
248,3.0,                       i bought an extra large for my husband that usually wears a large just figured they would shrink  he does his own laundry so that usually happens with his t shirts  however i bought a pack that showed two white shirts two black and one grey  i had bought a pack of athletic shorts that had each of these colors on the sides  i m disappointed bc i got one darker grey    two light grey    and two black  i love him in white t shirts so hated they didn t come in the pack like the display showed  he however i m sure could careless      
249,3.0,                       i purchased these to replace some now impossible to find fruit of the loom stay tucked shirts that i had worn out   these are decent shirts  but they don t measure up to the ones i replaced   the shirts are of average length  sitting at about    below the belt   the shirts stretch horizontally  but not vertically   while this makes for a comfortable fit  they do not want to stay tucked when you bend over or squat the material seems slightly thinner than hanes or fotl  and slightly less soft   it s still good enough in both regards  just not great   the sleeves bunch up at the end after being washed and dried   they stretch back out again just fine  but this will cause some wrinkles around the sleeve when they are folded   not a big deal for an undershirt  but still a minor nuisance   the collar and waist do not bunch up for some reason overall  this is a so so shirt   not great  not terrible   it gets the job done  and if coming untucked is not an issue for you  these are a good and inexpensive option      
250,2.0,                       one of the shirts hem came undone after first wash   trying to decide if it is worth returning after washing  only   of    can i get credit for one         
251,2.0,                       bought these as under shirts for darker dress shirts  opened them and immediately washed them to get the  bleeding  of color over with  took them out of the wash  several had small holes  like moth holes in them  and over half had threads hanging loose from the hems around the arms and neck   upon wearing the first one  the neck hem entirely let go they were cheap and i got low quality  lesson learned  would not buy again  i have a business and i buy gildan shirts from my screen printer and have never seen these quality issues  i truly believe these are factory seconds   rejects      
252,3.0,                       i originally bought a variety pack of   that included   black shirts and   gray  i loved the way they fit so i then ordered a   pack of just black  it was the same brand  same size  unfortunately the shirts on this second order do not fit the same  the collar is much larger than the original order giving the t shirts a sagging look when worn under a garment such as a v neck sweater or collared shirt  clearly these are source by different suppliers  i will not buy again      
253,5.0,                       i am a woman but i wanted comfortable t shirts for work  it s been incredibly hot and i wanted something easy to throw on  the shirts fit well  they might shrink so when i get more i ll probably size up to an xl for extra room  bf took a shirt too  both like it  idk why all the negative reviews because they re cheap  soft  and do what they re supposed to do      
254,4.0,                       the t shirt is nicely made and fits perfectly for a medium  i hope it does not shrink though  the crew neck is perfectly sized and the shirt hangs well  the cotton fabric is very light weight and thin  although not necessarily cheap  i m used to kirkland ts which run larger and use much thicker cotton  but they fade after a few washes  i ll have to see how these gildan ts hold up after ten washes before i buy another   pack  but i like them so far      
255,5.0,                       order a size larger  i did and after the first wash and dryer the t shirt shrank a bit  these are not heavy duty tee shirts  the material is thin and light but very comfortable  a couple of the t shirts did have loose threads  don t pull on them  take the shirt outside and hit the loose thread carefully with your bic lighter the   stars are a relative rating  for the money you can t go wrong  obviously if you want a thick heavy duty t shirt  you ll have to spend more  i m very satisfied      
256,5.0,                       needed some everyday tees   read the reviews   was skeptical   rec d the goods and no flaws   they are medium weight   not too thin but heavy enough to wear as everyday tee            lbs   fatty likes his shirts a little loose   got the  xl and fit nice   even after a little shrinking  they should still be fitting nice   colors are nice and can t beat the price   don t expect them to last forever but curious to see how they wear   if badly  will buy more in  mo    yr at this price   would recommend and will buy again      
257,5.0,                       this might just be one of my top    on line buys of all time      i say that only because i think it and it is no lie  i am going to get some more just because they are      a shirt     need i say more   i rest my case     mic drop boom  that is a review for the ages and straight up from the floor up  we are going to get some more up  thanks for the awesome shirts thats what is important to me is are the t shirts comfortable and feel right when you put it on   i can then be very happy as i got a very great buy  a feel good purchase    top    in my book  sianara tango team leader out      
258,5.0,                       these have a collar that doesn t quit   want that look of a well fit undershirt t shirt   go no further   heavier weight and a bit richer cotton than the hanes   my hanes undershirt  t shirts have quitter collars  these undershirt t shirts are thicker and better than others i have purchased   they shrink quite a bit when you wash them on hot  which i do  and i dry them on medium   i like a tightly fitting t shirt   it makes me feel buff and doesn t make me look like i have a pencil neck   i would not get these if i was looking for a relaxed fitting undershirt or if you have a bigger belly  which i used to have    you may want to up the size a notch to get the belly comfortable  but if you re a snuggy fit shirt kinda guy with a slim fit shirt overtop  you re in the right place      
259,4.0,                       i got my delivery really fast which was great and my husband says that he likes the t shirt  it looks good on him  all i will say is if you are expecting this t shirt to be a thick material like the classic  pro club t shirts  it is not  the material isn t like extremely thin  but again it is not a thick t shirt  still a great product though  good to wear around spring and summer      
260,4.0,                       gildan is my go to brand for shirts now  they are comfortable   affordable   fit me pretty well  originally i got them in an xl size which felt more like a  xl  so i went with the large which fits me much better  i love the black   dark grey shirts but i m not so crazy about the light grey ones  i would have much rather have traded them for one more dark grey   one more black shirt had they had that option  stitching seems to hold up alright after putting them through the wash after a couple of weeks   color seems to have held up as well  would buy more when these start to really wear out      
261,5.0,                       great and inexpensive  my teen needed simple solid tees but i can never find the right size or colors  or individually they would be too expensive for what it was  so this was a bargain and the shirts fit well  i m air drying them in case they shrink or fade  they go a couple of inches past his waist which is perfect for him      
262,5.0,                       i purchased a  xl and hooly cow  these actually came a bit bigger than i expected haha  i would say the  xls look like a  xl mostly  however  i love my shirts baggy and im considering buying more just to sleep in  i bought these for my hair initially but they are so comfortable to lounge around in     
263,5.0,                       i used to order promotional t shirts at work and gildan was my go to brand as they held ink well  were comfortable   durable and the fits were consistent  because i usually worked the events i always got a shirt or two  over    years in that position  my wardrobe mainly consists of these promotional t shirts  i ordered these plain colored shirts for my personal wear as they are timeless colors and i don t feel like a walking billboard on my personal time  i would highly recommend these t shirts for general all around wear
