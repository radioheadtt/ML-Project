0,5.0 ,                       i needed to connect   monitors to my laptop  this hub has   hdmis and i was able to connect two     monitors to my laptop  now i have   screens to work with  i connect the hub to the usb c to my laptop  so i dont need an extra power source for the hub  i connect my keyboard and my mouse to the hub via usb  i have the memory card in the hub at all time  so i can save to it if needed  i would recommend this hub      
1,5.0 ,                       my background  macbook pro user  not a super user but very tech savvy  can use more ports on this than most and have tested various scenarios i have run into before turns out many of the usb c hubs are either made by or sold by the same groups  probably both   they are all made in china even name brands  i have a totu one that i am sure is made by the same people or distributed by the same people  the totu one is the    in   just like this  they essentially have the same functionality with this tiergrade one having a usb c port instead of a    mm jack output  here is the one i m comparing and have had for over a year  https   smile amazon com gp product b  q jxwtp ref ppx yo dt b search asin title ie utf  psc  i don t really need the    mm output on my macbook pro     inch       i   as it has one natively  however what i do need is an easily portable solution that has all the ports i need  the main specs for the two are identical and really the difference is the one port i mentioned and the layout comparing this to the totu it has a different layout with all the usb on one side  the totu has a split design where it has a usb     on the side with the hdmi and the rest of the usb are on the opposite side  this tiergrade has all usb data connections on one side and the usb pd port on the other side with the hdmi and sd card stuf  basically a power only port that you plug into your usb c power adapter  this layout is more logical in that you don t have to worry about flipping it around to find which ports you need as all usb ports for connecting anything are on one side  the downside is you have to have everything on that one side it used to be that we worried about usb     next to a usb     and rf interference so that could be why the totu has that design  i put a usb     unifying receiver from logitech into the     port next to a usb     while it was connected to a hard drive  i did not notice any interference which was good the ethernet reports in at gigabit connections to my router  i ran a speed test and it ran at my maximum internet connection  i didn t test a full saturation throughput with gigabit ethernet because    well who really saturates a gigabit ethernet connection very often  i doubt i have ever it does get hot like all the others especially when powered and has multiple things connected edit  after contacting the company regarding the second hdmi port flickering they sent a new one  it was still flickering with the cable i used  re ran the tests with a different cable  hdmi premium high speed certified  and it did much better  normal response and no flickering  moral of the story is to try a better cable when trying to do  k hdr  with another cable it was fine only through one port  i d say that some hardware is more picky than others sd card transfer was decent  i had a sandisk ultra with some pictures on it rated at class   speed    mb s   the transfer rate to my macbook was about    mb s so not bad  it transferred      gbs of data in about   minutes  i m betting if i had a faster card it would hustle more but i ll leave someone else that test  my faster cards are at the office   power delivery through the hub is about   watts less than the adapter itself  so you can probably guess the hub takes about      watts depending on what is connected  i tried two different power adapters  one a    watt and the other an    watt adapter  both registered   watts less when connected to the hub vs directly to my macbook  this is about normal from what i have seen  i even had a bus powered usb drive connected and it still showed that reading a few big pros  this has a longer cable than the totu and a more useful usb c port which in this day and age is a better choice unless your computer doesn t have an audio jack  but most of the time we are dealing with wireless audio with bluetooth nowadays  it also has rubber feet on the bottom which a are nice touch to keep it from scraping or moving as much  this thing feels sturdy and all the ports work as expected  usb     didn t interfere with rf for wireless mouse like others have   better shielding cons  it s thicker but shorter than the totu  it is blue so it doesn t look like a macbook pro space grey which isn t really an issue  the blue is not a bad color just doesn t match the macbook  must use a quality hdmi cable  cable matters was what i used   it gets very hot    but they all do overall i d buy it but make sure you test all the ports you are going to use with the cable you are going to use   i contacted the company and they sent me a new one to test  when it had a similar hdmi port issue they troubleshooted that it might be the cable  they were right  i needed another one for my home  dock  so i ll probably leave one of the two at home connected to all the peripherals  thanks for reading      
2,3.0 ,                       love the size of the tg hub     but require a solid power setup for its usb c power jack  dell work laptop blue screened multiple times  and was losing power with   monitors connected through the hub  since video can cause blue screens during updates  tried a phone charger     tried with lenovo using usb a to usb c     adapter   hdmi display did not work  any drivers for hdmi through adapters      
3,5.0 ,                       great addition to my macbook pro and ipad  it s a great portable addition to have all the extra ports i need  it is small but has everything  it doesn t overheat which is nice  seems durable and well made  i like the ability to charge through it as well so i can have everything plugged into the one port  it works quickly and seamlessly and haven t had any problems connecting      
4,4.0 ,                       have been using for about   months for work and personal  nothing broken that i m aware of pros this works great for connecting my   monitors via hdmi  mouse  keyboard via usb a  a micro usb charging cable for the keyboard and mouse  and charging my dell work laptop hub will work when connected to the laptop only  does not need a power adapter for it s own source of power   hub is small case and paint is durable  case is very lightweight con gets hot when i connect my laptop charger s usb c cable to the hub to charge my work laptop through the hub   it does cool down relatively quickly the maximum power passthrough to the laptop seems to be   w   thus  it won t charge laptops that require a higher charging capability  e g       dell xps    the usb a ports seems weak or does not support fast charging the microsd card transfer speed is really slow for transferring pictures and videos the usb c cable to connect to the laptop is short  like   inches       
5,3.0 ,                       i received this today and was very excited to use this with my new surface laptop   the two hdmi ports work perfectly   but the usb ports do not work at all   i even plugged the device into a usb c power supply and it still won t work   so my usb mouse and keyboard won t work   i have e mailed the company and have received no reply hours later   i was really hopeful for this   i will update this review if the company gets back to me and develops a way to get this working update  i lowered my review to   star because it s been a full day and no one has returned my e mail to the company about the issues i am having   seems tech support is non existent  buy at your own risk update                i finally troubleshooted  toubleshot   the issue on microsoft s web site and discovered the issue was not with the tiergrade device but with the ucb c extension cable i purchased  once i connected the device directly to the surface  everything worked perfectly  i m still deducted   star for such a short a   cable  and   star for absolutely zero tech support  had to find out this answer on my own      
6,5.0 ,                       i bought this usb c hub because i have a lot of equipment that has a very limited amount of ports  especially my macbook and ultra thin hp laptop  both of these devices only have a handful of usb c ports and not much else  this makes it hard for when i want to connect an external monitor  keyboard  mouse  and so on to either one of these devices  i have a small selection of individual adapters to provide more usb ports and a way to connect to external monitors  but those adapters end up taking up the limited usb c ports that i have with this hub i can now connect up to three external monitors  thanks to the two hdmi ports and the vga port  i can connect up to four different usb devices with the   usb     and the   usb     ports  i can also charge my devices directly through the usb hub without taking up another usb c port  i also like that there is a little bit of rubberized material on the bottom side of the hub  this helps prevent the hub from sliding around my desk or making a lot of noise if it does move around i also tried it on both my android phone and ipad and it works great on both  i really like that i can use samsung dex on my phone when i plug this hub in  effectively turning my phone into a computer on the go for anyone that needs more ports on their devices  i highly recommend trying this usb c hub out for yourself      
7,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i bought this as a present for a co worker who bought a new macbook pro which came with no usb ports  this was a great addition to just put into the usb   c and have a lot of different capabilities i tested everything but the hdmi and vga as i don t use bigger screens  everything worked properly  issues i ve had in the past with other items similar once connected they would disconnect then reconnect then disconnect over and over  this one the connector for the usb c is a tight fit and doesn t jiggle around i rate         
8,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i like this hub and i recommend this  likes  i like this most from the all of my usb hub because this one has all kind of ports and most number of ports you may need in the hub  this is smallest side docking station i have ever used  hdmi  hdmi to hdmi   works well  hdmi to dvi converter   works well  hdmi to display port   works well  vga  works well   this is very useful and handy since many old monitor works with only vga port  vga hdmi or vga hdmi hdmi  i like this most as both port works together and displays two separate monitors form the laptop  usb c  works well  usb      works well   usb      works well sd card  works well  ethernet  tested up to    mb s   works well  audio  audio and mic   works well overall  this is very well designed usb hub that has all the connectivity in one  quality of outer case is very well and durable  came with nice soft cloth case i like this hub and i recommend this      
9,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       it is a great hub to extend ports and provide an ethernet   however  i found the cable to the usb c port too shot   my laptop has a usb c port on the right side  therefore this sits right next to the laptop giving not enough length of the cable  it interferes with the mouse   yes  i use always a mouse with my laptop   the cable should have been at twice the length so it could be moved away from the mouse pad area  the other option  if the cable is detachable them the user can use his own long cable      
10,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       solid metal unit  feels durable  with every port full  it holds up  note to buyer  the power is low for the new mbp   which requires   w  this one only pushes around    w  also  the two hdmi cables cannot be used for extended screens on the macbook pro  each screen on the mbp needs to be on two separate ports      
11,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this product works exactly as advertised and i was able to quickly get my samsung laptop up and running with an ethernet connection and two external monitors connected via hdmi cables   great for my office set and i now have one monitor running in landscape mode and one running in portrait mode   which is great for multi tasking and improved technology  it also allowed me to get ethernet speeds vs  wifi when i m connected which is nice assurance for zoom and other video calls   for my laptop  i was also able to use a usb c power in  same one that powers apple devices  to the port so that while this accessory is plugged in it is also charging my laptop  another big plus    while i haven t yet used  nice to have the flexibility of additional usb c and     ports for other items like an external web camera      
12,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       got this and hooked it up right away   it worked perfectly   everything connected easily and fit perfectly   i had no problem getting it connected with my computer and other devices and all worked as it should   the color is my favorite blue so a huge plus   the size is great  it s small enough to take with you anywhere if you wanted too   it s light weight also   comes with a nice carrying bag also   i highly recommend this device      
13,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       tiergrade adapter was more than i expected   it handles all my plug ins   projector   dvd player  speakers  external hard drive  with extra ports to use as a mine safety instructor   it s important all my components work together with no interruption adapter even came with a drawstring pouch  which i wasn t expecting    delivery was within   days  and adapter packaging was sturdy i m so happy i found this      
14,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       with a macbook pro       although it has two hdmi inputs  it doesn t allow for dual monitors as extended screens  it only allows mirroring between the two monitors   also it causes a green flicker on the screen that cycles every    seconds or so      
15,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i really love this hub  i saw a video review after i had already bought a cheaper one  well  the cheaper one didn t work  whenever i plugged my portable hard drive into it  it would not connect to my laptop   i can put my portable hard drive through this hub and it worked perfectly and as intended  it s nice to have all these various slots on one unit without having to dig around to find each one individually whenever i switch stuff that needs plugged in  i do a lot of photo and video editing and it really comes in handy      
16,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this hub works right out of the box  and it handled all of the various cables i have  eliminating the need for the many dongles i was using   unfortunately  the internet cable connection didn t work  and i had to re attach my internet connector to my computer   this wasn t a big problem  just a small disappointment   otherwise i would have rated it   stars   it sure looks neater than the kluge of wires  dongles  and the previous hub i had before   this was a very good investment      
17,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this is a great little device that allows me to hook up all my cables so i only have the one usb c going into my laptop   i work in several locations throughout my house  and its  really convenient to have just one cord to plug in to get dual monitors  etc   it does get warm when in use  but never hot the company has great customer service   i was having problems getting my usb keyboard to work and they advised me to use the usb     instead of     port   and  that resolved the issue  great customer service      
18,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       variety of input types and   hmdi inputs for dial monitor use  love the color  looks and feels good and isn t too big  easy to pack and travel with  my only concern is though my laptop indicates it is being charged when the hub is plugged in  my battery does not gerry charged  it s not the biggest deal for me as i can use a separate port on my laptop  but it would nice not to be able to cut the second cord  that is the only reason for   instead of   stars      
19,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       nice little usb  hub  however be aware that this will not allow you to run two hdmi monitors from a mac in extended mode  the two hdmi displays will mirror each other  and extend the desktop from the laptop display  i don t know if this is a limitation from the adapter  or if it is a limitation from macos      
20,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       overall this product is as specified   it seems to be well built   the price was mid range  not the least expensive or the most expensive   the qty and type of ports is very convenient   however  the performance is less then i was looking for   i have a     x     monitor   it support s this resolution with one monitor connected   i have two     x     monitors   when i add one of these monitors to the first monitor the performance on both drops to     x       i probably could have figured this out before i bought it   so i can t say that this is the manufacturer s fault  so the   star rating    i just have higher than normal needs   i did not try the two     x     together as i don t have that need   i did not try returning this product as it is convenient and does support the one monitor which gets me most of what i need      
21,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       pros   compact and solid build quality  joint reinforced thick usb c cable  tight connections on all ports  i plugged into every port and wiggled and pulled   versatile ports for apple and android users   useful when i need to copy between sd  microsd cards and computercons none  this hub is perfect      
22,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       bought this about   months ago  everything worked perfectly until it no longer started responding to me plugging in an ethernet hardline  my computer stopped recognizing it  i reached out to their customer service and after a few emails they honored their   yr warranty and had a replacement being sent to me  the device does the job i bought it for fine  and the customer service was great  if i didn t already own it  i would buy again from them      
23,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i really like this usb c hub  i m using an ipad for almost everything now  and this will give me the ability to connect it to my tv as a monitor and connect a wireless keyboard and mouse  it is made from sturdy aluminum  and even includes a little pouch to put it in when i carry it in my book bag  highly recommend      
24,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i ve tried a few different usb c hubs trying to find one that allowed for use of extended dual external monitors and wireless keyboard mouse without delays or connection drops  this one works perfectly  absolutely no delays   no screen flickering  set up is non existent  you just plug it in and it s up and running  highly recommend      
25,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i replaced a failing usb c hub with this one  this hub does more for less money and came with a warranty of one year  when registering with them   i travel  and this is smaller than my cell phone  a bit wider  in a convenient travel bag to protect the device  it s nice to have the ability to connect to hdmi or a projector when needed in case the venue doesn t have the appropriate cables to connect with my computer  it s a bit more than some of the other hubs on the market  and i m hoping guessing that this one will outlast the warranty   if not  i ll update this and let you know         
26,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       product arrived with nice  secure packaging   currently we only two usb ports  keyboard  mouse  and one hdmi for a monitor   worked immediately after connections were made   only question we have is that the documentation references plugging in your laptop power adapter into the usb c female port  have no idea what this means because i ve never seen a laptop with a usb c power cable   other than that  all is great      
27,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this hub fits the bill and works great for my needs  i currently have a usb adapter plugged into it for a bluetooth keyboard and mouse for my computer that only has a usb c port  there are extra slots to add plenty of additional peripherals should i need to in the future      
28,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i m using this docking station to use my laptop like a standard desktop at times  i have it connected to my keyboard  monitor  and external speakers  works like a charm  my only wish is that it had an audio in port  but i resolved this by buying an adapter for my speakers to convert to usb  great docking station  works well  no issues      
29,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this is a top quality hub   works great for expanding the expandability of my laptop  it gives me ability to add storage  monitors  and a variety of other components can be added   can t go wrong with this   definitely a great choice      
30,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i ve tried many usb hubs for my home office  most of them work ok  but have at least one issue or the other  usually its  flickering in hdmi port or lag in usb nano receiverbut this one   so far    week  amazing   everything work  great  i will update the review if anything changes i use it charge may dell latitude  connect to a     monitor via hdmi  charge a couple usb type c devices  i use a   w power adapter as input      
31,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       when i recently replaced my old      macbook pro with the new macbook pro which has only usb  ports  i needed a hub to be able to use the many accessories i ve collected over the years  this device is the perfect solution slim  solid  worth every penny      
32,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       it was working for   months and   days  exactly   days past the support date   it generally worked but ran very hot all the time  i had to unplug it at end of day for fear of it burning out  unfortunately  it wasn t enough      
33,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i spent a great deal of time reviewing all the options for adding ports to my new     macbook pro   the hatowork  seemed to offer all the ports i needed plus some i may need in the future if i want to hook up one or two monitors   i ve been using this device daily since i received it and it works flawlessly

36,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       tiergrade    in   triple display adapter is the perfect device for my office  it has the quality  features  and durability that fits my needs  not to mention  the accessibility that s capable of accommodating any display  vga  rj    hdmi  storage capacity and the list goes on  it is the most compatible unit i ve seen and use so far      
37,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       seems to work just fine but it literally has to be sitting practically on top of the laptop because the connector usb c cord is so darn short   it has lots of connections and is lightweight     but i like to keep all cords and clutter away from my workstation  behind my monitor or otherwise hidden out of sight  which is impossible with this      
38,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i like the material quality and color  it comes with nice packaging  bought it because i needed ethernet connection and extra usb  so far it seem really good and conveniente    i m happy with it     
39,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       love this product    no  assembly required  simply connect the usb type c plug to your computer   its small and compact  which is ideal for my    inch wide desk   and it gives you the option to extend or mirror your monitors i purchased this device for the sole purpose of connecting and extending my two monitors since my laptop only has one hdmi port  even though i only use the two hdmi ports  its nice to have    additional ports just in case      
40,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       we purchased the usb c hub  usb c adapter  tiergrade    in   and right from the start it worked perfect we know have so many different ports to plug many different devices into you really need this if you have a  gen ipad pro  this thing rocks       
41,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i was concerned that this item was defective as i tried to connect my apple super drive to it an it sends an error message the super drive needs power   after a lot of research it appears that several people have the same problem an nobody has found a hub that can fix this issue   warn customers about this      
42,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       bought this for a lenovo pc that had usb c and thunderbolt  it worked well  bit the pc was crap  i soon bought a microsoft surface laptop   and this works on that too  even without thunderbolt   glad i bought it      
43,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i received this very quickly and plugged in my laptop  two monitors  a keyboard and a mouse to it  i have a windows based dell laptop and it allowed me to run three monitors simultaneously with different windows on each one  it is very small  lightweight and easy to use  there is no set up other than plugging in all of your cords   i am very pleased with it and would recommend it to others      
44,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       the product is a good quality and works as intended   effective and efficient in a nice small size   easy for travel in my laptop bag      
45,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i like they way you can just plug it into the computer and to the monitors and it works  the only draw back is that it has no power supply and the instructions say to use the laptops  but it doesn t fit  i guess since i m not charging anything it will be ok      
46,2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       it is great to have one place to plug everything into   can t say this for sure  but my ethernet connection often dropped during zoom meetings with this connector  something that never happened with my dell  hockey puck  connector       
47,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       the short cable strains the connector and doesn t fit flat when plugged in to my surface pro     a few more inches would ve been perfect   i have dinged it one star for that reason      
48,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this is an amazing hub  it is not be necessarily light weight  in fact it feels very well made  very sturdy shipping was fantastic  arrived fast   other vendors of similar products were needing     weeks thanks     
49,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       due to teleworking policy as a result of covid    i have to work from home  oh darn     so  i made myself a home office and needed a docking station to display my company laptop to dual monitors  i found this on amazon  the price was perfect and it works so well  great purchase  only thing i noticed was there is no port for my speakers  that is ok as i am able to plug them into one of the monitors  so  not really a problem  i highly recommend      
50,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       one usb port became glitchy after a day  in a little over a week    usb ports stopped working completely  waste of money and a terrible product      
51,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i was looking for a small lightweight multifunctional docking station for travel and the home office the tiergrade    in   device has been performing excellent and no issues at all with supporting dual and triple monitors from my laptop   as described  the unit does run a bit warm but this has not been a problem thus far the price point was very reasonable compared to other options on the market  the packaging was concise clean with unit appearing constructed very well      
52,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       good quality and fair price  nothing to complain about  it s working as it s supposed to do      
53,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this is a great option for an adapter to go with the new     macbook pro s  which only have     usb c ports  when you have the power cable in one and an adapter in the other  there aren t any left  this is the best affordable solution to upgrade an already expensive macbook pro into a complete workstation   an external monitor through hdmi  ethernet port  sd card reader  but favorite is the additional usb c port      
54,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i haven t gotten to the extensive use this adapter is capable of but  the ports i ve used thus far worked flawlessly  i would recommend this product if youare looking for many expansion port options  i used this adapter on an imac pro     
55,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i ve been generally satisfied with the product  i love the versatility it offers and the  docking  functionality in a small package aspect of it  i do wish the cable it comes with was a tad longer  i work with a surface and because the cable attaches to the screen and it s on a higher position  i have the hub standing on one of its sides rather than flat on its base  minor inconvenience though      
56,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       not working with my laptop  lousy support  somebody send me one email asking about the problem  after i response with the problem description  never hear from support again      
57,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i set this up right out of the box as a docking station for my hp chromebook   i have it connected to my printer  gig ethernet    monitors  a keyboard  webcam  wireless headset  and mouse   this enabled me to use all these external devices with little effort   my chromebook only had   type c ports and one regular usb   so i could not connect all theses devices without this product      
58,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       very good quality   well built with just the right choices of connectors as well as good placement for the connectors   i am very pleased with this item and would buy again     
59,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i like the design of this adapter  but did not expect to provide my own cable to provide power for this adapter the ports do not seem to be working all the time  not sure if there is a fault on my laptop or the driver is installed correctly the hdmi ports have not worked since i purchased it i have order new usb c connector to make sure the issue is not with my usb c power cable      
60,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this is phenomenal and at a great price versus the larger port replicator and docking stations  really the only downside is the short cable to connect to my laptop  i succeaafully run two     monitors  a webcam  a wireless mouse  and a phone charger      
61,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       very solid  easy to access ports  exactly the kinds of connections i was looking for with my surface book     
62,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       works great with surface pro   and dual screens   just plugged in the hdmi port and it worked automatically   does not get hot or overheat and lots of great ports in the hub that can be used      
63,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this  tiergrade    in    has way more ports compared to apple s branded adapters  as soon as i plugged in the  tiergrade    in    hub in the ipad pro everything worked great      
64,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i really liked the light weight tiegrade adapter  it has enough type of ports to connect to pretty much any display you like  you can mirror your displays using the adapter  i had two hdmi monitors and used the adapter to mirror my displays also connecting my rj   ethernet cable along with my mouse and keyboard to the usb     ports  i highly recommend this product        
65,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i bought the hub because of the   hdmi port  i m able to connect my laptop to two monitors via the hub      
66,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       so far so good  plugged it in and it is working well  i searched to find something that was cost effective and had two hdmi ports and this was the one  great value and even better that it worked      
67,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i received it and most functions worked out of the box  the vga needed a driver update which it did on line so no issues there  seems to be a great product and works exactly as advertised      
68,2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       the product works but doesnt charge my hp laptop  in order for me to use it i have to run off the laptop battery which defeats the purpose of  docking   if you have an hp laptop with fast charging this may not work for you either  wish they would ve stayed that more clearly in the description      
69,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i ordered this so that i could work off of   screens to make it easier to do my job from home   it sure did the trick    it was so easy to install too   so far i ve been using it for a couple weeks and it s been working great   i highly recommend this product       
70,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this product is amazing  the materials are indredibly lightweight and all the ports work as promotioned  my mac with just   usb c ports now is better than my desktop computer      recommended     
71,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       my      macbook pro will only mirror the displays other than that great quality but i need the screen feature more      
72,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       works perfect on the      surface pro to project to   screens via the usbc     
73,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       solid product  good quality  excellent packaging      
74,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       tiergrade adapter was more than i expected  it handles all my plug ins   projector  dvd player  speakers  external hard drive  with extra ports to use      
75,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       took it out of the box  plugged it into my computer  attached the   hdmi cables and now i have   monitors  i couldn t ask for anything simpler   and lots of extra ports for other things as well   has a case so i can travel with it if need be  probably won t but good to have it because it has a pretty blue exterior i would hate to scratch       
76,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       works well supporting dual hp monitors and as a hub for additional usb ports for wireless keyboard and     
77,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i bought a hub at best buy and couldn t get it to work after two different hubs  i asked if the device would work with my laptop and received an answer the next day  ordered it an plugged it in and everything worked  nice product and worked oerfect      
78,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this works perfectly   i had purchased two items from other companies and neither one did what i needed  this item allows me to view   different things at one time  laptop  monitor  big screen tv   now i can be as productive working from home as i am when working at my office      
79,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       the amazon write up for this device states that dell  along with several other computer manufacturers are compatible   so i felt comfortable in procuring this device to go with my new dell computer unfortunately  not true   the owners manual that accompanies the device states that dell xbs                are not compatible  meaning  in this case  that data is transmitted  but not pass through charging    several other specific machines  other than dell  are also listed as being non compatible  i emailed the supplier about my specific dell machine and received this reply   this usb c hub can not supply power to dell xbs           we recommend you to charge your laptop by plug in separated port on your laptop    the physical setup for this device is a daisy chain with the computer power supply plugged into the device and the device s short pig tail plugged into the computer power input  a thunderbolt   connector  in my case    the data from the dock is then available to the computer  as well described in several other user inputs this works very well   the problem appears to be that the device uses energy  it becomes quite warm  such that not enough is left to power the computer   the computer will run on batteries  but to recharge  you have to unplug and plug cables   or perhaps a second power supply could be introduced   i didn t find either of those approaches acceptable and have  reluctantly  returned the device to amazon   note that dell makes several other computer models and this device may  or may not  work with them   the supplier  ludtomsupport outlook com  answered my email within    hours  so a quick compatibility check with a specific computer might be a good idea before ordering      
80,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       my friend told me that he used a very good usb c hub  and he said that this product has a fast transmission speed  so i bought it with a mentality of trying  in my past few days  i found that my friends didn t lie to me during use  this is really a product with a good number  it matches my computer very well and the transmission speed is very fast

133,2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       desperately needed more ports and to free up some laptop ports  however  i ve noticed an issue   i have two external monitors plugged into this adapter and a third monitor plugged directly into the laptop  i notice that with this adapter  it is mirroring the two monitors plugged into this adapter  previous to this adapter  i had a different one with less ports but two hdmi ports and it did not mirror the monitors  desired outcome   because i ve this  i ll have to return it as the whole point was getting more ports  freeing up some laptop ports  and keeping my same        laptop monitor  setup

137,2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       my brand new hp spectre     laptop only has a few ports   this nifty hub has a ton of ports   it was just plug and play  all   displays  laptop     externals  are supported and the setup was a non event   i tried a more expensive hub from a brick and mortar retailer and it didn t have nearly the capability   however  that was the  st week s experience   on week    i took my laptop to a remote presentation and left the hub at home disconnected   i used a projector connected to my laptop while at the remote meeting   when i returned home and hooked up the tg hub to the laptop  none of the displays connected through the hub worked   i tried different ports to connect the displays  nothing   checked my drivers  nothing   sent tiergrades an email for technical support and here it is   days after and not a word from them   i also note that the hub came with a warranty card that said i needed to register on line   however  the tiergrades on line website doesn t allow for registering my purchase unless it is bought directly through them   so how are you supposed to sign up for warranty protection amazon did send me a replacement hub and so far it works fine  just plugged in my peripheral displays and all is good  but i ll have to test whether or not it works after i ve removed the hub from the computer for a few days so i ve given tg a   star rating based on uneven product quality and abysmal customer tech support     stars to amazon though  who replaced the product in    hours  after tg didn t respond   here s hoping i just got a bad hub   tiergrades  best man up with the technical support  hear

164,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       will be returning this thing  it does not work  got this because i really wanted a docking station for my new laptop  i have a fewusb  devices  a logitech unifying receiver and an ipod  i have also tried a few usb  thumb drives  that this thing will not recognise as being plugged in  if i put a usbc adapter and plug the devices directly into my pc they work if i use another  older  smaller  usbc hub that i have  they work  any usb  device i plug in  i ve tried a couple usb  external hard drives and a few thumb drives  all work just fine  any usbc device i plug in works fine  but for some reason  even though it has usb  sockets  this hub does not recognise any usb  device i have plugged into it without recognising the devices i use  this thin is useless      
165,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i m not one to usually write reviews  and i certainly don t write reviews immediately when i get a product  i want to test it out for a while before feeling confident enough to speak to its quality  with quarantine in full effect for a few months now  i can say without a doubt how wonderful this hub is for my home office setup  while my employer one hub for plugging in an hdmi monitor  i have two monitors and it s the optimal setup for my line of work  i m using this on a      mac book pro  and with only   usb c ports  i can t have   hubs plugged in unless one has a way to connect power into the hub this hub has worked wonderfully for the past   months  i m able to plug in a monitor  my usb dongle for keyboard and mouse  as well as the power cable for the laptop  i can leave my other smaller hub for plugging in the second monitor  mission accomplished  things work great and have run into no problems that are the fault of the hub itself pros  so many ports  plug all the things  easy to use  lightweight and worth every penny  i know it s pricier than other hubs  but worth the extra scratch for its added abilities cons  it gets pretty warm  but hasn t caused any issues so far  also  this is probably a limitation of the mac os and not of the hub itself  but i m unable to plug   monitors into the   hub and able to use   montiors and the laptop screen  i m sure on windows it works much better  but for mac os  you have to have   different hubs  and sometimes it gets confused and doesn t want to display a monitor until a good ole fashioned restart  after that it starts working again  but that s a mac thing  not a hub thing  also  there s a power specific port  and if you try to plug your power into a different usb c port it will not work  just be aware of that overall highly recommend to anyone looking for a high functioning  workhorse of a hub for their office      
166,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       it appears that my monitors and the usb c have a mixed relationship   they appear to have no rhyme or reason as to why they work or do not work the site has no support options   i have emailed the company but we will see  it appeared to work fine  right up until the first time i had to disconnect the usb c  rebooting  resetting monitors to default  all no go connect to the laptop directly and all is well so  i would say it is a good hub  but not a good monitor system  the reason for my purchase      
167,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       now that i work from home with   screens a wireless keyboard  wireless mouse and other usb i have bought several docks   this is the best one  everything connects and work seamlessly  i can also change laptops and all the plug ins run great      
168,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       the hub randomly disconnects  i a hub for   hdmi but wanted to support   monitors  this cannot even support one      
169,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this hub was a great add for my new macbook pro  this is a work laptop and moving from an older macbook that had connections for my monitors  etc  i needed an additional hub for ports for those accessories  easy to use  great storage bag  and does exactly what is needed      
170,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this will legit be the only thunderbolt   adapter you will ever need  it does everything and small and compact  also  its built from high quality materials  it doesn t feel cheap like other products  thank you      
171,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       it works really well  and i love the way it lights up when i plug it into my computer  it s pretty lightweight and i love the pouch it comes with      
172,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       updated review initially  the product had occasional issues where the external monitors were not being detected by my windows   it used to resolve itself after a few unplug replugging   however  recently the hub just stopped working where the external monitors are no longer detected   my other cheaper  single monitor hub works very well so it s unlikely an issue with my laptop windows   it s a pity because i liked this product and needed a hub that supports two external monitors   i would like to get a refund or at least an exchange as the current item stopped working and at best unreliable even if it decides to work again at some point                     i m finally able to use   external monitors in addition to my laptop   this product also comes  with additional ports  which is helpful especially given its compact size   ability to power the laptop using the charging port on this product also means i just need to unplug   cord  this hub  rather than   cords  hub   laptop power  when i take my laptop with me  not a big deal but definitely makes the disconnect reconnect easier i recommend it to anyone looking for a  convenient home working setup      
173,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       overall  this is a great device  the case is metal and feels strong  the network connection supports the gigabit speed of my network  photo attached  and the power pass through port works as well  this will indeed drive   hdmi monitors  have not tried the vga port yet   but at least on mac  the hdmi ports mirror each other  i believe this is a mac limitation due to only one usb port being utilized on the computer and you can see the picture where only   monitors show   the laptop and tiergrade   this can be useful if you need a remote secondary display at another location   like for clients or in a lobby  i m not sure if the vga port will also mirror or show up as another display the fact that this has another usb   port and also has memory card ports make this device a winner      
174,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i have an asus zenbook     and i wanted to have a hub for my desk at home to connect to my monitors and keyboard mouse  i bought this one because the color matches my laptop and it had all the features i wanted  this is a perfect hub  as it allows me to connect everything to my laptop with just one cord  it seems to have good heat dissipation  which is good for large workloads  the machining seems really good and i love the blue color      
175,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       certainly does what it is supposed to do  only concern is the amount of heat that it generates   even when not  in use   just plugged in  had to put it on something heat safe also the chord from device to plug in is incredibly short      
176,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this hub is very useful and convenient because it provides multiple ports   this is perfect for my business trips because it is small and the laptop has very limited ports  but the hub will allow me to connect multiple devices to perform multiple operations      
177,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       great product works well     
178,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i  really excited to get it going  so far  it is working fairly well with my work laptop as a work from home to connect   monitor together  this is a very solid product  i m no expert so i can t speak about data transfer speeds  but all usb ports work  charger works on the thunderbolt port and the hdmi works perfectly too      
179,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this portable hub has everything i need to use for my mobile setup  i can work remotely without worrying about not having enough ports  i like that it has rubber on the bottom so that it doesn t get scratched up or move around on my desk when plugged in  not all hubs have this  i also like that it is heavier than other hubs and feels more sturdy and doesn t just dangle and the color is nice too
