0,1.0,                       i put this on the very smooth wall  it fell off the wall a few days later and stick on velcro was ruined so no way to rehang this  it s also slightly warped as i did add some strong magnets to back of it   the week in it won t let it lay flat enough to stick to the fridge  very disappointed in this product      
1,4.0,                       it s the perfect size for what i needed   just keeping some notes about some studio projects   the back is cardboard  so not the highest quality  but was appropriate for the price   the first board arrived damaged  dent from having something dropped on it  but amazon replaced it quickly and all is well      
2,5.0,                       i use this for doing math  chemistry  and biology problems without going through a bunch of paper  it is the perfect size for working out most problems without having to erase for space  i bought expo dry erase markers  cleaner  and an eraser to use with this pros   easy to clean  does not stain if you use better markers  i suggest not using the one it comes with   easy to hang  although i chose not to   does not show any signs of falling apart or breakingcons   if you use the attached marker and eraser  it does tend to get a bit cloudy looking and stained  so you would have to clean it with water more often      
3,2.0,                       overall it s a okay little marker board  when i got it  it was all dented up and there was two what looked to be like deep scratches to the point  you could see the sliver  this was definitely not for shipping  if i had time to wait around for another one i would have requested another one  but seeing how this one was late to beginning with  i would rather just not deal with the hassle  pictures are included of the damage      
4,4.0,                       the manufacturer claims that there is no ghosting  it may be the dry markers that i am using but  a stain remains when i erase what i had written      
5,3.0,                       for the price i can t gripe too much  but it does not have hanger options  only velcro  so you are limited as the where you can put it it is okay for sticking  via velcro on the refrigerator  but   it should have a loop at the top and side to hang it on a nail  and a fold out leg stand like some table top picture frames have   after all  what do they think we re going to do with it   fridge only      
6,3.0,                       i m really disappointed in the consistency with this white board  i bought   of these for our in home classroom  one is great  it comes clean nicely  no matter how long the marker writing stays on the board the other one  however  will not come clean no matter how much elbow grease i put into it  with soap and water  and lots of pressure  i can eventually get it somewhat clean  but you can still see the remains of the previous writing i m so frustrated with this      
7,3.0,                       i bought these to post information about our day for my    y o husban and my    y o dad  thee boards won t stay on the wall and are very flimsy  i am very disappointed  the boards are now just propped on their dressers  not what i wanted      
8,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          love the board  dislike the marker that comes with it  see my video review to see it in use      
9,5.0,                       i never mounted mine i used it for practice problems in my college classes  let me say for this use it was perfect just the right size and so sturdy  i used many different colors of dry erase markers on this board also and when erasing none of the color lingered behind like how it does sometimes  even with red  dark blue  and green   i was super sturdy and durable and i still love using it to use as a reminder board or practice problems in my other classes  would      recommend      
10,5.0,                       i didn t like the idea of sticking something on my cabinet  so i chose to use command picture hanging method  it worked well  i already had them so it wasn t an additional purchase  so far i haven t had a problem erasing  i got the  x    it fits inside the cabinet next to the calendar  not so many darn post it notes now john s wife     
11,2.0,                       title of the product misleading  i was looking for a dry erase board that could magnetically attach to my metal door and  magnetic dry erase board  i though would fit my needs  if you read the last paragraph in the description you see what it means is that it comes with just a small magnet for you to attach notes to the dry erase    it s a dry erase board  write the note on the board    the board itself actually uses small velcro patches to attach to whatever       
12,3.0,                       unfortunately competitor prefail under failure from all x  pens on both white boards  therefore  i llike the pen magnet and eraser which is useless without the pen writing capability itself  tks anyway     
13,5.0,                       i use this every single day when i teach esl classes online to chinese kids   i write on it with whiteboard markers and also stick magnetized  d props on it to help explain the meaning of a word or concept   works great for me  i plan on ordering a few more      
14,5.0,                       i bought this because my daughter kept having math equations that she needed to solve on video for online learning  this was perfect size for her to handle and worked great      
15,5.0,                       i love the u brands contempo magnetic dry erase board   it s adhesive properties appear to be just that  it sticks without help of external magnets   the mounting magnet strips were easy to apply and so far haven t come loose from the fridge   perfect price  perfect adhesion and perfect sturdiness   this one is a keeper if you know what i mean      
16,3.0,                       i originally got it for my dorm  and when it was time to take things down  the stickiness of the adhesive took part of the wall with it  bummed about that  thankfully didn t get fined  once i moved the whiteboard to my desk  the frame started falling off  i will say that this white board is good for the price and gets the job done  just be careful about the mounting process  a hairdryer to melt the glue i found works      
17,4.0,                       easy to write on and erase   we bought four   x   for our office for notes  collaboration and paper reduction  they were damaged free and work well   the plastic edges won t provide much protection if dropped  the only part i was disappointed with is they come with foam adhesives to hang but no bracket attached or holes on the back to hang      
18,5.0,                       there were no magnetic strips to mount it   had to use my own magnets   yet package said easy mounting  ugh      
19,5.0,                       daughter needed it for school  much sturdier than i expected   magnetic was a bonus  writes nicely and the perfect size   great value for the price  would buy again      
20,3.0,                       i grabbed   of these  cheaper than target so why not   seems pretty cut and dry   nope  these are very cheaply made  the pen clip pops off  the board doesn t erase as others do  it s very flimsy   not pleased with this purchase at all   even at the low price i got it   waste      
21,5.0,                       next to the freezer to organize what s usually a massive chaos of food in a chest freezer  it s always so hard to find things in those types of freezers so we just taking inventory and then mark it off as we use it      
22,5.0,                       we re using this as a visual behavior daily tasks board for our son with asd  with the schools shutting down and his routine completely messed up he needed a visual board to help him      
23,5.0,                       i got this to use while doing my computer science homework  it is great  because it fits in my backpack so i can take it to computer lab too  comes in very handy  i did get a bigger  regular sized eraser to use with it  because if you are constantly writing all over the board the pen eraser gets mucked up  overall  just what i needed      
24,1.0,                       not at all what was advertised  first off  mine didn t come with a marker  there is no way to hang this thing on a wall without a little diy  magnet is cheap as heck for something that looks like it came from a dollar stores discount aisle  don t buy this piece of junk if you need it for work asap like i did  also  i can t add pictures to this for some reason   i can t even get a refund or return this damn thing      
25,5.0,                       i wanted a dry erase board to keep by my computer and desk  this is the perfect size for me  i ve also been pleased because it erases quite well  the marker works nicely  its quite lightweight  easy to hold in your lap too while writing something      
26,1.0,                       had to return this item because the very first use show it to be defective and of very poor quality  i used expo dry erase markers on the board just after it arrived  when i went to erase the board with a dry paper towel  the marks would only erase     and the surface material began bubbling up even with a gentle wipe  i dampened the cloth lightly  i cared about this board lasting me quite awhile  and pressed a little harder  the surface covering bubble more and even tore and the marks did not go away  i appreciated the fast  sturdy shipping  but the product is of very poor quality and was unusable from the very first dry erase streak   disappointed      
27,3.0,                       while i haven t used it yet  i assume the whiteboard itself will work as expected  my problem is the board is warped so much that the adhesive strips barely make contact with the wall  and it kept falling down until i finally took it down  if you re looking for a small whiteboard to carry around in an office to make diagrams or lists  this will probably work  if you re planning to mount it like i was  it may not serve that purpose as well      
28,1.0,                       i bought this for my fridge door  it comes with velcro for hanging so if i want it on my fridge i need to buy adhesive magnets for the back  if     
29,3.0,                       quality doesn t seem to be the best  in the beginning it s perfect but after you erase a few times it becomes blurry and you need to keep cleaning it with a spray and a paper towel      
30,5.0,                       the teacher asks kids to write answers to math problems on a whiteboard to show to her in class  the school provided a coated cardboard surface that quickly collected old marks that could not be erased   in contrast  this board erases cleanly every time  and the included marker writes smoothly    it works as well as expo ones  perhaps even a bit better   the built in eraser on the marker is convenient      
31,5.0,                       i bought this for my home classroom during quarantine  it s a great board  i like the marker holder but it only works with their marker  not the standard dry erase marker  other than that it s perfect     
32,3.0,                       shipping fast  but it was dirty when i received it  but the package wasn t damaged     
33,5.0,                       so i brought the one with the   x    the actual white board size is   x    the frame of each side was   inch  but it was still bigger than expected  it s prolly because the price was cheap  everything was nice except i didn t like the color of the magnet  i was expecting it to be white or sum like shown in the picture  but i can deal with it i guess  it s nice for the price  and you can use it as a clipboard too by the help of the magnet  i didn t wanna hang it up because i want to hold it when i m doing those math problems  sigh     
34,4.0,                       i bought this white board to use for writing down garment measurements for my poshmark listings   i just dot down the measurements  snap a photo of them  and then upload that photo as part of my listing   saves me a lot of time  and this whiteboard is the perfect size for my needs   i had to take off one star because the board doesn t wipe completely clean without some real elbow grease   but other than that  it s great for my purpose   and the marker it came with has plenty of ink  so that was a bonus      
35,3.0,                       very cheap price and works great  except product description is intentionally misleading  maybe because shared between   different products    this has nothing magnetic  even though it says magnet like   x  it s worthless velcro  the smaller board has magnetic attachmentd  it s a great deal  but the pen thing was bent and doesn t stay on  i wanted a magnet  the velcro doesn t work  but the board and marker are great  total steal for the price      
36,2.0,                       i bought this for my son  because he needed a whiteboard for class to help with online learning  the white plastic border that holds the board and its backing immediately fell apart  and are a continuous hassle to put back together  it s a huge distraction for my son when he s trying to write down math problems and the dang thing keeps falling apart with the slightest nudge  i m usually pretty generous with my reviews  but this is unacceptable pros are that it comes with a marker  and that the board does what it s supposed to to with regards to erasing cleanly etc      
37,3.0,                       these are ok  my kids are rough on this but even so this should have lasted longer than   week before the end breaking off  they still function  but don t look great  the marker it comes with is junk  buy your own      
38,3.0,                       i didn t like it when i first bought it the marker wouldn t completely erase off the board so it made it look so ugly but i realized that when i used other markers they worked just fine so i think it s the marker that comes with it is no good so i just use other markers i didn t feel like returning it and my daughter uses it for her chore list     
39,5.0,                       bought this for taking the gre online  since they don t let you use scrap paper it s small enough that it s not unwieldy  but big enough that you don t have to erase for every question      
40,4.0,                       i purchased this white board to better track work projects    i needed something that was large enough to track multiple projects with numerous sub steps but still portable  this board was perfect   i would recommend a better marker    it is a little hard to write clearly and the eraser just doesn t cut it  the magnetic portion is simply some tape  i wish it was built into the white board itself  still for the price the white board perfectly fit the bill      
41,3.0,                       this dry erase board is  ok  and only because it was less than     if you erase fresh ink  then it s fine  but if you wrote on it an hour ago  it will not erase at all  i had to get a rag dipped in alcohol to remove all marks that we were written earlier in the day  which is not practical at all it s not the marker  because i tried that on a different board and it erased fine hours later  i ve also tried better quality markers on this board and even they wouldn t erase after an hour  since most people are not erasing as soon as they write something  i d say this is more like a  wet erase board  than anything  i would not recommend this board      
42,1.0,                       the whiteboard came completely warped and didn t hang flat  so the sticky parts wouldn t touch the surface on two corners  also  just  be aware that this does not have magnets on the back  my fault for not reading the description closer  i was looking for something to hang on my fridge      
43,3.0,                       the board is bent slightly making it impossible to go on a fridge straight and stay on    there are stickies on the back   not magnets  so that part is mis advertising  bought additional magnetic tape  even then the shape of the board is defected and the board would not stay  i threw away the packaging  otherwise would return  flimsy product  i guess  you get what you pay for      
44,5.0,                       needed a small ish white board for daily notes and such  works great for what i need it for      
45,1.0,                       it s definitely cheap  it s not even when laid on a flat surface and the marker doesn t just wipe away  it smudges and you have to use a wet cloth to actually get the marks off  even when you have just barely written something  it still doesn t come off very well      
46,5.0,                       cheap dry erase boards quickly become tracked with ink in the pores of the board   this dry erase board has remained in excellent condition and it is used daily   very smooth surface  reasonably sturdy  and a couple of extra double sided tape holds it to the mounting surface securely   price is more than some but it has been worth every penny because of the top quality   highly recommended      
47,3.0,                       it holds up alright  but the included marker and eraser will often not erase cleanly  and will leave streaks  so be sure to use a wet cloth to clean it every once in a while  to keep it clear  the marker is quite alright  and lasts a long time  i like that it clicks into the side of the whiteboard      
48,1.0,                       the term  magnetic  led me to believe this would stick to my fridge using magnets right  nope  this uses adhesive to stick to the fridge wall which  to be fair  adhesive is most likely more sturdy than magnets  however  i don t want to use adhesive on my fridge due to residue  i also like to be able to move my white board around  which i cannot easily do with adhesive           
49,1.0,                       these dry erase board are good for kids while doing virtual learning  they are sturdy  the only bad thing is that once the plastic cover that does around the board falls off you can t put it back on  then the corners of the board can hurt you  you would have to somehow bend the corners so they don t poke thru      
50,5.0,                       this has been great and really helpful during online schooling  it is small enough that my daughter can hold it during her online class and hold it up for people to see  it is lightweight  but large enough for her to have fun drawing      
51,5.0,                       this has really helped keep our food shopping streamlined  it is not cheap looking   we take a picture before we head out and voila  simplification  no more guessing what we may have and what we may need      
52,5.0,                       white board is a great size  i use this this to write my weekly schedule out for my family so they don t ask me    times a day about what i m doing the next day  and this is perfect for that  it s the perfect size for all the days of the week to fit on and give me enough space to add notes and such  the velcro strips that come with is aren t the best for adhering as they ve popped off my door a couple times but it s fine the next time it happens i ll probably just buy some command strips  the market that comes with is works great      
53,4.0,                       my son needed this for distance learning   thank gosh we found this just in time for school  the marker works great   my favorite part is the sturdy eraser nub  it s stiff and not flimsy like others we have had in the past  the only thing is that he did drop the board and it dented      
54,5.0,                       great little dry erase board   not cheaply made   my only complaint is i wish the mounting system was a little better   i would have liked to have mounted this to my fridge using magnets   this has adhesive velcro   i don t want to stick adhesive onto my fridge   so i left it not mounted   not sure how it would stick on my wall   i don t want it to take the paint off if i try to move it   it comes with a little magnet and a dry erase marker   the dry erase marker has a little fabric to erase the marker on the board   again my only complaint is not having magnets to mount on my fridge     
55,1.0,                       i have been using this to teach school from home  the dry erase markers do not erase well  no matter what the color  and now the board is all bumpy   as  if the magnetic layer is buckling under the whiteboard layer  i waited   weeks for this to be delivered and it s going  in the garbage  do not buy this if you plan to use it every day      
56,5.0,                       i purchased this knowing that i would most likely have to purchase mounting hardware to hang in on the outside of my kitchen cabinet  however  much to my surprise  it came with   precut velcro pads that i was able to use to hang it on my fridge  they hold up very well on that surface so far with my son  husband  and myself constantly grabbing the marker and adding things to the grocery list  love it and i m glad that i purchased it      
57,5.0,                       this board is great while my  th grader is schooling virtually  he writes out math problems with the marker provided and it s easy to clean   we use a little microfiber cloth as the tip to the pen can erase but is small  very happy with our purchase  thank you      
58,3.0,                       its the perfect size   i wanted this for my kids room to write chores  notes   etc  but for some reason it keeps falling off the wall   the velcro stick part is not strong enough   but i found a way to keep it on the wall without falling   so we good now    would love another one        
59,5.0,                       i m a school transportation driver and when i pick up students i m not allowed to remove my mask  school staff will come to my car and ask whom i m picking up  finally got tired of repeating my self so this will come in handy as i just jot down their names   saves me time and paper      
60,5.0,                       i use mine for teaching esl online  it s perfect for when i need to demonstrate english concepts using magnetic letters  it s easy and durable when traveling  too  it s sturdy and has survived multiple trips in my suitcase  land and air       
61,5.0,                       this simple product has made my life easier  it s on my fridge  i don t have to hunt for post its  it also saves paper  i snap a photo before i leave of my grocery list  and i also leave a chore list at the bottom      
62,4.0,                       this item is great however had to buy magnets to put on my refrigerator  and the marker it came with was dried out completely and didn t work  thank goodness i had my own markers already     
63,5.0,                       great for school work and household notes  we bought them for help with virtual learning for my  th grader  we also bought to help prep my preschooler for school  they loved drawing with them so much we bought for our vehicles for them to draw when they want too  great size  easy to clean easy to store      
64,2.0,                       i like how easily it wipes off and it looks nice   cute little magnet too   unfortunately  it doesn t stick   it s now on the floor beside the fridge  waiting for me to fish it out from between the cabinets   this is the second time that happened  so i give up   i just ordered a different type board   i hate that i wasted money on this one      
65,5.0,                       great white board that s also magnetic  we did not mount it so i can t speak to how good that is  but it did come with everything needed      
66,3.0,                       i ordered the dry erase board to keep track of projects at work  it will do fine for what i need  but it arrived today in what i would describe as  imperfect  condition  there is tape and gunk stuck all over the board  when you receive something new  you expect it to be in peak condition so i am disappointed to say the least      
67,5.0,                       i had got my first board broken  i let the company know  and they sent me a another one free of charge  thats awesome  thank you  and it works like a black board should  my only complaint  i may inject  is the stickers on the back arent super sticky  i would recommend putting another type of adhesive or something on it before putting it on the surface you are placing it  i cleaned my wall  and put it on there  but fell after a while      
68,5.0,                       i m thankful i stumbled across this magnetic dry erase board  writing on my walls was starting to get out of hand  and i figured purchasing a white board would be much cheaper than purchasing new paint every couple weeks  why i didn t think of that sooner  we ll never know  seriously  my house started to look like the movie      with jim carrey  horrible movie  but you get the point   more than anything my mom and dad thank you      
69,4.0,                       as a nutrition major who has to take a lot of chemistry courses  i bought this to help me learn structures and reactions  i love it it s the perfect size to even throw into my oversized purse  it hangs out a little   if i m going to the library or local coffee shop to study i m giving this a good review because it s about the board   however  u brands markers smell strong  as someone with chronic migraines  i can t even use them because they trigger a migraine  not knocking them because of that  just warning anyone else out there sensitive to chemical smells   also  the marker stays super wet on the board for a long period of time so i m always smudging everything and getting marker on myself overall  great little cheap board but do yourself a favor and get fine tip expo markers and an expo eraser      
70,4.0,                       i like it  i planned to put this one on the wall  i can write notes directly on it or hang lists on it with the magnets so i can see my list and take the lists with me  i hung it up with command so i could remove it easily and not ruin the paint  it comes with double sided foam to permanently attach to a vertical surface  i like that the magnet doubles as a tiny cork board      
71,4.0,                       the round magnet that comes with it came apart the second i picked it up  the frame looks a little cheap quality too of course with this price point you can t expect much better than this  for      it s worth it  it s not falling apart or anything like that  but it s more practical than pretty the dry erase marker works great  i love that it has the eraser at its end instead of that being separate      
72,5.0,                       i have been using this on the wall next to my desk at work to help with scheduling and other tracking needs  very handy and the price was another selling point  the marker it comes with feel good and not one of the cheap ones  i wish it would have come with a couple other colors as well that clip along side the black but this is a great product even without it      
73,4.0,                       these are pretty good  but the quality is definitely lacking  the boards are easily dented   in fact  i was sent three  and all three of them were dented in some way before i even opened the packaging   one was particularly bad so i had it replaced   i am using them for photography  so this was a big deal to me   the makers are also pretty useless  one was dried up upon arrival   we have other  better  markers  though  and the boards have been able to be used for my purposes  so i m thankful i was able to get them at a lesser price than competitors      
74,5.0,                       needed this super quick due to school being online this year  it light weight but not flimsy  comes with pen  which has eraser on it  and a magnet as well  decent for the price and easy for my   year old to handle and show his work to the teacher on video calls      
75,3.0,                       the white board itself is decent quality  for the price point i really didnt expect nothing more  it was disappointing that the marker was completely dry when i unpacked it and tried to write on the white board  so i had to buy some  other than that  it was a reasonable price for the whiteboard         
76,5.0,                       yes an old cotton made pair of briefs  great board      
77,1.0,                       after around      months of very less use  this board now is useless  the eraser won t clear the ink and hence i used water in a paper towel to wipe clean which worked for a while  but now i get poor watermark when i try to write  and the letters disappear in a while rendering the lot product utterly useless  it s cheap so can t expect great quality  but i would go for a better one even if it costs a extra few bucks      
78,5.0,                       my wife has a problem with short term memory so we bought this to go in the bathroom on the mirror  it was easy to install and has yet to come off  it was a great price and worth getting  now she has a constant reminder to do something whenever she goes into the bathroom      
79,5.0,                       ordered this so i can make grocery or errand lists without having to have a piece of paper lying around  i had to use some special magnetic sheets     stacked together for added thickness  to enable this to mount to the fridge magnetically rather than sticking velcro the fridge door  it s worked out well and even my husband approves  he s very low clutter and i was afraid he d find it on the front of the fridge as messy and unattractive  i haven t used any other color marker than the black that came with it  but i ve had no issues cleaning it  it s just the right size too      
80,5.0,                       bought two one for me and one for the student works out excellent for her daily schedule and the other for notes     
81,2.0,                       i haven t used this yet  but i m pretty disappointed  miffed even  with how this board fastens to the refrigerator  the quartet i had  that became too small  had adhesive to attach the pads to the back of the board  and magnets to attach it to the refrigerator  this has adhesive on both sides  with velcro in between  for some inexplicable reason   so that you have to adhere it to the fridge  and it even states in fine print in the instructions that the adhesive may damage some surfaces  great  what are they thinking  did see that in the listing      
82,5.0,                       this is a great mousepad and is worth the premium from the qck   it feels very high quality and the surface has a little bit more friction making it better for tracking in my opinion  the braided edges are nice and this feels like it will last much longer than the steelseries      
83,5.0,                       this has been perfect for my son to use for digital learning  he uses it on zoom calls and for  scratch paper  during math lessons  it was recommended by the school because of our current situation with digital learning  but i can see this becoming a must have for every school supply list and every situation  great to have      
84,5.0,                       got it for my daughters homework  i haven t seen the product because i got to deliver to the mothers house but my daughter loves it so it s a good product she plays on it almost every day  and for school stuff to     
85,3.0,                       the white board is great if you want it for the kids and don t care about looks  it came with a few dents straight out of the packaging  shown in the circles i drew  the back feels like a piece of a cardboard box  can easily be bent  i am using it for homework as i don t care if it s the best quality but i feel like this board will last me a month or two till i ll have to buy another one      
86,4.0,                       i for some reason thought this came with a magnet  but it did not  the sticky tape seems to work fine so far and i just went ahead and put it on my fridge  so hopefully it eventually comes off without leaving a bad mark  but i would have preferred a magnet  the marker is nice quality and everything seems to work just fine  we ve had no quality writing or erasing easily      
87,4.0,                       to fit on my cabinet at work  remembering things it s always so easy   this white board fits right over my head so i can jot down meeting schedules as they pop up   sticky tape didn t work in the middle as the board has too much curve   of course the thing fell off the cabinet when i wasn t around and scared everyone  fortunately  i happened to have some sticky velcro that i attached to the outer edges and that worked like a charm      
88,3.0,                       the board itself is fine  the backing is cardboard  so i don t think this would be a good choice for heavy use  but it suits my residential application just fine  the tape that was included for hanging was worse than useless  it fell down in the middle of the first night  nothing was damaged  but i needed to get new double sided tape overall  well worth the price      
89,5.0,                       i bought this for my    year old aunt who s    year old husband is very hard of hearing  she loves it  it is the perfect size to keep near her chair  hold in her lap   write and show it to her hubby in the next chair all while saving her voice  she can write  erase  repeat   not have to yell  a win win win       
90,1.0,                       bought this board for my little brother to practice his multiplication and division on and when it arrived  the box was fine but the white board itself was bent  the frame was cracked in multiple places and it had scuff marks as well  hopefully the replacement will be fine      
91,5.0,                       we bought this for use during virtual learning and have used it daily while saving notebook paper   we use a scrap piece of fabric to wipe it off as the little eraser on the market isn t very efficient  but a great buy all in all      
92,1.0,                       i bought   of these for my kids for remote learning  the box came completely smashed and the whiteboards inside were bent in half  definitely disappointed in the quality  better off getting one at walmart or target  heck even the dollar store had better quality stuff      
93,3.0,                       i was a little leery that the board would stay on the wall with the adhesive velcro that came with it  it sticks to the cardboard backing of the whiteboard just fine  but fell off the wall after about   days  scaring the bleeding life out of me and my dog  the board itself is good  but i would recommend trying to mount it with something other than the adhesive velcro it comes with  or at least try a different surface than i did  which was a painted drywall   magnetic tape might be a good option to strap it to a fridge  or a small wall hook      
94,5.0,                       i love it  it comes with velcro pads you can use to stick it to a wall or fridge door  be sure to clean the surface you are installing to   i put mine on the fridge door   the velco stuck well and has held up to removing the board a couple of times   it also comes with   dry erase pen      
95,4.0,                       great to write down quick ideas or a small script when making our pokemon based web show  this board has really come in handy   helped us be better prepared  the marker holder broke off the first day we used it  so not so sure about that aspect   also there is no mount to put this on the wall or hang anything from  you might need to buy some double sided tape or possibly something to poke in the back so you could hang a chain or string to hang from a nail or something  other than that it serves our purpose   i gave our reason for using it   our needs in case anyone else a has similar situation  perfect size      
96,2.0,                       we didn t get the marker or clip  not worth it to return at this price point and i have other markers  but grrr      
97,4.0,                       i give this four stars cuz it s very inexpensive  but some little nit pickiness   the dry erase marker dried up within a few days       i ordered some expo dry erase markers which are great  came with a big eraser  because the erase on the marker that comes with the kit is very small  the marker holder on the board doesn t fit them  i tried to do my own little fix and force bend it and applying a bit of heat with a lighter which kind worked to tighten up the holder so it can hold the thinner expo dry erase   there s a little magnet thing i guess to mark if you have a to do  the plastic falls of easily  and the magnet remains but with the sticky side  i guess you could add more adhesive or somethin   the cap of the dry erase marker gives the impression that you can put it on the back like a pen  and it slips in but falls out easily   the adhesive it comes with seem reasonable  i did put it on the back  but i haven t removed the cover to stick it on anything     
98,4.0,                       nice whiteboard  a good size  marker gets trapped around the plastic frame  can t be easily cleaned when too close to frame  but otherwise good construction  i like that it s magnetic      
99,1.0,                       we thought this was magnetic  with magnets on the back  but only the surface was magnetic  i had to glue on magnets to the back to use  unless you want to risk damaging your refrigerator with the velcro strips  you would need to glue magnets on  otherwise it s a good whiteboard  the description was just a little misleading      
100,3.0,                       it serves its purpose as intended  but it already fell off of my refrigerator after day    the magnet also fell off of the board  the adhesive is not as good as it needs to be in order to make this product reliable  i m going to try super glue      
101,5.0,                       it s small and that is exactly what i wanted  the larger the board  the more cluttered it gets in this house  no issues with packaging or broken parts upon arrival  clean and dry any flat surface you use the stickers on these  pins          acrylic magnetic push pins   assorted colors   perfect magnet set for fridge and refrigerator  whiteboards  dry erase boards  maps and teachers                        work great on the board      
102,5.0,                       i bought this as part of my son s school supplies for this year as we are doing a virtual learning option from home due to covid  it is very sturdy  just the right size  and comes with a dry erase marker that has an attached eraser and clips onto the board      
103,1.0,                       i received this small white board  magnets do not stick very well  which is what i bought it for  and along the   of the side the board it warped  definitely not what i expected      
104,5.0,                       i bought this to use in my daughter s virtual classroom at home  she loves it  i use it to write down the daily class schedule      
105,1.0,                       i must have misread the item  it is magnetic yes  but it doesn t come with magnets to stick onto your fridge  it comes with double sided adhesive velcro  so you have to permanently attach velcro to your fridge  or wherever you want this  if you want to hang it  or you can purchase double sided magnet strips yourself  but the board is not all that sturdy  and it s warped  so it doesn t fit flush against the fridge surface anyway      
106,5.0,                       this is a great product for the price  i bought this because if was very cheap and soon found out this is what i needed all along  this whiteboard sticks in my room really nice and doesn t take up any room  i write my homework anything that is upcoming that i need to do  every time i wake up i see what is on my list  i would have loved if there was a clip that holds papers but i can live without it  this product is really worth it  the marker last quite a long time  i usually use a bounty tissue to clean the board  this board is amazing  would recommend if you are a college student or someone that is unorganized   this comes in handy      
107,5.0,                       i like being able to customize decorations by hanging baby pictures with the magnets  the marker works nicely and erases clean      
108,3.0,                       the board mounts well but has fine lines in the surface  meaning the surface is not absolutely smooth  after erasing the residue sticks between lines  also the eraser on the pen is not upto the mark     
109,3.0,                       i ordered this item thinking it came with magnetic strips so i could put on my refrigerator  nope  it comes with velcro strips  i now have to buy magnetic strips separately just to use it the way i originally intended  other than that  product is light weight  comes with one small magnet that attaches to the dry erase board  and a dry erase pen      
110,4.0,                       unfortunately mine had a small scuff when i opened it  i can t seem to remove the scuff  works fine otherwise  feels cheap ish but gets the job done  nothing fancy      
111,4.0,                       i purchased this as a needed   minimum quality required item    for daily notes  quick sketches of ideas   such  the included black marker   eraser tip work just fine  i use a paper towel to erase large drawings etc  with no problem in clean removals i see others have expected  and not received their greater expectancies   colors etc    dunno    my needs were are met for the priceframe involved      
112,3.0,                       got this in spring of      for the sudden transition from school to online learning due to covid     unfortunately  it the edges started to peel of   mos later and i attempted to glue back together but have had to replace it  it was not tossed around  beat on   or played with  strictly used for education      
113,2.0,                       the borders are very cheaply glued on  they fell off the same day we got them  my boys use them for school so they still serve their purpose  just would have been nice if i didn t have to re glue something that is brand new      
114,5.0,                       this works well for our needs  this board has reduced arguments my boyfriend insists it is helpful to see a list of things to do as opposed to being told verbally  we have tried handwritten paper lists and iphone apps  and this works better for us hey whatever gets the dishes done  right      
115,5.0,                       just came to share that the board has a protective wrapping over it that you have to remove before trying to write erase on it  i also thought  like many other reviews  that it was not erasing well  then i realized there is an extra layer of plastic wrapping covering the board that must be removed before attempting to write erase on it  this is after removing the outer plastic wrapping   now it works perfectly      
116,4.0,                       this is an exact copy of what i bought from big lots for about the same price around two years ago  it s a white board with some metal under it so you can stick magnetic things to it  not much more needs to be said  the surface is a little bit difficult to clear off completely  especially with weeks  worth of marker drying out and attempting to merge with the board  but it does the trick just fine for taking notes that have to be cleared out at the end of a call  if you just need a simple whiteboard for your desk or fridge  go for it  it s not too expensive  and it s a great choice for just quick notes  maybe there are      whiteboards out there  but they won t deliver much better than this  you won t  however  use the included magnet  i promise  it s incredibly weak  and you d do better with some kind of rare earth magnet  possibly some spheres that are small enough to carry a lot of them it s worth the price  but don t expect a miracle  it does its job perfectly fine  but the whiteboard paint comes off pretty easily with any metallic objects like  say  magnets      
117,2.0,                       the velcro stickers will not stick to the wall and will only last so long on your fridge   mine lastef about a week  so  if you have those textured type of walls where the paint is sorta in small globs and not flat  at least in my experience  it will not stick  i will need to buy a hook for it to work on my bedroom wall where i wanted it initially  and now for my fridge  you get what you pay for here guysalso  the marker it came with works does the job but the eraser is small and after only a few times of using it  it s almost     saturated do yourself a favor and get a bigger eraser because the residue will fall off the board and onto your floor      
118,1.0,                       product was previously used  you can clearly see marker marks at the edges from previous use  check your items before shipping out to costumers  especially since we are currently dealing with covid         
119,1.0,                       the board i received was warped so that the top right portion wouldn t lie flat  the included adhesive on the velcro didn t last the weekend before the board had fallen on the ground  i knew i should have used  lb adhesive tape  erasable surface was fine and include pen and eraser worked      
120,1.0,                       this dry erase board is magnetic  in that magnets will stick to it   it does not come with anything to make it stick to a refrigerator   i bought adhesive magnets and they do not stick to the cardboard backing of the dry erase board   total junk if you intend to use it on the refrigerator like i did   waste of money      
121,4.0,                       this is pretty useful to have by your side   sure paper isn t hard to find  and computers have notepad software etc  but the simplicity and readiness of this simple little board beats those mentioned in many regards   and the notes stay current and in your face until they re completed or obsolete   i d say this is one of the top    most useful things to have around for the thinking man s  fill in your gender  hq   you may not use it day    but keep it close and you re bound to see it fill up   as for this one  so far so good   erases clean enough with both the cork square and the eraser cap  and the pen writes well   i d give it a   if it didn t feel like a cheap plastic rectangle  but for what it is    you don t need some titanium edged bedazzled frame to get use out of it      
122,5.0,                       awesome white board for the price  comes with a dry erase marker with an eraser on the cap  a magnet to hold up paper  and some adhesives to stick on to the walls  some reviews state that the adhessives come off over time  but i have had no issue with that in the past month  overall great investment for a cheap whiteboard        
123,4.0,                       these white boards are very useful and economical  there were no warping or dent issues with the board that i received the magnet that comes with the white board is just a magnet  not an eraser  also  the pen dries out very fast  but so do the thin markers from expo  so this is to be expected for the next white board i get  i will look for one without a raised frame  as the erased bits get caught up in the frame edges  no real complaints though  it has been workibg great      
124,4.0,                       hi  ok here it goes   this doesn t have magnets built in   just has a metal structure for magnets to stick too   the construction is very good and will not degrade   the white face is made out of a completely thick piece of polymer and does not let marker bleed through it clean up is awesome and would recommend this product compared to the poor quality versions competing against this  i would suggest purchasing good quality magnets and adhering them to the back of the whiteboard to stick to your fridge dont try the others  not worth your time honestly      
125,5.0,                       as a college student  i have had this board for about a year now and use it almost daily  it really comes in handy when i am going over course material with my classmates as we can discuss the topics over the whiteboard instead of using paper to jot down notes after a year now  the material has started to degrade it a little bit though  most recently i have been using a purple marker and every time i erase  the board has a slight purple hue  thinking it was the marker s fault  i switched to an orange marker  but then the board started having orange hue  still works great though  for the price listed  i give it     stars      
126,5.0,                       it works  nice shiny finish  clean rounded corners not really suitable for on your lap use as the backing is just cardboard but great for mounting      
127,2.0,                       ok so it is an effective dry erase board  however i couldn t get it to stay on the divider i was using for virtual learning  so we started using it handheld  then the edging started coming off  we ended up getting a replacement from the school      
128,5.0,                       my husband is very very hard of hearing  so i thought writing things down would be helpful and i didn t want to keep looking for paper to use so using this dry wipe board solved the problem      
129,5.0,                       this product is stylish and fits in a backpack  this was meant as a mini whiteboard for my school supplies  and it does not disappoint  it is the right size to fit all my work  but also not too big that it becomes too bulky  i would recommend this product      
130,3.0,                       did not come with clip to hold the marker although in the packaging it said it was included  i thought it would stick on to the refrigerator magnetically but it doesn t  instead it comes with cheap pieces of velcro to stick on to it  these pieces of velcro leave behind pieces of black dust every time i touch them      
131,3.0,                       included pen stopped working almost immediately same pen left some marks that aren t coming off pen clip is awkwardboard is a good size for kitchen notes and lists     
132,5.0,                       since this is the year of virtual school  my kiddo needed a small white board to keep by her desk in our office  this one is sleek  works well  and comes with a little magnet  price is better than any i ve seen in school supply stores  i purchased a pack of dry erase markers for her so she could color code assignments or whatever she needed and then i used command strips to  very easily  hang the board next to her desk  it s perfect and she s said that it s really helpful to have it for what we needed  it was definitely a good find      
133,5.0,                       needed an extra space to post dr appointment notices instead of totally plastering the fridge   i purchased some stronger magnets to hold the cards and papers which was the only problem we encountered      
134,4.0,                       this is a very good and reasonably priced dry erase board   the front is a glossy  magnetic white surface and the backing is cardboard   it comes complete with a magnet  a black dry erase marker with eraser cap and although we have not affixed this to a wall  velcro mounting pieces are on the back   my kids play games in the basement which often require keeping score or they watch sports games and try to predict the outcome beforehand  so after what seemed like them using several thousand pieces of computer paper or sticky notes to do those things  we picked up this dry erase board so less paper was wasted   for that purpose it works great   the black marker sometimes deposits in a manner that gets left behind after dry erasing  so periodically a baby wipe or wet paper towel across the surface is needed   otherwise this works well      
135,5.0,                       i bought several of these for my kids to use for homeschool  they get daily use and have lasted great  they wipe off clean      
136,5.0,                       like  very easy to write and erase  leaving no color marks  lightweight  simple  good value dislike  not robust  cheap material  the back is made of cardboard  but does not affect functionin general  worth more than the price  good value  will recommend to friends      
137,5.0,                       instead of using notebook paper everyday at work  i swapped to this guy to save paper  i literally use it every day  it has held up well except for the   piece velcro stickers that it comes with  i only have   left on the wall from constant use  the marker it comes with is not very good  i bought the    colors magnetic whiteboard markers by shuttle art and those have worked the best for me  i do love the convenience of it so i bought a second one for home too  great for family reminders or daily menus      
138,1.0,                       was so excited to get this whiteboard today for my son to use for school  i let him open it and draw on it right away  first with the black marker it came with  but it didn t wipe off well  he used a whiteboard cleaner on it  expo  then drew on it with a red expo dry erase marker  the first pic is what it looked like when he tried to erase       second pic shows the pink hue that remains even after using the cleaner and a rag on it  don t even know how this will work for school      
139,5.0,                       my daughter  years  is learning to write  which is how my husband came up with the idea of purchasing a white board for her for the ease of writing on it    basically learning the white board came with a  black dry erase pen   four velcro stickers undoubtedly  its light weight  very handy and easy to carry  oftentimes  my daughter keeps the board in her lap   keep writing or painting  the dry erase pen accompanied with the board has a tiny duster eraser on top moreover  the board is around    inch tall      inch wide  im glad we bought this product  m sure its gonna be equally helpful for parents teachers students artists literally anyone      
140,4.0,                       i appreciate being able to have a small whiteboard to write and draw on  and i appreciate the pen and pen holder it comes with   i will say that the marker that holds the pen on the top of the board is fragile and will break after a bad drop  but so far the board s held up well      
141,5.0,                       i had bought this for my refrigerator  but it s not magnetic  it s a mount with adhesive stickers  so it s on the back of my door with reminder notes on it  it does have   magnetic button     
142,4.0,                       it s good but wish a little more thicker around the edges  otherwise  it s durable  my kid just using to take note for virtual      
143,5.0,                       i teach online courses and use this board occasionally in my recorded video lectures  but also when video chatting with my students  this is a good size    x    for using in these environments as it is big enough to write examples and explain concepts to hold up to the camera  the marker that comes with it is average  at best  i would definitely recommend purchasing name brand markers if you plan to use the board in a professional setting      
144,1.0,                       i thought this was a magnetic chalkboard that you could put on your refrigerator  it is not  it s not the sturdiest  i ordered two of them and one of them was missing the clip that holds the marker  do not recommend this      
145,4.0,                       we use this primarily  for reminders and our baby s meal menu for the nanny   my only complaint is that the marker that s included doesnt wipe that cleanly   we usually have to spray and wipe  other than that  we use the command strips to attach it to the wall and it s been good      
146,1.0,                       i thought this would be a magnetic white board that stuck to a magnetic surface  but that s not the case  it has sticky prices that stick to the fridge and damage it      
147,4.0,                       the product looked like it s been in a wearhouse  for a long time i did not mount it i m going to use it for school     
148,4.0,                       my son is using this on this virtual school calls   the little clip at the top that holds the marker broke off but overall good project      
149,5.0,                       we love this thing  magnets are easy to put on install  we have it our fridge  so that we all know what the week s dinner plans are  whether it s good home cooking or we re going out somewhere  exactly the reason the i bought it  the dry erase marker works great  the eraser is good  the plastic clips that holds the marker on the top is good  the little magnetic coark piece is good  it s all good  buy this      
150,5.0,                       great addition to my elderly father s door  i use it to leave notes for his aid of medicine that needs renewed to supplies that are running out      
151,4.0,                       our kid uses it for remote school and it has survived a month without breaking so give that much credit  i think it would be too small for any adult use unless you writing is small  comes with a small magnet but have not really used it      
152,2.0,                       the surface warps and gets dented far too easily   the slickness of the surface is such that the ink actually moves pools through what i m guessing is a cohesive force   so the words i write become warped over time into illegible lists   i have to keep writing over them to be able to keep them legible erases well though   so i guess if you had to use it for very short term lists it d be fine      
153,5.0,                       came with   markers  red  green  blue  black  and a magnet  each marker has a built in eraser  can be hung two ways that came with it  and a  rd way but requires additional parts  over all happy with purchase      
154,2.0,                       great board  erases easilyupdated  it was great for about a month or    then  the pen wouldn t work well   other dry erase pens smeared when trying to erase  using the recommended cleaning didn t help either      
155,5.0,                       met my needs  used to write a permanent  message very little erase   rewrite required for what i used it for      
156,3.0,                       feels pretty cheap  fell off the painted wall once and the plastic  frame  came loose and i had to slide it back in place which wasn t easy  i recommend using your own command strips or whatever  not the things that come with it  also don t take the marker holder off if you want to use it  its way too hard to put back on      
157,4.0,                       it works for my kids virtual school  it s good for the price but if your kids handle it roughly the edges will come off  my little one kind of took it apart in two weeks  older one has it perfect  so depends  but both are still using it and i would say that s good for the price i paid      
158,1.0,                       i just took it out of the package  i started on my flashcards and tried to erase the writing and it smeared everywhere  did not erase cleanly  i actually looked to make sure my marker was a dry erase marker   but no matter what marker i used i am left with writing all over the board  words cannot describe how crappy this product is  it s as if this is no dry erase coating on the board at all  maybe i got a defective product      
159,2.0,                       i got this for my daughter s school locker  it turns out to be slightly to big to fit on the inside door panel  so i wanted to return it  unopened btw  and then i got this when i tried to  this item isn t eligible for returnfor safety reasons  items containing flammable liquids or gases can t be returned to amazon  for more information or help  please contact us  what   you can ship it too me  but i can t ship it back   glad it was only            
160,4.0,                       this is great for writing little reminders and keeping track of household bills and such  it comes with four velcro strips that stick to the surface you want to place the board  the only issue is that once the strips have been stuck in place  they are a bit difficult to get off  the board itself can detach  but the four strips will need to be replaced when we move and take the board with us  marker works well and hasn t run out in over five months  board fits on the top half of our refrigerator door and isn t very heavy or bulky  took about five minutes to put together and hang it up      
161,5.0,                       i bought this to write down the workouts we are doing at the gym  it is the perfect size  and the marker that it came with works great  i love it  and would definitely buy again      
162,2.0,                       this will do the trick  but   of the   boards i purchased are slightly damaged   i do not believe its worth the hassle of returning and buying new ones  so i just let me nieces use these for fun as it ll probably get damaged anyway   it is very light and a bit cheapy feel it serves it purpose  but would not recommend as   out of   boards i purchased are damaged      
163,4.0,                       took off a star because you will have to rig up a way to hang it  it doesnt have any type of mounting bracket on the back  other than that great product   perfect size to write a todo list or grocery list then just take a pic with my phone  i found i manage time better and get more done thanks to this  i can also write down important dates and appointments so im not keeping a bunch of papers laying around      
164,5.0,                       i like how easy it is to install  got a new fridge after a month of having it mounted on my fridge  therefore i had to transfer my board along with the adhesive strips to my new fridge  in hopes it ll stick again and it did  it transferred nicely and has been working great for our family      
165,5.0,                       i bought this for online grad school  easy to wipe and glides very smoothly with any markers and leaves no stains behind      
166,5.0,                       i bought a couple of these at a local meijer store   liked the quality of them  i don t live close enough to the meijer to go more than once a wk so i checked on amazon  i have prime   was able to get in under   days so i decided to buy this way  i plan to use this one for a grocery list which i will take a pic of before i leave my house to do shopping each week      
167,3.0,                       great product except the marker already died  we have extra markers so that s no problem  but they don t fit in the holder which made it convenient  also the little tip eraser on the marker is good for little mistakes but erasing the whole board you re better off with a paper towel      
168,2.0,                       the board itself is magnetic  but you can t have it stick to a fridge  the adhesive they give you is like   velcro strips mine came with damage on the back  but no one sees that part  it s cheaper than i expected  and i have to go out and buy magnets for on the back  i would have assumed  magnetic dry erase board  meant that the back was magnetic  especially because one of the recent reviews said it came with magnetic strips  but mine did not i was disappointed  but not so much to return it  i ll just buy some strips to put on the back and see if that works      
169,5.0,                       how do you review a dry erase board  for one it sticks to the wall without issue  huge for me because i ve purchased more expensive ones that fall down  i use one in my kitchen for a to do list  and erase it all the time using a little mrs  meyers and a tiny bit of water on a paper towel  works great  it cleans the whole board and there are no annoying faint lines from previous writings  the market they give you works well  one thing that doesn t work well is the marker holder at the top of the board  i just took it off because it continued to fall off  this wasn t a big deal to me because i have magnetic markers too  but keep this in mind it that s a must have  thanks for reading        
170,5.0,                       i ordered this whiteboard while working at home to take the place of a notebook  i like that the marker has an eraser on the top and the marker attaches to the board so i don t have to worry about misplacing either  i am very happy with this product      
171,3.0,                       it attaches via velcro strips which you stick the surface with adhesive  so you cannot use the product multiple times  once you stick it  that s it   you cannot move it i suppose one benefit is that the adhesive allows it to stick to many different types of surfaces  but the downside is when you use it on a refrigerator  probably the    use case   then you cannot move it around or use it on the next refrigerator because the adhesive velcro is a one time permanent sticker  so that sucks      
172,1.0,                       i bought   boards   all   fell apart and   of my kids got hurt a lot with the metal tips   very dangerous         
173,5.0,                       velcro holds this dry erase board to our refrigerator reliably   our old dry erase board was held to the refrigerator magnetically   the old board fell off the refrigerator and took a beating several times over the years   the description of this board says  magnetic  because magnets will stick to it   however  this board is attached to its location by velcro and it works much better than attaching magnetically in our situation      
174,5.0,                       bought this to use in a restaurant for the servers to let us know when we re running low or out of stock  unlike other boards  when you erase what you wrote down on the board  it removes it completely      
175,2.0,                       needed something to put on the fridge for family notes so i ordered this based on the low price  it arrived slightly warped so that it made it kind of a pain to  install   it only comes with velcro  so i modified it by glueing magnets to the back so that it can be moved around the fridge as needed  it will serve its purpose  but you get what you pay for      
176,1.0,                         of the   that i bought were warped and one had a missing pen holder   all are made out of cardboard and the price is too high for this garbage   i just saw some at dollar store for    this morning that were better quality than  these        
177,3.0,                       first off  i just want to start by saying that the whiteboard looks like a good product and i am happy with it  but i am disappointed because it has a few small dents and creases in the board  i will just live with it since it will do what i bought it for  i can tell that the damage was from the company and not the shipping because the box it came in was in perfect shape      
178,2.0,                       ok so i bought this product under the impression that it was magnetic       as in it would stick to a refrigerator magnetically   that was not correct   it comes with velcro stickers   well  i rent  i do not want to adhere velcro stickers to my temporary refrigerator  so  i went and spent    on magnetic tape  i taped the entire back of the frame and it didn t stick  so i glued it on  still won t stick   it has fallen off of the refrigerator   times and the frame is now broken   just spend the extra   bucks and get one that is better quality and is actually magnetic      
179,3.0,                       it s a whiteboard  i mean not much to mess up there but that  m tape has the adhesion of super glue or something cause it straight up ripped a chunk of the drywall off my wall  i couldn t bother telling anyone about the hole so the whiteboard is stuck there until we decide to move i guess  also  the magnet is cool but it broke  like the magnet  just clean came off the sponge and cork part  and lastly  the logo on the  magnet  came out  it s a pin  i found that out pretty quickly when i stepped on it  honestly  not an ideal way to find my magnet  however  it is a whiteboard so there s really no way to mess it up      
180,4.0,                       wanted to place this on our cupboard above our kitchen counter so we can write a grocery list   the size was perfect for our cabinet  but because our cabinet is wood  and will have to move out at some point  was nervous to use the sticky velcro pads included with this board as there s the warning label that it could remove damage some surfaces  so i used command strips instead and it works great  reason for the   stars is really because of the sticky velcro pads not being safe on all surfaces  the small eraser square isn t great but they never are   better off wiping with a damp paper towel  overall very happy with this purchase      
181,4.0,                       the kids love these  however the markers run out of ink in just a couple days  make sure you buy extra markers     
182,4.0,                       i love this board  especially for the price  i keep my shopping list on it  the reason i took a star away is because of the sticky mounting pads  i wanted this to put on my refrigerator so when i m low or out of something  i simply write it on the board  i wanted to be able to take the board off and put it back on which would be impossible with what they give you to mount it  besides that  i give it   stars because adding magnets on the back is not that hard and it works great  there is one more thing  if you will be moving this from time to time like i do  the little holder for the market constantly falls off  it s a little annoying but very simple to put back on  just thought i d note that      
183,4.0,                       greatly improved over earlier era design  i expect i ll really like it   nice way to erase using felt pad on pen cap  i think i ll be swapping this cap onto other erasable pens later on   looks like plenty of room    all i need and just enough to set aside a reserved note here or there   should replace my need for wasting scratchpad paper   doesn t seem to make a mess when erasing  felt pad maybe can be cleaned after heavy use  con  would be better if its rectangle were inset into frame rather than enclasped by one      
184,5.0,                       bought this for my mom s refrigerator to leave her notes and reminders  works great      
185,2.0,                       the adhesion is super sticky burn them doesnt stick to anything  its sticks for maybe a few hours max before falling off  i tried my fridge  my walls  nothing the boarder keeps coming apart but clicks back together which is fine i was sick of it falling so i decided to just take the whiteboard off  no big deal  well turns out its metal which i didnt expect  peeled it off the cardboard and it rolled up  i tried to rebend it but proceeded to cut myself  so kind of gave up i m not mad it was cheap but a little disappointed  i would of tacked it up instead but cardboard was to thick and it was metal  aside from those it worked without any issues      
186,1.0,                       the board itself is fine  but flimsy  arrived with scuffs on the white frame  the marker holder clamp broken  and the marker missing entirely  could probably find a better quality   and complete   board elsewhere      
187,1.0,                       don t waist your money on this if you intended on using it for it magnetic ability to stick to something  it won t even hold it own wait on the refrigerator  slide right down not impressed         
188,3.0,                       with just a few days of not so much use  the pen is already dry  not very good quality overall but you get what you paid for sometimes      
189,2.0,                       wrong title  this board is not a   magnetic board   i personally assumed when i read it that the back of is magnetic   well it is not   comes with  x  adhesive magnets that are not very good i can say the pen is great and the board is a good size      
190,2.0,                       this is light weight and a good size for distance learning activities  also  the magnetic feature seems to work well enough and the board erases easily  however  you get what you pay for   it s inexpensive and unfortunately the quality is reflected in the price   after   weeks of light use for distance learning  the outer frame popped off   it revealed that the inside is cardboard   i was able to push the frame back together  but i m not thrilled that this broke so soon      
191,4.0,                       the board itself serves its purpose the marker it comes with works fine but will stain the board if you wipe it off with the eraser on the top  highly recommend using a microfiber towel to erase if you plan to write with the original marker   you don t need any fancy cleaners either  ultimately  i d suggested using true expo markers on the board to avoid staining it altogether doesn t seem too durable  but as long as you re not slamming it around and banging it against the walls  it ll last      
192,5.0,                       works as expected  i hesitated to purchase based on some reviews saying that the ink will stain but for the price   glad i did buy   i used the original pen  expo pens and expo eraser and  there were no stains left behind  now  if you use the eraser on the pen  there may be some residue but nothing permanent    think of it like using a qtip vs tissue wipes to remove your makeup  attached r before  after photos  to illustrate that it cleans up well after use      
193,1.0,                       first off  this board is not magnetic  it comes with some cheap velcro that didnt even stick to my fridge  the border around the white board is cheap and already started to peel back while the marker they sent with this board has already dried out  outside of that   its a dry board   hard to mess up that part atleast      
194,5.0,                       the adhesive is pretty decent  i would just get a separate eraser as the one that comes with the marker creates a lot of smears      
195,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          it s just ok for what i need it for  but would not purchase again  the first day i used the built in eraser it broke off  leaving it with just a bit of fluff on the tip  so now i use a tissue anytime i erase something  also  the cap does not firmly secure to the top of it like every single pen or marker in the world normally does  another thing that bothers me is you have to place the marker in the holder in just the right spot or it falls out      
196,5.0,                       bought this as a christmas gift for my   year old son and it s perfect  he s obsessed with drawing on his  board  and the size is just right for him to sit with it on his lap  the marker that comes with it isn t as good of quality as the expo markers i bought  and you ll want more of an eraser than the tiny one on the cap of that marker  but overall this is a great board      
197,1.0,                       first of all  let s say i did not expect much  i just wanted a board for small notes that could be hung to a wall on the positive side  you can write and erase on the big negative side  the sticky things coming with these are terrible  pretty sure my spit can do a better job than this on a different perspective  they stimulated my creativity   check the picture conclusion  don t buy these  the sticky parts will defenitely does not work   don t be me and trust othe reviews saying the same  if it happen to us  it will happen to you    and you cannot use nail to hung it because it does not have an edge to be placed on the nail     
198,5.0,                       easy to install  the stickers that come with it you stick on and put it on the surface  it s very handy and fits perfectly in my cabinet      
199,2.0,                       i wish i listened to the other reviews  this thing is a piece of crap  it came super dirty  the plastic pieces aren t even connected together and look broken  and there are multiple warps in the board  i tried to get a picture to show the warping  that s not even all of it  there s more on the other side  the pen works fine  the board is just a piece of junk      
200,5.0,                       perfect for virtual school  my daughter uses it to do quick math problems as she follows along  the dry erase marker it comes with writes well and erases well too      
201,5.0,                       good dry erase board  my son needs his be for his distance learning school year model  he has been using this since it arrived and it is the perfect size for his school work and for him to practice on      
202,5.0,                       love this thing   months laterget your life organized  i ve noticed that this thing has helped me remember important tasks  sometimes just the act of writing something down is enough to get you to remember it  if your a forgetful person this whiteboard will add a lot to the quality of your life also the build quality is pretty solid and it hasn t once fallen off the wall      
203,2.0,                       cheaply made  it s just cardboard with a dry erase finish over it  we ordered   and one came with it little dent in it  even though it was sent by itself in it s own box  as we were using for a craft project it worked  however next time i ll buy one at a craft store for quality      
204,5.0,                       used this as a tool to work through algebra problems with my son at home  i appreciate that it came with a dry erase marker so i don t have to purchase one separately  used a microfiber cloth as an eraser  works great   the size was nice  i didn t mount it  very satisfied      
205,5.0,                       i purchased this for a quote  coming back to work after the shut down was very difficult and needed some thing to lift my spirits on those challenging days  so it is posted in my office and so far it is staying in place it is now high enough the kids can t touch it      
206,5.0,                       it s a whiteboard  it sticks to my door very well  the magnet with a pin is kind of useless  but that s just an extra  not particularly high quality and can be bent with relative ease  as long as it s adhered to a wall or other flat surface  it will be fine  i wouldn t recommend if you intend to use it as a mobile board  it really is best suited as a message board on a wall or door      
207,5.0,                       i like that i can put all my appointments and little reminders on it  and simply wipe them off  later   have all family and friends birthdays in a column so not to forget them   now if i could just remember to check the lists      
208,5.0,                       i thought it was magnetic  but it s actually adhesive velcro   i m not bothered because it stays on my refrigerator and we use it every single day to keep our family on task   wipes easily  it s plenty big enough      
209,2.0,                       i purchased this to use as an occassional visual aid when teaching groups of youth  along with a pack of the u brand dry erase markers pros  very small  light and easy to carry no frills designcons  backing is cardboard and is easy to dent  warping the shape of the entire dry erase board if not handled carefully holder clip does not do a good job of holding tightly to even the same brand dry erase markers  makes losing the markers very easy to do  holder clip itself falls off very easy without warning surface does not clean well  the u brand markers do not really erase  they largely just get smeared all over the surface  most dry erase boards require a periodic cleaning with solvent to get      clean  but this one seems to require that with every use  disappointing good for what it costs  but paying a bit more for a nicer one that cleans better and is more durable is likely a better way to go      
210,5.0,                       love this so much  if you re looking for an affordable and reasonably sized white board  this is perfect  it comes with a little magnet too  and i m able to store some pictures on the sides of the board      
211,2.0,                       this whiteboard is pretty poor quality  it s on flimsy cardboard  the magnet came apart the first time i tried to move it  and the marker smells rancid  the only reason i gave it two stars is because technically it works  well enough for me to not bother returning it  however  i would definitely not buy it again      
212,2.0,                       i m trying to use it for an online exam  which we are only allowed to use these whiteboards  but it s not straight not even flat  so there s one side of the whiteboard that goes up and the other one goes down and that s driving me crazy  it s like the tables from those old restaurants that need something behind to keep the balance of it i regret buying this board  and i wouldn t suggest buying it if you are going to use it for an exam like gre  lsat  mcat  and others  what s more i want a refund or a replacement      
213,1.0,                       i bought this for my    year old daughter to do her math work on  so we would not go though so much paper will working on her math program  hi however not even three weeks later it s almost destroyed  the first time she dropped it the sides broke  they are busy plastic  i would not by for kids or even office imagine if it feel off a wall if mounted      
214,4.0,                       i wanted a white board for my stocked freezer items in the kitchen   i forget or because other hands rummage in the freezer  things get moved around   i didn t use the mounting system that came with it   magnets  and i don t know how strong they actually are as they are strips   i taped cord to the back and hung it on a hook inside my pantry door   what i really like about it is the clip on the top for the pen   perfect   the frame seems to be fairly sturdy around the board   could take a light beating from kids playing with it      
215,5.0,                       it is surprisingly light  my son     carries it around  writing and the magnetic aspects  work as advertised      
216,3.0,                       why is it so hard to find an actual magnetic dry erase board  one that adheres to metal with magnets  not magnetic itself  i tried putting this on my fridge and it fell down in the middle of the night  i ll have to find some magnets to glue on the back      
217,3.0,                       update  removed star as the frame is coming off after regular handheld useoriginal review  very basic board as expected  cannot comment on mounting as we didn t mount it      
218,5.0,                       its such a good product i love it sooooooo much  its sturdy i don t know about hanging wise but functionality and everything is splendid  also  all colors can be used nothing stained on my white board i have no idea why  but overall would recommend      
219,4.0,                       i bought   of the magnetic dry erase boards and both work well for their intended purposes  one board tends to streak the dry erase ink when erasing causing extra clean up but it isn t too big a deal  i haven t used the adhesive stickers but they look decent for the job      
220,5.0,                       needed for virtual school   works well   been dropped multiple times on wood floor   i have not mounted it or adhered it to anything as of yet      
221,4.0,                       exactly as described  it s works like expected  not very sturdy as it has a cardboard backing but it s what we needed  writes and erases well      
222,4.0,                       it s a basic small white board  comes with a cute magnet and a black market that has an eraser  the velcro to mount it with has not held up for me  it s fallen twice and could damage walls while trying to remove  overall it works for my purpose      
223,5.0,                       i purchased this white board for my son for distant learning  it s held up nicely and is a great size  invest in a white board cleaning spray and eraser      
224,5.0,                       product arrive on time  i purchased it for my son for when he begins his online classes at home  he is able to hold it  if need be  while on zoom with his teachers and classmates  i think  for the price  it was worth it      
225,1.0,                       it s frankly difficult to call this a dry erase board  the marker that it comes with just smears when you try to erase it  and every marker i ve used on this board from other sources has completely stopped working  they don t write anymore on any board  not just this one  within less than    minutes of use  i thought perhaps my markers were coincidentally running out of ink at the same time  but then i started using markers that were fresh out of the box and they died as well once being used on this board  my advice  spend a couple more bucks and buy a board that won t just frustrate you like this one      
226,1.0,                       i was super excited to receive this and use it but upon opening the package  which i ll add was incredibly well packaged  bubble packs  and no dents in the box   i found a dent in the lower portion of the white board  i plan to put it on a stand and on my desk for my business  and there s just no way to hide it  right now i m using the included magnet to cover it but i am so disappointed      
227,4.0,                       it works  erases well  good magnetic adhesion  just  i wish it came with a hook hanger instead of just double sided adhesive foam pad things      
228,1.0,                       the marker does not wipe off cleanly  it leaves a stain you scrub off and there is still a residue  i tried the provided marker and higher quality expo markers  neither wiped off cleanly  i tried using the eraser provided  used a soft microfiber  used a dish rag  it all just smears  and the board itself arrived scratched  it feels flimsy and low quality  not worth the asking price and doesnt even provide its basic function of dry erasing      
229,5.0,                       i have this item on my refrigerator in the kitchen and use it to track items i ll need next time i do a grocery store run   adheres easily and from what i can tell  quite well to most surfaces   i like there is a dry erase pen attached   sure helps come time to run errands being able to look at this board and see what i need      
230,5.0,                       i purchased this to use for quick notation for my online piano lessons  i love it s size and the fact it comes with a pen holder  and the pen has a white board eraser on the end of it  the magnetic stips that came with it hold it in place on my metal music stand   great purchase for the price        
231,5.0,                       good product but amazon needs to watch where they are delivering it  a neighbor i dont recognize was nice enough to bring my boxes   over      
232,1.0,                       i expected this  magnetic board to be a magnet and attach to metal surfaces  it does not  it comes with a small round magnet  not at all what i was expecting  i returned it     
233,4.0,                       the board looks a bit on the no frills side  but it is quite inexpensive   the adhesive strips attach easily and are holding well several days along   i have not yet needed to wipe any writing off the board  but the marker included and others purchased write very smoothly on the surface   i like that it is magnetic  but do not plan on hanging a bunch of items as i am not confident in the strength of the adhesive strips   if you are in the market for a small  white board  give this one a shot      
234,5.0,                       this is just what i needed  i needed to get a larger whiteboard for an online class and this was the perfect size  it is super easy to erase and does not leave behind marks of the whiteboard marker  i clean it occasionally with whiteboard cleaner to keep it looking new  the marker that comes with the board is very nice as well  i use this as a portable whiteboard so i can not comment on how good the mounting would be      
235,1.0,                       not as described  no pen  no pen holder  and no cork magnet included  just the board  also  thought i should mention that although the title of the product says  magnetic  and mentions magnets an excessive amount of time in the description  there are no magnets on the back of the board  it only means the surface is magnetic  i e  you can use a magnet on the wipeable front surface of the board that is only mountable with the adhesive provided   as i read the description again now that i have bought the product  it does not say that there are magnets to mount this on the fridge  but that was what i was looking for from this product  this board is not able to be put on your fridge unless you want to ruin the surface with adhesive      
236,3.0,                       i would suggest to not use the black marker it comes with  because when you use it and erase  it leaves black marks on the board  otherwise it is a good board i bought a different set of eraseable markers and they are good and do not leave any marks on the board   linkbro magnetic dry erase markers   fine tip  assorted colors    pack  low odor whiteboard markers for kids  work on white board   calendar  refrigerator https   www amazon com dp b  rpxkqy  ref cm sw r cp api i cvftebmje gw      
237,2.0,                       i bought   of these dry erase boards to replace the aging one on my refrigerator  the extra one  because my kids like to draw on them sometimes as well  these don t come with magnetic mounts  so i ordered a pack of adhesive backed flat magnet mounts separately  they do include double sided tape  but that s not practical for the refrigerator  so  the problem is these boards are so warped  no amount of magnets would support them to our fridge  i gave both boards to the kids   am still using my old dry erase until i find a good replacement  instead of saving a few bucks  i should have known you get what you pay for  my mistake  to be honest      
238,5.0,                       after a couple months the marker still works good   its sturdy and stood up to my   year old daily use  good for the price     
239,1.0,                       it s   x   inches including the frame  i ordered two and both areived dented  very disappointed      
240,1.0,                       i literally just took it out of the box and noticed several things right away  first off  somebody clearly has used this before  i can see smudges of marker towards the bottom  also looks like somebody beat it against the wall  you can clearly see the indentions in the board  the bottom plastic is broken  also last but not least  this isn t magnetic at all  this is the first time i ve ever been this disappointed with something i purchased online  save yourself some money and avoid this junk      
241,4.0,                       i like these small boards  but   of the   boards i received had very minor blemish on the board the pen holder broke off easily and i couldn t put it back on marker and eraser are good  the small indentation not worth the effort to return i didn t hang them up and would buy again price is good      
242,5.0,                       i like the  m brand mounting tape used to fix the magnet strips  magnates are strong enough to not go flying when i open the fridge door      
243,1.0,                       i was quite disappointed when i received this product and unwrapped it to find that it was damaged  the size of the board is great  but receiving a damaged product is not acceptable      
244,4.0,                       cute board for my fridge to write what s for dinner each week  the attached had it should have a clip for the marker to attach to the board  there was none  only due to the fact it was inexpensive i will not fuss about it although wonder if it was a restock returned item      
245,5.0,                       i m a homeschooling mom going through a spelling curriculum  all about spelling  with my son  i wanted a heavy duty but light white board so we both can spell out words  this one fits the bill  it s just the right size and the marker works well  the eraser on the pen is small and doesn t work well so you ll definitely want to use a better eraser  otherwise this board works well  we haven t tried mounting it  we just hold it      
246,2.0,                       a couple of indentations and one scratch approximately    long on writing surface of the white board  there was also some foreign substance on the surface that i originally thought was another scratch but it was on  not below  the surface  i was able to remove the unknown substance with isoppropyl alcohol  but nothing touched the scratch or indentations  i will try for a partial refund but keep the product as returning it will be more trouble that this is worth      
247,1.0,                       junk  i got this to use for homeschooling my son  the frame broke apart from the board after two months of use  the board itself is merely just a piece of cardboard with a dry erase sheet glued onto it      
248,2.0,                       i use this board everyday and the writing is erased everyday for new lists i have to clean this board with soap and water to get all the residual ink removed  remember  that ink hasn t been on for    hours also  the pen cap doesn t attach to itself and it doesn t really stay in the holder clip the cheapo ones at walmart actually would be better since they erase clean      
249,2.0,                       poor quality as adhesive doesn t work over time causing the board to fall onto the floor in the middle of the night multiple times  would not recommend      
250,3.0,                       it is okay  worth the cheap price  it has a weird velcro for it to hang  it was my fault for not seeming that it was not magnetic  regardless it is just okay  good for a simple whiteboard      
251,5.0,                       this product is great  it mounts onto walls and doors easily  and the frame allows for some neat customization  with various add on s   all of the expo markers i ve purchased have worked quite well with the board  and i definitely appreciate the bonus magnetic paper weight paper holder  the  only  issue i have had so far is with some of the additional accessories you can purchase  if the accessories are too large or heavy  they do not stick magnetically  the associated eraser that i purchased  separately  periodically falls off with little to no prompting  and it does indeed feel loosely bound to the board  however  that is the  only  problem i have found so far  after weeks of usage  this board does its job well      
252,3.0,                       the erasing on the whiteboard worked really well for the first couple of weeks then it began to start smudging on the board every time i tried to erase dry erase marker marks from it  for its price  it fulfills its purpose  but i just wish that the longevity of the whiteboard lasted a bit longer  as now i have to wash it every time i use it      
253,5.0,                       didn t care much about the magnet  i used this to get used to whiteboarding coding problems to get me ready for an interview for a software engineer spot  and it worked well  you can do a lot with it  but i just do practice problems or write down things after learning them to remember them more easily           
254,5.0,                       perfect for small applications   i bought a second one to serve as a sign up whiteboard for hearing devices we issue out at church   mine though is for me to jot down ideas  sketches  and designs  which i then photograph and upload to evernote   i like to scribble my designs down on something like this   you can hold it in your lap while you work   the eraser on the pen cap is clever and useful  but i bought a standard whiteboard eraser separately for when that pen plays out      
255,5.0,                       great to hang anywhere or take it anywhere to wright notes  words or anything interesting that comes to mind and great gift for anyone or just to have for yourself and also great to remember the task you forgot      
256,5.0,                       i really like the whiteboard  it is exactly what you would expect  i would however recommend using command strips to mount it instead of what it comes with  i have no issue with staining  i think it is a great size  and i love using it for reminders  great value      
257,5.0,                       very simple whiteboard and works with different dry markers  the size is perfect for school and work  it s really sturdy and smooth  the marker it comes with is a plus because of the eraser it comes with  i often have this on my desk rather than being mounted on the wall and it served me well in solving problems and planning  plus this is way better than wasting paper  wonderful product overall      
258,5.0,                       i like to wait at least   months before reviewing a product to truly test the durability neat little white board  i had it for my office desk and used it to draw diagrams when explaining things to coworkers you should note that the adhesive that comes with it will not stick to the typical cubicle fabric wall it is easy to clean and durable      
259,5.0,                       just what we needed for daily school schedule  the marker holder broke off after a few weeks  but all else still works great  we mounted this with  m velcro strips  because i don t plan to homeschool forever          
260,5.0,                       no complaints here   it s exactly what i was looking for   a simple whiteboard i could mount in my sons room by the door to write down notes or things i needed   all the mounting tape is included   it was really easy and still stuck up there to this day      
261,5.0,                       stuck homeschooling your kids this year  i know i am these are great for the kids for a multitude of reasons useful for many subjects and a good size writing space marker  with eraser on top  is great and still working magnet can be useful  but clip for marker hasn t stayed on either board  i bought two boards  kids haven t destroyed it after months of use  so there s that      
262,3.0,                       the marker eraser and the board itself work great but the thing on the top that holds the marker in place broke within   mins of opening the package and we weren t able to get it to snap back on  disappointing b c i bought this for an elderly pt to help with orientation and someone with a poor memory is not going to be able to keep track of that marker      
263,2.0,                       from the description you would think that this is a magnetic whiteboard which you can attach to metal surfaces  it s just a whiteboard in which a magnet can attach  it does provide mounting adhesives  but that s pretty useless unless you plan to permanently attach the whiteboard to your wall  i ended up going to walmart and buying some magnetic strips so i could attach this to my fridge  the whiteboard also had a dried out pen and i can t find a dry erase marker than can fit in the clip provided   other than that   i guess it s great  it s a whiteboard        
264,1.0,                       it actually came broken from a corner    and with all this craziness going on in the world    i m not even going to bother with a return  just sad that an item would even go out like this      
265,5.0,                       obsessed with this  i m a college student and this has come in handy so many times when studying for my science classes  i m sad that i waited until my masters program before i thought about buying one of these instead of wasting millions of pages from a notebook  it fits in my backpack  a little snug  but it fits  and i like that it s bigger than a normal piece of paper so i have extra room  if you are going to put it in your backpack though be careful because the little clip that holds the marker fell off from pulling it in out of my bag      
266,4.0,                       use it regulator to jot down things to do  adhesive connects the back of board then connected to my refrigerator  can hang either vertically or horizontally depending on preference  erases smoothly     
267,2.0,                       i had to buy and return a couple of these until i got one for the refrigerator that didn t have any dents in it  then i applied the velcro to a spot on the back and i didn t like how it laid mounted so i removed the velcro from that spot  from the other side  there is a noticeable indentation where the velcro tab was placed  this is a very poor quality product but you get what you pay for i guess  while it is still functional  it is made very cheaply  i got this for less than    and i still feel ripped off  this is something that belong at the dollar store      
268,3.0,                       just the right size for my refrigerator  easy to stick  a small eraser is provided on the marker  it would have been better if they had the eraser on the magnetic square piece itself update  after a month  the board just dropped down from my refrigerator  tried to stick it back but it keeps dropping in a few min   looks like the adhesive on the the velcro is too weak  that said the board is just fine but you would need to get an alternative to the velcro provided      
269,5.0,                       since doing remote learning i have been using this white board with my niece while home schooling her  she had one in her classroom  it s great   cleans easily and we save on paper  delivered in a reasonable amount of time given the circumstances      
270,1.0,                       this item is not as described  it is not magnetic  instead  there are velcro strips included to place onto dry erase board and they don t stay put  waste of time and money  do not recommend      
271,5.0,                       this is the perfect size and price  my front door is metal to the magnetic whiteboard is perfect   i use this to leave notes for my husband bc i leave much earlier for work than he does  this is a sure fire way he will not forget to take the garbage out      
272,5.0,                    excelente para colocar recordatorios si pretenden usar para clases recomiendo un tama o m s grande ya que es peque a pero para lo que yo la quer a me quedo perfecta        
273,4.0,                       purchased this small whiteboard to hang on the wall next to my desk to help keep track of my college work  i was expecting this to be a pretty cheap board that would only adequately serve its purpose  but i ve been pleasantly surprised yes  the whiteboard itself is pretty cheap  but the pen it comes with is actually very good quality  it also helps that the board has a spot specifically for the black pen  which makes it extremely convenient to use  not to mention  the pen also has an eraser on the end  which means everything i need for the board is always on the board my only gripe with this product is that the adhesion strips are not      reliable  i ve woken up startled several times since purchasing this due to it falling off during the middle of the night  luckily  it s easy to put right back onto the wall  but still  it does detract some quality from it  otherwise  i have no complaints      
274,2.0,                       i got it and the adhesive on the velcro was not strong enough for my wall  i simply decided to put super glue on my wall for it since the wall it is mounted on is smooth stone  i also did not expect it to have cardboard on the back and it also bends very easily  it feels like its going to break when i m writing on it without placing it on a surface and just holding it in air  i guess you get what you paid for  works great for things such as to do list since you won t be writing on it a lot but when doing math homework it can get annoying when it slightly bends all the time side note  mine has a little piece that i cannot describe  simply looks like the white board chipped off and it came like that      
275,4.0,                       when i was looking for this my criteria was a magnetic board for the fridge  when i saw this one it was the perfect size and an amazing price  but i don t know if i didn t read the specifications carefully but this board is not magnetic on the back  just the front where you write on it has sticky adhesive squares that you have to stick on the surface  which i don t know how that well that works doing it on a refrigerator this board looks good  has a nice size but is not magnetic on the back  i really don t want to return it so i just bought magnets to see if i can stick those to the board so i can use it on my refrigerator  so ended up being more expensive      
276,1.0,                       this product is so cheap and terrible  don t waste your money  it keeps falling on the ground and this last fall had the borders coming off  it s not adhesive and it s cheap cardboard in the back  that already ripped      
277,5.0,                       i m a resident advisor at my university  and put this on my door with command strips to allow my residents to write me some messages this board has been perfect so far  my custodian cleans it every week and leaves it looking as white as paper the marker has lasted a couple of months surprisingly  i thought it was going to run out really quickly but nope would definitely buy another for other uses  very good quality      
278,5.0,                       i track my daily task  pills  dog pills and food using this board  i use two large clip mag to hold the board on the door of my refrigerator  this is so much better that making paper list  just erase in the morning and start your current day duties
