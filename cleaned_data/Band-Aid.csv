0,3.0,                       so this box of bandaids was smashed when i got it    so i couldn t put the bandaids in the medicine cabinet because the box wouldn t stand up   i miss the metal containers   also for some reason they didn t agree with my skin     when i removed them after   day it left red marks   maybe i am alergic to something in them

6,4.0,                       i like this flexibility fabric band aid better than the water block one   it can use longer  stay more comfortable  and easy to take it out  and the price is valuable  it has     piece with   different size  one thing i don t like is  i need to find the small container to organize these band aid  so  i still like to buy it again

30,4.0,                       other plastic things are useless  these stick under water  love them  will never buy anything else      
31,4.0,                       this is a very plain product to review  but i often go through many bandages  and this seems to be one of the better items for price quantity  i can t recommend it for outdoors sports use  however   they sell more durable ones with stronger adhesive if you need them for that purpose

39,3.0,                       as promised but packaging was non existent  so baisically i received an envelope with a crushoed box and     loose  band  aids  not a big problem  just kinda shabby

44,5.0,                       does what it promises     
45,2.0,                       made in china  the band aids are fine  but the box they come in is junk the box these band aids come in don t let them selves well to storage  very thin and flimsy amazon grouping together reviews for different versions of this product leads to confusion  i purchased a     assortment box      
46,5.0,                       love it     
47,5.0,                       had to order these since no stores had stock  i m accident prone and always keep some on hand  these are great      
48,5.0,                       well  they do what they are supposed to do  just better than bargain brands       
49,5.0,                       unfortunately you can t find this brand anywhere in israel anymore  so glad i could buy these for a decent price here  best bandages in the world  perfect adhesion  won t go off that easily  and very confortable      
50,5.0,                       i have ordered these   times  highly recommended     
51,5.0,                       i love these flex bandaids   regular adhesive causes a reaction on my skin but these don t   they also don t wear out like the older style bandages      
52,5.0,                       great bandaids  our family loves the fabric bandaids because they seem to last longer  the pack has a variety of sizes that also works for little kids and adults alike      
53,5.0,                       very good      
54,5.0,                       i haven t used them yet  i hope i never have to but they are as advertised and quick shipping      
55,5.0,                       band aid is  by far  the best brand on the market for bandages   this particular purchase was needed for my daughter s hands and fingers   she works in a warehouse requiring significant manual labor resulting in extremely dry  cracked hands and box paper cuts on her fingers and hands  her hands are petite and regular work like gloves do not fit her properly and caused blisters so she had to go without gloves   these bandages acted  like gloves for her  they speeded up recovery of the wounds she d attained and prevented new ones from arising      
56,5.0,                       i think it s to do with the slightly rounded corners  i mostly end up using these on my toes or my feet  yes  toes are on feet  but they re a different beast to band aid   for blisters  or on fingers for paper cuts  or if i have a skritch from a cat   whatever my boo boo  these are my go to      
57,5.0,                       as expected     
58,5.0,                       great bandaid  flexible and vreathable

60,5.0,                       i love this product      
61,3.0,                       band aid is a good product but i will not recommend this one there are only   sizes of band aids  they are very thin and not very strong  the box is very cheap so when it arrived  the box was already open and all the band aids are mixed together inside the envelope  i won t buy this again      
62,5.0,                       a wonderful pack of bandages for the value  and great to have on hand for a bathroom cabinet      
63,5.0,                       great bargain  value     
64,5.0,                       these bandages are reliable  they do not peel off in the shower  definitely water resistance and the adhesion last for a couple of days  also easy to remove and it doesn t hurt to peel off your skin      
65,5.0,                       i m very pleased that it brings all the sizes it says on the box  my band aids arrived on time and packaged really well      
66,5.0,                             
67,5.0,                       literally didn t even need this i just got carried away  they re band aids  fabric kind so you know they ll work great      
68,3.0,                       i thought it has a few sizes in the package but it s just two sizes only      
69,5.0,                       best band aid for me     
70,5.0,                       nice selection of top quality band aid brand fabric bandages      
71,5.0,                       good band aid pack  between my husbands construction projects and my kids i am confident we will use the entire package quickly  great band aids        
72,5.0,                       ready when i need them      
73,4.0,                       package was damaged when i received it and some bandaids fell out  other than that  still usable      
74,5.0,                       excellent product     
75,3.0,                       these band aids are okay for very small cuts  most of the band aids would not cover more than a small cut  there are very few that would be big enough to cover much more than a pin prick  the description say assorted sizes but most are small  would bot buy again  i need larger bandages and most of these are useless      
76,5.0,                       a lot for the price     
77,5.0,                       in the winter my fingers get sore n cracked from dryness  i apply vaseline and cover with a bandage  it stays on all day n nite  amazing      
78,5.0,                       these have always been my bandages of choice   this value pack is great and lasts a while      
79,5.0,                       love everything about this product     
80,5.0,                       satisfied with the purchase  the trust in band aid keeps pulling me away from buying other brands  the various sizes is a very good option to have in hand      
81,3.0,                       i love the cloth feel of these  and they don t irritate my skin   but what is super annoying is as soon as you put them on  they start shedding threads and i have to keep cutting the strings off   it s similar to an unfinished hem on cloth   it s just keeps  shredding off string by string   but they don t just fall off   you have to cut them off because there is still adhesive on one side and then your scissors gets gummy      
82,5.0,                       great addition to my first aid kit     
83,5.0,                       abrasions       
84,3.0,                       item came completely crushed  yet not seemingly from the other items shipped  as the box and packaging around it was all ok they re bandages  so most of them are still fine and usable  but some got torn  the picture is after i  fixed  the box by bending things back together and folding it up as best as it can be  definitely looked worse on opening still  shipping and packaging problems are shipping and packaging problems  the item itself works as you d expect it to  sticks on  covers a minor wound  can t complain about that      
85,5.0,                       they adjust to anywhere u put it on and they stay on when u use water     
86,1.0,                       band aids fray very quickly  its       there are so many different bandage company brands that are better in all regards  not sure why so many great reviews      
87,5.0,                       adhesive is strong  one of the best bandages out there      
88,1.0,                       got my package and it was ppen      
89,5.0,                       always have these in our home        
90,1.0,                       small bandaids  bandaid box was cheaply made and didn t hold in bandaids during shipment  wouldn t buy again  looking for something more substantial      
91,5.0,                       a great product thats flexible to cover many types of cuts and its nice to have a varied selection of sizes to better fit the actual size you need   got this at a great price making the purchase all the better   dont plan to have that many cuts during the year and will be sharing these with a neighbor      
92,4.0,                       excellent     
93,5.0,                       great to have in case of small injuu      
94,3.0,                       the band aid is not very waterproof  i took a bath on it and it fell off after a while     
95,5.0,                       sticks well  does the job as it should      
96,5.0,                       my wife has been buying the cheap bandages  i bought these and within five minutes of her applying it she remarked on how well it stuck and how it stretched when she moved to conform to her hand  she isn t going to buy any more of the cheap ones  skip a meal at mcdonalds and you will lose weight and be able to buy these good bandages      
97,4.0,                       good band aids     
98,5.0,                       i do not mind using generic medicines  but when it comes to adhesive bandages  i do prefer band aid over the generic store brands      
99,5.0,                       it is used for minor wounds

104,5.0,                       old fashioned     
105,5.0,                       great quality and reasonable price      
106,5.0,                       great bandages     
107,5.0,                       these stay on   i don t mind that they sometimes leave a bit of stickiness when you take it off as they don t fall off my kids throughout the day even when it gets wet   the bandages prevent my little one from scratching his mosquito bites and he would forget to tell me if the bandage falls off   these stay on even in tricky locations  e g  bend of the leg  etc    also prefer them because they allow the wound to breath  there is no adhesive along the edges of the gauze  so you can keep a wound covered  but it still gets to breath      
108,5.0,                       product is perfect for my needs      
109,5.0,                       bought these to avoid going into the store and they worked great     
110,3.0,                       definitely not what i expected      
111,5.0,                       exactly what it     
112,5.0,                       perfect     
113,3.0,                       all the brands of bandages out there  band aid sticks the best  but has disappointingly mini sized the cotton part meant to cover wounds  that w antibiotic ointment or active bleed  comes through      
114,5.0,                       good     
115,4.0,                       good value and works well   not water resistant tho box came smashed but bandaids were fine

119,5.0,                       after throwing my box of misfit bandaids out the window  i picked them up to avoid being a litterbug   i opened my new band aid brand band aids with excitement and relief  then i realized i no longer had an injury to patch up  but held firm in my confidence that my next cut  scrape  puncture  etc  will not suffer the embarrassment ad wastefulness of weak adhesion  requiring repetitive replacement throughout the day  to quote the tune that has jingled in my ear since  i was a young boy   i am stuck on band aid because band aid s stuck on me      
120,5.0,                       great bandages easy to remove i m stuck really good

128,5.0,                       brand name quality  but still at a better price than my neighborhood store  walgreens duane reade   the flexible fabric sticks better versus sheer clear  if you want it to really stay on your finger  etc   even through hand washings  get it to stick to itself as you wrap it around your finger  i can t accurately describe this in words  but i think you know what i mean  haha      
129,4.0,                       nothing like material bandages     
130,5.0,                       the best band aids i ever bought  wish they had more variety on sizes     
131,4.0,                       good value band aid could improve this product by dividing sizes with partitions of any kind

143,2.0,                       first time a j and j product has disappointed us  this fabric bandaid is not waterproof and often does not stick correctly  not pliable enough for example to use on a finger or other awkward or angled area  heavy looking  j and j makes so many varieties of this item   this is not the one for every day use  in our family  we like the sheer or antibiotic bandaid  thought we would try this type but big mistake  it is heavy duty in terms of the weight of the fabric  a disappointment      
144,5.0,                       this is a great value pack and cover s our family s needs for months at a time

160,2.0,                       box was opened when it arrived      
161,5.0,                       works good     
162,5.0,                    las mejores        
163,5.0,                       i was expecting a box of band aids  i received a box of band aids  they work    like band aids    stars      
164,5.0,                       essential for a first aid kit   great brand      
165,5.0,                       great bandages     
166,3.0,                       i love these bandages  they are simply the best when you have a cut on a part of your body that bends why did i only give   stars  they aren t shipped properly so the box was completely crushed and the band aids were all over      
167,5.0,                       these are the only type of bandaid that my   year old tolerates  they are fabric and flexible  so they are easy to take off without further pain and panic  this pack was nicely sorted and high quality      
168,5.0,                       these leave adhesive that is hard to get off but they stay on     
169,2.0,                       box arrived open with bandaids everywhere in the box  it wasn t a big deal to put them back in the box  but it does make me take pause at the sanitary issue      
170,5.0,                       gets the job done     
171,5.0,                       best band aids for fingers     
172,5.0,                       no rocket science of a review needed here   their band aids  they work      
173,5.0,                       these band aid flexible fabric bandages are great and the    ct box is a tremendous value  these are genuine johnson   johnson bandages      
174,1.0,                       i just received these bandaids yesterday   didn t have it on for a     day before it started to fray   look raggedy  this is  likely due to washing my hands often    i suppose it just couldn t survive the water  the adhesive seems to be just fine    in fact  it stuck to my finger when trying to remove it causing some discomfort based on so many reviews  i thought these were the best option  definitely wouldn t recommend      
175,5.0,                       reliable go to for adhesive strips  you call every strip a band aid even if it s a different brand because it s the gold standard  flexible and reliable      
176,5.0,                       recommend everyone to prepare one at home    the three sizes of the band are useful and able to cover most area of the wound  besides  it s easy to remove and won t stick one your skin  but literally  one band can stand for two or three days if you don t touch water      
177,5.0,                       we go through a lot of bandaids and do lots of swimming and these stay on      
178,5.0,                       can not get better product if needed      
179,5.0,                              
180,5.0,                       i bought these because that small box that you buy is pricey and you don t usually get that many   there is a bunch in here and they have good adhesive and you can wear them in the shower with no problem   surprisingly  they are pretty easy to remove  if you do it slowly   i have one of the  old  tin boxes for band aids and it s finally full with plenty left over   highly recommend      
181,2.0,                       the bandaids feel really cheap  they don t seem to last longer than an hour  i had some that just were not sticky  i had one where the white pad fell straight off      
182,5.0,                       i have   babes    boys    girls  and my boys give me a run for my money when it comes to injuries  thankfully i found an awesome deal on these  on sale and buy   get one half off  and will be stocked up for awhile      
183,5.0,                       great band aids  flexible  somewhat water resistant and easy to remove when needed  good amount for a good price  box was a little smashed but whatever   would buy again      
184,4.0,                       good     
185,5.0,                       good bandaids  only a little hard to take off but that s because it sticks really well      
186,5.0,                       i cut my fingers a lot as i flip balisongs regularly  this is a great assortment of high quality bandaids and was an excellent value      
187,5.0,                       works great     
188,5.0,                       it s flexible and it sticks  how else do you write a review about band aids      
189,4.0,                       i got   different sizes in this order that was stated to be all the same size   the   surprise sizes are a bit bigger and a bit smaller although most were of the advertised size   although these fabric kind will fray if you re wearing one on a hand and using that hand  they stick very  very well and are comfortable   so much better than those plastic ones that come off so easily and feel awful   good band aids  just was surprised to get the different sizes      
190,5.0,                       you can never have enough band aids  i always reach for a trusted brand name  hoping these last a while      
191,5.0,                       very good deal      
192,5.0,                       very good for the price     
193,5.0,                       like the quantity and variety this pack has no skin reaction like i have seen with other cheaper brands

195,5.0,                       great     
196,5.0,                       i couldn t help it but these are worth it      bands of different sizes that fit well and stay on point      
197,4.0,                       good name brand product  good variety of sizes  small  medium  and large  be prepared for the box to be crushed which doesn t really hurt anything      
198,4.0,                       they work     
199,5.0,                       sweet      
200,5.0,                       my   years old need this every time he gets hurt      
201,5.0,                       just adding that the box is huge   can t really see it in the pic  i was picturing the old boxes that were about the size of a pack of cigarettes   this box is   times bigger  a lot of band aids      
202,5.0,                       ease of purchase     
203,5.0,                       what an excellent product for such a terrific price    thank you so much   everything arrived perfectly      
204,1.0,                       probably great band aids but they arrived crushed      
205,5.0,                       thanks     
206,5.0,                       my favorite bandage  holds up quite well and very flexible      
207,5.0,                       these stick as expected and won t leave that nasty  gummy stuff behind when you remove it      
208,5.0,                       use it almost every day     
209,1.0,                       description says  all one size   all pictures of the box say  all one size   when i received them  the actual box says  assorted sizes   then i double check my order and notice that the  style  indicates assorted sizes  not really what i was looking for      
210,3.0,                       the product itself gets a thumbs up  quality bandaids stick to skin firmly and do not easily peal   fall off   unfortunately it was the shipping that i was disappointed in as the box arrived in a waterproof bag with no bubble wrap around product   the box of bandaids was crushed should ve been placed in a sturdy shipping box and not a tyvek bag      
211,5.0,                       good bandaids     
212,5.0,                       good bandage at a good price when i purchased it   larger box means they are on the shelf longer     
213,5.0,                       big variety of sizes   it s band aid    what s not to like      
214,3.0,                       for being band aid brand  i really thought these bandages would be higher quality  after only a few hours of use  they started to fray  i am careful to keep them clean and make sure they don t touch anything  so i m really surprised they re this poor quality  would not recommend      
215,5.0,                       these are very flexible and comfortable   they stick well  but are easy to remove   they are fabric  so are not waterproof  but are not intended to be   good selection of sizes  and a very good price      
216,5.0,                       this is a great size and assortment of band aids for our active family   it would also make a good addition to any emergency medical kit  and i plan to make my own instead of buying a pre made kit again      
217,5.0,                       ouchies are safe now  sticky booboo pads stay onstays wet when wethard to off  but good     
218,5.0,                       great value     
219,5.0,                       we have this bandage box in our family all the time  it s a reasonable price and free shipping with prime at amazon

221,5.0,                       good quality bandages  it protects your small cuts and wounds from being contaminated  it will save your time  money  and in some cases your life  different sized are very practical  just in case you should always have them at home      
222,4.0,                       the pack comes with different sizes of bandages  they are easy to use and sticky enough to keep on the skin for a long time  removing it is not really difficult and pain stalking  quite a good experience      
223,3.0,                       well band aid brand is amazing the only type i ll use the only thing wrong was the package was ripped up and spilled all over inside the bag and i counted and i was short    bandaids     
224,5.0,                       the old kind of band aids that aren t complete pieces of crap  i have learned over the years that while many non brand items are just find  band aids seem to be an exception  i have gone through so many cheap vinyl plastic type bandaids and finally decided to stick with the originals  these are comfortable  breathable  and stay on until you want them to come off  i use these in all my first aid kits and am very pleased  this box comes with about a years worth of band aids in different sizes      
225,5.0,                       band aide brand is the best

227,5.0,                       i love these bandaids and they are so convenient to get on amazon  i will say i do not think they hold up great if you get a little sweaty or wet  but they do make other bandaids for they  no complaints      
228,4.0,                       bandage helps keep wound clean and dry  banges came on time and work as expected

231,5.0,                       wasn t the best bandage     
232,5.0,                       i ve been using band aid brand as long as i can remember  i have tried many other brands that were cheaper but none adhere as well as band aid   stays on when wet  i m taking a blood thinner and worry about even the most minor scratch cut  i always carry a few band aids in my pocket      
233,5.0,                       work great

238,5.0,                       glad i went with the name brand   good value  probably will never need to buy bandages again as long as i live      
239,3.0,                       the box was open        
240,5.0,                       please disregard previous review  it was for a lip pencil that did not arrive  the bandaids did arrive  i aplogize for the confusion  thank you  terry ryan     
241,2.0,                       the box is squeezed      
242,1.0,                       made in china   need i say more      
243,5.0,                       i like these because they do not leave glue on your fingers after wearing them all day  i wish all   sides of the bandage part were covered not open on        
244,5.0,                       good selection good prize

247,5.0,                       love it     
248,4.0,                       they seem to be legit band aids  but when they came in  the box was a little beat up and there weren t any safety plastic stickers  the picture is how they came      
249,5.0,                       there s a reason that adhesive bandages are colloquially called  band aids   they re commonly cheap and very durable  i personally prefer fabric over plastic because of their durability  aside from not being water proof  this     pack doesn t lie either  it came with     strips and varying sizes as well  great for families and refilling first aid kits      
250,2.0,                       standard band aids  no issue  however  packaging bad  busted box and bandaids everywhere      
251,5.0,                       good stuff     
252,1.0,                       for me it was awful because i got a allergy and i got a rush on top to my cut  maybe it s just my skin reaction but i ve never been allergic to any band aid       
253,4.0,                       deal     
254,5.0,                       secures   awesome     
255,5.0,                       flexible fabric band aids perform exceptionally well   this is a great price for these compared to buying them at local stores   great assortment      
256,5.0,                       i think these are the best and most durable band aids  will not buy others      
257,5.0,                       comes with small  medium  and large sizes  it also does its job for wound care

262,5.0,                         dollars worth of     pieces  very cost effective  i bought it for my boss  she opened the nail shop  she is very happy that i can buy such a favorable band aid      
263,5.0,                       these are my go to band aids  they stick longer and are perfect if you are active and sweat  they will not fall off if applied to direct skin  best band aids on the market in my opinion      
264,5.0,                       seems excellent to me     
265,5.0,                       when it gets wet it dries quickly  will last up to three days without getting yucky  i had to cut the ends shorter for a finger area so the adhesive would come lose each day  good product  will buy again      
266,5.0,                       great for the kids  we always need bandaids around our house

272,5.0,                       my daughters have really sensitive skin  while other bandages create all sorts of nasty reactions  these have excellent adhesion and are easy to remove without all the pain that off brands seem to cause

279,5.0,                       i have a bad anxious habit where i pick at my fingers and all the time i have bad cuts on my fingers because of it  but if i throw some neosporin on with a bandaid that cut will be mostly healed by the morning  where without it i can expect it to be healed in a week

291,4.0,                       i know they don t say they re waterproof but c mon  if you wash your hands once or your hands get sweaty from wearing gloves they immediately start peeling  i would expect better from a name brand      
292,3.0,                       decent bandaids  they are boxed sloppy  why can t i find bandaids made in usa  these are made in china

303,5.0,                       huge variety of band aids in this box for       what s not to like     i have three kiddos  so clearly we go through band aids at my home  i like that these are the thicker  quality fabric ones   not the cheap plastic style  they also seem to really stick on  they can last for several days with no issue  quality  quantity   it s everything you want in a band aid       
304,5.0,                       the only kind of bandaids i like to use      
305,5.0,                       as advertised      
306,1.0,                       listing title and detail  says  all one size     detail says  assorted sizes      
307,5.0,                       i have a latex allergy and sensitive skin  and band aid brand fabric bandages are the only ones that don t give me a reaction  they adhere very well and stand up to getting wet  within reason   the pads don t stick to the wound  always very happy with these      
308,5.0,                       our local drug store has a poor selection of bandages  most of what they have are store brand  glad to see amazon has good old trusty band aid bandages  my preferred brand  the assortment will handle most of my injuries      
309,5.0,                       good     
310,5.0,                       overall i  like these bandages with the following tips  adhesion works better if you put it on your arm first to dull adhesion  adhesion is too strong  edges fray  requires frequent bandage change  good bandage for wound protection      
311,5.0,                       these are the most durable band aids in my experience  i use these to re stock all of my first aid kits  they stay on even in the shower  the perfect all purpose band aid      
312,5.0,                       expensive but worth it      
313,5.0,                       i have used this brand for years      
314,5.0,                       these are the best bandaids   they allow your skin to breathe and heal while protecting the cut or abrasion   my whole family loves them and i carry a few in my handbag for children   a great variety and always useful      
315,5.0,                       works great     
316,4.0,                       these have great stretch and stick on really well  i am a hair stylist and i keep a couple boxes on hand at all times  these are the best that i have found to stand up to the day as well as wet hands  my only pet peeve is that there are way too many little bandaids in the box and not enough little fingers or people to use then on   if you have kids as home  this would probably be a perfect box for the household      
317,5.0,                       i cut hair and these hold up even through shampoos on customers  they stretch to fit snugly and stay put      
318,4.0,                       arrived quickly  these flex fabric band aids stick very well  very good brand      
319,1.0,                       the item was open when i receive it  it s not qualified for return  so  if you do mind this condition  don t buy it online      
320,1.0,                       this item was terrible  it had a horrible basement mildew smell that has not gone away in a week  i would not repurchase      
321,5.0,                       i m not sure how to write a review for something as ubiquitous a bandaid brand banagages  i do prefer the all cloth bandages  they flex with your skin and makes it easier to use that injured area normally which promotes bloodflow and healing my only con is that if i must use bandaid for a few days in the same spot  i always get a contact dermatitis or some hives  washing all the adhesive off before using a new one helps but the bandaid brand adhesive always does this too me generics adhesive causes the rash right away curad doesn t give me a rash but i have a hard time finding their brand with the fabric bandages     
322,5.0,                       great band aid product   these are the band aids that can get wet but still stay on      
323,5.0,                       affordable price  buy two boxes directly      
324,5.0,                       great product been using bandaids brand for    years now  others are just second rate robert pozdrowski     
325,4.0,                       what can i say  i m a kindergarten teacher  i bring a box of these to my class every month  the kids know they may have one if they have a boo boo  sometimes there is blood to cover  but usually it s a hurt feelings  or missing a grown up  i don t ask them to show me their injuries  because some can t be seen  they don t hurt too much to take off  and a thorough hand washing wipes them out  but it s worth the investment to patch up broken hearts      
326,5.0,                       while outer packaging  mailer  was fine  the box was stained as if by an oily substance  for plenty of products  this would be of little concern  but when picking and shipping band aids        
327,5.0,                       they don t do very well when wet  it fell off right away  it was great until then      
328,5.0,                       love these bandages   they are good price too      pieces   never run out of bandages  always good to have a box like this size at home      
329,5.0,                       being in a family of   these come in really handy  simple application and i love how flexible these are  a must have for your first aid kit or a cabinet for easy access     
330,3.0,                       wouldn t buy again  it s not the  something more substantial      
331,5.0,                       just a big box if assorted bandaids     
332,5.0,                       they are bandaids     
333,2.0,                       this is a reasonably priced box of fabric band aids  it has a good variety of sizes and shapes  however these band aids left large painful welts on my husband  daughter  and i after use  we are not allergic to latex so i m not sure what caused the sores  so buyers beware     
334,5.0,                       great product  definitely will buy more for my hurricane preparedness kit      
335,5.0,                       funny that the listing isn t clear about is these are latex free or not  they are  it says so on every bandage package      
336,5.0,                       as a mom i love these bandaids   they actually stick and do their job   as a child though  brown is not the funnest bandaid to wear  haha  they stick so much better than the themed decorative bandaids that fall off and require more and more bandaids  which requires more and more bandaids to buy   best money spent on bandaids right here and love the different sizes included      
337,5.0,                       the quality that we expect from band aid   great         
338,5.0,                       it stayed ln my ankle cut all day at beach  in the water  walking beach  it never wrinkled or moved  so comfy i forgot  about for    hours      
339,5.0,                       good variety  very sticky and easy to apply  some sizes you will rarely need  water is still the easiest way to get the bandaid to let loose      
340,5.0,                       momma  poppa and baby sizenice quality bandaids  i usually don t shop name brands  for bandaids i do  when i need a bandaid that will do its job i only use band aid i once met someone tell me that they had an open cut on their finger and ended up in the hospital because they used a cheap bandaid  i asked them what they meant by that and they said that an infection began to brew in their finger from it not being properly protected  they had to be hospitalized and pumped with antibiotics for several days before they could go home  stories like this scare me because you could have a little cut on your finger  but if you don t protect it and you touch the wrong thing  you can get an infection that can kill you  from now on i m very careful about any cuts on my hands or body and protect my skin  especially after i heard that story       
341,5.0,                       use them for what their meant for cuts      
342,5.0,                       great band aids      
343,5.0,                       bandaids  brand name band aids  they stick and last      
344,5.0,                       this is truly the only brand of band aid  if you purchase a different brand  give them to your daughter to play dr  with      
345,5.0,                       worked like it should     
346,5.0,                       a good variety of this product      
347,1.0,                       these band aids literally ripped the skin off the back of my thumb right below my nail   this is a liability defect and i will not be purchasing from this seller again        
348,5.0,                       these are a must have for working hands or active lifestyle  hold and hold      
349,5.0,                       they work     
350,5.0,                       just as described   thanks     
351,5.0,                       they are not water resistant but are these supposed to be   they are not but these are not supposed to be   they are made of fabric      
352,5.0,                       these keep wounds dry  love      
353,5.0,                       best price     
354,5.0,                       they are bandaids  they are as you would expect  great price  even got a few extra then what was advertised  only issue is they are not at all waterproof  a little water will cause them to fall off  but they were never advertised as waterproof      
355,5.0,                       they are bandaids   they are fine      
356,5.0,                       this is the third time i have purchased this product  the first time via amazon  for me  it is the best    good adhesion  no skin damage  flexible   just exactly right   i get this box due to the different sizes and i get a second box of the most common size   never disappointed  highly recommend  the delivery was very quick  i will buy again      
357,5.0,                       great     
358,5.0,                       love these band aides   easy to apply and remove   i like having these box with assorted sizes     
359,5.0,                       works as expected  arrived in good condition      
360,5.0,                       these band aid have great adhesion  multiple sizes that make covering your boo boots easy  great value  stay on well  an dont become soaked if you accidentally get them wet band aids are mostly easy to remove  i will continue to buy them      
361,5.0,                       good adhesion     
362,5.0,                            for me when i chew my fingers off and all dead dry skin around them and make them bleed to the point of them hurting when i go to work  these aids help with all of it and nice and stretchy  will continue to buy more as needed      
363,4.0,                       good brand     
364,5.0,                       i like this you don t have to go to the syore deliver to your door love this     
365,5.0,                       i needed several bandages of various sizes for several profusely bleeding cuts and this fit the bill  they stayed on well  protected the cuts and maintained the healing products i used on them  i am happy to say the cuts and abrasions are clean and almost completely healed  i really appreciated the various sizes  they became damp sometimes but stayed in place  the container has an honored site in my cabinet   thank you amazon      
366,5.0,                       standard band aids  good to have on hand for all kinds of cuts and scrapes      
367,5.0,                       quality of product  excellent     
368,2.0,                       box seemed to be short in number of band aids      
369,5.0,                       the price is awesome and not much different from store price that only gives you a few bandaids  being fabric  if it gets wet you have to replace it      
370,5.0,                       what more can i say  it does such a wonderful job preventing blood from oozing all over my white pants      
371,5.0,                       good brand  good product   stays in place  pulls off when needed      
372,3.0,                       they don t stick that well     
373,5.0,                       good product     
374,4.0,                       really sticky and stays longer than others i used earlier      
375,5.0,                       these band aids have wonderful grip  even with frequent hand washing  the adhesive didn t falter  i specifically bought these because i needed good bandages that had padding all the way to edge instead of an island surrounded by adhesive  these were perfect  and the padding never stuck to my burn as it healed  either  very happy with this purchase      
376,2.0,                       the box did not have any kind of seal or tape and band aids were almost spilling out  many band aids were crumpled like they were stuffed to stay inside the box   this made me count the band aids and there were only    of them  looks like band aids were taken from other boxes to make a new assorted one  hopefully they ll work well      
377,5.0,                       yes  these are the good ones   many sizes  and even the small ones stay on   truly flexible  not those rigid plastic ones   great price for quantity      
378,5.0,                       i tried to use this when i used a buzz saw to cut some wood   did you know that you should not put the saw on your lap when using it   i used a lot of band aids  they didn t work   not the band aid s fault       stars   wouldn t change a thing      
379,5.0,                       i love the flexible bandaids  the fabric ones   these are perfect   they hold on great and come off easily      
380,5.0,                       these work well each time   last and stay on at least    hours in my experience      
381,1.0,                       i m very disappointed with the quality of the product  they are not adhesive at all  i need to wrap two band aids at a time to make sure it stays in the place  also the fabric gets loose after a while      
382,5.0,                       i have a small section of incision still healing from my amputation   these allow me to put ointment on it  and to keep it from being rubbed on      
383,5.0,                       these have great adhesion  yet can be removed without taking skin with it  can t say the same at all for their  tough strip  variety   use caution with those  i keep these bandaids on for up to a week without changing  so long as i don t get them soaked  even then they stay on for a couple days  their longevity is shorter if used on a finger that s frequently involved with running water i like the  assorted sizes  option and find this provides a reasonable quantity of the   sizes   if you don t frequently use the      and      you re better off with the flexible fabric     ct of the   x        
384,5.0,                       i love these bandaids they are my favorite they adhere the best of any of the others i ve tried i think the fabric gives the best feel and flexibility while maintaining stick to the skin i don t even care if they re not very waterproof  i just avoid getting that part when when i was my hands  these are the best  hands down      
385,5.0,                       these band aid brand bandages are far superior to cheapo dollar store bandages   you also can t beat the deal of     bandages for under    delivered via prime   sure  they won t arrive in time if you are beading profusely and need one now  but this is a great item to order if you are anything like my family who goes through bandages frequently due to cut fingers and skinned knees   we always keep a supply on hand the thing i like about these is they adhere better than cheapo bandages   they also breathe better than those plastic bandages that turn your skin white if worn more than a couple of hours   this is one of those products where it is better to buy a name brand than waste money on a off brand bandage that won t stay on      
386,5.0,                       excellent bandages   fabric with high flexibility   bandage pad has non stick film   bandage adheres to itself tenaciously   has to be cut off   sticks to skin tightly  but not too tightly  three sizes   small  medium  and large   i use bandaids mostly for finger cuts and the medium size works best for adult fingers   i don t have much use for the small size  which are the most abundant   but the the small size is probably targeted for smaller kid s fingers  for those of us who don t have kids around  the small size probably won t be used much before the larger sizes are used up   but  still  a good value for an assortment      
387,5.0,                       the fabric like adhesive makes the bandaid stick longer   the only thing i do to enhance the security of the bandaid is i cut the sticky ends in half and overlap at an angle      
388,5.0,                       great assortment and excellent quality

392,5.0,                       great value for the amount of brandades     
393,1.0,                       if your skin is at all oily  sweaty or has lotion on it  these will not stick at all  waste of   for me      
394,2.0,                       do not have much flex to them when you put them on  adhesiveness runs out fast in water

415,5.0,                       thanks       
416,5.0,                       value and assortment of sizes to fit all needs     
417,5.0,                       as described      
418,5.0,                       these are ok as long as they do not get wet  they unravel if they do      
419,5.0,                       exactly what you expect from the band aid brand     
420,5.0,                       stays where you put it even when wet     
421,2.0,                       i clean pools and from time to time during the winter and filter cleaning season i get a few scrapes and bumps and sometimes this causes bleeding  i really like to refill my first aid kit because it helps a lot not to spill blood everywhere while i m on the job  i recently got this to refill some of the older bandaids i purchased from my costco bundle hoping that these be the same quality  but they are not that water resistant at all like the previous time i purchase  the band aids have just slipped off and the adhesion is either really poor or these are old and expired band aids  can t really knock on the brand because this is always been my go to brand but if you re near water or are going to be around a lot of water i definitely recommend going different route then this type of band aid for coming up small cuts      
422,5.0,                       all you need is this one  one box can with different size      
423,3.0,                       the amount is larger than the amount sold at the drugstore  but it is so strong that it tears my skin        
424,1.0,                       these band aids are not made by the band aid company and the band aid say on the box and on the package is made in china band aids do not make any of their products in china  are use this band aid and i got the worst rash on the side of my foot  contacted band aid and i ended up sending them the box because they said they don t have a plant in china at all   do not be fooled by these band aids

449,5.0,                       sticks well

453,5.0,                       great quality product  not itchy  stay on for a whole day even after washing hands several times  very resistance  couldn t recommend more     
454,1.0,                       upset because this came in a freaking little plastic sandwich bag  wtf   are they all accounted for  who knows  it s a sandwich bag filled of random bandages so i hope so  picture shows a retail style box     
455,5.0,                       i purchased this to go in my first aid bag at home   seems good to go      
456,5.0,                       its a band aid    it works    wish there was more variety of sizes  i m not allergic to the adhesive    so thats a plus      
457,4.0,                       good product   but    too many smaller bandaids in the box   kind of a  jip        
458,1.0,                       band aids suck as they are always peeling off when i start to sweat  nexcare bandages are the best      
459,5.0,                       band aids  not sure what you re looking for in this review      
460,5.0,                       works great and semi water resistant     
461,5.0,                       these bandaids are excellent  i was afraid that ordering these in bulk would get me crappy low quality band aids but these are flexible  comfortable  and stays stuck together all thru exercise and swimming  and i want to specify i used   bandaid and it stayed stuck together thru sweaty calisthenics and swimming afterwards      
462,5.0,                       these are my favorite kind of bandages and this is a good deal for a lot of them      
463,4.0,                       very nice     
464,5.0,                       good   as described and good value pack      
465,5.0,                       does the job  great adhesion     
466,5.0,                       i love all the sizes   very easy to apply      
467,5.0,                       came with a good variety of sizes  definitely worth the price  good value      
468,5.0,                       excellent      
469,5.0,                       nothing like band aid bandaids      
470,5.0,                       love this type of bandaids     
471,5.0,                       i bought these to cover cuts  keep them from getting dirty  and allow them to heal  check  check  and check   band aid really came through with this one      
472,1.0,                       this is how i received this      
473,1.0,                       definitely not what i expected   they go on nicely and that s it   i put them on and after only a few minutes of doing anything  they start to shred   the first time you get them wet they slip right off    won t purchase again      
474,5.0,                       these stay on in water and are much harder for kids who are pickers to get off      
475,4.0,                       it s a really good brand  so far the best bandaid i ve got  but this box was a bit of disappointment however  it s still as sticky as before  not really waterproof  but it won t come out when you take shower or swimming      
476,5.0,                       great value     
477,5.0,                       and don t take  your kids to the er for a cold   unless they are dehydrated or spike a high temperature or become unconscious   oh crap  take  em to the hospital   i don t need a lawsuit for giving advice      
478,5.0,                       as an emt  i ve dealt with many different types and brands of self adhesive bandages  these are by far the most durable  with their tough fabric backing  and an ample amount of adhesive  these bandages will simply not fail you  their perfect for everything from every day use  to backpacking trips into the great outdoors  although they lack water resistance  their ability to cling to cuts under almost any circumstance  more than makes up for it  sweat  dirt  skin hair and hard use are no match for these band aid brand flexible fabric masterpieces      
479,5.0,                       excellent item as expected  bandaid never fails        
480,5.0,                       love  price     
481,5.0,                       ban daid ban daid works great     
482,5.0,                       use too many     
483,5.0,                       one of the best band aid products from band aid  my wound was on my foot  and it stayed dry during my showers      
484,5.0,                       best bandages     
485,4.0,                       price cheaper but the size smaller     
486,4.0,                       i like the different sizes  but disappointed with adherence quality  it s hardly lasting for   to   hours  i can t return since i already open the box  but next time will try some other     
487,5.0,                       purchased several boxes good price for a good product     
488,5.0,                       so convenient to have things like this shipped  good product      
489,5.0,                       these are fantastic for covering wounds   they can usually last several days if you want  even go through a shower they are so flexible and quite effective compared to the plastic film versions   i only use these they work near finger joints and other flex places      
490,5.0,                       good deal  will purchase again  way cheaper than drugstores      
491,5.0,                       these are my favorite band aids to buy  because the pack provides me with different sized band aids for different situations  normally  i ll go to cvs to get my band aids  but i decided to purchase from amazon this time  because i had a lot going on and didn t feel like making the journey the package arrived in great condition  and was no different than going out to the store to buy them  i m very happy with my purchase      
492,5.0,                       sizes     
493,5.0,                       there are large and small  easy to remove and waterproof  suitable for home use      
494,5.0,                       good product and cheaper than the pharmacy       
495,5.0,                       purchased as a filler but always good to have on hand      
496,3.0,                       band aids are fine but the packaging was destroyed      
497,1.0,                       these are very good band aids   stick well  stay in place well and are comfortable   not that water resistant  though   good mix of sizes   made in china though   so i m looking elsewhere in the future   i went to return these and they are not available to return      
498,5.0,                       my kids go through bandaids like there s no tomorrow  the flexible fabric bandages are their favorite  they stick well and provide comfort and can be removed painlessly  the perfect sizes are included in this variety pack      
499,5.0,                       as described     
500,5.0,                       there is no substitute for the fabric bandaids plastic bandages just don t stick these are great  you should buy them especially if you re accident prone      
501,5.0,                       regular bandaids have their place  and are great  sometimes fabric is better  and i really like these  they are super sticky  and conform to non standard surfaces  great for toes  for example  because you can stretch them  and they stick like crazy  and don t come off inside your sock  they are somewhat harder to remove because of the strong adhesive  and i usually end up using scissors to cut them off if they are wrapped around something like a finger  being fabric  they are not at all waterproof  and i would not expect them to be  but i ve showered with them  and they stick well in the water   but of course the fabric gets soaked      
502,5.0,                       affordable    great usable sizes so many boxes in the store have very few and also too many tiny bandages      
503,2.0,                       i tried twice and both time i had a reaction on my screen  i never had reaction with any brand bandaid  please be careful especially people with sensitive skjn     
504,5.0,                       out of all the bandages that i have used  band aid bandages still remain my favorite  they stick nicely to any cut  removal can be painful  but i believe that to be a very minor inconvenience      
505,5.0,                       good flexible fabric bandages   they stay in place and the pads seem to absorb more than the plastic bandages   they are comfortable   i have sensitive skin and they do not irritate my skin      
506,5.0,                       great      
507,5.0,                       good product   keep this box just in case        
508,5.0,                       not the most adhesive      
509,5.0,                       great quality for the price     
510,5.0,                       good     
511,5.0,                       good value     
512,3.0,                       they are just band aids  not big deal  but the packaging is not great   received a cardboard box full of loose bandages  most are very small size      
513,5.0,                       great price and band aid brand is the best i ve tried others and they don t stay on     
514,2.0,                       i ve used band aid brand for many years and like the flexible fabric ones   this brand has been one of the few where the adhesive did not give me a rash   as i m always needing some size  i thought this large box and selection would be good to have in my first aid arsenal   however  the first use on my arm caused a reaction and made the area where attached red  itchy and painful   it took a day after removing for the swelling and redness to go down   these are made in china  so not sure if they have changed their adhesive or manufacturing process   i plan to check the local stores to see if they are also made in china   if so  looks like i ll be shopping for a new brand   disappointed   on the upside  it s a good selection of sizes if you can tolerate the adhesive used      
515,5.0,                       when you want a bandage that holds tight  is easy to remove and is water resistance  get these   after buying the cheaper ones  i came back to these as they work just like you want   your kids will thank you      
516,5.0,                       always a great brand of band aids  very happy with the size assortment      
517,5.0,                       great bandages  we are well stocked      
518,5.0,                       they work as expected     
519,2.0,                       the band aids may be fine  but amazon stuffed this little band aid carton into a large shipping box with something quite heavy  in the shipment  the heavy item banged around over the band aid carton  when i opened the shipping box  the band aids kind of exploded  falling all over the floor and table  what a chore to crawl around finding all the band aids  sorting them out by size  and trying to get them into the badly crinkled carton where they belonged        
520,3.0,                       these fabric kind will fray and the sizes are different      
521,5.0,                       water resistant and it holds that s the main thing it holds together and it s tight  overall  it healed my buubuu      
522,2.0,                       should of read the description and not the pic and questions  what i thought was    x    was actually an assortment which is mostly useless to me  so my mistake  only    of     i can use  the rest i m going to just throw out  and i find the fabric not as adherent as the sports version     
523,5.0,                       good quality     
524,4.0,                       title says most of what needs to be said   other than that  they aren t quite cheapo bandages  but they aren t more than    well    a band aid  if you re looking to waterproof a wound or be able to wash your hands with your bandage on  find a more premium bandage   these are great for little nicks and cuts that can get infected or take longer to heal if exposed and rubbed on things  like fingers or hands  but they will need to be changed frequently      
525,5.0,                       adhesion  and easy to remove  great for kids cut      
526,3.0,                       sorry to say that adhesive being used in these flexible strips has changed after two hand washes with regular soap  off it comes  doesn t last one day   i ll stick with tough strips the adhesion still pretty good but also less than used to be      
527,5.0,                       they have good adhesion  they are flexible fabric  and they do a great job in protecting small cuts and scratches  we did not buy them to be waterproof or water resistant  which these are not  i will continue to always buy the band aid brand      
528,5.0,                       great product and the price is right      
529,5.0,                       i love this product   it s band aid   not water resistant though but it doesn t claim to be   take note that these are assorted sizes      size types  small  medium    large    if you want one sizes only  band aid sells them too   and that size is the large version      
530,5.0,                       made of fabric     per box all good sizes  very good deal with fast shipping      
531,4.0,                       good band aids for the price  wish they included the small square ones though      
532,3.0,                       the band aids were of the standard quality   however  the cartons lacked a shipping carton so the box had items coming out the top and bottom  wrinkled packaging  etc      
533,3.0,                       i know they aren t waterproof but they aren t even slightly water resistant  i put it on and wash my hands once  trying not to get it wet but any water on it and it slips right off  it s a waste of a bandaid if i have to constantly put on a new one      
534,4.0,                       i like it in my first aid kit     
535,5.0,                       not waterproof but i like the material  i bought it when it on sale  it goes different sizes  good for home standing      
536,2.0,                       i was a little disappointed that the box of bandaids came opened and damn near ripped apart      
537,5.0,                       these are the best   these teen boys go through a lot of bandaids   hard working farm boys give these quite a test      
538,5.0,                       work well  moves with the body well  doesn t make my skin breakout somehow  for a accident prone person like me  these are a must have around the house      
539,5.0,                       band aid brand dependable and reliable      
540,1.0,                       there no option for  minus rating for this product otherwise i woul  i recommend not to buy as i used for my son and this band aids are por quality and does not stick  it peels off in     mins on its own   i strongly do not recommend to buy these band aid      
541,5.0,                       easy to remove  great quality and great price     
542,5.0,                       honestly  once it gets wet  how well can it really stay on  i wash dishes  even so  it does what i expect it to do  protect wounds until they re nearly healed  it s the comfort in name recognition that compels me to stick with the tried and true for band aids  oops bandages      
543,3.0,                       sad  band aids are fine but the packaging was destroyed so when i opened the outer amazon box the individual band aids went everywhere bc the flimsy bandaids box was mangled  now i have a ziplock baggie of band aids in my hall closet      
544,3.0,                       it is still easy to fall off after being wet  i want a good band aid     
545,5.0,                       exactly as described and received quickly      
546,5.0,                       there s a variety of lengths sizes  and the product works great

551,5.0,                       easy to put on and stick for daily use    good value for the amount      
552,3.0,                       smells like something spilled on the band aids  or maybe they were stored by something medicinal   not worth returning   other than the smell  these are high quality band aids      
553,5.0,                       great band aids  perfect for back of heels when i wear flat shoes  no more blisters      
554,5.0,                       every time we try to save money with off brand we regret it  stay with band aid brand they stick and work best  assorted size good to have around the house      
555,3.0,                       deteriates quickly     
556,5.0,                       good job     
557,4.0,                       mostly better than other brands   but these still fray a little too easily and ought to last longer than a day       
558,5.0,                       like fabric type stay on longer     
559,5.0,                       bought for our med kit at home  good adhesion to the skin  various sizes and flexible      
560,4.0,                       great product  box was crushed

562,5.0,                       more bandaids  i want more bandaids  get these so you never have to search forever for a dang bandaid     
563,1.0,                       these band aids do not stick   furthermore  when i initiated a return in this regard  amazon informed me that these were not eligible  yet that information was not provided in the item description when originally purchased      
564,5.0,                       old faithful     
565,2.0,                       the water resistance is not good enough   however the price is very affordable     
566,5.0,                       nice band aids  they will stretch to fit well around the finger or toe  they stick fairly well although not as well as the truly waterproof plastic ones  i like them because they breathe  they don t leave your skin with that white water logged look if you leave them on for a couple of days  plenty to last for a long time      
567,4.0,                       great for small cuts and scrapes      
568,4.0,                       great  cheap band aids  just know they re not      waterproof and your cut will get wet if you when you soak your hands or whatever  nice part is that they are easily removed when wet      
569,5.0,                       this was a great deal  so many band aids  so little money

576,5.0,                       i love these bandaids for their adhesion  i had the same brand but different line of bandaids that just don t stick  especially on active kids  these bandaids don t fall off that easily  love them       
577,5.0,                       nothing to complain about      
578,3.0,                       it lengthy wound prit protected the woundeven if the bandaid got wet    l     
579,5.0,                       what can you say about band aid that hasn t already been said   it s our family s favorite brand  we try not to get anything else  quick shipping  great packaging     
580,3.0,                       please note that waterproof can only be used in the shower  swimming and diving are not waterproof      
581,5.0,                       sticks well     
582,3.0,                       these are horrible  they have way too much adhesion and can tear the skin when you take them off  that has happened to two of us  and they have threads that come off fray and hang on the area of the bandaid      
583,5.0,                       band aid is a good brand       
584,5.0,                       great assortment of sizes  perform as advertised      
585,2.0,                       these do not adhere well   i think they are too old      
586,5.0,                       it is good to use     
587,5.0,                       not water resistant but if on body can get wet and not fall off  what it s covering would also get wet  if it breathes water can penatrate      
588,5.0,                       nothing beats band aid fabric plasters     
589,5.0,                       i use a lot of them     
590,4.0,                       good buy

593,5.0,                       i am stuck on band aid because bandaids stuck on me         
594,5.0,                       great product     
595,5.0,                       good bandaids for the price  will require replacement after washing your hands most of the time      
596,5.0,                       great product      
597,1.0,                       the product is excellent and this was a reorder for me  however  the product arrived in completely inappropriate packing and the box was completely squashed  the product is still usable but  when you order     band aids  it would be nice to be able to store them in their box      
598,5.0,                       i swear you can never have enough bandaids  this is a great pack to have on hand for all the cuts and little owies that happen      
599,5.0,                       comfy and don t leave a sticky residue when removed      
600,5.0,                       this is a pretty good assortment of band aids i can definitely recommend them      
601,4.0,                       these band aids stick well  my issue is that they are super painful to remove  and  i ve been using them in a non hairy spot on my body  if you re looking for a band aid that sticks this is the band aid for you  i also purchased one box and got a second box half off  it was a great deal      
602,5.0,                       a much better convenient alternative as opposed to going to the store  same quality  cheaper price      
603,5.0,                       strong work good      
604,3.0,                       not water proof  get off easily      
605,3.0,                       this is a product we all need at home  its standard quality meaning it wont stick to your hand all day long or to your foot if your shoe is rubbing  at least in my personal experience     i do wish it was more sticky and even though they tend to fall off of me on the areas i would use them for the most   hands and feet  they always seem to leave adhesive behind on the skin that looks like a dirty mark that doesn t wash off these are fine but they aren t heavy duty for active people      
606,5.0,                       i seem to have problems with bandages   either they stick to my skin or stick to themselves but not both   i have tried different brands and different varieties within each brand   imo  these are the best that i have tried   they stick to my skin and to themselves while protecting the wound   that s exactly what i think bandaids are for  unfortunately  they have the new thinner gauze pad  but i would still buy them again      
607,5.0,                       bandaide brand bandages   no more need be said      
608,3.0,                       it works as intended      
609,5.0,                       good product     
610,5.0,                       great to have in the house  good quality and they stay on  even through a shower       
611,5.0,                       this was the best purchase of band aids i have ever made  the assortment allows the versatility needed for various types and sizes of wounds  it is a comprehensive first aid cabinet in one small box  all at a very nominal price      
612,5.0,                       my kids are teens now  and we ve gone through all the cute bandaids etc  so i ve tried a lot of brands and types   these are the best   they don t make you sweaty  and they stay on very well   these are the only ones i buy now      
613,4.0,                       the product is very good  the same as the product i bought in the pharmacy  it is worth buying     
614,5.0,                       i like band aid brand   always have  always will   not sure what else to say   they adhere well  they soak up water if you have it on your hand and wash your hands  but they stay on through a couple washes   i like the mix of sizes      
615,1.0,                       these are terrible  would give them a zero if i could  won t stick to anything  must be old      
616,5.0,                       the box was a bit smushed  perhaps it was damaged by the post office  didn t cause any harm to the product  these are great bandaids  very durable      
617,5.0,                       i love these band aids  i bought them a few months ago because the bandages that came in my first aid kit were running low  i didn t have super high expectations  but i am beyond impressed with their quality i accidentally cut myself shaving in the shower the other night  when i got out  i put on a bandage  and then forgot about it  which is unheard of for me because i have very sensitive skin and even in the teeny tiniest little tag will drive me crazy  and then  three days later after two additional showers  the bandage was still there    i ll admit it was a bit ratty  but i ve never had a bandaid make it through one shower before  let alone two i am very  very happy with this purchase and will absolutely continue to buy these after my current box runs out      
618,4.0,                       a little disappointed         
619,3.0,                       too sticky for sensitive skin  excellent adhesion  painful removal from arm  probably awesome for heels   knees      
620,5.0,                       they re band aids  who s gonna besmirch band aids  not me  grew up with  em

623,5.0,                       love how comfortable these are  while protecting the wound completely      
624,5.0,                       what can i say   they re band aids      
625,5.0,                       great assortment of strong stretchable bandages     
626,5.0,                       great price      
627,5.0,                       this lasted only    days  then leaked contrary to advertised durability  would like a refund      
628,5.0,                       great price      
629,5.0,                       always the best bandaids      
630,5.0,                       i love these band aids  they are the material ones   not the plastic type  they hold well and are easy enough to remove  just what i expected      
631,5.0,                       i am allergic to many bandaids but tolerate this type  it goes on easily and stays put until you are ready to remove it      
632,5.0,                       durable   flexible and water resistant     
633,5.0,                              
634,5.0,                       i have a terrible skin condition that i m  working on healing but in the mean time  i have found relief with band aids and neosporin  my skin on my hands breaks easily and i have papercut  like cuts all over my hands    often   no i m not diabetic     i was using cheapy band aids before these and in comparison these are great  i wear them at night because that s longest stretch of time that i go without wetting my hands   these do come off easily if i wet my hands    because i m always washing them  and agitating soap     but i m sure these are fine if you wear them elsewhere    the band aid is fabric like material    its stretchy but doesn t compromise the adhesion which is great  i love these      
635,2.0,                       i do not know why these have such a good review     
636,5.0,                       this is the perfect package of bandages for the home or office   good quality  flexible bandages that come in a lot of different sizes   good adhesion and the flex  stretch even around your knuckles without making it uncomfortable which is nice      
637,5.0,                       same price as cvs and walgreens nearby me  great for topping off the first aid kit      
638,5.0,                       excellent     
639,4.0,                       works very well  but sometimes left a sticky residue      
640,5.0,                       excellent price  would buy again  love the assortment of sizes  and it s a know brand      
641,5.0,                       better than any other band aids on market  works perfectly     
642,4.0,                       good bandage     
643,5.0,                       nothing wrong with the product but it was balanced on the edge of the porch half wall totally showing any porch pirate  here is a package for you to get  hooray     usually ups or usps will at least set it out of sight on the floor of the porch out of sight     
644,5.0,                       cloth bandaids are the best bandaids  no discussion necessary  i don t use any other kind of bandaids      
645,5.0,                       great product      
646,2.0,                       see attached picture but box was destroyed when i opened the package and some bandaids are unusable      
647,5.0,                       a need to have for any home     
648,5.0,                       they adhere well and it s not very painful to remove      
649,5.0,                       great band aids     
650,5.0,                       bandaid brand is stuck on me they stick really well and the pain or removing them alone makes me never want to take them off      
651,5.0,                       these are basically the only band aids i ever use  and i use a lot because i m always getting cuts and insect bites in the summer   they are incredibly tough and flexible  and will stay on for a week  even in the shower  seriously   they are not waterproof at all  but that s the trade off for comfort and durability   however  water proof band aids are not great for healing anyway the skin needs to breathe      
652,1.0,                       i purchased these along with some other items for my elderly father   the bandaids where put in a big box along with boost protein drink and a few other items  the package was damaged during transport and a bottle of boost exploded and ruined the bandaids  i tried to return but they do not offer returns     
653,3.0,                       the product looks great but the box arrived completely broken    in an amazon bag  not a box so it s probably the travel now it s not nice in my storage  so ashamed      
654,5.0,                       have been using these flexible band aids in various sizes for more than    years  have tried others from time to time  but these are the gold standard imho  and i plan to keep buying them for the rest of my life  stay on through showers  under gloves at work  in the heat and cold  please never stop making these j j      
655,5.0,                       delivered on time and product is as described  however  don t expect to use the box it comes in      smashed to a point that the box is no longer usable unless you want band aids falling out of the box  five star review for the product  zero stars for packing   transport      
656,5.0,                       i have loved these for years  but this must be new and improved  now they don t stick at all  horrible  why do they do this      
657,5.0,                       last more than the dollar stores ones     
658,3.0,                       they do not stick to the skin  why     i wasted money      
659,2.0,                       not waterproof     
660,1.0,                       it comes off by itself  adhesive is really weak and is not water resistant  kept coming off and i kept hurting myself in the same place and the bleeding would stat again  finally went out and got a new set from bartells      
661,2.0,                       i miss the old days when band aids would stick until you were ready to remove them      
662,5.0,                       band aids are always good to have      
663,5.0,                       this is basic fabric band aid is everything i need to cover my medication  it stays on after hand washing and shower  and is easy to remove after around    hours i ve tried some other off brands  including the ones they use at my doctor s office and or labs  never as good as this      
664,5.0,                       seems to be resistant to water and goes on easy  stays on  its never come off for me  good band aid      
665,5.0,                       band aid is the best choice to cover your boo boos  the fabric ones are most comfortable when removing these from hairy boo boos  like an armpit  be sure to scream as you quickly tear it off  not only will you feel better  but someone will probably come check on you  share your traumatic experience with them and feel better      
666,1.0,                       thought i ordered all one size but received a box of assorted sizes i could live with that  but they don t stick  they fall off moments afteri put them on      
667,5.0,                       they are not really water resistant  but their adhesive is great      
668,5.0,                       just what we expected     
669,3.0,                       found other cheeper in price brands work better used them on the bottom of my foot and was not impressed      
670,5.0,                       perfect example of a time to definately go with the brand name     
671,5.0,                       good bandaid  like the size variety     
672,5.0,                       they are band aids        
673,5.0,                       bought these warehouse deals  best value around  the box came crushed  all the bandaids were fine   better than half price  they stick and flex well on fingers  my favorite type      
674,5.0,                       needed cloth bandaids to mod my mechanical keyboard  stab mod    they are perfect  and now i have a bunch of extra bandaids for my booboos     
675,4.0,                       great band aids  i received the package as agreed however the box was busted up      
676,5.0,                       great size and good size     
677,5.0,                       what can i say bandaids they do what they are supposed to      
678,5.0,                       good quality     
679,5.0,                       good product as can be expected from a reputable name brand      
680,5.0,                       perfect bandaids and great price      
681,5.0,                       this same package sells for        in major drug stores like riteaid and walgreens  i like that the pad is as wide as the fabric  other bandaids and bandages fool you with tiny pads that are a quarter the size of bandage  these however do not hold up to showers or swimming  if you expect to go swimming or want to extended life  wrap them with nexcare s waterproof tape      
682,5.0,                       staple     
683,5.0,                       tremendous value     
684,5.0,                       flexible fabric band aids are the only band aids i will buy anymore  they are the best out there if you want a band aid that stays on  i get a lot of cuts on my fingers and most band aids cannot handle being near a joint  they can t flex and move with the skin so they get loose and fall off and that allows bacteria to get in  these flexible fabric band aids are a different breed though  they hang on  even around a knuckle  after a thorough washing and drying of the cut  i apply a dab of neosporin  put the band aid on and let my body take care of the rest  after couple days  a maybe a couple reapplications depending on how dirty i get my hands   the wound is almost completely healed      
685,5.0,                       these are my go to band aids  they are soft on the skin  don t cause irritation  long lasting  and come in a variety of shapes and sizes to fit just about any wound      
686,5.0,                       doesn t come off accidentally     
687,4.0,                       i like this type of band aid  it sticks to skin and allows movement without coming off  there is a good variety of sizes in the package      
688,5.0,                       always the best bandage     
689,5.0,                       they won t peel off until you pry them away from your skin    even if you wear them in the shower  their paper wrappers don t impress me but the band aids sure do      
690,5.0,                       they are good   too many small ones though     
691,5.0,                       they are band aids and are used to protect cuts and scratches  they stay on  they re not waterproof but don t come loose when they get wet      
692,5.0,                       good price here     
693,5.0,                       good price point for the assortment of bandages       
694,4.0,                       this is a very good bandage that stays on no matter what   in fact it is so hard to take off and leaves a sticky residue when you finally get it off  to bad they don t use the same kind of adhesive on their water block bandages      
695,5.0,                       looks good   thanks     
696,3.0,                       variety pack only has two sizes  quite disappointed      
697,5.0,                       okay  so it s a bandaid and i love the different sizes  i did find that the smaller ones were very strong  the sticky part actually took off my skin from my finger  ouch    needed another bandaid      
698,5.0,                       great deal on huge box of bandaids     
699,5.0,                       great bandaids     
700,4.0,                       the quality is good  better than what i bought at the pharmacy  i like it very much  and it helped me a lot      
701,3.0,                       i thought band aid would have been the best to buy  but these don t stick for nothing  im doing house work and constantly cutting my hands and tried these guys and they only stay on if you don t plan on doing anything else with your hands    if not  they come right off  ugh     
702,5.0,                       great buy      
703,5.0,                       there name brand band aids  they work fine  do what they should  stick to skin easily and stay on  easy to remove when ready  i like this box because they have an assortment of sizes

706,5.0,                       great product   does their job      
707,1.0,                       product stated as  band aid brand flexible fabric adhesive bandages for wound care and first aid  all one size      ct  but received assorted sizes  not what i was expecting to receive      
708,5.0,                       great many bandaids of various sizes and fabric for those with tape issues     
709,1.0,                       they were all different sizes  it almost seemed like fake band aids  no good      
710,5.0,                       would buy again     
711,5.0,                       great product     
712,5.0,                       i was skeptical at first to order these because many of the reviews stated the box was delivered crushed   the package came in good condition so no complaints   the bandages stay on for a long time  even in the shower      
713,5.0,                       fast and great price     
714,5.0,                       really needed band aids

717,1.0,                       these band aids are pure junk   within a few hours after application  the edges begin to fray and look very unsightly   i will never by them again      
718,5.0,                       i got these bandages when they were on sale  i bought    that was good bargain  one box has   size of bandages  i used the small one last week  i cut my thumb and bleeding a little bit  this is a good product and sticky for whole day      
719,5.0,                       these are bandaids  they work fine and i liked the price  the brand and the amount  it is various sizes      
720,5.0,                       hubby had minor surgery and needed a band aid twice a day for almost a month   i couldn t go wrong with this bargain price for the real  mccoy band aid   we ve missed so much over the years buying the crappy generic   these were perfect   all different sizes  covered very well and kept clean   may never go back to generic again      
721,5.0,                       i ve tried the other off brand bandaids and always end up coming back to bandaid brand  they are made with quality  stay on well  and are just all around superior      
722,5.0,                       what do you think     
723,3.0,                       this was okay  it s not the best bandage but i like that it came in different size  the box was damaged from the shipment otherwise it s good product to have at home in emergencies      
724,5.0,                       too much adhesive made it difficult to remove   overall satisfied with product      
725,5.0,                       bandaids are like cool kid bandages  you can wear them like you were in a war zone but really it was just the playground  failed car repair or drunken stupor impact with a lego      
726,5.0,                       i always buy the original band aid brand  curad doesn t even come close in quality

730,4.0,                       this style band aid is exactly what i needed  easy to apply   can be adjusted without loosing adhesiveness  stays on overnight   through the day  i required the bandaids for wound care after surgery i did not test for water proofness there are     assorted sizes        x           x           x      unfortunately the box was crushed during delivery  disappointing when the item included     count bandaids   it is desirable to store for some time      
731,5.0,                       sticks well in all bends and shapes  this is a must have with young kids and clumsy adults

733,5.0,                       great band aids they work excellent

735,2.0,                                   bands everywhere in the package      
736,2.0,                       it easily took off when i wash my hand  not resistance to water  it is not very adhesive  i had to use a new one next day      
737,5.0,                       and i m pretty sure if i need a smaller band aid  i can cut one smaller with scissors      
738,5.0,                       great bowl by for emergencies     
739,5.0,                       the same excellent bandaids that i ve always counted on      
740,5.0,                       genuine band aids   they stay on and the cloth is breathable  but oh do they hurt when you pull them off      
741,4.0,                       box came damaged      
742,5.0,                       i love everything about these bandages     except one submerged in water or washing hands they will absolutely come off      
743,5.0,                       i have always liked the band aid brand for the way they stay on  if you put one on a finger and wash your hands  they stay put      
744,5.0,                       good quality  reasonable price  very practical  will buy again      
745,4.0,                       when i received my delivery the bandage box had been damages and there were bandages everywhere      
746,5.0,                       nice to have around  flexible bandages are the best     
747,5.0,                       my wife said it was time to give up the children s bandaids that i ve been using for the past    years  i disagreed but yet here i am reviewing my new bandaids  they do the job  mix these bad boys with some neosporin and you ll be heeled up in no time      
748,5.0,                       holds up     
749,5.0,                       bandaid has always been the best brand  and it still is      
750,5.0,                       these are by far the best band aids on the market  i think most people already know the quality and standards set by this brand  which is why theyre still in business  but i ve been going to them for years and this brand never fails me  especially when it comes to their bandaids   these band aids have amazing adhesive they protect whatever outer layer of skin that needs protection and i just cant find any complaints with this brand or product      
751,5.0,                       as advertised     
752,5.0,                       great value  a needed item in every household

758,5.0,                       good     
759,4.0,                       they seem to be genuine band aid bandages  however the retailing packaging was beat up  and there were only    bandages so i m taking off   star

761,5.0,                       works fine      
762,5.0,                       this the best band aid ever as it stays on you finger and does not fray off  and absorbs blood without oozing out  plus it matches the skin tone better than other band aids      
763,5.0,                       bandage     
764,5.0,                       i liked them stick very well     
765,5.0,                       lots of sizes  kept in my medicine cabinet just in case     
766,1.0,                       the new adhesive seems to cause a serious allergy reaction   see photo  was frightening had to seek medical treatment      
767,4.0,                       somehow don t stick too well but then get stuck on the finest hair  they are ok      
768,3.0,                       good product but the box was all beat up when it got to my house     
769,1.0,                       we received a neosporin that expired          when we ordered it in march           
770,5.0,                       excellent product  if you have a wound  it will soothe your pain quickly  easy to use and pleasant to the touch  i recommend      
771,3.0,                       i m rating this   stars because they have the wrong description      
772,5.0,                       period      
773,5.0,                       they are bandages to cover a cut  a bandaged thumps up here       
774,5.0,                       standard good bandages in a variety of useful sizes  great shipping quality and value      
775,1.0,                       this item frays down to nothing in a matter of minutes of putting it on    i do not recommend it for anyone  any use      
776,2.0,                       not recommended for fingers  get them wet and they shred in just a few hours and the adhesive breaks down  except for fingers i rarely every have need for adhesive bandages like these  the stretchy cloth is nice when it stays intact      
777,1.0,                       the box was torn  and badly taped back up  the bandages were obviously stuffed back into the box in a weirdly crumpled way and some were missing  had to toss the crumpled ones      
778,1.0,                       the box came completely distroyed  not even sure if i have all     bandaids      
779,5.0,                       can t get better than the fabric ones  they are all i ll buy      
780,3.0,                       i needed band aids for the kids at my job and it was much easier buying a big box here rather than going to the store      
781,1.0,                       tried these and found out they are very low quality knock offs  they don t look or feel like genuine band aids  the individual wrappers are difficult to open and don t look the same as johnson   johnson s  when you try to remove them  they shred and don t come off in   piece  what does come off leaves a large amount of adhesive on your skin  very annoying      
782,5.0,                       great deal  great product  great service  happy customer       
783,5.0,                       these work great  right amount of stickyness so that i don t ever have to worry about the bandage falling off  good price also  very comfortable  can t go wrong with these one reviewer said that their s shred  but i haven t seen this at all      
784,4.0,                       comfortable to wear   you ll forget you have it on  i don t find them particularly waterproof  especially when placed in awkward places  they re easy to come off after a shower      
785,4.0,                       using at a summer camp  great for cuts and blisters  stick well   easy open     
786,4.0,                       i hope i can keep finding these band aids at such a great price with free shipping helps a lot when you re a dialysis patient     
787,5.0,                       when my blood starts to leave my body  i turn to these to slow it down  this product works and is famous for working  i would buy again but i am hoping to keep all my blood internal and not need more for many many years      
788,1.0,                       these band aids are horrible  they are almost impossible to remove from wrappers  when i tear the wrapper open the bandage tears with it  even if the bandage doesn t tear it sticks to the wrapper  their so difficult i threw them away      
789,1.0,                       was shipped with water damage  not sure if the bandages are even sterile  box was completely destroyed  please refund      
790,5.0,                       better than store brand generic bandages  biggest difference being the larger gauze cloth area that doesn t stick to wounds and a better adhesive      
791,5.0,                       great product       
792,5.0,                       good     
793,4.0,                       the bandaids are fine  the crushed boxed they came in not so much  so i now have a drawer full of loose bandaids      
794,5.0,                       great product     
795,5.0,                       excellent price  great material     
796,5.0,                       perfect for owies  scratches  cuts  but not recommended for surgery     
797,5.0,                       this was a good deal     
798,5.0,                       waterproof band aid can not go wrong     
799,1.0,                       box came in pretty damaged which exposed the bandaids inside  given the time we are in  covid      makes me question whether i should use them or not  would be better if the bandaids were in a plastic packaging inside      
800,4.0,                       a good variety of decent quality band aids      
801,5.0,                       the cloth bandages have always been my favorite  they re durable and breath  can t beat it      
802,4.0,                       worth the price     
803,5.0,                       eexcellent     
804,5.0,                         star     
805,5.0,                       everything good to go no problem     
806,5.0,                       these band aids are just like those bought in the store  the only difference is they were delivered to my front door  recommended      
807,5.0,                       the pouch is a nice durable ripstop cordura nylon and the zipper pull has an added nylon strap pull attached to make opening easier  it seems to be a great deal because the bandages alone would be worth the price  so basically  you get a nice red storage pouch for free      
808,3.0,                       crushed package     
809,5.0,                       great product  arrived on time      
810,5.0,                       would purchase again      
811,5.0,                       good     
812,5.0,                       looks great works great     
813,5.0,                       these are very flexible and comfortable   they bend with fingers  knees  etc   i think they are more comfortable than  regular  bandaids   i gave them  three stars for water resistance because when i washed my hands  they soaked up the water      
814,5.0,                       little to none water resistance  it will fall off if you get them wet in the shower and such  i bought these just in case i needed them for a cut or small wound      
815,5.0,                       for emergency kit     
816,5.0,                       i rarely use bandaids  but when i do it s important  these are my go to as they are flexible  stay on  even in awkward locations such as fingertips   breathe well and come off easily when time to remove  great for use as a butterfly  helping me maintain never having to be stitched up      
817,5.0,                       thanks to amazon  i can find a great deal on bandaids  this is the authentic brand and this box has a great variety of sizes to fit our needs  i had a bad cut on my finger so i do need to change bandaids often these days to keep my wound free from infection  this really helps a lot      
818,5.0,                       i feel funny reviewing bandaids but these are great  i got a couple moles removed on my torso and didn t realize how much i needed flexible bandaids  after using more stiff ones for about a week  i bought these and they are just noticeably better  they move with you  definitely recommend      
819,5.0,                       been using these band aids for a while and the only issue we have is that it s not as water resistant as we would like for them to be  but they do the job they re supposed to when you don t come into contact with a ton of water      
820,5.0,                       i m so glad these came in  just in time because i got a paper cut  these are pretty durable  i wash my hands a lot  so of course they don t stick as well  however they do last the whole day      
821,4.0,                       good buy  good brand
