0,5.0,                       so i normally use my ninja foodie which is really expensive  so i did a comparison between the   and this air fryer cooks exactly the same as my foodie  same cook temp  time and everything   i do like the look of this one better and it has replaced my foodie on the counter lol i love the ease of use of the buttons and the display looks very nice and clean  i love the basket release button its not come loose on me at all so far  it s also square and fits food better inside than the foodie does  it also fits a lot better on my counter  it s very easy to clean and easy to check on food during cooking and the food tastes great  this actually seems to cook a tad hotter than my ninja so i can probably even do less time on meals  i love the reheat button  my kids love how reheated pizza comes out in it  ribs come out amazing in here  i baked them and then added bbq sauce and air fryed about    minutes   i would definitely recommend this air fryer  will update if i find any complaints after longer use      
1,5.0,                       i ve been wanting an air fryer for a long time and i finally made the plunge  this air fryer got some many   star reviews i had to get it  the basket is huge and fits a lot  first time trying it and we made wings  tip  if you want crispy wings shake some baking powder on them  they came out super crispy compared to my first batch  highly recommend this airfryer  it s quite  easy to clean  and cooks amazing   a must buy      
2,5.0,                       i m so in love with this machine  it was super easy to set up the instructions are very clear  it was easy to use  easy to clean  i was afraid that it would take the food flavor away but no it didn t it actually leaves a really nice crispy flavor on my wings that i made the most that i love about use it is that i don t have that many dishes to wash lol and since the basket it s big enough to make food for my family of   it s easy to wash also  this air fryer it s a must have for everyone i just love everything about it        
3,5.0,                       while i am generally going to praise this unit  please do know that it is a lower priced unit with a lot of plastic   i found this out by accidentally letting the drawer bang on the granite counter  resulting in plastic clips which hold the front cover together breaking off   however  the unit still functions  looks like it has a loose bumper  and amazon has offered to replace the unit even though i said it was my fault and was inquiring about a replacement drawer  foolish me  soooo     for the price this unit cooks great  has great capacity and is easy to use and easy to clean   this is our first air fryer and it works better than expected   don t expect deep fryer results  but expect most of the way there with much more healthy results my adult aged son is a picky eater  doesn t cook much  but he loves fried foods   he s taken to the air fryer very quickly and makes his own mozzarella sticks  fried tofu and more   that s the result we wanted      
4,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i have a ninja air fryer  but i needed   air fryers  buying another ninja is expensive          so i relied on our old friend amazon cutting the store lines and expensive brands wish i would have bought this instead of splurging that much on a ninja  it s smaller but it does the same  crispy fries and crispy chicken  on top of the air fryer it guides you with the proper temperature for each food group  no more guessing  will buy some for christmas gifts  hope this helps you save money and time as it did for me      
5,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          wow   so convenient an easy to use  i m hooked   i cooked frozen tacos an burritos in    mins an they are very crispy an delicious    love   this product  worth the money  now to go grocery shopping      
6,5.0,                       i loved how easy the air fryer was to set up and use  i started using it the same day i received it  i got it because i m going on a journey to be healthier and it honestly helps  there is virtually no mess  so quick and easy which so many other options  not just air frying  i ve been using it atleast twice a day       
7,4.0,                       my wife loves this machine she hasn t cooked with  anything else since xmas easy clean easy to use awsome flavor a must have  the only reason for the   stars instead of   is that it advertises     free recipes included  but it doesnt i tried to reach out to the company using  the email address giving to me on the instruction  booklets and it says not a valid e mail address  so i looked online and found a company  email address but no response but that doesnt take away from the product it works awsome update i know alot of people are complaining about not being able to find the     recipes believe me it was a pain in the a but i hope this helps on the description  look real close for application pdf it s really small u will need to download a pdf reader i use adobe acrobat  reader in ur play store it s free after u install the pdf reader press application pdf and waka theres ur     recipes comfee promised good luck     
8,4.0,                       only used it about    times so far  i have over under cooked a few things   i have so far found that baking pillsbury grands took a little more time than online recipes  lower heat as well   apparently it takes very little oil spray to brown  mine overbrowned and undercooked in the middle   french fries after a couple of tries came out well  this is a basic  cheap  model  i did not want to blow a lot of money on something that i did not know if i would like  the only downside i see is that the timer is a dial and apart from    min intervals it s hard to get accurate  is t    or    on the deal   for the money it s worth it  when done correctly the food does taste good      
9,5.0,                       i m blown away by the tastiness of the food coming out the air frier   also saves time compared to using an oven   cuts time to cook in almost half   it cooks fried food great  tastes basically like a real deep fry with a lot less calories  quicker  and a lot easier clean up   it also can bake and reheat items really well   things like eggo waffles or pancakes come out great i haven t tried the dehydrate function but it s also advertised as doing that other reviews mentioned problems with the basket   i have experienced none of those issues   there s a button that has a flap that is used to control that function   and it s very easy to not press   especially because it is protected by a plastic cover   so all in all  it cooks great and i didn t have any problems other reviewers mentioned   very happy with my purchase     
10,4.0,                       so  my friends are all super in love with their air fryers   i m less impressed   it turned a frozen burrito into a hard block   it only cooked one side of the grilled cheese  and took a while doing it   i will admit  that it reheats takeout fries like a dream   and mr loves it for his tots   i just expected to like it more  use it more   i m going to try baked potatoes next  i think   the girls said they loved them in it   we ll see   i imagine as i get used to it  it ll probably be good   my niece loves theirs  and uses it all the time   i m probably just weird   nothing new there      
11,4.0,                       i like mostly everything about this air fryer  it s my new favorite appliance  it makes the crispiest fried chicken and it s great for cooking single servings or enough for    the only thing i didn t like was the numbers and all of the lettering completely wiped off after the first use  overall a great product but now i have to guess the temperature i m cooking my food at      
12,5.0,                       i ordered this to use as a dehydrator to make backpacking meals  works like a charm  the basket is large enough to hold a decent amount of whatever i m dehydrating and the machine dehydrates evenly and thoroughly when shaken well in the middle of the dehydrating cycle  i haven t used it to cook with yet since my intention was to use it as a dehydrator but based on my experience so far  this machine should work exceptionally well for cooking too      
13,5.0,                       bought for my mom  i love her and want her to be around for many more years  she was eatimg alot of microwave food  saw your product and had to get it for her what a wonderful invention  easy to use  even let s you know when to shake  no fuss clean up  healthy cooking in minutes  i want one myself  easily best thing i ever gave my mom  thank you for this     
14,5.0,                       my air fryer came on time  we are loving it    it is so basic and easy for my   yr old son to use to make his fries  it even beeps half way through your cooking time to let you know to shake your food  no more oven for easy and light dishes  this is the appliance to have  the taste of the food that i have tried so far are really tasty and delicious  no mess   no grease  no hard cleaning      
15,5.0,                       this is such a game changer for me  i rent a room and don t have access to a kitchen  this air fryer is amazing  i decided to try salmon first and it came out perfect    the fryer itself is super easy to operate   clean      
16,5.0,                       very nice and easy to use   the images on the top of the air fryer provide temperature information but the book provides guidelines on length of time to cook the food  having the air fryer has made life easier  no messy oil cleanup and no lingering fried oil smell in the house which i used to hate  this was definitely well worth the money      
17,5.0,                       i love this air fryer  it was so easy to use  it came with easy to read instructions i made some onion rings n they came put super crisp as if i had fried them in oil certainly a way better alternative than frying  i cant wait to try other things  i am so amazed and in love  i cant get over how simple it is to use  i highly recommend

27,5.0,                       i m trying to eat healthier but still like fried chicken and french fries   this works surprisingly well   is it as good as kfc   not even close  but on the other hand the chicken turns out quite well   you have to experiment a little to get things the way you like  but it s not too hard   it cleans quite easily    and way easier than scrubbing a greasy frier

31,5.0,                       this was the right size for the two of us  discussed to purchase a smaller one but more than happy with this size after buying we then seperatley bought accessaries maybe should ave looked for a fryer that offered some easy to clean

40,5.0,                       made fries twice in my new air fryer   came out great  the fryer even makes a buzzing sound so you can shake the fries around to make sure they nice and evenly

42,5.0,                       it does the job nicely  just takes some time to learn the all button features   i wish the manual had more air frying information   they make the directions too complicated it s easy to clean and has a large tray to fit lots of food   good for its price

52,5.0,                       i am in love  honestly  i made salmon for my meal prep and it came out better than it did in the oven  the salmon is moist and crispy   disclaimer  read the instructions first  dont be like me and hold the basket in the air and press the release button  the bottom portion of the basket will detach and hit the ground  this will damage the outer covering

57,5.0,                       this air fryer has many functions  i use it to bake cakes and cupcakes  it is very successful and the same as an oven   its operation method is very simple  and it is easy to learn the first time it is used  because there are some data on the air fryer to provide reference when you want to use it   i think it s easy to use and clean

280,1.0,                       i received this today september         this product is very nasty it looks like if it was already used amazon sent a replacement i hate this item when it is time to shake the basket the lanch comes apart this item is cheap for a reason do not buy this item not worth the time     
281,1.0,                       this fryer works well   it does its job but the container that the basket fits in is glued together with a devil of a glue that will stink up the inside of your entire home   it reeks and after heating the thing up for an hour on high  washing it  and sticking it outside  it still stinks   now winter is coming up   if you are in a cold climate where you wont keep the door open then this fryer is a bad choice   if you want a cheap fryer that works and you have no sense of smell then go for it update edit   i can t get rid of the very strong glue smell after trying for a few weeks   i will send it back and i am changing my rating from   stars to   star   too bad because if i could get rid of the smell it would be fine but that isn t happening      
282,1.0,                       i receive my air flyer but didnt receive the     free receipes very disappointed   and the best thing customer sevice did was give        off my order  which not want i wanted or go through the hassle returning the item      
283,1.0,                       i didn t like when i pulled the tray out  it separated from the basket and fell to the nearest surface  i didn t feel safe using this product  the other air fryer i own stays attached until i push a button to release it      
284,1.0,                       i use it  x and it only worked for   mins then blew out then amazon took forever and i still didn t get a new one bc they drivers are rediculous  so i got a refund     
285,1.0,                       no where in the information about the product did it say lead was in this product  just that its bpa and pfoa   very misleading  will be returning

288,1.0,                       i used this air fryer   times and it started to rust   sending it back for a refund     
289,1.0,                       the air fryer itself looked like it was previously used  the tray itself wouldn t close all the way and the front cover came off when i took it outside the box      
290,1.0,                       i purchased less than a month ago the latch broke and fell to floor and the cheap plastic front came off now there are sharp  points  the front can not be put back on   i would not buy again      
291,1.0,                       if i could leave negative reviews i would  air fryer got delivered broken and wouldn t even turn on  and replacement wouldn t be delivered until over a month which would be two months after i ordered  don t waste your time  ridiculous      
292,1.0,                       did not work  i got it brand new out the box  plugged it up and     nothing      
293,1.0,                       basket door does not go in or lock  very dangerous if hot  i never used it  it came that way from amazon  will send it back

296,1.0,                       quit working two days after christmas     
297,1.0,                       i received this item today excited to use  when i went to turn this one  it lit up green  but never the red button that means heating  the air fryer never got hot    i had to take my chicken out and put it in the oven      
298,1.0,                       door broke     
299,1.0,                       broken handle from light use  very disappointed  main components made from plastic  how about use metal on important places  no  gosh     
300,3.0,                       decent air fryer for the money but i have used better ones  not top of the line     
301,5.0,                       so this air fryer is pretty nice  it makes cooking fun     
302,5.0,                       love this product     
303,1.0,                       broke the  rd time we used it  the button broke on the handle  it s stuck in the down position so when u pull the handle the basket inside doesn t stay attached  almost burned myself removing items  so disappointed     
304,1.0,                       air fryer came in the box damaged and look like it been used     
305,1.0,                       it didn t work and amazon did nothing     
306,5.0,                       great product   worth the investment      
307,3.0,                       i must have received a defective item  it was returned  be very careful  the  nd bucket kept falling out when shaking  i have babies and pets in my home      degree chicken grease splattered all over my kitchen  and all over the user  it happened to me when i used it the  st time  then   other household members cooked with it and it did the same thing to them  very dangerous  i have used other brands before and it never happened  i am super disappointed  this brand had great reviews and a great price  now i am without an air fryer until it gets replaced  pretty bummed it couldn t work right and could have severly burned people      
308,2.0,                       just got my comfee air fryers today  use for pork chops  cooking part is okay  but detachable basket    it is keeping falling  and i don t even press the button  it s so dangerous if you re carrying hot food around  the bottom part will fall by itself    and screen had a lot of scratches    isn t the old one for me        
309,3.0,                       on the  nd use  the basket release became unhinged w normal use and is stuck down  out of place  off the track or whatever    i am very disappointed to have to go to the trouble to return the air fryer after   uses      
310,1.0,                       i disliked the fact the basket disconnected from the pan without pressing in the release button  i oven fried chicken thighs and   times this happened  grease and chicken went flying all over me and my kitchen  would not take this if it were given to me  i paid just over        on amazon and regret every penny of it      
311,4.0,                       this airfryer s basket is big enough to fit   lbs  of chicken wings  as pictured   and damned good wings they are  this is the first dish i cooked in this airfryer  received yesterday  it is almost a no brainer to operate  just load the basket with your favorite food  push it in  push the button and that was it  for these wings  i turned them at around   minutes left  they came out delicious  even got an approval from my wife  my next tests will include baked potatoes  small whole chicken and char siu chicken and pork  not all of the same time of course  what a time saver  there are all kind of options for whatever dish you want to cook the reason i gave it   stars is you can not just put the basket in the dish washer  not a big deal  they are easy enough to be washed by hand  but for a lazy person as i am  that one more chore to do after having a good meal      
312,4.0,                       i ordered this and then returned it without opening it  i thought it would be too small  and after i read the reviews  after ordering  i was suspect since the reviews were mixed in with   models  plus  chinese  i then ordered another that was so gigantic  a    qt  it was very un user friendly and when i washed it  it already looked pitted  or at the very least  like it was starting to  after one use  again  it was a huge chinese one that the buttons had a mind of their own  now this one  extremely easy to set  as in  that k you  it set the machine to exactly what i wanted  no fighting with it  per the pic  i have lotsa ribs in there  probably too many  it seems to cook better in the rear of the machine  my ribs are          i m assuming this might be used error  i was going off a keto cookbook recipe  so my first thoughts are  extremely easy to set and use  seems like it will be easy to clean  we ll see  i m actually thrilled with it  i might hit broil on these  can t seem to get some of them cooked evenly  otherwise  i m thrilled and sorry to amazon for ordering this one  not opening it  ordering it again  i love amazon  will update after i cook a few more things in it  glad i have a meat thermometer  can get that on amazon too    and this is a real review from a real person      
313,5.0,                       my old air fryer crashed on me so it was time to try a new one   there s so many on the market so it s hard to pick one  i think i m pretty happy with my choice though   while my other air fryer had specific settings for different foods it was just an air fryer  this one is so much more  there are multiple settings like air fry  toast  bake and even dehydrate  i used it for regular heating of frozen foods and used to toast option to heat up and melt the cheese on my fajitas last night   it s very powerful   tells you when to shake the basket half way through and the basket insert is as deep as the entire casing  qt  which is nice because my old one had just a grill liner for the bottom and was the first thing to break  overall i m happy with my purchase so far      
314,5.0,                       i have had the comfee air fryer     qt for a little more than   months  wanted to give it good use before giving my review on this product  i ve made fries  frozen and fresh made   lamb chops  biscuits  baked potatoes  sweet  and white  i ve made chicken wings  hot  sticky  lemon pepper  and plain fried  made from scratch pot pies  fruit pies  even did field roast brand vegan burgers  all came out nicely and flavorful  made all kinds of chicken  fish  and veggies dishes  season kale chips  all came out very flavorful  eye appealing good i got this just to see what all the rave was  about air fryers  it was inexpensive  and it has the lowest temp and longest time cycle for dehydration  for an air fryer than some of the others i looked at  and they were more pricey i read the instruction booklet which tells you what to expect and prepare for first time use  i preferred to soak it  basket and basket casing  which are washable  i didn t want to run the fryer for a few minutes as they suggested   its burning off the chemical smell creating a white smoking  releasing the smell in the house  soaking in white vinegar and hot water will alleviate that and no smelling up the house  make sure you wash these parts with hot soapy water  rinse  then soak in vinegar solution  about        mins i m pleased with this purchase  would suggest you get an air fryer accessories kit which helps out a lot making clean up easier you can cook up enough for     people after using this for a while you will be able to work time and temp for preparing your food  no preheat button but is very easy to do if you choose to  air fry has alert to shake feature the noise is no louder than a micro wave this does not heat up my kitchen like a conventional oven or counter top convection oven and that s a plus for me  when summer comes i will be using this  its quick with much less heat if your thinking about getting a airfryer but don t have a lot of space or want to spend a lot right now i would say try this to get a feel of what these fryers are able to do  simply good   easy prepared  fresh foods made quick i m glad i got this one      
315,1.0,                       plugged it in the  time and it melted my plugs had to have electrition guy come and fix all me wiring  cost me        i wonder if amazon will pay for that it just over heating i m only lucky it didn t hurt my kitchen  air fryer is ni trash and i want my money back including evectrition amazon please let me know about your help thank you mindy evangelista     
316,1.0,                       was alright when we first got this  but it s small   you can only do   burgers at a time as opposed to the   we could do in our previous fryer  the big ding against this one is the fact that the inter tray separates without even pressing the release button  several times i have pulled the tray out to turn the burgers and the bottom falls away sending the grease flying across the floor and up the cabinets     luckily we got the protection plan so i ll try to get a new one and see if it s the same or just a defect in this one case  tbc        
317,1.0,                       when i plugged the unit in it beeped and the screen flashed for a second  then i heard a popping noise and four electrical outlets in my kitchen are now dead  amazon offered to send me another one  but i don t want to risk having no electricity at all in my kitchen  plus i m going to need my money back to pay the electrician to come out and rewire these outlets   sigh      
318,1.0,                       i must have gotten a dud since there are so many good reviews   the timer did not work and i could hardly turn the dial   every time i took out the basket to stir i would have to turn the timer off   also  i don t think it heated properly because i could not get my fresh sweet potato fries to cook and i must have tried for    minutes   i have since bought another brand that works the way i expected  farberware       
319,5.0,                       i m still learning new tricks with this since i just got it  but i really love this air fryer  it was a lot cheaper than the other air fryers available  it seems to work just as well  it s very easy to clean  the instructions are very simple  and of my food has been coming out very tasty  these are some vegetarian pizza nuggets that i got from the grocery store  i didn t put very many in  but they were fully cooked and had a very nice crisp to them in five minutes  i also made the most amazing brussels sprouts ever      
320,4.0,                       nice product   certainly better than frying  though i d prefer grilling to this  great product  worst english in the manual i think i ve ever seen      
321,5.0,                       this air fryer came and works just as advertised  it was my first air frying experience and it was so easy to use  the directions that come with it are clear to understand  the basket is huge and the presets seem pretty accurate  there is even a  shake  notification when it s time to shake or flip your food so it cooks evenly  i can t wait to make more things in the air fryer  i would definitely recommend this product       
322,5.0,                       since i bought this hot air fryer  i have almost quit using my other appliances   it didn t come with a cookbook so i spent a couple of bucks and bought one glad i did   i can cook the amount i want and put the rest back into the freezer for another time   it s easy to clean and it looks good with my other black appliances   this one is a winner      
323,5.0,                    estuve mirando muchos reviews de air fryers y definitivamente di en el blanco con  sta  vivo solo y  me gusta cocinar para varios d as por cosa de tiempo  buscaba que fuera grande  poderosa y que cocinara r pido    los resultados son los que esperaba    s lo les recomiendo comprar esa parrilla que ven en la foto para darle espacio al alimento y se cocine bien           
324,5.0,                       this air fryer is quick and easy  and is not too loud   it works just as advertised and easy to clean   thanks for a great product  delivered as promised      
325,1.0,                       this would ve been a great air fryer but everything taste like the equipment  a bad metal taste no matter how much i wash it  the latch is so hard to pull out i have to force it  it had scratches on it and i m scared this was used before  i see why this was selling for a lower price  completely disgusted      
326,5.0,                       hubby uses it often  the food cooks well and so far taste pretty good  this was a good investment  anytime i don t have to use whatever we buy is a good thing  the main thing is you need to make sure you preheat the unit or the food doesn t cook correctly at the required time  i would recommend this item  yes  i will be using it also  it really is easy      
327,5.0,                       i got this for my son as he lives fried food but it is not real healthy  he uses if for frozen breaded appetizers and the such  so far he has had good words for it  he is experimenting with different things and methods of using it  if things change  i will update my review      
328,5.0,                       we were excited to get this   out absolutely did not disappoint  i chose this one for the price   reviews   easy to use right out the box  just as pictured   described   it s not overly fancy   but it s easy   very functional  prefect size for our   person fam too  buy it already         
329,5.0,                       super easy to set up  i like how huge the basket is  we cooked fried chicken in it lastnight and it came out crispy  there are other options like roast or dehydration   i can t wait to try those out i also like how easy it was to clean too because we all know how messy it gets when you fry chicken in a pan  lol     
330,5.0,                       i ve wanted a air fryer for over a year now and finally gave in and ordered this one  i love it  it makes cooking so much more convenient and fast  i use it a few times a week  it cooks fried chicken and fries to a perfect crisp fast everytime  i like that it has different temperatures and preset buttons for different things  it is easy to use and just as easy to clean      
331,4.0,                       i love my new air fryer and definitely can t complain about the price  it was super reasonable  the only frustration i have and why i only gave it a   star overall review is because the booklet  or should i say   page info pamphlet  doesn t give any information on the features of the air fryer  otherwise  i love it      
332,5.0,                       so just received and have cooked frozen hamburgers  steaks and chicken strips     all came out great  only issue the book only gives limited info on cooking times  had to go on the web to find heating to cooking charts to help guide me to greatness  for the price outstanding results     
333,1.0,                       total disappointment   finally got my air fryer   plugged it in   dropped by fish into the basket and     nothin   no power  no lights  crap      
334,5.0,                       i only used it once but it worked really well   heated it empty after cleaning it per instructions  with using it for the first time to cook a meal  no plastic smell while it was on   what a nice surprise   i used a parchment paper liner and the clean up was really easy      
335,4.0,                       love the air fryer  i did dock one star since i was disappointed at there not being any examples or descriptions of how to use  only the setup  with temperature and time  glad i watch youtube and can figure it out by checking out other fryers  overall a great product      
336,4.0,                       works great and everything is really crispy     you just have to get use to the digital buttons and turning it back on after shaking      
337,5.0,                       works great  had to get new one because my old one stopped working  this is twice as big   like the healthy side of airfring

358,4.0,                       so my sisters who love to cook have been telling me about how much they love their air fryer  they ve been trying to be more healthy and cook healthier  fried  food for their kids  they swear by air fryer and says its the same or even better than the traditional one  so finally i decided to jump on the bandwagon   today was my first time trying it  my son eats a lot of frozen food like chicken nuggets and fish sticks  i usually cook it up on a mini oven but i decided to get rid of it and start using the air fryer  the bag on the air fryer said     degrees for   to   minutes  teh instruction book to this air fryer said to add   minutes of  prep  time if it s not already  so i put it in for   minutes    fish sticks  the picture shows how it came out  of course  it was cooked and it wasn t cold inside but it wasn t crispy  so my son was not happy about it  so we put it in again for another    minutes  again  my son said it was only crispy a little on one side  he said he liked the oven better  in the end  he ate it but the timing on it didn t match what i thought it should be   when i try it again with other food  i ll come back and edit this review  but for now i did want to explain that first try i do also want to mention putting this together  it was as simple as it get  they had an instruction book inside that had visual and it was super explicit  you could put it together without reading anything becaause really nothng to do  ha  but you do have to know there is a button on the handle where you have to press it and lift at the same time to get the inner part out  ohterwise  everything is self explanatory so you you need to put the food in the basket and then put it in the machine all the way  it will not work if it s not in all the way  do not put any oil or anything in it  however  my sister said if you sprintz just a tiny oil on the food  it makes it more crispy then you just set the temperature  on top of the machine  it actually even gives suggested time after that  to turn it on  you actually just set the time  the time goes to    minutes  one hour   the tick marks are at every   minutes  so it is very hard to estimate like   minutes or numbers that are not divisible by    but it really is okay if you just round it it didn t super dirty or anything but you do need to clean it  the basket that comes out is super easy to clean  just run it through hot water or so  but inside the machine  it does get dirty too and you will need to get a cloth and wet it and clean it  the whole bottom part does come out though also overall for now  i think i do like it because    its so easy to use     easy to clean     healthy  but i am not sure about the crispiness yet  as i try other foods  i ll report back if i learn something new i hope this has helped someone      
359,3.0,                       i was looking for something for two this is meant more for a family of   i returned it as it was too large for my counter space      
360,5.0,                       this comfee is my first air fryer  i became a huge fan after making the following dishes you see in the photos  all of them turned out fantastic and k literally love making food in this lovely appliance  i ll be using it until the day it stops working  which i hope isnt for a very long time      
361,5.0,                       the wife loves this machine and finds reasons to use it  watching her   it seems using this machine is quick  easy and fast  clean up is a breeze  very  very good purchase      
362,3.0,                       what could be the big deal about an air fryer  it is the right size and it cooks the food well enough  the basket part sits so close down to the base that all the oil that drains from the basket into the base still touches the bottom of the basket  it makes cleaning annoying and i never feel like the food is as oil free as i have with other air fryers the basket also does not slide easily out of the base  in addition the timing now has to turn off by itself  if i am finished earlier and want to turn it off  the unit does not shut off until the timing has run down  considering it is only a few weeks old i can only assume the quality of the materials is not great      
363,4.0,                       the device works very well   the down side is that although the inside tray is dishwasher safe  the outer container has to be washed up in the sink      
364,5.0,                       everyone needs an air fryer in their life and this one is so easy to use  the tray is big enough to cook a good bit of food at once which is great for having leftovers or a family      
365,5.0,                       i ve cooked everything from chicken wings to baking fresh bread in this air fryer and it s awesome   size is good  and it s square which makes it easier to fit even a small whole chicken in it  love it      
366,5.0,                       great product essay to use and clean  cooks product great     
367,5.0,                       i love this thing  everyone needs an air fryer
