0,3.0,                       title says it all  get what you pay for i suppose   good enough for casual adult gamers who don t need want to be competitive  so i may just keep it since it s almost half price of real xbox controllers      
1,1.0,                       tldr  radial stick deadzones are     of the total movement  unusable for fps games informative version overall the controller gets a     rating based on the importance of the defect the good     of the controller is absolutely fine  it s super lightweight  so it feels good in your hands  the buttons aren t as smooth as on some controllers but they function just fine  no sticking or extra wobble from being too small  the rumble is nice and the cord length is ideal for pc use  price point is great  and the controller looks and feels very similar to a microsoft xbox controller  solid construction  no wobbly or loose parts the bad the other    makes this controller unusable for almost any shooter games  the joysticks i will preface by saying i ve tested this on   different games and went through every setting from lowest to highest in terms of sensitivity  acceleration  and deadzone adjustments  the only thing i can t rule out is a defective controller  as i ve only tested mine the biggest flaw is these sticks have a huge deadzone  when moving the stick with the   directions  deadzone is normal  this is what i would expect from any controller  when checked   directions  the flaw becomes glaring  the   diagonals have a deadzone of         of the allowed movement before they kick in  this makes any movement that is not   directional  which is     of modern shooters  essentially not possible  the joysticks are arguably the most crucial part of a controller and these do not make the cut  there is a certain level of quality expectation when buying off brand equipment  it ll be  fine   not perfect  not great like an oem version  but just fine and you can use it normally and have saved some money  this product does not make that cut  it falls below fine as it cannot function the way it needs to function if they were to correct this problem  i would say this would be a       product  as is  the   flaw is too essential to it s intended use to give this anymore than a           
2,5.0,                       if there s anything that distinguishes this controller from a first party xbox     one other than the branding  i don t know what it is  and it s likely not worth the cost of buying a first party controller absolutely no issues with it  feels and works great      
3,1.0,                       the product is very cheap quality and the programming from controller to console will not recognize it as a controller for this console  it keeps losing connection to the console despite being a wired controller  and has faulty buttons not registering button press  direction input is atrocious and constantly is pulling to the back right and this product is new out of the box  definitely the worst knock off brand to hit the  rd party wave of products  do not buy      
4,1.0,                       product doesn t work don t buy retuned window closed before was able to try because it was a birthday present     
5,4.0,                       vibration strength could be better but for the money it is an a  controller     
6,5.0,                       this is really a very good product  it can completely replace my previous controller  with it  i can play games happily again      
7,4.0,                       no complaints aside from too much give when pressing the face buttons      
8,5.0,                       excelkent     
9,4.0,                       works well however the right trigger squeaks      
10,5.0,                       edit  so after a while  it did seem like they have addressed the only complaint i had about the controller and updated their page as well addressing this original review so for those that play games with the controller should know the advantage of control over the keyboard is its precision in movement due to having essentially     direction over the   direction keyboard have  this is especially true for games such as resident evil   where the cameras are fixed so having the ability to move where you want exactly is extremely important this controller seems to have a limited direction set which became obvious when i was playing around with different remote and notice that this controller will make characters snap towards a direction rather than gradually turn  what this means is the remote has a limited movement direction in comparison to some of the higher end controllers lacking precise control of the movement      
11,5.0,                       highly recommended this controller it s very good product for a very great price       highly would recommend you buy does everything you need it works just like an official controller for an inexpensive price     
12,4.0,                       maybe i got unlucky  but i get major stick drift when trying to use this on my pc  i bought it so that i could play old     games that weren t backwards compatible on xbox one or available on steam  and it works perfect on my      however  for whatever reason  it starts acting up on my pc  my other controllers don t at all but i didn t buy it for pc  just happened to plug it in one day and try it out  if you are buying this solely for pc  be aware that you might have an issue  really good price though so not too much of a gamble in my opinion      
13,1.0,                       probably the worst controller i ve used in years  the reponse is absolutely dreadful  no crisp movement  all setting are maxed and it s barely responsive to input  it s very cheap and buttons are small      
14,4.0,                       it is a very good control for that price i had my xbox     and the control is practically the same  it has very few differences and the main one is that the other was wireless  and the other difference is that it makes your hands sweat a lot  i think it s because of him   type of material it is made with apart from that it works very well and the vibrator works well too     
15,5.0,                       good     
16,1.0,                       not worth it  delay is terrible      
17,1.0,                       as i said in my title the biggest issue with this controller is that all the buttons work normally except the right stick will not start working for      seconds when starting a new game or loading a save  sometimes it only takes   seconds sometimes it takes a full    depending on the game  it happens the worst in the outerworlds  i bought this to replace an xbox branded controller that was drifting but i would rather deal with the drift than the right stick bug  if you have a saved game when you are being attacked and the right stick doesn t work for    seconds after you load you are going to get killed every time before you can even look around  i am tempted to give this a   of   but since everything works except the stick i ll grudgingly give it   stars  would not recommend this brand to anyone  edit the controller completely died one week after my initial review  none of the system i tried to connect it to even recognize it anymore  this isn t even deserving of my initial   star rating      
18,5.0,                       previously i had difficulty with the controllers  but customer service reached out to me and is sending a replacement free of charge  i can t figure out how to change my below review  but this is my way of updating it to   stars  buy with confidence  since voyee will make things right if there are any issues      
19,3.0,                       worked fine for my xbox but very flimsy      
20,1.0,                       bought two both broke  the  nd broke after three months  connectivity problems with the cord      
21,1.0,                       don t try to play skate   with this controller lol     
22,1.0,                       this controller isn t worth the black powder to blow it up  which i would like to do   plugged it into my xbox  worked fine enough to get the game started  and then it just stopped working  the system wouldn t even recognize there was a controller connected      
23,5.0,                       i didn t want to spend     on a controller so i got this ans it works great  i use it for my pc and i have no complaints      
24,5.0,                       this controller works well and very pleased with it      
25,5.0,                       every bit as good as the name brand controllers  have no complaints about it      
26,5.0,                       works great     
27,4.0,                       is what it is  a     controller  i use for pc and its been through hundreds of hours   some buttons feel a little off  but they still work like they did when i got it   all in all a good buy   i m very much so looking at a higher end pc controller  xbox  steelseries  astro  razer  etc   but cant justify it as long as this thing keeps working just fine  both a curse and a blessing really  if your budget is        you cannot go wrong with this thing      
28,1.0,                       bad product     
29,4.0,                       the longer cord is the primary reason i chose this model  it already has proven better than a previous controller   the only reason why i don t rate it higher is because it doesn t aim as well for some pc games   the thumbstick aiming is laggg    overcorrected w in minor movements  a game issue  doesn t apply for all games      
30,1.0,                       the joysticks have no sensitivity  they are either not engaged  or fully engaged  not usable for fps use edit  company refunded charge for the controller  so that was nice of them  but i still cannot recommend it  it doesn t work well      
31,2.0,                       aug   th       and here i am october   th ordering a new controller  didn t take long    months the left analog stick got lose and has a mind of it s own looking up or in circles   why is every xbox controller i purchased after      all suck and immediately need to be fixed and or replaces ever   to   months  true story  prior to       my xbox controller lasted   years   buy at your own risk      
32,5.0,                       although my first experience would have been lower then five stars  i can justly say it is five  my first one died within the month  and my thought was you get what you pay for  i shoved it away in a drawer until earlier this month  i thought to myself  man i can try to get a new one so i contacted the support team  unbelievably  fast  within the hour of first contact they had gotten a new one shipped out to me  it s a dang good controller  great for my uses  mainly just souls games  but add that on the outstanding customer service and you earn my five stars  as well as future business     
33,1.0,                       i m not picky when it comes to how sensitive controller inputs are  but even i could notice the amount of dead space with both analogue sticks  worthy controller if you need a throwaway which will end up getting banged around update  so after weeks post purchase i ve been hounded by their support department about paying me for a better review  i tried being polite and explaining why i left the review i did yet they kept asking from different emails  don t bother buying this simply because of the behavior they exhibit by harassing unhappy customers      
34,4.0,                       after one day of using it  the left analog malfunctions  when in game  it moves to the right often when i press the analog to the left but the seller offered to send me a replacement at not cost i used it for pc  gtx       ryzen          gb ram  windows     to play games like fallout    conan exiles  terraria  and etc   feels good in hand  lightweight not heavy at all  it has vibration  the cord is   to   feet long   plug   play  didn t need to download any drivers for it      
35,5.0,                       i like the controller because it has a cord and i don t need to easy money on batteries     
36,5.0,                       good controler for the money     
37,5.0,                       love this controller was a bit lighter than the og xbox     controller  but does it s job      
38,5.0,                       i love it work great     
39,1.0,                       do not purchase this controller if you plan on playing any fps  the dead zones in the analog sticks are ridiculous  if you just want to play simple platforms or sport s games then maybe this controller is for you  i should have known better      
40,5.0,                       at first we thought it was broken due to the fact it wasn t syncing to our xbox  we wished there were some kind of instructions in the package that tells you how to do that  thank you you tube  we figured out how to sync the controller to the box and now it works great      
41,5.0,                       pretty good     
42,2.0,                       i am returning the controller because the buttons are not very responsive     
43,3.0,                       this controller is ok for the price  works well and actually is easy to install  instructions are bit to be desired but you can muddle through and figure how to use the the controller      
44,3.0,                       the controller is responsive  but every time i turn the console on i have to unplug and plug in the controller so my console recognizes it  i am afraid i will eventually wear out the plug in port or the cable      
45,5.0,                       excellent customer service helped me with a replacement when my original purchase quit working      
46,4.0,                       i got sick and tired of the continuous wireless replacements for the     so i decided this time let s try a wired one  especially this time for myself because at my ripe old age  i figure i can handle it with much more delicacy than say my son can who is a terror with these controllers when he plays video games thus far for the low price  almost less than half  of what a  ony replacement would cost  even a wired  ony xbox controller for the      i was pricing them over forty bucks  it fits well in my hands  easy to use  comfortable  everything is pretty much the same as you would find in an official xbox controller     except        the panning sticks tend to push things too fast and too far on many video games such as fallout like when you re picking locks in the game  this makes lockpicking for the pc very frustrating  it s not easy to get the posts to adjust correctly even with the game s adjustment settings set to the extreme where this issue should be resolved  yet it is not    the central controller button requires you to hold it down for an eternity to send a signal to the xbox for it to wake up and play  whereas the official  ony controller you hold the button for   seconds and the xbox     immediately turns on    not certain why  however  there have been several times after a long day or night of gaming  i have had to virtually unplug the cable from the front of the     base  wait   seconds then reinstall the controller  at this point the voyee controller lights up and responds whereas prior to this it sat lifeless   this issue is sporadic overall if you re trying to save      then give this unit a try  i gave it   out of   stars for the reasons mentioend above      
47,1.0,                       works perfectly except they sent me one with a broken home button  i have a pink one and a black one  the black one has a broken home button and came that way  voyee would you please replace my controller      
48,1.0,                       worked for a solid    mins  then went haywire  i couldn t control my controller  i tried it with multiple games  unplugged replugged it  restarted my computer  tried my partner s laptop  same issue  i have windows    and a fairly new laptop  i m not the most computer savvy  but my partner is  it was the controller while it looks like an actual xbox controller  the vibration is very weak and it doesn t have the weight that the actual controller has  i get it s not the real thing  but figured i d add that tidbit i ve also read in many reviews that the company harrasses you to change your review  i was initially going to try to get a replacement  but i m not gonna deal with that  i m returning and saving my money to buy a better controller  i thought i d cheat the system and buy a dupe  but just keep in mind  you get what you pay for      
49,5.0,                       works like a charm     
50,5.0,                       this thing was cheap and it works just like the brand name controller  i couldn t give a rating for sheerness as i have never been to there before      
51,5.0,                       great in an old xbox     i still play  great to play steam games on my computer too      
52,4.0,                       i m using this as a control for my motorized telescope through my win   pro laptop  the control software will utilize an xbox or compatible gamepad  and this controller works with my application  windows device manager recognizes this as an xbox controller   the joysticks and buttons work as expected but are not as responsive as a true microsoft xbox controller  i have a wireless ms xbox controller for comparison  however  this will be adequate for my use   one glitch was that the usb plug was partially crushed and needed to be carefully reshaped with a needle nose pliers prior to use  it inserts into the usb port ok  but is a bit tight fitting   it was not worth returning the controller  but should not have been an issue with a brand new item   for the price this is an acceptable item  but is only recommended for those who do not need a top quality controller      
53,5.0,                       its just as good as a microsoft brand controller and way cheaper i use this on my windows    pc and it works very good i mainly use it on rocket league and don t have any problems with the thumb sticks like the windows brand      
54,5.0,                       great controller at a very reasonable price   fantastic customer service from voyee  highly recommended       
55,5.0,                       works great  good value     
56,1.0,                       very disappointed  it stopped responding after about   weeks of use  huge waste of my money        
57,5.0,                       exactly as expected     
58,5.0,                       great     
59,5.0,                       a great controller i d definitely recommend  it feels great and has weight to it  not like some cheap shell knockoff  and has a nice long cable  works with both my     and pc  just plug and play if you re looking for a great wired controller  this is it i did had an issue with mine  but voyee customer service was quick to respond and help  i ll be buying a second for some split screen gaming with friends soon  just like the good old days      
60,4.0,                       way cooler than even expected   my boys love it      
61,2.0,                       the left stick has no ramp up sensitivity  and the actual input points are all at diagonal angles  don t expect to be able to curve or precisely turn with them everything else seemed to work fine  but i couldn t get over the problem if you really just need a cheap controller this could work  but you ll notice the problem almost immediately      
62,5.0,                       works extremely well for the price its at  fixed all the problems i had with my previous controller     
63,2.0,                       only reason i m not giving a   star is because it does the basics of what a controller is supposed to do  however  if you re planning on playing any kind of game that needs precise aiming  do not buy  the deadzone in the sticks is ridiculous  and the buttons are not very sensitive either  i play competitive rocket league and for me personally this controller is literally unplayable because of the dead zone  i bought this because the rubber grips on the sticks of my other controller came off and needed another one  it was a gamestop brand  xbox  controller  but there was little if no dead zone  can t remember what i payed for it  not much   if you re looking for a cheap controller for casual play then go for it  it works  fine   if you re looking for a controller to use competitively  buy a more expensive name brand one  you get what you pay for      
64,1.0,                       controller is malfunctioning upon first use and drops connection with xbox while plugged in  testing with other controllers have shown that the console isn t the issue      
65,5.0,                       it works     
66,3.0,                       i bought this for my son and it s so annoying having to unplug it every time the xbox is turned on  if it s connected when the xbox is turned on  it just flashes and the xbox doesn t recognize it  definitely not ideal to have to keep doing that      
67,5.0,                       having grown up on pc games and without a console  i ve resisted getting a controller  but since a lot of games now on pc are console ports  it is pretty much a necessity   my previous controller was old and incompatible with a lot of games  and this one seemed to have the best reviews for a low price i still don t use it for anything with   d look  as the thumbstick is just awkward compared to mouse for me  but all side scrollers and driving stuff  and right now the game hades  work great   it feels kinda cheap plasticy  but does the job   buttons and stick still seem good      
68,5.0,                       very good     
69,2.0,                       comfort and buttons feel good but the joysticks have really bad deadzones making playing fps games terrible     
70,2.0,                       i bought this controller not too long ago  i ve recently started to play more games that use a controller  so i busted this out  everything was fine until about a month of use  the right stick constantly drifts down  making most games totally unplayable  up until that point  i had really enjoyed the controller i m sure this is a solid buy if this doesn t happen to you  but for me it s basically unusable now      
71,5.0,                       it doesn t have quite the heft of the original or upmarket     controllers  but at half  or less  the price  it works great   i mainly use it with dolphin on the pc and it s comfortable and reliable  no complaints here      
72,5.0,                       it was a gift and he hasn t complained lol so must be doing fine     
73,5.0,                       i ve ordered a couple of these controllers now  and both myself and my brother agree they feel similar in weight and construction to the regular     controller from microsoft   buttons feel good  no obvious dead zone issues with sticks that you see a lot with third party controllers   computer identifies it like any other     controller  so it integrates seamlessly with controller support on pc      
74,1.0,                       within a week of purchasing it  the left joystick gets stuck  it s impossible to have a good gaming experience  not worth the money     
75,5.0,                       great product  great customer service      
76,5.0,                       windows recognized the controller immediately and it was working with seconds  controller feels well made  the  st controller i bought stopped working after a few days  but the company was extremely responsive   they immediately responded to my email and sent me another controller   so far working well      
77,2.0,                       even with the poor sensitivity  i decided to continue to give it a chance  bad decision on my part  the controller is useless after    days of moderate use  the movement input is all over the place  the button presses frequently fail to register and the vibration is missing in action sadly  i missed my return window by one day      
78,4.0,                       as many others have pointed out  it does have a pretty bad dead zone   really bad  if you compare it to an official microsoft controller  which has no dead zone at all   so this is not the controller if you play fps games   but  most of the games i play on computer do not require that kind of precision  so it s fine for me   as far as build quality  i ve purchased other generic controllers around this price and they have been much more poor quality   cheaper plastic  shoulder buttons broke right away  which are important for games like gang beasts   this one feels really solid and works fine with all the types of games i play      
79,5.0,                       works well     
80,5.0,                       it works great thanks      
81,5.0,                       my son loves it     
82,1.0,                       this is the worst controller i have ever used in my entire existence  i can usually aim professional  but when i try to aim with this controller i instantly become a noob i am very good with countless and countless controllers  but not this one  also it doesnt say anywhere this controller is less quality than the     s original controllers but when you get the controller  it comes with a note stating that this controller is less quality than       it should be more qualityi want a refund i am broke      
83,3.0,                       this controller is very well made is great for most games but the dead zone for the thumbsticks is to large for my personal liking not a great controller for fps games  not as accurate as i would like      
84,5.0,                       work just like originals for less money     
85,1.0,                       i can t play anything with this control  the joysticks are terrible  don t waste your money      
86,5.0,                       it s a cheaply made controller   mine came with a defective right bumper but they immediately sent a replacement after i notified them      
87,4.0,                       the buttons dont feel springy enough    they work for now  but i find that a little suspect  the documentation that came with the controller is also a little odd      
88,1.0,                       controller broke after     months of use  it worked fine for the first     months of moderate use  but now it wont turn on      
89,3.0,                       two words dead zone   the sticks have a larger dead zone than an actual microsoft controller   this is a fine inexpensive controller that will work fine for a lot of game types   shooters or anything you need to aim in it was much harder than with the genuine   these the sticks don t register input until you ve moved the sticks farther than on a real one and when they do it s at an amount comeasurant with how far the stick is so your cross hairs or whatever moves faster than you want   tested bach to back playing borderlands pre sequel   it s much harder to aim with this than genuine   playing madden couldn t really notice      
90,5.0,                       use this controller for pc games and it works as intended for games that do not require joystick precision  recommend for the lesser intense games  any shooter games  you ll need a better controller      
91,5.0,                               
92,1.0,                       the voyee xbox     controller causes a stop error  or blue screen of death once you plug it into your computer  not advised for anyone who cares about their hardware or system security  just another scam      
93,1.0,                       the left trigger is broken  makes most games unplayable  buy the real thing and save money when you don t need to buy another one      
94,5.0,                       have yet to have any issues with it  the cords do get a little tangled easily but not a huge problem  feels nice for the price     
95,5.0,                       quality build is good  i like it alot      
96,5.0,                       its was perfect      
97,5.0,                       i needed a cheap controller to play certain pc games and this was great  sometimes it had troubles connecting to my friend s parsec and i m not sure if it had to do with my controller or their pc  but overall it functions really well     
98,5.0,                       bought this as a replacement controller since my old one got packed in a moving box  and i m pleasantly surprised by how well the buttons and the control sticks feel  i was expecting them to stick and be all plastic y like all the other xbox bootlegs  i don t expect this to last long given how cheap it was but hey  for being in a pinch  this thing owns      
99,5.0,                       my husband hasn t complain about it yet so i m guessing it is still working grrreat      
100,2.0,                       sticks have almost no range where they have intermediate input  it goes from no input to max input very quickly  with a bit of stickiness between no and some input  as a result  there isn t really any fine control of the sticks  for some games  this is probably fine  for a first third person shooter  it s basically not usable  otherwise nice construction and responsiveness      
101,2.0,                       i bring this guy into work with me because i am a bad employee  i generally wrap it up and throw it in my backpack   days a week  but after  what has it been  a couple months  i dunno the exact dates  point is  the cord sheathing came undone from the top of the controller way more quickly than any of my actual xbox controllers have  i legit wish i would have just gone in for the pc wireless dongle and a regular wireless controller      
102,5.0,                       pretty solid controller     
103,5.0,                       works good     
104,1.0,                       uhh mine came with a note saying that it doesn t work  so i am assuming they just sent me one for the hell of it cause they are cheap  really annoyed that this happen  like why would i receive a note saying it doesn t work      
105,5.0,                    funciona a la perfecci n        
106,5.0,                       this is a great controller   i only use it on my p c  right now  and it runs great with lots i of games  but not all of them   seems the older games were not programmed to use controller s like this   i haven t tried it on all my games yet  so it s an ongoing project   i m happy with the purchase       
107,4.0,                       good controller for good price  but not recommended for competitive purpose  played tekken and the d pad has slow response  sometimes cant attack low got contacted by the after sales services  they were asking me of the problems  trying to give solutions  overall theyre trying their best for their services   respecti can raise to   stars but to be   i need a really fine controller with class     
108,5.0,                       for the price of this product you really can t beat it  honestly if there where any flaws that didn t effect the functionality or comfort i would still give this a   star review due to the price  that being said this controller is on point  no defects  has great tactile response  and quite simply works     i bought   i m a happy customer      
109,1.0,                       we bought   of these in the last   months    are left  one of which disconnects every few minutes  if you count the two we returned  that s      that still function  this is obviously a scam  and instead of buying official xbox wireless controllers for my kids  i wasted my money on these  which was in hindsight was a horrible decision  extremely disappointing      
110,4.0,                       small issue with rt upon purchasing first one  voyee offered a new one which i accepted  i am glad that situation was quickly resolved and customer support seemed very prompt pleasant      
111,5.0,                       bought so pc games would be easier  works perfectly  feels just like my xbox remotes for myself and my kids  no glitches or lagging at all  great value for the money i spent  if something happens toddler tantrums   would buy again     
112,5.0,                       great value for money  as well as amazing customer service  their email support was great      
113,5.0,                       controller works great  had a problem with it after a few months  and they sent me a new controller free of charge  very good service      
114,5.0,                       value for the money     
115,3.0,                       worked perfectly fine for a little over a month and all of a sudden the cord split on me     
116,5.0,                       works perfectly  got it for my laptop to play my games on the go  perfect fit  feels great   very responsive      
117,5.0,                       plug and play on win   pc   nice      
118,5.0,                       my brother seems to like it  good product      
119,3.0,                       i ordered two of these bad boys  i didn t anticipate top tier stuff at the price  i bought    one works fine but the other one both triggers and a couple buttons do not function properly and the joystick on it   sticks a bit  luck of the draw here        chance of a working controller    the first one is fine       
120,4.0,                       works just like the real thing   i ve had it for a few weeks now and have dropped it about   times and still works perfectly   would ve bought a wireless one if i didn t use it for other stuff   works really great and is a fantastic price      
121,1.0,                       honestly  this controller is absolutely horrible and a giant waste of money  i used it for a couple weeks  but wound up getting a real x box     controller  from gamestop  i absolutely hated having to do that  because i think gamestop is garbage the reason i had to do that was because the analog sticks  for this garbage voyee controller has terrible output  if i was playing any games  that required small movements  such as call of duty  i simply could not play it  i could not make small adjustments  with the aim cursor  because the analog sticks just weren t sensitive enough i can t stress enough  do not waste your money on this  you ll thank me later      
122,5.0,                       perfect for the kids      
123,1.0,                       i plugged it in  it flashes for a second  and then doesn t work  useless  do not buy it     
124,4.0,                       this controller is all around pretty decent especially for the price  the only thing that bothers me is the little bit of dead zone on the analog sticks  in a game  for example  fallout    it is fairly important to have pretty much no dead zone  you have to move the stick more than desired to make tiny adjustments  putting sensitivity down to compensate can be a disadvantage  overall  i d say if you re looking for a solid and responsive controller for fps games  don t get this one  this game is great for games like fall guys or other things that don t require as much precision      
125,2.0,                       got this to replace my ancient xbox    controller that is finally showing signs of aging  out of the box  the x button on this is barely functional  i have to press it really hard for it to register  that s unacceptable  the overall build of this controller also is in general not very good  the buttons are deep and buried in comparison with the official controller  but that is to be expected  shipping out an untested flawed product was not      
126,4.0,                       using it right out of the box  i immediately hopped into a couple games of call of duty  i noticed very quickly that the camera seemed a bit stiff  as if the controller doesn t have a diagonal direction  no matter though  i mostly play fighters with my controller so using a camera isn t a big need for me  overall a good product  only con is not having omni directional camera movement      
127,1.0,                       this constantly has to be unplugged and then plugged back in  it never just consistently works      
128,5.0,                       i purchased this controller and was amazed by how good the quality feels  it is almost exactly like an authentic xbox     controller  unfortunately  something went wrong within a couple of days with my left thumbstick  it started sticking i don t think it is a common issue   so i contacted support and selena at voyee was a pleasure to speak with and helped issue me a refund without any hassle  i am going to buy another one of these in a few days overall  i definitely recommend buying one of these  great product for a low price and the company has very good customer service      
129,1.0,                       not sticky like covered in syrup sticky  but everything sticks  move the joystick to the right  it stays there  press a button  it stays depressed  i ordered two and both of them were like this  not worth the hassle      
130,1.0,                       i could never get this product to work properly  i feel like i ve been ripped off      
131,1.0,                       hy i bought two controllers  one of them  was not working   i wasted my money  in these times of crisis the children will not see  santa claus this year thanks for watching      
132,1.0,                       controller stopped working after a few weeks  the seller sends weekly emails  even   months after purchasing      
133,5.0,                       great product  well worth the         
134,1.0,                       windows     as far as i ve seen from all of the other reviews and many other sources i find online  should be plug and play i ve tried every available usb port on my computer only to find that it lights up for a brief moment then goes dark windows doesn t even recognize it as a controller i don t think a product that ended up as nothing but a paperweight when it was at my doorstep deserves a favorable review  yes  i have attempted all possible avenues of getting my computer to recognize it  and no  none of them have pulled through for me  no device manager wizardry or driver funny business here  it s just not functional if you want a product that works the first time  try somewhere else      
135,4.0,                       i am so happy to have this controller  ever try to play nba  k while in the midst of playoff and tour sprint direction control goes out  it sucks the controller itself has bumps on the thumb stick which is very nice  buttons all perform with ease and haven t had any kisses after going through each button now  not really anyone s fault  but annoying  with a wireless controller i got a button to connect to my game console  with this wired controller i have to wait and then unplug and plug back in for it to connect other than that  fine product for the price      
136,4.0,                       i think this is a great little controller for most things however  if you game much  like myself  and if you buy a lot of controllers  like myself  then i will say that the buttons are a bit squishy feeling  especially the triggers   i greatly prefer a crisp trigger that immediately bounces back so you can feel a strong tactile sensation of clicked and unclicked   this doesn t give you that don t get me wrong  the triggers work just fine  and you can adjust to it and just trust that it truly is in or out    but it just isn t a crisp toggle like many other controllers for me this is a big enough deal that this controller is now firmly a kid only controller   but it works great for them  and i ve had zero problems with it      
137,1.0,                       i was hoping that this stick would not have the same issue that i had from other     controllers on the store  it had the issue on day one of the left stick having a dead zone whenever i would move up and to the left in any game and my character would stop running and start walking  tried to reach customer service through their sms service and never heard a word      
138,2.0,                       has the comfort of the original xb    controllers  but the second i took it out of the box and plugged it in  the right trigger sticks in every game  you get what you pay for      
139,2.0,                       regular wear and tear on the cord connection seem to have made the controller stop working in about three months of light use  otherwise it s fine  joysticks could be a bit more accurate  i don t know if this is a systemic problem or just bad luck on the unit i received      
140,5.0,                       works just like the original controller        
141,5.0,                       easy to use     
142,5.0,                       bought this for my room mate  arrived quicker than expected and is working out great      
143,5.0,                       i bought one of these for myself and then one for a friend   great products value      
144,5.0,                       the overall product is very good  but the joystick is a bit hard     
145,5.0,                       works with my pc and with a usb c hub for my phone  works great for emulators works looks feels  just like an xbox controller  buttons are responsive and there aren t any dead zones plug and play  didn t have to set anything up with pc or android i am going to get   more for a emulator computer build      
146,2.0,                       i bought this to replace an actual microsoft xbox    controller i had been using for years   the weight and feel of it was great   it felt very much like the original   but from the start i noticed the analog thumbsticks weren t quite as accurate   considering how much cheaper this was  it was a fair trade off  and didn t really interfere much with my games   but then after only about   weeks  i started noticing the thumbsticks would sometimes start drifting   first it was the right stick  but the left stick started doing the same thing shortly after   now about   days later  it s getting to the point of being unusable   i m going to try to replace it and i ll update this review after that experience      
147,5.0,                       good value for the money      
148,5.0,                       works great  cord is short     
149,4.0,                       performance is good  just the cord is a little short      
150,3.0,                       some of the buttons were sticky and the joy sticks are not as smooth as the official microsoft xbox controllers     
151,1.0,                       right out of the box the x button did not work at all  and the a button shortly began to malfunction and act as the b button  the controller was never damaged in any way before  during  or after experiencing these issues      
152,5.0,                       perfect     
153,1.0,                       the bumper buttons on both of the controllers i ordered broke within a week with about    hours of use total  similar to a key being stuck on a keyboard      
154,5.0,                       works really well like the original xbox     controller  i had an issue where my joystick was a little broken after some time but customer service sent me a new one with no issues      
155,2.0,                       if you re just using this for the d pad then you re fine but the two analog sticks have serious issues with deadzones and as hard as i try to change them they just don t compare to a xbox    controller the analogs also seem to function like a d pad in that they only have   directions unlike a normal     controller if you just need something for the d pad and buttons then you ll be gold  they re very responsive and can t really tell the difference between the buttons and d pad on this compared to my     controller  don t expect to be able to aim well with these  i bought two and they function the same way      
156,5.0,                       very comfortable   light  yet substantial feeling in the hand  super responsive controls with couch shaking vibrations to boot  now i need another one      
157,4.0,                       it works fine  plug and play usb controller  but the thumb sticks    how do i put this  it feels kind of like they re more like  on off  when you use them  like trying to do subtle precise movements  think lock picking in a bethesda game  is impossible  ive messed with all sorts of in game settings to try and get is usable to no avail  you can push a stick a little to the side and nothing happens in game  then just a hair further and your characters neck absolutely snaps to the side  so  it s ok if you re super casual or just looking for something for kids who ll destroy it in a month anyway      
158,2.0,                       i got this for pc gaming  works perfectly  just plug and play with games that are already mapped for controller use edit  after         hours of normal gaming the control sticks  both right and left  were out of alignment  they will drift randomly in a direction which makes game play very difficult will update again after testing the replacement      
159,2.0,                       bought two and had two seperate problems with both  dont buy these just go on ebay these controllers are crap      
160,5.0,                       kids said they work great so i will take their word   happy kids happy life right      
161,2.0,                       first  the positives  the controller feels just like a brand name one  it s comfortable  the buttons have the satisfying tactile responses  and true to the advertising  its d pad and sticks are both sensitive to the full range of motion  the price is also pretty good  it also was a perfect plug and play for my pc  no drivers needed  and it worked out of the box the two major downsides  first is that the dead zones for the joysticks are massive  by my estimate  the middle        of the stick s travel is not associated with any input  even after calibrating the controller  e g  through steam   this means that while gross motion and corrections are possible  any fine control  e g   adjusting long distance aim when playing a shooter  is extremely difficult the second one  which prompted this review  is that it did not survive   weeks of moderate use  i d bought this controller months ago but was unable to use it due to personal time constraints  two weeks ago  i got a break  and have been using it daily for a few weeks  this morning  the controller was dead  the lights flash once  then go dark the dead zone issue is annoying  but manageable  but now i ve not gotten a full   weeks of use out of it and it s dead forever  unfortunately  i also can t find out how to contact the seller  due to the time since purchase  so i can t test the good customer service that others have reported      
162,1.0,                       what follows here is an untrue review  this review belongs to a controller i bought at walmart around the same time  i am leaving it here just so people who have read this review will recognize it  in truth i have not yet tried the voyee controller  never the less voyee reached out to me on multiple occasions to try to make this right inspite of my somewhat harsh review  to them i offer my sincere apologies and look forward to actually using their controller this is not a voyee controller    i realize it is a cheap knock off and the official controllers were not super great  but after just a month or two of occasional play and being carefully stored away  this thing developped a drifty left stick  whatever is controlled by the left stick fould just kind of ease down and to the right  you could flick the stick and make it stop for a while but it would start again       
163,5.0,                       nothing to download for windows     just plug in and play      
164,5.0,                       works great  the bumpers are very  clicky  and loud but everything else is perfect      
165,1.0,                       works as intended for a few months      
166,1.0,                       tl dr broke after   weeks don t know whytwo weeks after purchasing this controller  my computer stopped reading the device  i have tried reinstalling drivers  swapping to every usb port i have  and tried it on a friend s pc  and none of it worked  i suspect the cord itself or the usb device that plugs into your xbox or computer being broken  no physical damage is visible big waste of      i recommend a different brand      
167,4.0,                       you can feel that it s made cheaper than the xbox branded controller it gets the job done though  i just use my     now for netflix hulu  you get what you buy      
168,1.0,                       only the left joystick worked   none of the other buttons or the right joystick worked      
169,5.0,                       great for playing games on steam      
170,5.0,                       it s exactly what i wanted needed      
171,5.0,                       works     
172,5.0,                       everything was awesome      
173,5.0,                       right trigger can be a little buggy but other that that its great         
174,5.0,                       this is such a great controller and it feels really great in your hands because the buttons feel nice and the joy sticks have a good feel to them        would recommend for anyone searching for an xbox     controller without the     price tag      
175,4.0,                       can t complain about the price   no major issues on it  works fine   fits fine  feels fine   however  the analog sticks are a bit stiff   it s hard to explain  but my movements on video games are much clunkier than when i used my other controller  duke hyperkin    it works in a pinch  but for precision games it just isn t doing it for me      
176,1.0,                       for whatever reason when used on pc the game share menu pops up every few button presses along with the start or back button activating frequently also  it makes using it next to impossible to play   i ll be returning it asap and getting something else instead      
177,4.0,                       nice weight for the price      
178,3.0,                       update        still couldn t get controls to work but the company did refund my money supposed to be plug and play and well let me tell you they aren t  the function button just circles and won t connect with the xbox         
179,4.0,                       i had been using this controller for   months with no issues but then the wire connection encasing to the controller ripped from the regular bending of the wire  it still worked  with sometimes pausing when it was moved  but i was worried it would tear off after little use  i contacted the voyee customer service and got a quick response same day for offering a warranty replacement  controllers comes with a year warranty  or refund  in sum  the controller works well for most pc games and felt almost the same as the old xbox controller  but the wire bending issue might become a problem after more then a year of use  but for     can t complain since its far cheaper then official xbox controllers      
180,3.0,                            can t complain a lot  i use this mostly for rocket league on pc  it worked well for the first   months or so  buttons always felt a bit stiff  but i can work with that  now  even though the trigger is not stuck and the controller has been well taken care of  the right trigger seems to always be slightly on or  pulled   the game doesn t react like the trigger is being fully pulled  but it does stay on the gas when i m not touching anything and my friends list goes crazy  trigger is mapped to both depending on if in game or in menu  if you just need something temporary  don t take care of break controllers  or don t want to can t spend the money on an official xbox controller  this would probably be okay  i play   or less hours a day with it so that s not really a ton of hours before this issue started  i can t stand the problem with the trigger now so i m just going to go back to an official controller      
181,5.0,                       this controller was exactly what i needed  had an old xbox     with broken controllers that a few of us share and wanted a cheap alternative so i didn t break the bank  this controller has held up great so far and feels close enough to oem  obviously you will be able to tell that it s not the original controller but plays just like one with no input lag  would def recommend and will buy again      
182,5.0,                       i ve used this for about a month and a half now with no problems  everything works very well and i m very pleased with this purchase      
183,4.0,                       controller was very price friendly  came well packaged  company mentioned plenty of times that they are willing to vouch for their products through customer support and their warranty  only trouble i had was making it work on my pc  i resolved the issue by going to device manager and updating my windows settings device drivers and then restarting  overall good bang for your buck      
184,5.0,                       came earlier than expected  highly recommend      
185,1.0,                       i was really happy with this controller at first and thought i found a good deal  but then about a month in the left joystick would just hold  down  as i played  this obviously made my games unplayable and the controller useless      
186,5.0,                       looks and feel good   the only issue is that joysticks and triggers doesn t have same sensitivity as the original ones having said that  you could have some issues on shooting games  joysticks  or some simulator games  brake and gas pedals using the triggers i hope it will last much time as the original ones      
187,5.0,                       works great but i found if you plug the usb in a     slot it does identify it but didn t work   plugged it into     slot perfect   windows    pc     
188,1.0,                       they were good for about       weeks  both my kids complained that they got stuck and they could not even select from the menu because it kept racing through it  but for the first few weeks very happy they worked great don t know what happened    but what are the chances of both going out within a day or two of each other  had better luck with rock candy at least those lasted about a year before the cord gave out not the controller        
189,1.0,                       this is not a high quality item  the joysticks are super sensitive  right up until they break  loud clicking sounds were irritating  but not as bad as the joystick breaking      
190,2.0,                       i loved this controller for pc gaming  but it completely stopped working after a couple of months of casual use      
191,3.0,                       long story short  this controller is good for anything that does not require accuracy and precision the entire controller is built well and feels like a good quality product  the issue lies in its actual functionality  the joysticks are not accurate  and have a pretty large dead zone before it starts to detect any movement  as an example  when i used this controller on gta  while driving  the steering is very obviously not precise and would behave more like using a keyboard  some people may not notice it  but if you re an experienced user then i m sure you won t want a controller that isnt accurate and has a dead zone  i m returning mine and getting an original wired     controller  it s just not worth getting a bad product      
192,3.0,                       great controller  but isn t recognized by windows pc as an xbox controller  so there are some issues with drivers and overall stability if you also have a keyboard and mouse  overall  great controller major flaw is that the vibration does not work on the controller that i receive  if you want to purchase something that will work through and through  i may recommend going with the amazon basics xbox controller     
193,5.0,                       quick delivery  works great  buttons are very responsive and so satisfying to use  cord is nice and long  feels just like a     controller  pretty lightweight      
194,1.0,                       there are in fact not   levels of rumble control  but    there is no control for the rumble  and there is no rumble  as mentioned in other reviews when slowly tilting the thumbsticks it s either all or nothing  other than that  it s a perfect  little brother  controller      
195,4.0,                       it does the job      
196,1.0,                       poor tracking  no real diagonal  electric shocks and died in under a year  dont buy     
197,5.0,                       excelente     
198,1.0,                       it worked great    for    hours  then the wire disconnected from the controller      
199,4.0,                       this controller definitely gives decent value for the price  however  the analog stick dead zones are noticably larger than standard xbox as others have noted  i ve used this controller for   months now and have had issues with the right trigger sticking  recently this issue has become more pervasive and has made it just about unusable  overall i feel i got decent use out of it for the price  but will purchase a different model as a replacement      
200,4.0,                       updated review while the original controller i received broke within minutes  after reaching out to voyee they sent me a replacement controller no questions asked  and it arrived a couple days later  the new controller has had no issues as of     hours of use the controller itself is pretty good  perhaps not up to the quality of the original xbox     controller  but for the price it beats the original  i ve mostly used it for non shooter games so far  and it has worked well  i did play gears of war a bit with it and it wasn t super great for aiming  however  that could be attributed to the fact that i m used to playing shooters with a mouse and keyboard and i can t play shooters well with a controller anymore  it s a good controller to get if you re old xbox     controller is broken or you want an extra controller and want a cheaper alternative to an original controller original review when i plugged this controller into my xbox      it worked pretty well for a couple of minutes  it then suddenly disconnected  and after a moment it started to rumble nonstop  i tried plugging it in to different ports on my      my computer  even my phone but all it would do is rumble uncontrollably i emailed voyee but haven t heard back yet  i ll update my review with the results of their customer service      
201,1.0,                       worked fine until after a month of light play  both joysticks now read upward input constantly  even when there is no actual input  makes playing almost any game impossible      
202,3.0,                       i really wanted to love these controllers  my wife and i just ordered three to complement her one oem controller without breaking the bank  and  for the money  they re decent  really  i only have one complaint  but it s major enough that it warrants a   star rating  the only issue i ve seen  aside from the slight physical quality loss that almost always comes with  rd party devices   which in this case is negligible  is that the thumbsticks have a significant delay  on any oem controller for xbox or playstation  any slight movement of the thumbsticks initiates some movement onscreen  however  these controllers do not have this  you have to move the stick by         a centimeter before it actually sends a signal to the console  this means that fine aiming adjustments onscreen cannot happen  where an oem controller essentially allows for a gradual       acceleration   these go directly from   to     with no buildup  as someone who enjoys playing games well and really gets into them  this is maddening and can ruin one s ability to make instant target acquisition a thing  to verify that this was a consistent issue with voyee  i tested all three of these controllers against our microsoft controller on several cod and borderlands titles  with several sensitivity levels across each game  and voyee failed every time now  does this mean that the controller is useless  not at all  again  for the money  it s decent  i plan to keep two as backups or for split screen gaming  however  i personally would not be okay using this controller as my go to for cod  halo  or any other fast paced  competitive title  i can manage to work around the imprecise aiming  but i feel no need to do so when i can hunt down a used oem device for a similar price  even if it will take a bit of bargain hunting      
203,2.0,                       detailed review below parents grandparents of amazon  do not get your child the cheapest controller on amazon  for    dollars more you can get a razer wildcat  which is a far better controller for the money this controller s deadzones are absolutely atrocious  this has the ergonomics of a potato  not terrible  but not great   the pressures between the two triggers are different  and the resistance on all the analog controls are too much for precise use  the d pad does not inspire confidence  though this is personal preference      
204,1.0,                       this is not the one  after just a few     months  the right joystick is already doing its own thing  i was trying to look past how choppy the joystick responsiveness was before  until i can longer aim in gta v without the crosshairs moving up on their own  ironically  the features you are allowed to select on your rating have little to do with the point of having a controller  shocking      
205,5.0,                       this controller feels like an xbox controller  it worked immediately just plugged it into a usb     port and the drivers installed and i was playing in minutes  it s a great value for the price i d definitely buy another one      
206,4.0,                       better than expected  it feels like a good quality remote  not too light  not too heavy  easy to use  was delivered quickly  we have only had it a few days but its been working great      
207,1.0,                       the controller is very jumpy when using it in first person gaming  does not move smoothly at all      
208,3.0,                       it works on pc games  there seems to be a dead zone in the thumb joystick that makes it difficult to control movement      
209,1.0,                       i dislike the incompatibility for my use  it s not even recognized by one of my games      
210,1.0,                       arrived on time and looked original  worked fine for a couple of weeks of playing  very irregular  and then stopped working  would not recommend it further to this i was contacted by company for a replacement   still waiting on them to send it  is there anything lower them one star      
211,2.0,                       somewhat good for the price but has a micro delay and cable is not long enough for like playing on the living room tv      
212,1.0,                       garbage     
213,5.0,                       it works perfectly     
214,5.0,                       love the product and the service was great     will order again     
215,5.0,                       i had bought a voyee controller around   months ago  i began to notice there was something particular about the x button  it sometimes would not be responsive but would eventually work after pressing it multiple times  its level of functionality was adequate enough for my purposes though  so i didn t bother to contact voyee  recently  i upgraded controllers and found that there was in fact a defect in the one i was using  so  i contacted voyee about it  and within about     days  they responded and sent me a replacement free of charge  i was very glad to see that the company honors its warranty and values their customer base      
216,5.0,                       like others have said its pretty much like an original     controller  the only difference i ve noticed so far are the joysticks  they are better in my opinion  they ve got more stages so they re easier to control than on the original controller  all is good  the only slight con is that the shell of the controller is not perfectly aligned so it sort of shaves a bit at the bottom  meh  if it bothers me too much i ll just file it down but seeing as there are no new     controllers this was a great buy if you ask me   i m using it with pc      
217,5.0,                       great value     
218,5.0,                       none of the buttons works     
219,3.0,                       broke after   months  didn t even use it that much     
220,5.0,                       about the same feel as original and it works extremely well      
221,5.0,                       works great     
222,5.0,                       works for my xbox     and it seems pretty sturdy     
223,1.0,                       my pc will not recognize this device   it looks like the drivers are not loaded with window    and i cannot find drivers for windows    anywhere      
224,1.0,                       was stoked about this controller for   weeks and then it got stuck in the down position and had to send it back      
225,4.0,                       the box was partially opened for me and there were a few glitches sometimes  but other than that good      
226,5.0,                       listen  this isn t a cheap knockoff controller that you get from gamestop my old xbox     controllers kept burning through batteries and simply weren t working anymore just wanted something simple that felt good and didn t need to eat through batteries best thing about the controller is that it feels just like microsoft produced it      
227,4.0,                       could of been a lil better on price     
228,1.0,                       could never get the controller to work it would blink one time when plugging it in an that was it     
229,5.0,                       working great so far   fast shipping      
230,2.0,                       within a week of getting this controller the right trigger is squeaking loudly almost every time its pulled  it s super annoying  really disappointing      
231,1.0,                       pros  value for the money quality good weight good textured feel  identical to the original     controller no input delaybuttons feel new  i don t know why people say it s loud  recognized by steam right away i ve used powera and they feel so cheaply made  broke after like a month  i do feel comfortable with this controller and will update if my impression if it changescons this isn t a con but i see where microsoft changed up the up the grips on the xbox one  if you have been playing the pc with an xbox one then you knows it s pretty comfortable it will probably take some getting use tooi wish the controller cable was a tab bit longer the vibration is so soft  i don t understand  is that because of the game  ah well  one star removal for that update              well  it worked for about a week  don t get me wrong it turns on  but i have to physically disconnect the controller and reconnect it to my pc for it to reinitiate vibration too right joysticks starting to drift when i play certain games i also noticed their isn t a spring reaction in the triggers like there is in the oem     controller update              my god  tried to play mhw last night with my friend and the controller was jumping all over the place  i might as well use my xbox one controller lol this is a joke update              i got the replacement and if you take a look at the packaging damaged i m shocked it arrived in one piece  controller seems to function but i m not holding my breath at all      
232,5.0,                       i love that my granddaughter liked them when we bought them for her for christmas      
233,5.0,                       got less than   months of moderate use before the joystick rubber broke off   boo  you get what you pay for i guess edit  thank you zheng lili for the excellent customer service  they replaced my controller      
234,3.0,                       after   months the controller constantly keeps saying disconnected and the wire protection broke near the controlleri also don t like the length of the cableit works but it s annoying     
235,5.0,                       i purchased this controller to replace a microsoft xbox controller   works just like the original   works great with my xbox and pc  easy to install  just plug and play   the wired connection is much more reliable than wireless   cord length is adequate   very responsive and feels great   at about half the price of the microsoft version you can t beat it   i will looking for other voyee products when a need arises      
236,5.0,                       not very durable     
237,1.0,                       i ve had it   months and it s messed up multiple times and now won t workthe seller contacted me and asked if they sent a new controller would i delete my review yes of course if it worked but i m still having issues with this one so               
238,5.0,                       works great     
239,5.0,                       order this one since amazon recommend so far no issues yet but will see     
240,5.0,                       love it  works great been using it for a few months now        
241,4.0,                       a fantastic value  it feels a bit smaller than the official controller which is unfortunate because as someone with large hands  every centimeter counts  however it s still comfortable  just not as comfortable as the official controller there are some quality issues like the plastic giving way when you press it in certain areas however  the feel of the controller is right  the analog sticks are firm  buttons feel nice  texture is great  you d hardly notice this was a third party device if it weren t for the missing xbox logo on the home buttoni bought this for certain games on pc  absolutely no issues getting it to work  just plug and play very great value  i can t find a big enough issue to knock off a star considering what this is      
242,1.0,                       the controllers were purchased to play kid games on the     so that i could save money on batteries   last week both controllers no longer functioned   my kids did not mistreat the controllers since i played the games with them every time they used the controllers   to this day both controllers look pristine but no longer work   i would not recommend this product and so i purchased a used xbox     controller instead      
243,3.0,                       this is a cheap controller that is good for hack and slash games but a poor choice for shooters  due to dead zone issues with the joysticks  precise aiming is very difficulty  i would recommend this controller to anyone who primarily wants to play games that don t require a great deal of precision  the price is reasonable and it feels good in your hands  however  if you like shooters  you should pay a little bit more for a better controller      
244,5.0,                       i purchased this for my son  the item works exactly as it is stated in the details  item shipped quickly      
245,5.0,                       this is the best wired controller that i found at a decent price and it is awesome  i works with steam and all of my emulators  highly recommended      
246,5.0,                       like it an would buy it again     
247,5.0,                       this controller is almost an exact replica of the xbox    controller  it feels really comfortable in my hand and all the buttons feel good to press  i would give this product   stars  however  it disconnects every minute or two forcing me to pause my game to reconnect it  it s a shame because everything else about the controller i love  but i can t give this a high rating if i can t use it for its intended purpose  to play games edit            i was contacted by the seller and was sent a prompt replacement  the new one works fine without disconnecting and the service i got from voyee was superb  highly recommended      
248,1.0,                       i bought one and the left analog stick didn t function properly  sent it back and got another one and the right trigger did not function at all  would highly recommend not wasting your time on this controller      
249,1.0,                       horrible  ordered   of them and neither worked   so sad       
250,5.0,                       i didn t think it would work so well with my pc   it s high quality nd i d definitely buy again  d     
251,2.0,                       the controller looks the part and overall works  the big issue is the joysticks  they re terribly unresponsive  zero response through     of their travel then jumps to wide open  there s a very tiny sweet spot to get some of the ramp up and there are definite dead spots in the diagonal directions  probably fine for small children or very casual games  not so much for any demanding games      
252,2.0,                       i bought this controller to use on my pc  i thought it might keep my hands from getting so sore playing fps games  haven t used this type of controller before  but i found myself going back to the mouse to do any precision aiming  after looking a some reviews  got the amazon basic controller instead  in comparison  the ambas controller is has much better joy sticks  that can allow for fine control  i still need practice  though         
253,5.0,                       works great no issues     
254,4.0,                       it was great but after a few hours of play it was moving curser by itself and shorting out     
255,5.0,                       i purchased this for my grandson and he loves it     
256,4.0,                       this is a generic xbox controller and works well for games   only reason why i am giving it   stars is because the sensitivity is a little off for fps shooters like destiny        
257,5.0,                        edit  may  th      company representative has contacted me due to   star review  has offered to refund or replace product  i have chosen to replace  will give   stars under good faith that replacement product arrives and functions as intended  will update again later the left analog stick is not very responsive when moving left to right  purchased for driving games and will be buying a different controller from another company  would not recommend  i could have just gotten a bad one but i feel this controller style and tech has been out long enough that there really shouldn t be any issues with it     
258,5.0,                       great and fast customer service      
259,5.0,                       love the controller  plugged it into my usb on my windows    box  worked perfectly right away  still working perfectly      
260,5.0,                       works fantastic  seems to work just like an original xbox     controller  feels sturdy and well built      
261,5.0,                       good cheap controller for our kids  has held up for a week so far so good      
262,1.0,                       i would give this a   star if i could  it wont turn on  my xbox     cant even tell that its plugged in  it s bullcrap  buy a real xbox     controller if you actually want it to work      
263,2.0,                       controller didnt work correctly on my pc  it kept choosing   player option by itself  it seemed to be locked into a certain mode      
264,4.0,                       thumbs up     
265,1.0,                       controller stopped working but they refunded it      
266,5.0,                       very good controller responded instantly  was able to add as a mobile controller too with a usb to micro usb adapter     
267,2.0,                       it will serve as the standard controller we have all come to know  but damned is it great when i can finish the gaming session on silly games that need controller and place my hands on a mouse the normal xbox controller is just so horribly terrible for ergonomics  remember to take breaks from using it every hour or two to avoid cramps edit  after a couple weeks with the controller  i have noticed that it s now just randomly having the right thumbstick read as though it s point up  regardless of how it s being used  this is obviously inconvenient for any use that you might have for a controller   it then clears up after several minutes  before doing it again i am really unsatisfied by this bug      
268,5.0,                       good little replacement remote     
269,1.0,                       controller stopped working after minimal use     
270,1.0,                       controller feels and looks the same as a wired xbox     controller besides for how the buttons feel being pushed  good cheap controller  my only problem with this controller is that it sticks when you use the left joystick up and to the right  i ve tested it on different games  both on laptop and on xbox      character movement lags because of the sticking in that direction  a good controller but probably a game of chance on getting one without any defects at all      
271,2.0,                       it was working good  but then the right thumb stick starting sticking  playing gta and it kept pulling the camera down  then the left thumb stick would pull right sometimes  causing me to crash in gta  unfortunate      
272,5.0,                       it feels like a regular xbox wired controller  it s well built  it doesn t have any give like other off brand wired controllers can have  it s durable and and easy to plug in  it doesn t have a short usb plug   it s very responsive      
273,5.0,                       only had the controller for about a month and the right joystick is drifting up constantly  update   vendor sent new one several months later to remove bad review  new controller does not have the drift at this time and review has been upgraded to   star  will update again if it develops another problem     
274,1.0,                       horrible durability  pan controls move on their own  impossible to aim or play  complete waste of money      
275,2.0,                       well i did not expect the quality of an expensive controller but i did hope for a little better than what this was  it has horrible response time  huge dead zones and terrible input lag  it does look just like an xbox     controller though  so if you want play poor quality controller that looks like an xbox     controller this is for you      
276,5.0,                    es bueno  compatible        
277,1.0,                       product does not work sent back and refund requested still haven t heard back from company     
278,4.0,                    muy buen producto lo recomiendo        
279,1.0,                       the controllers had bad stick drift right out the gate  both controllers have the issue  i would have been better of just buying the real thing      
280,5.0,                       feels and looks like a     controller  not very good at precise moments but works well enough      
281,5.0,                       i just like it      
282,5.0,                       love it     
283,3.0,                       the controller works  but i did notice you have to tilt the analog stick before a signal is picked up   definitely not sensitive enough if you like to play fps games   overall  i bought this controller as a  th controller so it does it s job      
284,4.0,                       the cord could have been longer but it works and was compatible      
285,5.0,                       great value for a replacement   item arrived exactly as described and works perfectly      
286,5.0,                       works well very happy     
287,2.0,                       i bought this because after years of using a wired microsoft xbox     controller  i was just starting to get some stick drift  and this controller has relatively good reviews it s fine for games that aren t demanding on the controller itself  but after only a couple months of playing borderlands   on weekends  the left stick inward push failed to register consistently  and today the up position is intermittent  both completely dealbreakers in a game that  if played with a controller  requires consistent and sharp stick input i ve chucked it and am using my old drifty controller until my wired microsoft controller  for about four times the price  sigh  gets here because at least when i hold the stick it works  plus i ve completed all the jumping puzzles  p     
288,2.0,                       do not buy this for precision gaming  do not buy this as a long term controller this bit is a lie outright   precise joysticks   sensitive buttons provide players with precise control and fast response to enhance the gaming experience   came with a dead zone from the start but i managed to work around it  was fine for the price but this month it developed some issues expanding from that  i literally struggle to flip in rocket league now  thanks for making me worse at a game   do not buy this for precision gaming  do not buy this as a long term controller      
289,2.0,                       this is a terrible controller for any first person shooter   to exaggerate only a little  as you push further and further on the analog stick initially nothing happens  and then suddenly everything happens and your character on the screen goes from not moving to moving too fast  with not enough motion in between   it makes me wonder if the variable resistors inside have an audio taper instead of a linear taper  but that is just speculation  i did not preform any measurements with a multimeter   so  to exaggerate a little  it goes from nothing to everything instead of being more in control of the left or right stick s motions   aka  instead of being analog  the sticks act more digital than they should  however  all the buttons and the triggers work great  it s a cheap     controller clone of a microsoft brand     controller  only the clone got a couple of crucial things wrong  namely the analog sticks   there is also no electromagnetic shielding on the wires running from the controller to your system  which may or may not be the reason for an almost unnoticeable slowing down  when using graphics intense games  of the system as it tries to filter out the extra noise from the controller  but it is so unnoticeable it may not be fair to even mention it   and there is no break away connector on that wire either  but it is not like i am going to let kids play on my system anyway  after all  games are not for kids       kidding   what i did find is that the controller works great with puzzle games  where analog motion on the sticks is not required so much  so i am not returning mine   i just wish it would work much better with all my other games  than it does  also don t buy the name brand  voyee  controller for a couple of dollars more like i did thinking you will get a better controller than the no name brand controller for a few dollars less  because they are the same controller exactly  because if you look at the reviews  it show the same functionality and problem in both controllers  strange brand or no brand  there is no difference   if you really want to get this inferior but cheap controller  it is on ebay for     from certain sellers for now update   voyee does have good customer service in that they do refund your money if you are not satisfied   thank you voyee for the refund   i left you positive feedback as a seller   however  voyee  please stop emailing me asking me to change my amazon review of your product  as this is dishonest   i shouldn t do that   that would hurt others  considering the purchase of this poor product   for the refund  i owe you positive feedback as a seller  not a change of the amazon review for the poor product   to even ask such a thing is not right  they ve emailed me   times to change or delete this review   the last time they put in a quick link taking me directly to  delete review  and i almost hit the wrong button getting out of it   i am concerned they may keep contacting me once every two weeks until the day i die   if this activity keeps happening  i will be forced to take further action       
290,5.0,                       works great  just like the original xbox     controller      
291,5.0,                       this is a great controller and the price was great too  it has a nice long cord too  would      recommend to others   we use it with a x box           
292,3.0,                       controller cuts off while using often     
293,4.0,                       feels and controls just like a first party xbox     controller  great value for the money  the reason i m giving it   stars instead of   is that it needs to be unplugged and reconnected every time my computer goes to sleep and wakes back up  a minor annoyance overall      
294,5.0,                       i liked how the controller looked     
295,1.0,                       plugs in  turns on xbox  but is otherwise non responsive and just blinks the greenlight on the controller  will be returning     
296,5.0,                       i used this for my x box      and it worked perfectly      
297,1.0,                       i have still not successfully set this product up  use manual  is a single folded piece of paper that is mostly referring people to an email address and a facebook website  it does say that power for controller requires two aa batteries  which i did not see on the amazon listing  i have completely unscrewed the controller to open it up and i have yet to see a single place where batteries are supposed to go it s also probably not a great sign that i can t find a single youtube instructional video for this product name period extremely disappointed and if i don t figure this out within the next couple of minutes i m just going to pack it up and return it for my money back      
298,1.0,                       after a using the controller a few times the controller seems to be stuck on  down   every time i am on a menu screen  it just keeps scrolling down  same thing happens when i have my pc menu screen up    can t seem to get the controller to do anything else      
299,4.0,                       i connected this to my pc and expected it to function exactly like the actual xbox one controller i own    nope  i can control my xbox controller s rumble function with microsoft software but the only way i could get this controller to stop shaking was to open it up and rip the rotors out still works and now it s light as a feather      
300,5.0,                       i ve only had it for one day  but if the goal was to emulate a genuine microsoft xbox controller  mission accomplished  pretty spot on as far as weight  feel  and functionality  and roughly     of the price  we ll see how it holds up long term  but so far  no regrets      
301,5.0,                       had an issue with my controller  but customer service fixed the issue for me     
302,1.0,                       i have used it for a little while and the some of the buttons have already started getting stuck  it s quite annoying when you have to keep mashing a button that you don t mean to press if you want to play regularly  i wouldn t recommend update  i pretty much get an email a week  sometimes more often than that  asking to make good on the controller so i will update my review the controller isn t worth the hassle      
303,1.0,                       we bought it as a gift and finally got to open it and it didn t work     
304,2.0,                       i hit the d pad to go one space and it goes two randomly  doesn t feel quite right in the hand  and a fair amount of the buttons don t function as they should  i m planning to return it and just buy the real thing  this is a poorly functioning controller  note  i have it plugged into a pc and not a console  so possibly that might be what s causing the poor functionality      
305,5.0,                       have had it for   months and no problems at all   reliable      
306,5.0,                       like the joysticks     
307,2.0,                       i like this controller a lot  but all of a sudden it just stopped connecting or turning on  my pc registered a  driver error  but i can t find any more info on it  i used it fairly regularly for a month or so with no problems      
308,5.0,                       product was not working correctly and was offered a replacement or refund  great understanding customer service      
309,2.0,                       i bought this to play rise of the tomb raider   it works but there are dead zones with the right joy stick  it either gives no response or too much  can t really use it to aim effectively with accuracy   the left joy stick is too sensitive  wish there is a way to switch the joy sticks so that the left function as right and vice versa  that probably would make it work better   i also experience slight delay with the a and x buttons   the voyee circle only has the upper left bar lite up even tho i see the other bars flash when starting up the cord is long enough to serve my need  unite feel good and the rumble works good      
310,5.0,                       this is a really good controller none of the buttons stick and it s very comfortable and compatible with accessories as well  i ll be buying from this company again for sure      
311,4.0,                       update           new product arrived and worked perfectly  adjusted my review to   stars only cause the first controller arrived doa                   product arrived dead  i contacted voyee before returning it to amazon  their customer service was quick and helpful  they told me to keep the defective device and they would send out an replacement for me for the inconvenience  i will update this review as soon as i receive the new controller  as of now i m giving it a   star cant give a good rating on something that doesn t work yet      
312,1.0,                       worked good at first until it stopped working properly      
313,4.0,                       bought for my old     and it worked like a charm  only issue i have is that if the cord wiggles it sometimes turns off  i m not sure if this is an issue with the usb or the cord itself  but it doesn t turn off constantly so it s usable      
314,4.0,                       in short  good for many of controller friendly games     
315,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                       lo compre por que mire que estaba bien calificado pero   semanas de uso y ya no me funciona  espero me ayuden        
316,5.0,                       for the sales price it can t be beat    worth the buy       
317,1.0,                       the right stick constantly drift upwards  and not in a subtle way  i constantly have to swirl the stick around to recalibrate it  to make the drift stop      
318,5.0,                       very very  good     
319,1.0,                       feels like a nice controller  however the buttons keep  sticking   not physically but virtually  triggers activate on their own without me pressing them  joysticks will register inputs without me touching it  can t really play a game when your controller makes you just walk off a cliff  might be a lemon but i won t buy again to find that out  it s a shame because it does feel like a nice controller  higher quality than the cheaper rock candy ones from pdp  update  few days later and the issue is just worse  all buttons now register randomly  completely unusable      
320,1.0,                       bought the controller to play flight sim  only used it a few times and it broke right after the   month mark         
321,5.0,                       was kinda scared   inside the envelope the box wasn t even together   but it works great and my son loves it     
322,5.0,                       impress for the cost     
323,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i bought this controller to play game horizon  and it s so wonderful  all features are great  the vibration of this one also works with my game  it s worth money      
324,5.0,                       this product is good for its money  it is pretty durable  i threw it on the ground a couple times to test it but it was on carpet     
325,4.0,                       the controller is super squeaky but works wonderful  i love it for the coat it s amazing     
326,5.0,                       i needed a new wired xbox controller for pc gaming  was skeptical at first because of the no name brand but it has exceeded my expectations  very solid and sturdy like the real deal  plug and play  would deff buy again      
327,1.0,                       controller would light up for a second  and then turn off   next thing  i get a blue screen on my pc   controller was back in the package within    minutes of opening it   do not recommend      
328,4.0,                       i got the controller yesterday and everything works fine except to the a button   it works only when i press hard  it makes the gameplay much difficult  how can i fix this issue      
329,3.0,                       it worked for a few months with some issues  but now my pc won t even recognize it  the usb seems fine  and i even tested it on several computers  sometimes unplugging it and replugging it in worked  and other times the left joystick would tilt downwards without me touching it  the cord length is just fine  but i wish it didn t have as many problems      
330,5.0,                       bought this to play outer wilds on my pc  no problems plug n play  worked as soon as it was connected     
331,5.0,                       works great     
332,5.0,                       me and some buddies wanted to play diablo iii  works great  has a slightly matte surface which feels better than my original xbox     controllers  cord length is a little shorter  i didn t measure it but i d say between   or   meters  anyway i m happy with the purchase      
333,5.0,                       great controller for the money   my son uses it to play fortnite on the pc      
334,4.0,                       good controller but cant button map without third party software     
335,5.0,                       this is a great controller for the money and works great      
336,5.0,                       product arrived super quickly in excellent condition  would definitely purchase from seller in the future      
337,1.0,                       it doesn t work           
338,1.0,                       stopped functioning  became unrecognizable by both my pc and xbox  after maybe    hours of play time  huge dead space on joysticks  feels cheap     
339,5.0,                       works great with playstation      cord is not long enough for me to lay in bed and play      
340,5.0,                       i own   oem x box one controllers and several other brand controllers and this is by far my favorite one to use    there is just something about the     controller design  great product if your in the market for a controller      
341,1.0,                       the controller is super cheap and therefore will stay in the drawer and never be used  there is terrible range of motion  controller looks up and down  left and right but any other angle of     degrees is not smooth  i bought this for a shooter game  and makes it impossible to play      
342,5.0,                       great price and works      
343,5.0,                       plugged in and played for a few hours  after my second day of using this controller the l  stopped working and as an fps player  i now need another new controller by a different brand  cheers     
344,5.0,                       good     
345,3.0,                       pros  inexpensive seemingly good quality cord is decently longcons  joysticks are not as loose and fluid as i would likepurchased this controller to use on my gaming pc  overall the controller is alright  the buttons are pretty snappy  which is a good thing  the controller feels pretty well built  my only real complaint is the  analog sticks seem to be kinda jumpy  on screen movements are not fluid while using  not a complete deal breaker but they could definitely use some work  is this controller worth buying  yes  with bridled expectations      
346,5.0,                       works great at a low price if you don t mind a wired remote     
347,1.0,                       i bought this controller a few months ago and only started using it about   weeks ago  it does not feel like an xbox controller and the deadzones are huge  the controller frequently wouldn t register when i moved the left joystick  recently it stopped working altogether   i have tried plugging it into several laptops usb ports and it won t turn on      
348,4.0,                       got what was advertised and pleased     
349,5.0,                       works good     
350,1.0,                       after one week of use both joysticks have significant drift issues that  while intermittent  always happen at the worst possible times   should have invested more money in a better quality product   do not expect this controller to last very long at all      
351,5.0,                       feels just like an xbox     controller  works great  great value for the money      
352,1.0,                       this product is advertised as plug and play  but this controller was dead on arrival  no option to fix it  forced to replace or get a refund  this requires going to a ups store which is     minutes away  frustrating      
353,3.0,                       this controller is very stiff  it is fine for some games but not any games that requires precision movement   joystick travels up and down aswell as left to right  but will not travel at any    deg quadrant  in addition i could not move it in a fine movement it would always over shoot  i bought two and both are the same      
354,2.0,                       so i play quite a bit of video games  and let s say that these controllers aren t built for constant play  after around     hours of play time  each of my   controllers broke something  on two of them  the right trigger failed and the spring snapped  on another one  the signal connection got severed  and finally on the last one  the a button got stuck in the depressed position  would not recommend if you game a lot      
355,1.0,                       works well for the time being  but unreliable   started having connection issues after   months and now it doesn t connect     
356,5.0,                       i bought it for my boyfriend and he loves playing with the controller      
357,5.0,                       good     
358,2.0,                       product worked great for a month  bad connection within the cord now just outside of the controller      
359,1.0,                       it came fast   it feels good in my hands   the whole reason i purchased this controller is because i broke the rumble motors in my other     controller   was excited to feel some rumble again when i got this   plugged it in and it works but the rumble does not work   neither does the guide button   i also cant have another controller plugged in at the same time or this one always registers as player   controller  making it not work for many games   very disappointed update as of              the controller is no longer usable   both sticks are no good   i dont even have to touch the sticks anymore for them to do something   its partly because of the huge deadzone the sticks have and also probably because of cheap stuff inside the controller   i would not recomend this controller to anyone   its better to just spend between    and    dollars and get a good controller that will last a long time update   i was sent a replacement controller   when i plugged it in it registered as player   controller  so i restarted my computer so it would register as p  controller   after that i started a game and had the same problem  no rumble   tried a couple other games and some controller tester thing from the microsoft store   nothing   i unplugged the controller and plugged it back in and decided to try a game with the controller registering as p  controller   i got rumble   so i restarted my computer so the controller would register as p    launched a game and no rumble   tested it on the controller tester and in the steam controller settings  if you click on identify the controller rumbles  and got nothing   i did the same thing as last time and tried it as p  controller   got rumble   so i unplugged it  restarted my computer and plugged it in after the computer finished booting   finally i got rumble when the controller is registered as p  so  i figured out that i have to unplug the controller if i plan to restart my computer and plug it back in after its booted up if i want to get the rumble feature to work when the controller is registered as p       
360,1.0,                       would not recommend this controller it stopped working after   days of use  no date  even gets unplugged after use  but went to plug it in on the fourth day  and has no connection  tried other usb ports  and even plugged it into a console  i use it on pc  and it still won t work  do not buy      
361,5.0,                       the right joystick would get stuck in the up position  rendering many of my games unplayable edit  i started receiving text messages a couple of month after this review went up from voyee  they said they are going to improve the design and wanted to offer me a     gift card to change my review  on top of the full refund i already received   i agreed  i now recommend you buy this controller  if it s still garbage return it  and post a review with a picture and you too might be offered    bucks to change your review      
362,2.0,                       the left joystick  like on many other controller reviews  broke within   month of purchase  cheap controller  cheap durability      
363,5.0,                       i am going to buy another one  works great       
364,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          second time using had to unplug and reconnect several times before controller actually worked  after less than a dozen times using thumbstick is stuck      
365,5.0,                       good control thingy     
366,2.0,                       ive only had this controller for a few months and the left joystick is already drifting  ive tried fixing it but at this point it would be better just to buy a different controller      
367,3.0,                       it is nice to have a replacement  but is definitely more jerky and not as seamless as the original xbox controller      
368,5.0,                       excellent product  works just like original xbox controller  durable and reliable     
369,1.0,                       controller wouldn t work when plugged in and starting the console to play games  i figured we just needed to have it disconnected first  then start the console  then plug in the controller  it would then start freezing the console in the middle of a game and now the console has a red dot on the power button and doesn t work      
370,5.0,                       usps lost my original order    replacement came right away  works great        
371,5.0,                       they replaced my broken controller very quickly  great job customer support  thank you      
372,2.0,                       had the voyee wireless controller for   months  now  all was working great  easy to setup  was  able to play on windows pc and google stadia via mac while playing sekeiro  the left bumper stopped working out of the blue  so i guess you can call it sekeiro  controllers die  once      
373,5.0,                       excellent quality  superior delivery  quality of the wrapping was high standard  item was outstanding      
374,4.0,                       this controller is exactly what it says it is   a good value controller that has to remain plugged into the system for power  works great for us  there s no trip release on this product  so if you do happen to trip over the cord or yank on it too hard  the system will follow it and come crashing down  generally not a big deal  but worth mentioning        
375,1.0,                       lasted a week  then broke  not happy at all with this purchase      
376,5.0,                       long cord  clean  and crisp  hooked right up to my xbox with no issues  it s really light  feels a little cheap but it works just fine  have had it for about a month now with no issues      
377,5.0,                       i use it for my xbox      i like the use of the cord since i use batteries for my two xbox ones      
378,5.0,                       works and can t get lost with the cord so i m happy with it      
379,5.0,                       works great for the      we had connection issues with the wireless controller we bought my son a few months ago  decided to purchase a wired one and works a lot better  great price and with prime it arrived the next day     
380,5.0,                       it s lightweight and easy to use while gaming on my pc     
381,5.0,                       the controller works adequately for most purposes  however  i found that there seems to be fairly wide dead zones in the hardware itself  the controller also seems to snap to    degree angles before settling between them  you really get what you pay for with this product      
382,5.0,                       better then i thought  just like xbox controller      
383,1.0,                       started coming apart almost immediately  triggers became defective     
384,1.0,                       i switched from another knock off  non microsoft  controller after it quit in under    months  mind you  i grew up on consoles and controllers so i kinda know what to expect from a knock off  this controller feels really good in your hands and the first impression of build quality seems better than most at the        range  i was extremely disappointing to find the the dead zones in the thumb sticks  meaning the amount of movement you make before the controller actually gives any input to your computer  are huuuge  i mean  no lie  it s probably     of the thumb stick movement gives literally no input at all to my computer  i have tried re calibrations and driver updates installs  nothing solves the problem  it s a hardware issue and it s so bad i ll be returning it for something else  it s just unusable      
385,2.0,                       worked amazingly for a whole week  now the left trigger keeps thinking i m pressing it when i m not  i ve tried everything  but it s impossible to play anything with it now      
386,5.0,                       games recognise controller immediately  no messing around with settings or configuration  cord is ample length to play with  joysticks have really good tracking and triggers work flawlessly      
387,5.0,                       i bought   and they work as intended  a cheap way to replace the original microsoft      
388,5.0,                       feels like a true     controller when using it for the pc      
389,4.0,                       it took awhile but they sent me a replacement controller and so far seems to be working fine      
390,1.0,                       i bought   of these controllers back in may and after only a month of slight usage  they no longer work on any of my computer s  i have   of them   i thought it may have been the games i was trying to play on but nope  it s these controllers huge waste of money as i don t think i can return them now and i only used them about  once a week  buyer beware     
391,1.0,                       the controller is great  however  after   months of light use the cord stripped it self at the base  its ergonomic and has great value for money  i just wish i wasn t sent a defective product      
392,4.0,                       this controller works great in my tesla model    controls are solid and responsive  the only thing i don t like is that the center lighted logo keeps blinking nonstop      
393,2.0,                       you get what you pay for  if you need precision aiming in a same  do not buy this  go ahead and by an xbox brand controller     
394,1.0,                       not working   pc not recognizing the control      
395,5.0,                       as expected     
396,1.0,                       i m trying to play online games on my pc and the top trigger buttons keep getting stuck  this is a very awful product      
397,4.0,                       i bought this controller almost a year ago   it worked great for about   months and then i started to experiences drift in the left thumb stick   this continued to worsen and became unuseable after    months   i was researching controllers to replace it and noticed that they voyee said they had a   year guarantee   i contacted them via email and received a prompt and courteous reply   they informed me that they would ship me a new controller   i have yet to receive this controller but they sent me an email with an estimated delivery date   so  i m hopeful and overall impressed with controller and customer service   hard to beat that for    dollars      
398,1.0,                       cord at the controller has torn in less than a month of ownership  just missed the window to return      
399,5.0,                       and it is still working perfectly      
400,5.0,                       if you are running any windows os this controller is a dream  it took all of    seconds for it to link with my surface pro   and never had to worry about anything again      
401,5.0,                       works like a charm  thank you      
402,5.0,                       works great for pc games  like halo and cod  easily hooked up and recognized by all software i ve tried      
403,1.0,                       horrible  took two weeks of light use before r  decided that it only works when it wants to  that s it    bad controllers in a row  don t buy cheap      
404,5.0,                       could use a slightly longer cord but honestly it seems about standard size  i bought four of these when another companies gave out  for the cost its definitely worth it    you can use usb extensions with these as well with no problems jsut grab female to female ones       
405,1.0,                       within   months it broke      
406,5.0,                       got this controller to use on my gaming laptop  better response time than my other expensive controllers  can t beat the price  had a minor hardware issue but voyee customer service took care of me  definitely happy with this product and company      
407,1.0,                       the x button keeps sticking after maybe a month  complete waste of money     
408,2.0,                       right bump started to short out within first month  you get what you pay for  buttons are loud to press as well      
409,5.0,                    es de buena calidad a pesar de el precio  se siente como un mando real de xbox      la computadora lo reconoce al conectarlo it is of good quality despite the price  it feels like a real xbox     controller  the computer recognizes it when connected         
410,5.0,                       great      
411,1.0,                       sticks are to stiff don t waste your money      
412,2.0,                       i am a casual gamer and maybe play for an hour a week and this controller began sticking where you auto look up after   months of use  spend an extra        and buy a higher quality controller      
413,5.0,                       the first controller i got started to malfunction after a few weeks of light use  the right analog stick would drift upwards  which made it impossible to use the seller contacted me and sent me a replacement that   so far   works great      
414,5.0,                       received item early which was a bonus  controller is durable and was easy to set up for my pc  its sensitive and really hard to tell the difference from an real xbox controller     
415,5.0,                       very good works just fine     
416,5.0,                       bought for my grandson s xbox     
417,1.0,                       i ve tried every available usb port on my computer only to find that it lights up for a brief moment then goes dark when it was plugged  it lighted up for a second then went dark  i tried every usb port but all were same even computer never recognized it as any device i will return this      
418,5.0,                       great value and worked like it should     
419,2.0,                       i bought this for my son to use when we play pc games  mostly simple indy titles  so i didn t notice right away that the thumbsticks seemed to have pretty large deadzones in their middles   this mostly doesn t become an issue until you re trying to aim in a shooter  where you need to make tiny adjustments to your aim with the thumbsticks  but it makes these types of game basically unplayable now  after having bought the controller less than   year ago  march         it seems to have stopped working entirely   if it had been a     controller  i wouldn t have been all that surprised  but when the price is closer to      it doesn t seem unreasonable to expect a couple of years of life from an only occasionally used controller      
420,5.0,                       it s a wired xbox controller   out of the box  it ll connect and play nice with any xbox or windows computer you put it in   it is what it is      
421,5.0,                       it works but it doesn t share port options with a mic or cam  they all get a lil wonky     
422,5.0,                       great customer service  product got cord damaged and they promptly sent me a replacement      
423,1.0,                       wire gave out about   days after my    day return was up  and the item was removed from amazon marketplace so i couldn t even contact the company  don t buy this shoddy product  spend the extra     on a first party controller and be happy you bought a product that will have some service      
424,3.0,                       for some reason it keeps cutting off      
425,1.0,                       when aiming with thumbsticks there are deadzones  difficult to aim accurately in shooters  very cheaply made  would not recommend or buy again  i bought as a replacement  i rather would buy original xbox     controller used from game stop edit  july   th        they keep harassing me through email because i left a truthful review    do not buy from them   voyee  if you are reading this i will report you to amazon if you keep spamming me with emails trying to change my honest review edit    august         they keep emailing me  please leave me alone      
426,5.0,                       gr      
427,4.0,                       controller is amazing  just make the cord longer      
428,5.0,                       works great for the price  had held up well for my boys      
429,5.0,                       it works perfectly on    it works for what i bought it for  it is made of good material  and seems as durable as the original the rumble is really strong the control stick is enough sensitivity for this price it is simple to use  just plug and play      
430,1.0,                       bought this bc it was cheap and cheap it was  i don t know what was in the driver for this but now my pc won t recognize any other controller and i can t seem to uninstall any drivers  the right thumb stick is sticky  i have my sensitivity on ten and it s like dragging a brick trying to aim  tried uninstalling drivers and it sat there for    mins to no avail  force quit it and restarted my pc and it s stuck on restart  i don t know what this fkn thing did but it screwed me over hard      
431,4.0,                       this controller will work well for my purposes  the issue that many others may face however is with the sensitivity of the joystick  these joysticks do not work well in games like competitive shooters where the amount of drag on the joystick inputs a certain pace of movement of the character or crosshair      
432,4.0,                       great feel for a wired controller  only draw back is the buttons are really load and the r   l  sticks are really sensitive to being pushed down which can be annoying in certain games      
433,2.0,                       like the title says  the dead zone is just garbage on the analog sticks  i know the price is low but come on  you ll be better off skipping this product and putting out the money for an actual controller made by microsoft  very disappointed  would not recommend it      
434,5.0,                       i love this controller far more than any of our other xbox controllers   controls were a little  tight  at first but after being used a bit it has become the best controller in the house for family game nights    no need to worry about batteries or charging    simple but effective     
435,3.0,                       the analog sticks are not at  precise  as advertised  they have a grainy feel and the right analog stick on the controller i purchased has a dead zone that s too large for a brand new controller  probably better off spending a little more cash for the real thing      
436,5.0,                       the controller worked great for about   months with occasional use  and then out of nowhere it stopped working   i ve read a few other reviews online since that said the same thing   i only used it infrequently    probably less than     hours   and now it s like windows no longer sees it   i ve tried driver updates and system restores with no resolution      
437,5.0,                       good product     
438,1.0,                       got one of these about a month ago and already the left control stick drifts constantly  making it more or less unusable  just bite the bullet and get a real microsoft controller  it ll save you money in the long run and you can feel the difference in quality      
439,1.0,                       spend more money to get a real controller    this one broke after a month of use edit  the company responsible  voyee  offered to replace my controller  but nearly a month later  my replacement has failed to come      
440,5.0,                       solid control and feel   responsive   no issues   perfect   ubuntu           
441,5.0,                       the wired controllers i bought work wonderfully  the cord length is long and the usb is secure  they ve dropped it the kids  and the controller didn t break   win win       
442,2.0,                       having played with one of these  i was excited to have a windows compatible controller  and i found a good price and went wired  since wireless batteries wear down over time  however  the ergonomics are really cramped and not very workable  it s where the extra cash went  saving materials  i ve used this   or   times ever  and owned it for under a year  after a few months of leaving it on a shelf  perfectly preserved  never dropped  cord yanked  exposed to liquid  or abused in any possible capacity  i treat my hardware like ancient relics  and am absurdly careful around them  having been a gamer since a child yet  i power it back up a few months later and windows can t recognize it properly and its inputs freak out  i put it off and retry a couple months later  in case it was a user error  and the controller won t even start and windows tells me the device s usb connection is busted or otherwise malfunctioning  the hardware simply isn t built to last my advice  pick up any competitor that looks like it s built better and seems to stand up in the reviews  shell out the extra    bucks or whatever probably even  it s for the best      
443,5.0,                        final update i am now giving the controller   stars based on voyee direct s level of customer service and the quality of the controller  the issue i was having with the first controller i received is not present in the new controller voyee sent me  free of charge  after the return date had passed  no less    i can highly recommend this controller  first update i m updating my review because after posting the old review  the company contacted me saying they will send me a new controller to replace my faulty one  the experience was pleasant and seamless  i haven t received the controller yet  but when i do  i will update this review  sounds like i may have received a lemon  but the company was nice enough to replace it  so that alone deserves   stars  old review decent controller  however any games that require you to click the sticks become difficult to play  clicking my left stick in particular is very fussy  usually not working and sometimes going off on its own  everything else about the controller is fine  but this problem makes it nigh unusable  i wish i went another route      
444,5.0,                       this controller is working great  rigid design  reasonable price  what i will need more  i highly recommend      
445,1.0,                       do not buy this product  i added a   year protection plan along with the controller just in case knowing it can die on me  and it didn t fail me in dying  i used this for   weeks and suddenly it stopped receiving connection from being connected to my pc and any other device it was connected to for use  i tried returning the controller but cannot since they closed the return window on june     even though i had a   year warranty purchased  so my advice is to just stay away it s a waste of money and time to deal with cheap products like this  learned my lesson      
446,5.0,                       i ve only had it for two days  but it s working like a charm so far  professional quality for a bargain price        but regardless of which brand you buy  controllers aren t made to last  if this lasts up to a year  i ll certainly consider buying this brand again  since that s the upper limit for most controllers before they start breaking down      
447,5.0,                       works as advertised  i had initially thought the controller didn t work but you have to make sure it s plugged all the way in  tactility and feel is very similar to the real controller      
448,5.0,                       this controller works great  no problems      
449,1.0,                       left analog stick broke after   months use  if anyone knows a good off brand controller for xbox     please help  that s the second one to break  wish i could get the og version at a reasonable price  considering going back to cordless version      
450,5.0,                       i tried it as a replacement for my xbox     slim and it was very easy use  in my case  the joysticks and buttons are very responsive  this controller is much more economical in pricing  i recommend it      
451,3.0,                       the right thumbstick is pretty insensitive  slow and inaccurate  i noticed a small dead spot on the upper right  nne on a compass specific   makes games like bioshock and red dead redemption unplayable  but was fine for something like gta and portal    everything else on it worked fine and i actually like the build quality on it  feels pretty sturdy whole being lightweight      
452,1.0,                       the controller does not vibrate properlly  i can barely feel when it vibrates  everything else is perfect      
453,4.0,                       i use a controller in my left hand and aim with my mouse since      i saw all the reviews that this was not for fps games but they offered a    day money back and it was    rd the cost so  what did i have to lose for what i need it is excellent  i m not aiming with it  just movement and mapping quick access  often used binds if this thing lasts as long as my xbox controller did i ll be  truly impressed i m going to repeat  i use it one handed and do not use it to aim  i have no idea how well it would work stand alone but i do know that if the joystick dies on the left the right will be virgin and i ll just swap them  after the warranty      
454,5.0,                       cord is sturdy and long would deff buy again buttons and joy sticks move as they should       
455,5.0,                       these work very well and we are very happy with them      
456,5.0,                       just what i wanted        
457,5.0,                       works perfectly for both my xbox     and my computer would recommend to a friend     
458,4.0,                       had to give   stars because after few months controller broke   however   will bump to a   if the new controller they send me lasts longer   customer service is great with this company   within    hours they texted me and offered to send me a new controller without hassle   they also are asking for help reviewing a headset they have which is a cool thing  for     can t beat price and i will continue to buy from this company due to amazing customer service     
459,2.0,                       i ordered two controllers  only one worked properly the other frequently spazzes out and acts as if i m pressing random buttons  it makes any game unplayable voyee messaged me asking how the product was and i told them my issue  i just got an automated response of  thank you  that s good news  would you mind sharing this things on the product pages  update  i have since been contacted by voyee  they offered a     gift card which will supposedly be followed by a     gift card only once i ve changed the review to   or   stars they can only issue gift cards because of a  system bug   and will not refund directly      
460,2.0,                       controller stopped functioning completely      
461,1.0,                       the x button didn t work from the moment i opened the box   immediately returned      
462,1.0,                       had this controller for a couple weeks  worked really well  used it after about a   day break  and the left analog stick now continuously is moving forward  navigating menus is a nightmare  and i can t get my character to stop moving in games  only bought this cheap thing because it had so many great reviews  guess it was too good to be true      
463,5.0,                       friend loves it  it s a perfect match     
464,5.0,                    todo excelente        
465,1.0,                       immediately on first use it was registering buttons i didn t press  and ignoring the ones i did      
466,2.0,                       joystick tracking is bad it s not worth it but a     one that has good joystick tracking     
467,1.0,                       i purchased this product to leisurely play on my pc while watching movies etc  the left analog stick strafes to the right and to the top  forward   i can only imagine if you purchase this to  actually  play an intense game you will notice these issues much much sooner  this controller worked fine for literally   weeks      
468,5.0,                       i had a wireless controller that came with my xbox last month via amazon   i noticed that it can go out of sync from time to time so i ordered one with a wire   they re a lot better because it won t interrupt your game occasionally  nagging to be re synced   everything was new and worked fantastic  and it only took a few days to get it   i m giving it   stars      
469,2.0,                       accuracy is not great the joysticks are stiff and it broke after being dropped about     feet         
470,5.0,                       i wasn t expecting too much for a    dollar controller but i was atleast expecting fully functioning buttons  the a b x and y buttons have to be pressed extremely hard to register an input  and the b button specifically sometimes doesn t even register an input at all  i guess i should ve gone with something a little more pricey to get my money worth but  you live and you learn i suppose edit  i contacted them and a replacement is on the way  i can appreciate a company who tries to do right by their customers    stars      
471,4.0,                       useless for fps or racing games  the thumb sticks have so much acceleration that makes it unusable unless you only play platformers edit  customer support reached out to me and offered to refund well past the date so if you are wondering if anything goes wrong with the controller after your refund date i would say it s still worth a try     
472,1.0,                       worked great until it didn t  one month in the lights flashed twice after being put in  then acted as if it didn t have power      
473,1.0,                       only had it for what  a couple months now  and the controller already died  usb died and windows no longer recognizes it  was playing a game and it just stopped working for no good reasons at all do not buy      
474,5.0,                       perfect     
475,4.0,                       the d pad is poor  i play rocket league and my quick chats come out wrong    what a save      
476,1.0,                       a big pile of junk   didn t last two hours and the right bumper broke and you have to really push on it hard to get it to click both triggers feel lose all ready and more i use it the more if feels like it s going to fall apart   the more i started using it the louder the clicking got as well      
477,1.0,                       was great for the first   weeks i had it  then the calibration on the right joystick messed up and now the input for the right joystick is constantly going up even if i m not touching it      
478,4.0,                       my right bumper doesn t click properly  it still works  but it feels like there s an issue with the manufacturing that prevents it from feeling proper  however other than that  everything feels perfect      
479,5.0,                       just what my son needed  he can use it on his console or pc      
480,5.0,                       had an issue with the controller  customer service went above and beyond to make it right      
481,4.0,                       controller is good  but sometimes loses connection when connected to the internet  other than that  it looks and feels like an original xbox     controller     
482,2.0,                       i do not recommend this controller to pepole who play all the time like me this controller is  a waste of money i bought it   months ago and the lt and rt buttons work without even touching them and the right stick drifts down like this controller sucks     
483,4.0,                       so how does this compare to an xbox controller voyee is much louder  the buttons make an audible click when you press them  it s loud enough where you can hear them from the next room with the door shut the sticks are incredibly sensitive  like a cross pad  which makes it very difficult to do things like  walk slowly  snipe  or do anything carefully  they are also made of hard plastic instead of rubber the height and width are the same but it is thinner  but it s not that noticeable it s also a bit lighter  giving it a cheaper feel so what do i think  it s a solid backup and worth the price if you are a gamer  you will want an xbox controller though if you are a parent looking to get you kids a cheap alternative  this one is a good buy      
484,5.0,                       does what it was designed to do  plug it in and play      
485,5.0,                       works just like the original      
486,1.0,                       terrible purchase  ordered on the way   th  came on the   th  two days later the a button on the remote doesn t work  don t waste your money      
487,5.0,                       i actually prefer this to the xbone controller as it is lighter  probably cheaper material but i appreciate the lightness of it  and feels just as good in my hands   plus it s way less expensive it s working perfectly right now but i will update this review of it gives me any grief in the next few months of almost daily use      
488,5.0,                    excelente control parece  se siente como uno original  material de gran calidad         
489,5.0,                       my kids enjoyed it     
490,3.0,                       this controller treated me well for the last year i ve owned it  unfortunately it appears it is already wearing out from moderate use  the controller only stays connected to my pc if the cord is in a very specific angle  which has gotten worse over time  great for the price  however expect to replace it before too much time passes would give it   stars if it wasn t having cable issues so soon      
491,3.0,                       i got these because they were economical  i like them alot except the left stick will stick when depressed   they games i play don t utilize that stick much so it hasn t been a problem     
492,5.0,                       it works  no dead zones or other issues      
493,1.0,                           stars for this crap       i bought this to replace a broken original xbox controller for windows   you get what you pay for  i tried this as to not spend the money on the original and i will be returning it   very cheap plasticy feel to it   the most important part and the only part that matters is that all the buttons are horrible  the responses on them are horrible   the right trigger is squeaky   stay away  pay the extra and get the real one      
494,5.0,                       good     
495,5.0,                       is so good that i did get a second control     
496,4.0,                       for generic controllers these are fairly decent quality  they seem to have a bit of a loose connection when plugged in  but that could just be due to the age of our console      
497,5.0,                       great price  good value      
498,3.0,                       i gave the controller   stars because it works and its cheap but i cant say much else in its favor besides that  there seems to be no variation in sensitivity based on how much you move the analog sticks  if playing a shooter and you try to gently move the crosshairs over  they will either not move at all or suddenly race across the screen      
499,4.0,                       first controller would not function with windows    pc  i contacted the seller and they sent me a new controller at no cost  it functioned correctly immediately      
500,5.0,                       im using it for over   weeks and works great  long cord also helps  very happy with price and quality     
501,1.0,                       it locked up my computer whenever it was plugged in  do not buy      
502,5.0,                       this is perfect  it s exactly like the xbox     controller i remember  i bought this to play halo   on steam  the controller works immediately upon plugging in and has no issues   if only i were better at halo         
503,5.0,                       i wasn t expecting much from the price tag of this controller  but boy i was wrong  this controller feels nice  and is very responsive  i love the     controller over the xbox one controller  i will be buying more of these in the future      
504,3.0,                    control regular  me descepcionaron un poco las palancas no son tan sensitivas como deber an y tambien lo triggers traseros lb y rb  creo que se llaman  por ejemplo este control no te va a servir de mucho para un juego de carreras o algun otro que utilice mucho la funcion de acelerar  para lo que ofrece este control deberia costar entre     y     dolares a lo mucho         
505,2.0,                       my right joystick stopped working correctly and is always tilting to the right no matter what i do      
506,2.0,                       value is fine  worked well for   months and now all it does is disconnect from my xbox  the window to return it is closed  so have to replace it with a different one     
507,1.0,                       i have had this thing a few months but right from the start i had to plug it in   unplug it   plug it in to get it to work  now the controls are sticking  this is not a good value     
508,4.0,                       wish it explain more  instructions just say plug in and go  assuming that the user has a pc  had to install a driver works great just wish i knew or that box would guide more in that department     
509,2.0,                       did not work with my game or computer     
510,4.0,                       on par with microsoft controller     
511,1.0,                       cord opened up right away      
512,1.0,                       this is the absolute worst controller and not even worth a penny  every time i try to play the right stick keeps pointing me up in game making any game unplayable and this controller completely worthless  waste of time and waste of money        
513,4.0,                       i liked that the product came a day then expected      
514,2.0,                       it works  but input lag is terrible  tried many different settings and couldn t get this to work out for me     
515,3.0,                       the left thumbstick top right and bottom  right axis do not extend as far as the top left and bottom left axis  this is crucial in games that require movement and basically makes this controller useless for the left analog  tested using windows game controller settings  do not recommend this item edit  voyee customer support responded quickly to my issue and worked out a solution quickly with me  good customer support      
516,1.0,                       i ve never used a controller as imprecise as this  as an example say the sticks are like a clock and the    would be up    is right    is down  and   is left  if you want to make a diagonal movement  say what would be   you re likely going to have it registering between      sometimes it will land where you want and other times you ll have to struggle doing such a basic command  it s infuriating in any game  especially ones that require precision i bought this controller to replace a different one that i d used for years until one of the control sticks broke and i find myself going back to the broken controller because it works better than this one ever did  i thought mine was just defective  but after reading numerous reviews with people experiencing the same thing i can only conclude that it s just a terrible controller from a bad company that will harass and put unsatisfied customers under duress to leave positive reviews for a defective product      
517,3.0,                       pretty basic but it works     
518,3.0,                       sorry  i am not able to provided any feed back as these i purchased this gaming controller as a xmass gift      
519,5.0,                       purchased this controller about   months ago and it was a great replacement for my girlfriend s old controller  which had died  the feel and controls are very similar to the official product  this would have been a   star review  because after three months of casual use for the controller  the right analog stick started to drift  this can be expected after longer use  but not this early on in its life i was able to contact the seller through amazon and received prompt and professional customer service  i explained the situation and they offered a replacement for the product to make it right  it was a fast and easy process and now she can continue to play her heart out      
520,5.0,                       controller works great for pc gaming  plug and play      
521,5.0,                       we needed a control for our old x box  this is excellent      
522,1.0,                       i contacted them directly and they said they d send me a replacement  which never happened      
523,5.0,                       solid controller for         
524,5.0,                       it works good as a pc gaming controller     
525,2.0,                       most of the reviews said it was plug in and play  but it only works half the time  i have to restart my desktop every time in order for the controller to connect correctly with the usb  it reads as driver error      
526,3.0,                       everything is great except for the sticks  there is a massive deadzone and no acceleration      
527,4.0,                       i purchased this to use in my zelda randomizer runs and the controls are pretty spot on   there are a few issues with the right analog sensitivity  but that s more than likely something i could fix if i had the care to do so   my only qualm is the cord is a little too long for my setup  but again i m not sitting as far away as someone on a console would be      
528,5.0,                       wanted a joystick to use on my retropie  couldn t resist the price on this item  item feels good in the hands  good weight to it  has vibration support  good action on the buttons and sticks   devices recognized as a ms     controller and functions on both pc and raspberry pi  recommend highly      
529,5.0,                       very nice condition  works great     
530,2.0,                       will start dropping inputs and spamming alternate inputs  not worth getting      
531,5.0,                       my son says it is working great for his pc gaming use  and he uses it alot      
532,1.0,                       extremely fragile  dropped once  r trigger stopped working  crapola     
533,5.0,                       my son loves it     
534,1.0,                       the wire connectors are already broken after a couple months of light use      
535,2.0,                       it truly was fine and didn t have any large flaws when it worked but  it gave into driver errors and stopped working altogether     months time  and i don t play games that often with it to begin with      
536,1.0,                       this controller started out great  it worked well for our xbox  after a few months  however  it died  when we plug it in it lights up for a second or two and then the lights go out  other controllers work in the ports  so it s not the game system  we contacted the company  they responded initially and asked our order number  so we sent it  then we heard nothing      
537,5.0,                       updated review            i originally gave this controller a     star review because of some dead zone issues initially and poor longevity  it stopped working after about     months of occasional use i did not contact the seller because i assumed i was outside of any warranty or return period  however  the seller contacted me and offered to make things right by offering a refund  which i accepted i was surprised and really impressed by this  although the controller itself stopped working eventually  it s nice to know that the company has customers  backs in case the product ends up failing  i now have full faith in this company     original review            purchased due to the price  and i understand i m not getting top of the line controllers at this price point  that said  from day   the dead zone on the control sticks was a nightmare the usb connection has never felt good secure  it feels like i m forcing it in incorrectly every time i insert it we ve probably actively been using this controller since january      or so  ordered it early for christmas  and now it is constantly jumping in and out of being recognized  i usually have to plug it in and take it out multiple times before the computer will recognize it now  sometimes in the middle of games it drops the connection and re connects on a whim      
538,3.0,                       i ordered this because i liked the ps  voyee controllers but this is awful sometimes the controller doesn t register and the buttons feel horrible  they click and have no smoothness many times this controller has made button presses without input all i can say is that it s fairly disappointing      
539,5.0,                       amazing quality for an amazing price  keep up the great work      
540,5.0,                       very happy using this as n my pc gamepad     
541,4.0,                       goid     
542,5.0,                       i m typically against any off brand controllers  these actually feel really nice though  feels just like an original     controller  definitely a good buy for only      for that price  if it lasts   months i ll be happy with it      
543,5.0,                       i play gta v and i have tried a few controllers including the microsoft   i kill the a button from running too much usually within   months   so i needed a cheaper controller if they are just going to die any way   this showed up quick and physically feels sturdier then the others including the microsoft   time will tell on how it holds up  for now it was a good price and showed up quick   not worried about the made in america thing because as far as i know you cant get one made here      
544,2.0,                       it worked for a couple days and then stopped working     
545,5.0,                       controller broke around a day after i got it  i emailed voyee and they offered a full refund and had a quick response  great customer service      
546,5.0,                       the controller feels exactly like an x box controller  no need to use it through third party software  simply plug and play  the buttons a bit clicky but they work fine  good value for money      
547,3.0,                       left analog stick is intermittent  does not register the  up  function     of the time  when moving forward in a game your character will stop moving  also the r trigger would activate without input  possible i received a bad device  the company reached out and sent a replacement  hopefully this one will not have the same issue      
548,5.0,                       if your looking for a cheap controller that can take a little bit of a beating this is it  been using this for over about a year now  left analog is starting to drift a little bit  but for a cheap controller that made it through me raging in sekiro not too bad      
549,5.0,                       the thumbsticks  d pad  and triggers feel slightly cheap on this xbox     controller clone  but it also cost a third of the price of my ds  controller overall this works very well  and i don t think i ll even notice the cheap feel most of the time during my gaming experience i still love my ds  controller for competitive gaming  rocket league mostly   but having an xbox style controller makes it much easier to enjoy my casual games  without any driver issues  i just setup the xbox options in steam and play what i want when i want to         
550,1.0,                       didn t work     
551,2.0,                       looks and feels great but mine came with a broken x button  it does not respond to input  disappointing as its actually a good quality controller      
552,4.0,                       good enough    but won t last long after a week i got it the right stick and right bottom key pad is less responsive      
553,3.0,                       the controller itself is fine for around a month or two in a pinch if you need one but  in my opinion this controller compared to the others i ve bought on here has worn out the fastest the buttons got worn out quickly and don t feel as tight as they were day        
554,4.0,                       these worked just fine for my kids however they are a cheaper version      
555,3.0,                       on mine  the thumbsticks had very large and inconsistent deadzones  making the thumbsticks very imprecise      
556,3.0,                       feels comfortable in the hand and works how it should for about a week  after that the right trigger will  press  itself in game while connected and it s very annoying and troublesome to play with at times  decent value considering the price      
557,1.0,                       left bumper didn t work  returned      
558,1.0,                       did not last more than a few months  right stick triggers without touching it      
559,5.0,                       pretty good for the price      
560,4.0,                       i liked it  lasted me a few months until the cord eventually broke but that s from tiring it around so much so i do recommend to be careful  also the customer service is great  they are true to their warranty deal      
561,5.0,                       so what if it creaks and squeeks after    hours of use  it s a cheap as dirt controller and it works very well  i used to burn through an xbox     controller per month but you can t buy them anymore  so in comes this voyee thing and even though it s loud as sin it works better than the     controllers used to      
562,2.0,                       you get what you paid for  it works great in terms of price and feel  but the right joy stick does not detect subtle movements  such as for adjusting aim in a first person shooter  you have to push the joy stick all the way  this makes movements feel chopy  and  un refined  definitely keep this as a controller for the player   s in your life      
563,3.0,                       turning is terrible  not a good controller for fifa     
564,1.0,                       first one i bought right trigger broke in   days  the second one i bought  the left stick broke  do not buy        
565,4.0,                       i just got the controller  and i have to say  this is the first third party controller that felt good  so many of them have ridiculous design additions that make them difficult to use  but this controller felt exactly like an xbox controller the problem was  the controller s left stick had issues  when i pushed up and diagonal  it wouldn t work right  instead of running diagonally  the characters started walking  i couldn t fix this through calibration  the refund process went really well  and i think this is due to the company taking pro customer options provided by amazon it seems to me this is a good company who believes in their product  i might have just gotten a bad controller   try it out  the company is very fair in helping you solve it if it doesn t work for you      
566,5.0,                       great purchase   materials feel good  controller feels solid  great value for what you payseems there is also warranty info on the box it comes inwindows    users  windows will pick up the controller  but good to install     controller drivers anyhow   also recommend joytokey application  for older pc games  excellent free key mapper  donate    if you like it   trust me you will      
567,5.0,                       content        
568,5.0,                       the price is low and the quality is good  at this price  there is no expectation that it has a very good quality  unexpectedly  this xbox works very well  and there is no problem with the buttons  i think its quality is worth more  i am going to buy one for my brother  he likes to play games      
569,5.0,                       got this for my pc because i don t own an xbox and i don t want to pay     for a licensed controller  good news  steam and other games recognize it as an xbox controller  so it immediately has its button configuration when you play a controller compatible game on pc      
570,5.0,                       had an issue with my controller  there was a dead zone on one of the sticks  but a voyee customer service representative reached out  was super kind helpful  and offered a full refund      
571,5.0,                       first one arrived damaged  replacement was quick and easy  new one works extremely well  feels like the brand name one i had  easy plug and play with windows    and compatible games  would definitely recommend  food quality for a good price      
572,1.0,                       i didn t work at all     
573,5.0,                       works well     
574,3.0,                       i only play pc games and i heard this controller to be  excellent  for pc but after testing it it was not good  the left thumb stick doesn t works as good as an xbox one controller  it freezes and then works again like every time i move the player stops moving at some point because the left thumb stick isn t working properly  in the end i had to buy an xbox one wired controller and is working way better than this     
575,5.0,                       great product  needed some replacements on the cheap for my son s xbox      these worked perfectly      
576,5.0,                       i like that this item is not only an xbox controller but also a usb wired controller for windows pc  i ll be using this item for pc gaming through steam  thanks a bunch for an awesome product      
577,1.0,                       just received this  when i hit up or down on the directional it frequently acts like i pressed the left button  the game i m playing works just fine with the bug  but buyer beware if you re looking for      accuracy on the controls edit  i am now replacing this product due to increasing inaccuracy with the directional button  i do not recommend this product      
578,5.0,                       bought it for my grandson  he is happy with it      
579,5.0,                       update  orignally i wrote a   star review due to a sensitivity issue with the joystick  voyee contacted me via email and worked to fix the product  then sent me a new controller  the replacement fixed the issue and is now a perfect     controller  it is even compatible with xbox     controller accessories such as the headset and controller keyboard attachment original review when using on the xbox     the right joystick only registers   directions like a d pad  extremely noticeable in twin stick shooters  other than that it s fine      
580,1.0,                       this unit should not be an  amazon s choice there is a huge deadzone on the joysticks and that makes this controller unusable  i bought it to replace a easysmc controller  same price point  that has provided good service for some time but finally developed jitter in one joystick  i will return this unit and get another one from easysmc  also offered by amazon      
581,5.0,                       i bought this about a week ago and now when pushing the right directional pad it pushes the down directional pad as well  really makes playing hard the customer service was quick and responsive and helped resolve my issue     
582,5.0,                       satisfied     
583,1.0,                       could not get them to work with my xbox         
584,4.0,                       if you re okay with three directional pads  then this is the best option on the digital market   voyee has found the sweet spot for product cost  and durability   the wired controller is as easy to use as plug   play  and windows   registers its existence with no problems just a little warning though  if you use this as a nintendo wii u controller for cemu  don t activate a motion control oriented area   the controller doesn t seem to like that      
585,3.0,                       this controller felt good   it felt just like the xbox controllers that i have used and worked seamlessly with my computer   however after   months  this controller died   now it doesn t work at all   i ve tried multiple computers and usb ports with no success   while it was working  i would have given it   stars   a controller that can t last a year doesn t deserve that though   it did work very well while it was alive   i am very disappointed in such a short lifespan  update   their customer service responded very quickly and got me a new controller that is working   it had been   months  which was within the  yr warranty and they did honor that warranty with ease  and wanted their product to be good      
586,5.0,                       works fine  like the vibration      
587,3.0,                       i only had it led them a month and didn t use it very much and it has a shortage it keeps saying connect to the controller when i move the left top button to go up or down or left to right      
588,1.0,                       the controller has a huge deadzone on the right analog stick  extremely hard to use  not accurate  and feels like you have massive input lag      
589,5.0,                       a great product for people used to console play  who want to move over to pc in terms of durability  it is surprisingly resilient  although i would advise caution with more aggressive and destructive gamers      
590,5.0,                       so happy i was able to replace my broken controller      
591,5.0,                       it was very well packaged and delivered fast  it is working on my dell precision      workstation the moment i plugged it in  no driver s needed  it s a fair product for a fair price  i would absolutely recommend it for any pc gamer who wants to use a controller from time to time the cord is longer than the competitors  i just wish it was a little longer      
592,2.0,                       i ordered the product in november       it did work well for the time it was functional  unfortunately it will not connect to my computer any longer and says usb malfunction  not worth the money for it to only work for   months      
593,3.0,                       i finally got to test it out and it is defective  the ball is loo sided so when you try to play games the curser goes back and forth through menus and you can t select anything and the characters walk on their own         
594,5.0,                       no adjusting or settings to mess with plug and play windows        
595,3.0,                       the quality is decent but there is a huge deadzone on the right stick that makes it useless for fine aiming in fps games  changing deadzone settings in game doesn t fix it because the controller doesn t seem to detect any movement  especially diagonally  until the stick is moved at least halfway to the outside threshold      
596,5.0,                       i accidentally purchased the wrong controller     
597,1.0,                       gamepad has begun activating the right trigger completely on its own fairly constantly  this is untenable  any game that uses right trigger is now entirely unplayable at worst  and immensely frustrating at best  gamepad was not even used daily  purchased less than   year ago      
598,1.0,                       i wanted to play flight sim  but it broke before i could properly play     
599,1.0,                       after two months of infrequent use  the left joystick started to cause issues  it would sense upward movement when nothing was being touched  it makes some games umplayable      
600,2.0,                       my son purchased this for me as a birthday gift so i could play a couple pc games with him  i had an old xbox     controller i was using before  unfortunately i had problems from day one with the left joystick rarely working  i would have to really  flick  it hard from side to side to get it to move around in games or in menus  after about a month it would just randomly disconnect from my computer  the power light around the middle button on top of controller would just shut off  i would need to unplug and re plug it in a few times before it would work again  after a couple weeks of this it just stopped working completely      
601,5.0,                             
602,2.0,                       the joysticks are not as sensitive as the original thing  you have to move it a good bit before they actually make your player do anything      
603,5.0,                    scabe de bushto        
604,5.0,                       i was in need of a budget controller for my pc and came across this one  i ve used it for a few months and it works great  when i broke my controller they said they would send me another one     
605,5.0,                       i was expecting a pos backup controller  and was pleasantly surprised  i have been using this non stop for pc  online gaming  cod  conan  the forest  no issues at all      
606,1.0,                       the d pad is sharper than picasso s art style  don t pick this up if you like your left thumb      
607,5.0,                       good     
608,1.0,                       while it may be plug and play  buyer beware  dropped on the floor once from less than   feet  and the plastic shell shattered  it s complete rubbish  and it s the second time it s happened with these controllers on me      
609,2.0,                       should of got another brand for easier mapping with certain games like blacksquad or warzone but i made due for now      
610,5.0,                       i purchased a two pack of these wired xbox     controllers from voyee   one black and one gray black   the black controller works great   it was plug and play on my windows    pc and i ve already played several games with it without issue   i like having wired rather than wireless   no dropped connections  no charging or changing batteries the ergonomics are identical to my original xbox     controllers and all the buttons  triggers  and thumbsticks feel and function like i d expect them to   i had some stick drift issues with the grey black controller  but voyee was very responsive and offered a refund or replacement without any hassle   i used the refund to purchase another one of these black controllers and i ve got my fingers crossed that it ll work just fine      
611,5.0,                       i could almost compare it to the original     controller will definitely buy again if ever needed in the future      
612,1.0,                       rubber bit over the joysticks wore out after     hours of use   do not buy this unless you feel like wasting your money of garbage      
613,2.0,                       i have only lightly used this controller but within a month  the left stick started to drift downwards  after a couple of more months  the drift has gotten too bad to use  and the right stick has started drifting as well  the triggers are a bit noisy too  the other buttons work and feel fine      
614,5.0,                       so i got    one is excellent and the second one glitches all the time edit  customer service was incredibly helpful and courteous with me  they reached out to me about the product offering me a replacement or full refund  very quick and kind people  really good to work with      
615,5.0,                       updated review              not only are these controllers the most affordable  but the seller will make sure you are happy with your purchase  some of the buttons went bad on the controllers and the seller reached out to help me get a replacement  now that is customer satisfaction right there  thank you as for the controller itself  these are the most affordable on amazon  and they aren t as heavy as the usual ones you d usually get  the wires are pretty sturdy as well  so i m not worried about them bending off of the main controller  the official microsoft one i purchased is already starting to wear and tear  and i only bought it this year too  compared to that  i think these will last a lot longer don t hesitate  get these and don t be like me and forget to contact the seller if you have any issues      
616,4.0,                       pros  sensitive  responsive  good quality  philips screw heads  no glue on broad to hide circuits  and easy to modify cons  too wide and flat  you will notice its not a proper controller from the feel in your hand  and bad soldering overall      the few downfalls are easily outweighed by how responsive the controller is overall  easy modality and the ability to repair it if it breaks are an easy plus  along with the affordable price      
617,5.0,                       works as expected     
618,5.0,                       use in tesla model s and works great      
619,4.0,                       great price and works good     
620,2.0,                       the rating would be much higher if the product was still useable  right thumbstick started to drift after a few months  at   months it s basically unusable      
621,5.0,                       bought for my kids  works great      
622,1.0,                       bad buy     
623,1.0,                       the diagonal for the joystick is defective  it s been bothering me since the first day i got it  specifically down and right  send me a replacement please      
624,5.0,                       it works well  i use it with laptop and worked witout any need of instalation     
625,5.0,                       i liked that it works  especially in steam and parsec      
626,5.0,                       amazing product definitely suggest buying this  needed a replacement and came looking for one and decided with this one  fast delivery and great packaging  if i need another i definitely know where to look      
627,5.0,                       a good control in a good price     
628,1.0,                       this piece of junk lasted less than    days before it just died and wouldn t turn on  two weeks passed the return date  i feel jaded and abused by amazon      
629,5.0,                       i bought this to play games that work best with a traditional game controller   while i am getting my arse kicked on jedi fallen order s higher difficulty settings i don t think its the controller      
630,5.0,                       so i had looked into buying a xbox     controller for a while and after researching a bit for a cheaper wired controller i found this product  i was amazed to find that not only did a lot of people come to enjoy the quality of the controller from voyee but they also had great support from them as well when things did not go great  controller got busted and they got replaced  so i bought a controller to try it out  came in today           and i opened it immediately and plugged it in to play  after plugging it in it didn t work and after    minutes of troubleshooting i gave up and contacted the seller  within the same day i had confirmation that i was getting my replacement controller within a week at no extra charge thanks to the warranty voyee provided would absolutely recommend buying from this company seller because they are very reliable      
631,2.0,                       as other reviewers have noted  the analogue sticks are very poor  the input they generate tends to be imprecise with a generous hardware level deadzone  while the other components feel good  for most applications bad sticks make a bad controller      
632,4.0,                       this is a cheap  knock off of the original xbox     controller for the pc   it has the same buttons in the same locations as the original controller and does what it s supposed to do for basic gaming   make no mistake though  this is a cheap knock off and nowhere near the build quality of a genuine xbox controller   this controller is considerably lighter in weight and creaks in your hands under hard use   the four color buttons  shoulder buttons  and directional pad feel pretty nice  but the trigger buttons have a less refined  looser feel to them   i ve had original xbox controllers stand up to over   years of hard use without breaking  but i have serious doubts that this will last as long then again  it shouldn t have to   for the casual pc gamer who wants a basic controller with a familiar interface  this is a good buy   as long as you have the correct expectations for a cheap knock off controller  it s definitely worth the money      
633,5.0,                       controller was as described return process was smooth and easy because the first one i got was bad but the second one has worked great only had it for   months now with no problems     
634,3.0,                       the controller was easy to use and worked great for gaming on my pc for about   months  then it just stopped working checked usb ports to make sure they were not the issue  all checked out fine   issue is the controller just does not stay activated anymore via the usb port      
635,1.0,                       right stick started sticking after like   weeks right in the middle of an online game threw it directly in the trash suck my b lls      
636,5.0,                       cheap and works great      
637,1.0,                       controller is comfortable but is not built to last  after using for around   days the coating cracked where the strain relief is   after being on hold with amazon for about    minutes they hung up on me      
638,2.0,                       product was working fine until recently where it started to disconnect  i did not even have this controller for a month  at first i thought it was my ports but i tried every single one and come to find out the part that connects directly into the controller was loose and when it would slightly drop it would disconnect  i used this controller for gaming on pc  i already went through and requested for a replacement  if that one doesn t work then i ll request for a refund      
639,2.0,                       you would think an x    controller is an x    controller  but nope  the potentiometers are garbage  and the input response is wildly uneven  calibration doesn t help  avoid this edit  customer service was very responsive in addressing the issues      
640,5.0,                       well balanced and calibrated wired replacement controller  it performs at a higher level and has a lower cost than other xbox    replacement controllers i ve used in the past      
641,5.0,                       feels like the real thing  worth the money     
642,1.0,                       this is the worst controller i ve ever used   the thumb sticks are both faulty  and even in calibration mode they fail to reach full travel   the thumb sticks are also very  analog  and go from zero to full deflection in game almost instantly   made any driving and shooting game impossible to play   do not buy      
643,4.0,                       i ordered this controller about a month ago  the way the controller feels is very similar to a regular controller  but the joysticks move a lot more freely and quickly  this may not be a good thing  though  because it makes precise movement very difficult  i got this controller to play monster hunter  world with  and this is the biggest issue i have with it  normally  when moving the camera with the right joystick  you can control the speed at which the camera pans  however  with this controller  you have exactly   speeds  camera so fast it pans right past what you re trying to look at  or a snail s crawl  i find that diagonal movement is also difficult for the joysticks  a normal controller has no problem with this  but this controller has exactly   directions for the joysticks  which can be a real issue at times other than this  the controller is fine  compared to the more expensive controllers  this does the job  if you want a real quality product  it may be better to splurge on the more expensive ones  price wise  i think this product is fine as it is tl dr  lower price  lower quality  but quality is enough to actually qualify as a usable controller      
644,1.0,                       when i first unpacked the controllers i was fairly excited  but was quickly disappointed  i ordered two controllers and both have issues  one with the right stick  the other with the left and right trigger and the left stick  i will most likely return these  although if you re stubborn enough you could probably ignore the issues  but when playing certain games it makes all the difference      
645,5.0,                       got this for my kid because i was sick of buying batteries for the wireless controllers  the cord is long and this controller does the job      
646,5.0,                       if you need a replacement or extra controller for your xbox      this controller is a great and affordable choice  it s comfortable to hold  and the buttons are responsive  it s also plug and play    you do not need batteries  however  the instructions are confusing because the manual says aa batteries are required      
647,1.0,                       bought the controller and tested it immediately upon arrival  the right stick is non functional except for the x axis and works horribly  the left stick is   directions  not a real joystick  buttons stick even when new  plastic feels cheap  and triggers are barely functional if they function at all      
648,3.0,                       this control functioned  fine  for a couple months then the cord got a short in it so it pauses the game randomly wanting you to reconnect the controller and basically you have to disconnect and reconnect the controller for it to re register   the controls work fine for alot of games but the sensitivity of the sticks is not enough to be very accurate in fps games or driving games   the triggers have a huge pull before activating so for some games thats not good also   i would spend a bit more and get something better      
649,5.0,                       jus perfect  works very well  my boys excited and enjoy new controllers for their xbox  i would recommend anyone whoever lookin for this  you have to buy this  it s works perfect  i will order again if my boys wants another one      
650,1.0,                       purchased   of these controllers  neither one works anymore after less than a year of use  when i plug them into my computer  they do not communicate with the computer  when they do work  it s in spurts  either in brief periods or it will work one day and not the next  would not recommend      
651,1.0,                       i used the remote two nights and the right bumper already doesn t work  also ever since i got it the right stick didn t respond until i pushed it halfway in any direction  horrible controller overall especially if you play fps games like me      
652,5.0,                       such dead on game controls  i ve purchased other cheaper controllers  but the dead zone would make it unplayable  this is perfect value for your money      
653,5.0,                       i play on steam and this controller really works seamlessly with my games  great deal  very satisfied      
654,5.0,                       it arrived super quick and great value for money   works well     
655,3.0,                       works well for the price  it had no problem finding the drivers when i  plugged it in for the first time  the parts seem to be retty durable  overall good deal for the price  works well with farm simulator   bought it for that reason      
656,5.0,                       good controller works perfectly     
657,4.0,                       totally my fault it broke  a great sub     controller if you don t have a death grip like i do      
658,5.0,                       had problems with controller and company gave full refund   no hassles at all      
659,2.0,                       purchased this controller about   months ago  worked perfectly as a plug and play controller  feels just like the microsoft branded xbox     controllers    for about     hours of gaming  at which point the right trigger started randomly inputting without me touching it  mind you  i m not prone to smashing my controller on things or throwing it around  it was treated gently  but still broke after about     hours tl dr  worked great but didn t last long until it broke edit  several other reviews mentioned getting contacted by customer services and getting refunds replacements  no such thing has happened in the few months since posting for me      
660,5.0,                       feels like the original controller  feels high quality at a low price      
661,2.0,                       same design as a regular xbox controller  with a decent cord length  however  the controller won t even turn on just a few weeks after purchase  don t buy this as a long term controller      
662,5.0,                       this was exactly what i was looking for in my usb controller  cheap and functional  it delivers on both      
663,5.0,                       the price is so affordable and the quality awesome   its a standard controller   the price makes so much sense that you start to wonder if there s something wrong  but there wasn t   i recommend it for your pc   ask me questions if you want        
664,1.0,                       do not buy this  not a good product for the price  or any price     
665,5.0,                       it gets the job done  standard controller      
666,1.0,                       used about   hours a week for a month and the left bumper started spamming constantly  i take good care of my controllers and don t drop them  guess you get what you pay for      
667,5.0,                       perfect replacement     
668,5.0,                       just what i needed to play my games     
669,3.0,                       a perfect controller for     hours  but be prepared for small problems after that      
670,4.0,                       work just as like the original     
671,5.0,                       great value for what you re getting  plug and play  i ve bought voyee products before  haven t been let down yet     
672,5.0,                       i plugged the controller into my pc via usb  it works well  until it shuts off randomly  then i have to un plug and re plug it back in  works great otherwise  really not the worst problem ever but it still is a problem edit  i was contacted by the company based on my review and they offered me a replacement  i ll update further when i receive the replacement edit    replacement arrived quickly and after extensive testing  works without issue  rating changed to   stars due to awesome customer service and fast shipping      
673,4.0,                       controller looks good and feels good in your hand  just like an xbox controller  got it to dust off an old copy of ncaa     the response of the buttons seems to be a tiny bit off  not sure if i m just out of practice or used to current generations controller responsiveness but i m using a knock off controller and my roommate that keeps beating me is using a real xbox controller so i m going to blame it on that      
674,1.0,                       the usb connection did not sit right in the port on my computer so it would only stay connected if i physically held it in place  had to return for a refund     
675,5.0,                       i mainly bought this for racing because my original wireless xbox     controller is just worn out  it would have costed more to fix the sticks   buy new battery packs for them than buy this  looked at reviews gave it a shot  fantastic controller  the sticks are great not as good as a new microsoft controller great  but close   its a bit lighter   thinner than an original one but that don t bother me as it still has more weight than a typical aftermarket one  considering the price of a authentic wireless xbox     controller  this is a great replacement at    rd the cost  would buy again and again      
676,4.0,                       it is a value for the money but the buttons started sticking a couple months in  it s not just one its like three or four at this point  it started with one and it escalated  i have dropped it several times so take that into account  overall i d say it is a decent controller if you take care of it  if life hands you a couple scuffles then maybe drop a few more dollars and go with something more durable      
677,5.0,                       there were no surprises  good or bad  it just worked like it was supposed to      
678,5.0,                       ok     
679,1.0,                       as many others have mentioned already  this controller s analogue sticks have large dead zones  meaning that they do not register any input until the stick is pushed a certain distance away from center  this makes it unusable in games requiring finer precision  like fps and driving games  don t be fooled by the rating      
680,3.0,                       everything seems to be working fine i ve never used this brand before time will tell how long it lasts but overall first impressions very pleased    well it is june  th  so the controller only lasted a couple months before finally biting the dust      
681,4.0,                       works great      
682,5.0,                       awesome            
683,5.0,                       overall   stars for sure     
684,1.0,                       i stream on youtube and twitch and have a decent following  around   k   i mainly stream console games  but i ve been getting into pc games lately  i m not an avid pc gamer  so i got a controller that was recommended by a friend  but after less than two months the right analog stick has started drifting  i m not even heavily using it  so i m extremely surprised it s happening  guess i m sticking to mouse and keyboard  i do not recommend this controller to anyone      
685,5.0,                       this uis a great value for the money  i was surprised to even find a     controller  it works awesome and the kids are happy      
686,1.0,                       after only   months of very light use it is already broken  holding up on the joystick results in inconsistent input  causing in game character to stutter about while moving forward  makes the controller completely unusable  and of course product support ended   weeks ago      
687,2.0,                       i was impressed with the  fit and finish  of this controller   seems to be well constructed  looks and feels just as good as microsoft   buttons are crisp and responsive  joysticks have a good pressure and rebound feel  triggers seem to be just as good             and then i actually played a game with it  that s when the movement sensitivity issues came up  when attempting to make small  subtle movements you will find that the joysticks do not respond right away   and then when you do find that spot you will very quickly get to the maximum  trying to aim in a fps or attempting to hit the apex in a race is extremely difficult compared to the original  but i guess you get what you pay for  even playing something like skyrim or fallout is frustrating because of the sensitivity issues   love hate relationship with this one   love the feel but there is no way i can be competitive with it      
688,2.0,                       this controller lasted for about         hours of gameplay  the main problem is there are duplicated inputs from the right trigger  d pad  left trigger  and right button  when any single one of them is pressed they all flash at once  while this could be caused by something being spilled on it  nothing came into contact with and it seems to be the result of a little humidity condensing on the internal electronics      
689,5.0,                       for being a cheaper price  works great for my kids     
690,2.0,                       no problems  worked as well as you d expect for a third party controller  but then it just quit on me  tried troubleshooting the drivers  but it was just dead      
691,3.0,                       this is an updated review after having communicated with voyee customer service   the game control i received was a bit disappointing  the x and y axis lacked sensitivity and performed poorly in situations where small inputs were important   as a result  i had given very poor review of it  though i noted that it was fine for the cost relative to higher end controllers of similar design   though i stand by that review  the company made a very strong effort to offer me a refund and a replacement controller  they claimed they d upgraded their product   i have replaced this controller with a microsoft brand controller however  and felt it was unethical to accept a refund or new controller from voyee given that the previous one wasn t defective  it just was not the quality i wanted   i added a star to my review to reflect how much of an effort their customer service department made  as well as their courteousness  in trying to reach out to me and help resolve my criticism of their product   bear in mind  however  i have not tried their  upgraded  product and cannot speak to the quality of it      
692,4.0,                       disconnects constantly it seems that it was a defective controller  a replacement was sent  and it functions just fine      
693,1.0,                       this controller is cheap yes  but after just one month i have issues that make this controller unusable  i ll be playing and the joysticks will randomly move the on screen camera even if i don t touch them  also  when i do use the joysticks they ll stick in place and i have to physically return them to center  the buttons are also very clicks  i wouldn t recommend this even though it s cheap      
694,4.0,                       the sticks are a bit stiff at first  so all you really have to do it increase game sensitivity and you ll be good      
695,3.0,                       its not bad for the money  i won t be testing the durability because i can t get over the huge deadzone  took a chance for a quick contoller  thank goodness i had a spare dualshock    i recomend a legit sony or microsoft controller  these  rd party options just never work right in my experience  it s just always something      
696,2.0,                       i m not sure how it would work on an xbox  as i don t own one  but it didn t work on my windows    pc  aside from when pressing where the xbox home button usually would be  the product does say that it works on windows    computers  but i don t have that experience  if you plan to buy this for your computer  save your money  it s not worth the time i spent      
697,3.0,                       it honestly held up better than i expect after a year  buttons work fine  but this feels cheap  you get what you pay for  xbox   controller would be way better for pc gaming  dont expect to have a fun time in fps games or anything that requires aim  the analog sticks have many dead zones and they do not feel confident while using them to aim  if you play car games   d games  or side scroll games it works okay so im gonna give it   stars      
698,1.0,                       worked for about   hours then keep disconnecting from the computer  tried in multiple computers and won t work      
699,2.0,                       no offence to the makers  but the left joy stick isnt really touchy like i thought it would be  turning it to the left works just fine  but when turning it to the right you have to move it all the way over for it to register  as well as the triggers are weak  they aren t sensitive at all  and its honestly disappointing considering the reviews were so high on this controller  get your moneys worth i suppose      
700,5.0,                       does what it needs to   the only complaint is that the vibration is a bit off      
701,5.0,                       great controller and great price     
702,5.0,                       i received my xbox controller from voyee  it was package will and has great feel for ergonomic and the length of cord was perfect  it has same feel and sheerness of original xbox controller  it is very responsive while any of my games  i high recommend this controller  it great buy if looking for wired controller  i gave it  star rating      
703,1.0,                       not worth deadzones in this controller are awful  it makes you movement in games super boxy and uncomfortable also  they keep badgering me about my bad review and won t leave me alone      
704,3.0,                       i m thankful for these  as not a single store in our city or surrounding cities had any controllers  however  neither controllers work at all now  and the wires are showing      
705,5.0,                       this is a decent working controller similar to factory provided one  i think the sensitivity could be a little better for driving  turning is almost all or none on games like gta v  the cord is long although i wish it had one more foot  it s longer then others though      
706,3.0,                       looks wise this a solid alternative to an xbox controller  the deal killer for me was the stiff and noisy right trigger   made it less comfortable to use than my   year old knock off controller      
707,2.0,                       dpad is terrible  i got this to replace a worn xbox one controller to use on pc  however the dpad is worse than the one i wanted to replace      
708,4.0,                       overall good quality and sturdily built  just kinda feels comfortable to hold for long game sessions  only real complaint so far is noticeable deadzone on the thumb sticks  limiting ability for finer tuning adjustments      
709,5.0,                       great value and arrived quickly     
710,2.0,                       didn t last long before it stopped working       
711,5.0,                       great value     
712,1.0,                       stopped working after    days  so can t return      
713,5.0,                       for various reasons i prefer a dedicated wired controller to wireless without a built in cable  this is a great product and if you end up with any issues just get in touch with the seller with your concerns  they re happy to help      
714,1.0,                       i wish i could give zero stars   after a week of playing gta v on my pc  it started registering random button presses   driving along and suddenly jumping out of the car  or having the social club open is beyond irritating   especially when you re on a mission and you unexpectedly bail out of an airplane   save yourself a ton of frustration and just get an official xbox controller for your pc   or xbox if anyone actually plays on those things    it started acting up the day after the return window closed      
715,1.0,                       i kept it a year and gave it away this last christmas there seems to be a short in the cord and the left stick has dead zones      
716,5.0,                       bought for my son and it came in brand new shape   works great  would recommend     
717,3.0,                       this is a decent wired xbox controller  my main issue with it is that occasionally i will get  phantom  lt presses  in halo this makes me throw grenades when i don t want to  sometimes it is a bit infuriating  this problem happens maybe once every   minutes or so  i would not recommend this controller if you are a serious gamer      
718,5.0,                       i purchased this on sale for         pretty good controller  i use it for laptop gaming on steam and so far the buttons  joysticks and overall feels comfortable definitely would buy another if necessary for   players      
719,2.0,                       the rb button wore out in less than   months of use  i m already looking into buying a replacement      
720,3.0,                       it is a little smaller than the original xbox controllers  all buttons work good except the analog sticks  they do not respond well when playing fps games  especially when it comes to aiming  my kdr went down since using this controller i wouldn t recommend this controller if you play lots of fps games      
721,1.0,                       broken ps  button after   months     
722,5.0,                       it feels just like the oem controller  even the weight is great  tried it out on a lot of games and i can say it is the best aftermarket controller out there for the xbox          
723,1.0,                       the controller does not work at all  do not buy this item      
724,5.0,                    fue genial para la consola de los ni os           
725,5.0,                       well made fast delivery     
726,5.0,                       i was on the fence about ordering a controller that wasn t official  but this controller is actually better than the original xbox    one  no batteries  just a long cord  i am okay with a cord because i also play on playstation  trust me great for the money  you won t be disappointed      
727,1.0,                       i liked the fact that it was plug and play  but every time i plugged it into my laptop  it would not work even though my laptop recognized the controller   a big waste of money cuz i can t even use the controller     
728,2.0,                       the controller itself is okay  definitely feels like a cheaper     controller  which is what you would expect  i liked it for the first few weeks i used it  but unfortunately the left joystick keeps  drifting   and thinks i m holding it up when it s in the neutral position      
729,5.0,                       my grandson loves it     
730,4.0,                       works really well and is usually very responsive  has moments where it lags or glitches but nothing that is consistent or disruptive  i plugged it in to my laptop and it works right out of the box  my only issue with it is that the left joystick is a little sticky and sometimes gets stuck in the bottom right position so i sometimes find my character drifting away when i don t want them to move  overall  great controller for      can t beat that price  i ll probably be getting another one when this one gives out      
731,5.0,                       great controller  it s very reliable  but i wished it was more slimmer     
732,4.0,                       pros  feels great for the price  works with emulators  exceptional valuecons  bottom shoulder buttons are a little squeaky   maybe a little machine oil would help  occassionally when rapidly hitting buttons the buttoms seem unresponsive  but this is rare     
733,5.0,                       i really like that this controller has a good  solid feel to it  it does not feel cheap or flimsy at all  it appears nearly identical to the original controller and functions properly  quality feel  great so far      
734,5.0,                       work really well  happy with my purchase      
735,5.0,                       not bad at all      
736,5.0,                       alright  look  it looks great  it feels great  like an original xbox controller  but the sticks   yeah  not the greatest  kind of has a lot of trouble with the diagonals if you know what i m saying  it s weird  but hey for the money it s awesome  but looking back   i should have just a little more money forward for the real thing  you get what you pay for here   nice on the outside  can t really trust what s inside bottom line  good for platformers maybe  but don t play something like halo at all with this or you will have a bad time  trust me on this one      
737,5.0,                       it works      
738,4.0,                    no iguala a uno original  tiene un espacio de punto muerto en los stick  pero en general muy bien        
739,1.0,                       unboxing this i was surprised how closely it resembled the oem controllers but after trying it out i immediately ran into issues with the left trigger activating at random and behaving as if stuck  and also noticed some drift on the right thumbstick that could be pretty disruptive all said it lasted less than   hours before i got frustrated with it  maybe a bad unit but not a great experience      
740,5.0,                       it works very well thanks        
741,2.0,                       the controller works on my xbox      but there are some obvious latency issues   it is really noticable in first person games  i go to turn around and it starts out slow  but a second later my character will spin almost        and yes  my sensitivity is set low  all in all  it is a decent  but the analog sticks are terrible   i will be looking for an oem controller soon   update       there is also a horrendous stutter when using the left analog stick to move around in games   moving straight would be fine  but the moment i start to strafe in any game it causes my avatar to seize up and twitch like it cant move correctly   i wish i could explain it better but this is not a good controller      
742,5.0,                       this controller broke as soon as i got it  update  they made it right with me  thanks      
743,1.0,                       controllers are junk i bought   if them and they both did the exact same thing after several uses     
744,5.0,                       totally shocked at the quality of this controller  i ve had several third party controllers over the years mad catz  afterglow and rockcandy   were some of the better ones  but this one is probably the best  it is pretty durable  dropped it several times  the cord does not seem to have the problems shorting out like the afterglow and rock candy brands  the rumble vibration is a little softer than the standard xbox     vibration  all in all this should be your first go to if looking for a cheaper alternative to an xbox     controller  you probably won t go anywhere else      
745,3.0,                       this controller worked fine but the delay on the thumbsticks makes it too annoying to use for games that require sensitivity  i won t buy this brand again      
746,5.0,                       in my opinion  this is the best third party wired xbox     controller  i used an official xbox     wired controller before it finally broke down and made the switch to this one  and i have to say this controller feels as close to the real thing as possible after a few months of continuous use  my voyee controller broke down no longer recognized by my pc or xbox  wouldn t power on etc   i sent a quick message to the company and they replaced it  no questions asked  great customer service      
747,3.0,                       very weak performance wise which is the first thing mentioned on the pamphlet inside  i preferred this over the logitech controller because i prefer the ergonomic style of xbox controllers within just under a month  take a look at the picture  the cable starts to rip        
748,1.0,                       didn t work  doesn t work  never worked  didn t expect much but i expected it to work    and you guess it  doesn t work      
749,5.0,                    funcion  perfecto en mi xbox      sin problemas        
750,2.0,                       works intermittently  basically three money away and window for returning expired  i would not purchase again      
751,5.0,                       works very well for the price  surprisingly so  would recommend      
752,5.0,                       works great  buttons are a bit stiff compared to what i m used to  but maybe it ll break in  it s recognized the same as an xbox controller  plug and play      
753,5.0,                       perfect     
754,1.0,                       this controller had a great feel and solid build  just like original  but it did not work  the left trigger button would not respond at all  filed a return and had to ship through ups instead of just dropping off at kohls  sent it back and still have not got a refund  not a product feature  but a seller feature   had to delay set up of new retro system due to this delay  really wanted to love the product  but it has to work for me to like it      
755,5.0,                       son love it     
756,2.0,                       horrible item     
757,5.0,                       updated review september    so  i am a week or so late with this  but after posting the original review and also sending a message to the voyee customer service  they replied back to me on the same day a few hours later  asking for my number and address for a replacement  i gave it to them  and they sent the replacement  which came the following week  original review was on a friday   working perfectly  seriously surprised at how fast it all was  and also that i even got a reply from customer service the same day  all praise and hail voyee  exceeders of expectations   don t care if that word doesn t exist original   star review from september          so i got this controller back in may           and up until a couple weeks ago  it worked well  the left analog stick was a little too sensitive when moving the camera in games  but i didn t mind that  i saw that as training fine motor skills  somewhat but my issue is that  randomly and for no reason  my controller is vibrating constantly  even when nothing is on  my tv and xbox was turned off  but i walked into my room and the controller was vibrating  i unplugged the controller and it stopped  but plug it back in and it vibrates  i turned off vibration in the xbox  controller still vibrates  i unplugged the xbox  it still vibrates  and  as a hunch  because the controller is usb  i plugged it into my tv which has a usb port  and the controller is vibrating  other than the vibration  the controller works perfectly  but i dont know what will happen if this continues on  especially since i only got this thing just over   months ago basically  i love the controller  but i may have to get a new one because it won t stop vibrating      
758,4.0,                       only issue i have is the same issue with all corded controllers the cord wont last thiat long  other than that it does what it needs to do      
759,1.0,                       it s functional as a controller  but only just  the stick inputs are very insensitive  making it difficult to adjust for intensity of directional input  this makes it feel like one is playing with a controller built of legos in games that require tight controls  such as fps s or tactical stealth shooters  on the topic of poor stick inputs  the controller does not register small differences between specific directional input  for example  one can either go left  forward  or forward left  there is no variation in between the three directional movements  again making precision control impossible  buttons become sticky after basic use  no damage has occurred to the controller yet there are times when unpressed buttons continually send unintentional inputs for anyone buying a replacement controller  spend the extra         and shop elsewhere  this controller is only acceptable for use with basic smart tv video game apps  any use with a half way decent title will leave you with regret      
760,5.0,                       it s worth the         
761,5.0,                       my nephew loves it      
762,5.0,                       nice works great so far  fast delivery was a plus      
763,5.0,                       i bought this to play games on steam   it worked pretty well out of the box   the only issue that i had from the start was that the sensitivity of the joysticks is lacking from minor movements to major ones   trying to sneak in a game by barely moving the stick vs running by moving the stick all the way    now  however  a few months on  the buttons are starting to be difficult to get to respond update          the company got into contact with me unsolicited and offered a replacement for the controller   top class customer service in particularly because i had already written the controller off   i would definitely buy another one of these controllers   the newer controller s are more responsive also i think they have been improved in design or something      
764,5.0,                       boys loved this     
765,2.0,                       i have several controllers  and this one is a nightmare  every time i plug it in it switches to another player mode  and i have to restart my pc in order to reconfigure it  this is the only controller i own that has this issue  not worth the frustration      
766,1.0,                       it s garbage  it doesn t work properly  the buttons are stiff  never buy this piece of crap
