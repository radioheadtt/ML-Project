0,5.0 ,                       i got this for my switch and you cannot beat it for the price  it doesn t take long to fill up the    gigs of internal storage  and if you buy a lot of digital games i highly recommend getting at least an     gig card  but the way the prices of these cards are dropping and with the holidays coming up  i d keep an eye out for another deal on these     gig ones  you ll be glad you have the extra room also  i didn t rate the durability of the card  as i haven t had it nearly long enough to comment on that      
1,1.0 ,                       i used this microsd in my dashcam   it developed errors that could not be fixed and drive could not be formatted of note  it made my thinkware dashcam malfunction  eg  the camera would spontaneously reboot  not boot up correctly  etc     i think that this behavior would happen with  any  defective sd card from any manufacturer   once i replaced the card  the dashcam performed as expected      
2,1.0 ,                       the micro     gb sd didn t work up to expectation   it no good what i needed it for i placed it into my mavic   zoom and it wasn t fast enough to record video because when i inserted the micro as into my aircraft and check why it was recording terrible mymavic   say it was to slow so i had to buy another micro as card with was    gb extreme plus class       
3,5.0 ,                       i have seen some complaints that these cards might be phony knock offs  admittedly  my purchase here was for  only    gb cards  but the complaints made me nervous  so i bought several cards directly from sandisk  after paying a bit more and receiving micro cards that did not include adapters  i wish i had bought them here at amazon  because their capacity and speed were no different  both for   gb and   gb of this particular card type  i can t promise for all cases  because i have had a number of fakes from other sources  without the labeled capacity or so slow that they weren t worth using and literally went to the trash  however  amazon seems to have consistently sold me a valid product  i hope this is not just a matter of luck      
4,4.0 ,                       i purchased the    gb micro sd card and it consistently writes at around    mb sec  reading at    mb sec via usb      using aja system test   the included full sized sd adapter  however  barely allows writes at   mb sec  like another reviewer whose adapter actually melted  i probably received a bad one  i don t intend to use it  so that s no problem  but i would hesitate to buy one of these if i did plan on using the adapter  aside from that  it appears to be a legitimate sandisk card and i expect it to last  if that changes  you can bet i ll edit this review      
5,5.0 ,                       used this as a memory card for my switch  do not  i repeat  do not purchase a nintendo brand memory card for the switch  the regular sandisk ones  like the one here  are more bang for your buck by a longshot and work just as well  the nintendo ones are overpriced  and are just sandisk memory cards with their name      
6,5.0 ,                       always afraid of buying memory cards from the net but since i was buying from amazon   not a  rd party  figure why not  definitely made sure i was buying from amazon directly   turned out to be good real memory card so far with no problems  weird it says    gb but when you check it out on a device or something  it only reads    gb  still plenty of memory for my dash cam to last a good long while      
7,1.0 ,                       this is the first time i got a sd card thur amazon site and it will be the last time i will get a sd card on this site  when i got this sd card for my nintendo switch to used when i put it in it  never recognize the card at all  i try to put in several times and it get the same results  i even try to reformatted and it never recognize it   i send this back and i m now waiting for my refund so thankful amazon does have that policy in place i would be stuck with a non working card that i couldn t even used  i got another sd card from another site that i got my sd cards before and it work good for me  i also want to add this is the first time i had a sd card that never did work for me  i also hope this is the last time      
8,1.0 ,                       i bought this for use in either a smart phonemotorola g  plus  orr tablet  galaxy tab a     sm t       or hp slate    on the android devices  no matter how many times i format and attempt to download google play music        songs i have purchased   the the downloaded songs keep fluctuating and the process never completes   clearly  this is a defective unitnot very happy   amazon needs to police its vendors more carefully      
9,5.0 ,                       i ve had this micro usb in my dash cam a while now  it still works great  i just leave it in there and trust that it s recording without fail  i ve had to take it out twice and the picture quality is awesome and was able to transfer the important information to my desktop  bought another for my other car      
10,5.0 ,                       i lost both of them so i wouldn t know honestly but i will say that my twat itches like it s rabid      
11,5.0 ,                       sandisk is the best memory card maker out there   not necessarily the cheapest  but there are stories of fakes and defective products from no name suppliers  so i figured  better safe than sorry i needed a larger memory card for my     gig macbook air   originally i got a     gig memory card to use for backups  but it s not enough for time machine  which requires a little extra space for incremental backups   so i swapped it out for this     gig card  and now backups are working well the ideal would be a    gig card  but those are still rare enough that they don t ship immediately  and are rather expensive   eventually  they will come down  but in the meantime  this is probably the best chip on the market  i m probably going to get one for my phone as well      
12,4.0 ,                       when formatting  be aware of partition size and adaptor type  i couldn t get mine to work until i actually put it in my mp  player and formatted with the device itself  when i did it with the computer  it gave me false capacity display and it was a constraint on either the usb adaptor i was using  or the usb port  or both  i managed to see the whole capacity in a laptop sd card slot  but my usb adaptor was useless when you do some reading about selecting sd card type and size  there s a ton of stuff to learn  the bigger card sizes aren t as easy to manage as the ones that are   gb and less      
13,4.0 ,                       good choice for a back up dash cam   very good video on the cameras   i installed this on a      plymouth voyager minivan my daughter is using as a new driver   overall easy to install  took me about   hours  but i was taking my time   cables are plenty long   i used power from the cigarette lighter in the rear of the van   only two small negatives to mention  the mirror does not seem have an angled night mode  annoying   second  it would be nice to have the option of the video only for back up  then when putting the car in drive the video screen goes dark   right now it waits one minute before going dark      
14,1.0 ,                       disappointment for a      and this microsd isn t even     gb  that s false advertisement   put this straight into my computer to check it   out of the box   and it s only       i won t be buying from sandisk again    ridiculous      
15,2.0 ,                       i wish to write a review about the    g sd card that i received today  but somehow i can only write the review for the   g sd card i bought   months ago the    gb sd card has   g available space    m s when copy video file  micro sd card stuck in the adapter  i have to broke the adapter to get it out the new     gb sd card i got today is not the one i ordered  as the picture is shown   it says up to   mb s  instead of    mb s also the color is white  not red  i do not feel like returning it because i have to use it today  also inconvenient due to covid        
16,4.0 ,                       my dash cam gaves me error when i inserted one of the spare class    sd card from another brand  that i need to insert card that supports high definition video  i was amazed that class    card should support high definition recordings  well it didn t  as this sandisk card is class    and supports high definition video recordings and works like a charm with my dash cam read speed is almost accurate when i tried to copy videos to my laptop  i also tried to copy a   gb file and write speed was not a described in the product description but i beleive both read and write speeds depends on type of file youbare working on but sandisk being a very popular and reliable brand i would always try to go for these cards and they always have good prices going on overall quality  performance and value of the card is better than other competitors      
17,1.0 ,                       i have used numerous memory cards in my phones and cameras etc   i purchased this to use in a older phone with storage issues   i was on vacation and ran out of storage room on my phone so i formatted the memory card and transferred my photos over to this card and kept taking photos   when i returned home and tried to access my photos i could not   i tried to remove the card and could not get it out of my phone   i actually damaged the slot in the phone in order to get the card out   it was ruined and not unusable and i lost all my photos   the phone place i took it to said some of the pins were probably defective and broke off upon removal causing damage to my card slot   i know somethings things are defective but they should never cause damage      
18,5.0 ,                       we recently purchased a new san disk ultra microsdxc uhs   card with adapter       gb   to be used with our new fire hd    tablet as storage for our e books and games   we followed the instructions received with the tablet for inserting the sd card into our new tablet   it went in very easily   it is presently working well   we are presently saving all of our books and games to the card   at present we have not attempted to save any pictures to the sd card as we do not take pictures with our tablet so we can not verify the quality of the pictures once they are saved   it is assumed we would not have any complaints with the quality of the pictures   we are extremely happy with our choice of this sd card for saving our books and games for daily and future use      
19,5.0 ,                       i m not going to write too much about it  the sionyx aurora pro i have came with a   gb kingston sdcard  i wanted a larger sd card so i bought the sandisk    gb ultra microsdxc uhs i memory card with adapter  so far i have been able to successfully get it to work with my camera  and now i have way more storage capacity     
20,1.0 ,                       i got this card in june and have been using it till now  but after using it and the storage got filled half way  the files started disappearing   i thought it was a problem with my camera  but other cards continued to work fine  then i ran hwtest on the card and shocked to discover that it s actual capacity is less than     of the stated amount  a    gb card is being peddled as    gb card  i called samsung who took down the serial number on the card and told me that it s a fake  my amazon return window is long gone  so there goes my      i had bought a smaller capacity version earlier that works fine  so a word to others   if you buy this  please run hw tests using any sd card testing such as h testw and make sure the capacity is what s promised and the card works before the returns window closes      
21,5.0 ,                       this fits the bill as hefty storage  with decent speeds   i ve captured  k video on it  and it was relatively stutter free  but the primary application is as extra storage in my surface book  and this does the job well if you re looking to film in vr  though  you probably want to update to the faster minimum write speeds of a uhs   card     
22,5.0 ,                       you can rely on sandisk vs many  no name  micro  and other type  cards   the amazon price is excellent  delivery is swift   accurate  and customer service is outstanding   i ve been a prime member for years   will always renew if buyers will read reviews of off brand micro   regular sd cards and usb drives  they may find that the advertised capacity is not accurate  above set aside for operating system  it takes time to read   drill down in product reviews  but we buyers are often rewarded by not making costly buying mistakes   rely on product users   thanks folks      
23,5.0 ,                       love the capacity in my phone seems as though i have endless available space   preparing the card with content was a breeze because it snapped right into my laptop and then into my pc using the supplied sd converter   also have run now for months without any issues with songs or photos being only partially displayed  my last card routinely took errors      
24,5.0 ,                       very reliable brand  using for media storage on my brother s phone for when he goes to the hospital  this replaces a laptop  which is just too large  he can t use his fingers to change channels on a traditional remote for the hospital tv  but he can use his knuckle on the virtual keys on his phone  no problem  holding up great  stores      movies   shows plus some music  my brother is ecstatic  i m very pleased  would purchase again  highly recommend      
25,5.0 ,                       bought a     micro sd card for my old galaxy note   that i use as a mp  player and   more for my samsung galaxy s  plus and another for my mother and father s mp  player  so far so good  they re a good value  and have held up  not much of a period for an sd card to find out if it s read and write longevity will be good  but so far so good  definitely a good value as of right now      
26,2.0 ,                       i ordered two of these and put them on my phone and my dads phone  the one on my phone works great but the one on my dads phone isnt working  i thought hi is phone wasnt recognizing the sd so i tried it on my phone and it still isnt working so its not the phone its the sd  im not a tech wiz for me to know the reason why  will be taking it to a friend who knows and if it works i will update my review and if not then i only added   stars because mine worked      
27,4.0 ,                       this might be a problem with the memory card reader i have and not the    gb micro sd card itself    but  i had multiple failed format attempts with just sticking the micro sd into my reader and trying to format it  it only worked correctly when i put it inside the  included  sd card adapter  then it worked perfectly and i was able to image it with a retropie image for my little raspberry pi arcade machine  is working perfectly now  so i just wanted to mention this in case anyone else has an issue      
28,3.0 ,                       this is actually the second of three of these cards that i own  the first one started getting errors after about   months of use and then went bad within a year  sandisk has a rather convoluted return process  i do give them credit for standing by their warranty service   their warranty is great  while this was bad i bought a second one and i m using that  after   months  i am already getting errors  the product handles video and audio fine  the reason for only   stars  i d rather have a micro sd card that is reliable  losing data is not fun  having one card go bad and now a second card starting to fail  indicates a quality problem update april     so i bought this in july of      and now for the last couple of months i ve been getting occasional errors on this  based on previous experience i am trying to back this up on a regular basis  i am not using the full amount of storage  formatted capacity now shows as     gb and i am only using about   gb  i am guessing that within a couple of months this one is going to fail as well      
29,1.0 ,                       not sure if this a knockoff or not but i thought it would be a quality product   not even one month has passed since it stopped working   i went to see if i can return it and it has been exactly one month to the day and returns closed yesterday so you don t even have a month window   very disappointed and will not purchase any of these memory cards on amazon again      
30,5.0 ,                       i bought two different sd cards both half terabyteastonishingly   the lexar ones was    gb less in capacity than sandisk   i always thought that capacity would be identical when it come to size   but no   the sandisk available capacity is    gb more than the other one i bought a month ago  to be precise both same speed class        
31,5.0 ,                       these were ordered for wyze cameras the storage capacity allows for    hours of video storage the packaging is quality and there s a very slim chance that these would be damaged during shipping i ve had zero issues with these being in continuous use for over a year      
32,1.0 ,                       xc type card is not compatible with most devices  they need to say this  top it off there is a sticker on the package that says made in malaysia which means not real what a waste of time  why is this allowed  see photo  i tried to take sticker off but it is stuck on can i use sdxc instead of sdhc because sdxc uses a different file system called exfat and it works differently than standard sd cards  this new format is not backwards compatible with host devices that only take sd     mb to  gb  or host devices that only take sdhc   gb to   gb   most host devices built after      should be sdxc compatible nov             
33,5.0 ,                       the sour dough  nuggets  are salted perfectly   they are a great side for a lunch salad   my grandson  age     knows just where they are located and gets a bowlful shortly after he walks in   for people with diabetes  be careful of the carbo load   they tasted like  more   but their carbs add up quickly      
34,4.0 ,                       not a paid review  my  st ir motion sensing camera  out of the box  the english menu really was super easy to understand  the english part of the user manual is only  pp  long   i turned off the beep  which sounded every button press  then set date   time  it seems the amount of available light  not time of day  makes the device shoot pics in color or b w  in default  shooting  mode  the actually very decent  useful  large ish  led screen changes its display from color to b w   back  dependent on whether one points at bright or dim subjects   menu has a  mp megapixel  setting for still photo resolution   a separate setting for motion video resolution  jpg photo   choices from   mp      x   p   to    mp      x    p  avi video    choices from     x   p  to      x    p   regardless of which resolutions you choose in the menus  color photos   videos will naturally use more disk space  micro sd memory space  relative to identical black   white photos   videos   i m using an imac to view pics  vids  of course  the mini sd card works on windows too   i m a mac user since        all comments based on    days   nights  experience    keep in mind cameras were only ever    feet off the ground  it d be best to be able to compare it s motion sensing sensitivity to another camera brand  sorry  i cannot  i can say the device gives you feedback as you walk side to side in front of the camera in  set up  mode  an led lights green as it detects you entering its peripheral range  the actual results seem to correspond to      detection and      recording range  as stated in the manual   but that may be a little generous  how can one  easily  test that  also  keep in mind that by nature  in daylight led ir cameras sense motion further away than in darkness  in darkness  motion sensing seems to work as advertized   should be pretty good for  the woods   in daylight    mph passing cars   trucks triggered the motion sensors from    meters for sure  it seems uncertain whether that is fact re  sensor sensitivity in darkness  when the ir leds are doing their thing    i m documenting domestic cat activity  and my slinky local medium sized possum has evaded the motion detection  but i suspect this is b c i was pointing toward my porch spotlight  which wasn t in  flood  mode  but provided enough light to defeat the motion detectors at least somewhat   the camera was approx     from the light source   on the other hand  at     from the same light source  the t   captured a mouse  a house cat should trigger motion sensors every time  at night  i ve captured mice  rabbit  skunk  possum  raccoon  and cats with this camera   the micro sd slot is not so user friendly  but this isn t a show stopper  imo  if one is willing to own a device that uses these tiny tiny memory cards  one accepts the experience  just bring tweezers and hold a hand underneath the unit so you can catch it if it falls   i m using    rayovac  btw  aa batteries  but the manual states you can load   run this camera on four or eight aa batteries  it states not to use rechargeable aas      
35,1.0 ,                       crapped out after only a year and a half  and will take days to scan and hopefully recover lost photos and videos  and to reinstall software that i used to run off the card to my phone s internal memory  pretty disappointing  since i usually trust cards to be reliable for at least five years edit  after numerous attempts to recover my lost photos and videos  it is clear that the card is corrupted beyond repair  all of my data was lost  i ve never had a card that couldn t have data recovered until this one  this really is a sketchy card      
36,1.0 ,                       i order these together with auto vox dash cam because i will be using it with my new dash cam but unfortunately i received a   gb so i can t use it to my new dash cam the minimum is   gb that s why when i insert the sd card to my dash cam it s not working  i wonder why when i check the sd card it was   gb i m so excited that i was able to use my new dash cam but there was a problem with the memory card      
37,5.0 ,                       great buy  didn t use tech support since i have a job in the it field of work  so i can t rate that part  seems durable  good quality  and reads fine on different devices  just make sure the device you plan on using it for can handle that much extra storage  all devices have  external  storage limits  you can find this out by either googling tour device to find the exact specs or by talking to a tech     
38,5.0 ,                       i put the card on a card reader and looked at it on my laptop  says there s     gb of available space  so now i get to figure out how to fill that up   so why can t these card makers advertise what the card can actually store     gb is    shy of the advertised      not a big deal  i would have bought it at      but that s going towards     less than the stated     gb    can t we just be plain and simple here by stating what the actual storage capacity is      
39,5.0 ,                       worked with the nvidia shield tube tv         my nvidia shield tv storage space started running low and so the venture to get a micro sd card in there to expand it  i first bought the samsung  mb me  ga am    gb   mb s  u   microsdhc evo one  but as soon as i popped it in i got the notice that the card was too slow and i should be looking for a u  card  i ejected  put it back in but kept getting it  so thinking that card might not be compatible  i found this one  searching for the shield tv yielded results that other people had success using it with their shield tv s  ended up buying the   gb version  so i pop it in and guess what  same thing happened  so annoying  but at least this time i did get the option to reformat it which i didn t with the other card  but after i kept doing it  i kept getting that same response  the only other thing i thought to try was to reboot the shield tv with the card in it  so that s what i did  and this time it worked  so if you guys are running into that issue with your shield tv  try unplugging it to reboot and that should do the trick  hope nvidia fixes that bug  cause that was annoying  i expect the samsung card is fine too since i didn t try rebooting with that in it  now this sandisk one is working great so far  happy with my purchase  now that i got it working       
40,1.0 ,                         star for easy to install   star for easy to use  star for durability  this microsd card did not last long    i used it once and it worked great    download was perfect the second go around the card failed    it would not format   tried several attempts to format the card but to no avail didn t buy it again   advised seller for refund   received it      star for the sellerthank you     
41,1.0 ,                       this p o s  murdered my nintendo switch   my switch tried to format it  and then i get the blue screen of death   cost me     dollars and hundreds of hours of game data and saves   i am so angry at this tiny piece of plastic      
42,5.0 ,                       my moto x  was constantly low on storage space   after fighting to erase things for months  i figured i would just suck it up and get a memory card   it took several attempts to format the card so that it could be used on the phone  though i m not sure if it was a card issue or one with the phone   i ve been able to download several audio books  pictures  and plenty of music to play in offline mode   i don t have to worry about phone hard drive space any more   i m very happy that i picked this up      
43,2.0 ,                       i bought this for a samsung s  to replace a   gb card  the last card loaded pictures from the phone very quickly as if they were stored on the device  that card was   years old and i was running out of space  this card while having much more capacity appears to be much slower as well  it takes a few seconds to load a picture  attach it to a text message  etc  forget about scrolling through your picture gallery  frustrating and not going to happen  a little disappointed in that  i assumed it would be just as fast as the   gb card      
44,5.0 ,                       so i bought a cheap version  i might have used uhh one of the super off brands  it was plugged into my nintendo switch and one day it just died  so   lesson leanrned so i switched the memory on my switch  ha  i m clever  and and it s been good ever since  sometimes it s ok to skimp on quality  this time it wasn t      
45,4.0 ,                       i needed some more memory for my ellipsis   hd tablet so i decided to give this card a go  san disk is a good name and the price was right for the    gb card  despite the fact that the tablet suggested that the card was a little slow  i do not seem to be having any issues with it starting out and now i have space for more apps and documents with the knowledge that there are some fraudulent sd cards floating about  i did verify the card i received  first i used the sd formatter app  from tuxera  on my windows    machine to format the card and then i turned h testw     loose on it  while i didn t really pay too much attention to the speed  it looked about right and the capacity was definitely right on   i should have done a screen cap  but oh well   card is legit and i m happy      
46,5.0 ,                       warning  if you re using this on your android   or    phone  don t install as extended memory   use the removable drive setting   if you try to run your apps from this you will likely have problems like mic not working or speaker not working   plus your phone s apps will lag   i found out the hard way with my umidigi power   phone it works great for storing pix  music  and videos      
47,5.0 ,                       prior to purchase  i read some people s complaints about this not being compatible with their kindles   as far as i know  this micro sd card works just fine with the kindle fire hd     th gen  you first format the card following the instructions on the screen   that s it you do not really need to buy one of those micro sd cards sold specifically for amazon devices      
48,4.0 ,                       pro  it s an sd card  so it s hard to find something that it does better than any other sd card con  mine started getting read write failures   year in i may have an isolated case  but it s still frustrating to spend what i had spent on this card a year ago  to have it fail this soon it s in a phone  so who knows what kind of read write load it has  but other sd micro s have lasted longer  leading me to believe i got one with a manufactuing defect unless there are a lot of other reviews with the same failure  take this with a grain of salt  but mine has failed  so it s possible      
49,4.0 ,                       i prefer sandisk sd cards as opposed to other brands as they are reliable and have high longevity  so i chose to buy this one    gb ultra microsdxc uhs i memory card with adapter   it works fine as an extra storage device  however  when formatting it with a brand new smartphone on android      the system informed me that any apps etc  run from this card would run slow if formatted to be used in this way  long story short  i am not mounting this as internal storage but simply keeping it in the bay to move media on off my phone  i guess this isn t a big deal to me  but it might be for you another thing  usually when i buy these micro sds with adapters  they come with a resealable little plastic blister pack that the adapter can be temporarily stored in after you first buy it  this one didn t come like that  the blister pack was not resealable  so make sure you have somewhere safe to store your adapter  preferably not just loose in a drawer somewhere       
50,1.0 ,                       my friend has   reolink cameras and really likes them so he told me i should give them a try   so i bought one of their cameras  the argus with a solar panel to monitor part of the outside   i installed it and had a few issues  but not bad   camera worked fine so i bought the c  pro for inside the house   it gave me an error message when i tried to set it up   couldn t get it on the network even when connected directly to the router   and it gave me and error message that wouldn t allow me to access the camera   by default the user name is admin and the password is blank   i even pushed the reset button to make sure it was on factory default settings   nothing worked   so i tried to contact their tech support   they only work through emails since their office is in china   after a week of exchanges with them ending in them asking me to do a video of me trying to set it up so they could see what i was doing   when i told them i was done and going to give them a negative review and that my original request to replace the camera was now going to be a refund  they asked me not to write the review and that the would handle a refund directly   i am returning the camera through amazon      
51,1.0 ,                       i used this    gb memory card primarily for my gopro hero    to record  k videos  the card worked well  and i used it to record at least one hundred hours of videos over the approximately   years i have owned it  i would fill the card with videos  eject it and use it in a card reader for my computer  move the videos to the computer  erase the card  and then put it back in the camera  most recently  i ejected the card and when i put it in the card reader  it said it was unformatted and it could not be read  windows detected it as a   mb module with unknown formatting i examined the card and found it has a hairline crack in it where the  lip  at the back is  to grip the card and remove it from a camera or other slot  i am extremely careful with my memory cards   it goes from the camera to the card reader and back again  and is never mishandled or bent  i can only assume they use very cheap  brittle plastic  and other cheap materials  and the card cracked through regular wear and tear  i sent the card to a data recovery company  they said the nand chip  memory chip  embedded in the card is physically damaged and no data can be recovered  goodbye videos from our first disney vacation  pre pandemic   i guess at least we have the pictures from our cell phones to remember it      
52,1.0 ,                       update not by much since i got til jun   th to do the return  gonna kept on trying to see if it works   try failed   nd try failed   rd try worked     th try failed  can t really use a card that would fail to write    th of the times   after the  st try  the card does not show a drive letter  but sd formatter could still see it  after the  st fail tried it on a different reader   nd  rd    th time was the same reader  even thou  rd time worked  it given me read errors  so i thought i could do it again  but nop failed yet again  what a surprise  failed at  st write  refused to be formatted afterward  totally junk card      
53,5.0 ,                       arrived quickly  was authentic       gb total   wrote quickly  very quickly  i was kind of shocked how quickly  but it was a real sandisk chip  was close to around    most of the time if i remember right  but it has been a couple weeks since i have done it  but it was fast  i do remember that well i got this one through mcg bear ltd and amazon  would do it again on a sidenote i ordered more of these same cards later and they were counterfit  not from mcg bear ltd   so some of the cards on this same page are fake and some are real  check your capacity right away and make sure it isn t a full     gb for a     gb card  it should be      and    gb cards will be    gb if you order some you will know if they are real as soon as you tear the top of the package  and it will be flimsy compared to a real sandisk backing  and extract the plastic  notice it has a place that says  pull   if there is nothing to pull  it is not real  sandisk has plastic behind it is a really nice card if you get a real one  superfast  runs bulky hd video incredibly well if you haven t bought a sd card in a while and you know how to utilize one well  your gonna absolutely love this card      
54,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          so far so good it arrived in an un opened package it was      gig microcard after inserting in my fire    it immediately recognized it and found     usable space on it  its about the norm my fire has    gigs and recognizes about    gigs of usable space    so far it works  if things changes i ll update this review          
55,5.0 ,                       i have purchased   of these sandisk ultra   gb micro sd cards for use in various devices  so far i have had zero comparability issues  these cards are instantly recognized by my computer and the data transfer speeds are exceptional  i have had no issues using these in my gopro hero     my mavic air drone  my vernee active smartphone or my surface book  the superior quality of these memory cards in conjunction with an incredible value for the money give these cards an undeniable edge over its competitors  i highly recommend you go with these sandisk sd cards than any of the other less reputable manufacturers     
56,5.0 ,                       fantastic  holds so many photos documents and video  and i can have more free space on my phone   i do not have an iphone  so this is fantastic for my android  it is great quality  and you can use it in a camera  upload to a computer  laptop  etc  highly recommend  sometimes too much storage is not good  this is perfect  uploads quick      
57,5.0 ,                       i bought this to store games on my nintendo switch     gb capacity will probably be more than enough for most people  as the average aa aaa switch game is around  gb  ranging anywhere from   gb to   gb  if you plan on only buying virtual copies of games  and never physical versions  i d recommend the    gb card in terms of performance  i have not had any issues after playing for   months  i have used many sandisk sd cards and have never had a memory failure      
58,5.0 ,                       just ordered this micro sd card and it came fast and was well packaged   this was exactly what i ordered   so far no issues   like that this particular item came with the adapter   works quite well   haven t taken many pics yet but will do so soon   will buy again when needing too   very happy with this purchase       
59,5.0 ,                       this is a fast and easy way to increase the size of the memory in my devices   and the cost is very reasonable too i allows for so much more data  pictures  and videos in all of the devices our family use  both granddaughters love their tablets so they need to have lots of memory to allow them to explore things without the fear of running out of room   the saying of  inquiring minds want to know  comes to mind   the rest of all love to take pictures and document the lives of the granddaughters as they grow up and experience their lives   so wonderful and we wish that these type of things had been available when we were raising our kids      
60,5.0 ,                       i got this to replace an oem   gb micro sd card for a nintendo switch  first thing i noticed was that the oem version loads games a bit quicker  this one takes a few seconds more  nothing crucial but something i noticed  the space that this allows me to add based on the price is great  i can now install plenty of games into my sd card instead of lugging around all them cartridges      
61,5.0 ,                       edit i was just looking through the reviews and seems there is quite a lot of conflicting info around about the cards speed  so i ve done my own test the speeds i get on a      macbook pro using a decent sd card reader which i ve tested on faster cards before  and i get   mb s write  mb s readthis is on a sandisk ultra microsdxc    gb card  advertised on the packet to have up to    mb s  maybe there is just bad quality control or some suppliers are sending out fakes  who knows  but mine have all been great old review no complaints  bought from the amazon seller  not a third party  and the item i received was the genuine item as far as i could tell  been using it for a few weeks now in my camera and have had no issues      
62,3.0 ,                       this appears to be a very nice  well thought out design and i really wanted it to work for us  i was unable to get it to connect to our wireless router  however   in this process  i reached out to both chris and jack  and they did an outstanding job of quickly responding to my situation with advice   but ultimately we concluded there was some unknown compatibility problem and the immediately refunded my through amazon   can t ask for more than that   the instructions are a bit hard to follow so i ll share what i learned step by step   before starting  check your wireless router via ip address browser connect to make sure you will only be accessing    ghz  if you have a dual band router  by either assigning different ssid s to     and  ghz or disabling  ghz  make sure your router is set for dynamic protocol   save and exit   then      download littlelf app from google playstore  install  and set up account with name and password  requires e mail for verification and code        set your cell phone location to  device only  gps  for purposes of the installation       select the  wireless  installation option on the littlelf app and select the correct ssid and password for your    ghz wifi radio line     turn up the volume on your cell phone all the way      turn on the camera and wait a minute for it to power up and for the red led to flash  then press and hold the reset button for   seconds with a bent paperclip or other thin wire until you hear two  beeps       a timer will start running when you proceed and the cell phone will send ssid and password information via a chirping sound to the camera  so hold the camera mic close to your cell phone speaker      when the information is successfully received by the camera  it will make a  ding dong  sound and the red led will turn green      hit  next  on the phone app when prompted based on hearing the ding dong sound       another timer will then count down from    s as the camera tries to connect to your router   this is where mine failed   hopefully yours will connect successfully   if not  chris and jack will be ready to help you      
63,1.0 ,                       put this card into new phone and my mistake was  assuming  it was just working from day one   come to find out this card never worked or allowed anything to save to it   now i get unsupported sd card in my phone and the card will not format   tried formatting in my phone  through pc  and even through nintendo switch  does not work   after format completes it just continues to tell me its unsupported and needs to be formatted again and again   i have a samsung    gb sd card i took out of switch and put into my cell phone and like magic that card is working   i will never buy another sandisk sd card   samsung is same price but just better product      
64,1.0 ,                       item arrived a day early  however  i had to pay the postal worker extra shipping cost  the shipping was supposed to be free  lies update  i have changed my rating from   to   because since day one of use on my android phone icons started disappearing from my home menu and some of my apps were running so slow i thought at first i had a virus  nope  it s just coz this isn t a real sandisk it s a fake  i transferred the apps i installed on the sd card back to my internal storage and they magically fixed themselves  unfortunately i chose to use the sd as shared internal storage so i had to uninstall half of my apps to make room in my internal storage for what i need to keep the phone functioning without crashing and now i have to backup what i can to the cloud  factory reset my phone  and pray this knockoff didn t corrupt any of my data  thanks so much for the hassle         
65,5.0 ,                       these work well for flash carts  and san disk has never failed me yet the packaging is simple  the value for the lower amounts is always excellent and you get what you pay for had this    gb since may      and it has not failed me yet  i mainly use it for my nintendo    everdrive highly recommended      
66,1.0 ,                       as soon as i used this item  i started to get flashes of duplicate images on my screen  also  applications i had transferred to this card somehow got transferred back to the internal memory of the phone  defeating the purpose of buying it  i called my phone s tech support and was told the card is corrupt      
67,3.0 ,                       i have multiple sandisk   gb microsd cards and the   i received in this set are slightly thicker than all other microsd cards i have  i need to use them in a raspberry pi and the cards are very difficult to remove once they are inserted into the raspberry pi microsd slot  i am less likely to use these because of how difficult they are to take back out  microsd card thickness of cards that work great at       inch thick  these cards at       inch thick      
68,5.0 ,                       had mine running for more than five years using as my main data drive on my laptopi even have several virtual disk drives on it in order to run linux on my windows    rigneedless to say i use windows as a host and do all my work in a virtual linuxall the bs about these micro disk drives not being durable enouph is bs              onwards               i have another one that records security camera footage on about    camera feedsits been doing so for about   years     any problems i ever have had was windows and not the cardthis feet is completely impossible with a hard disk drive     
69,5.0 ,                       the cost is low for these memory cards but that doesnt mean the quality is lowthese tend to work pretty well in the long run for your data storage needsalways be sure to check the requirements on your device before purchaseas these are micro meant for some devices but not allthough if you mistakenly buy these there are adapters which these may slide into to allow them to be usedlike the larger regular sized ones     
70,4.0 ,                       i bought this to use with my dji mavic air  but i put it in the drone and got a message saying  slow card    the drone software thinks the card isn t suitable for  k video capture from the drone   i did one test flight with it and did record in  k   fps   the file looked fine when i played it back so i doubt there would ve been any trouble recording to it   i also have a      samsung    gb    mb s  u   microsd evo select memory card with adapter  mb me   ga am                          which i also got from amazon and is the same price as this   it does not give the  slow card  message when in the drone   i ll keep the card   the samsung card was in a tablet so i m swapping them out   i did notice that the when writing to the cards the samsung averaged about    mb s while this card hung around    mb s   i didn t do any actual speed benchmarks  this was only transferring a few gb of pictures to both cards   based on that i can t deny it s slower than the samsung  but still probably would ve been adequate for the video from the drone   it may also be some metadata label on the card identifying it to the drone as u  whereas the samsung is u   but that is purely speculation on my part   however  for the same price  i ll be buying the samsung in the future if i need more of these      
71,1.0 ,                       this card i bought through amazon  they were able to refund me but beware of what you are getting  this looked legit but look closely when i compare it to my     gb  i notice the color  font  and texture was off  do not buy this open box  amazon warehouse   that what i did make sure it sealed because someone passed it though      
72,5.0 ,                       pretty good performance  for the money   not stellar   better than a hard drive  and good enough for my video needs to get better performance  you ll be paying double or more benchmarks for  k blocksize on the sd card slot of a      macbook pro   write   gb to card  dd if  dev zero of  volumes untitled test dat bs      count                        bytes      gb      gib  copied          s       mb s  read back   gb from card  dd if  volumes untitled test dat of  dev null bs      count                        bytes      gb      gib  copied          s       mb s     
73,1.0 ,                       sandisk should be ashamed  yeah i know  it s my fault  shame on me for not reading the fine print and not noticing that the write speed isn t mentioned anywhere in the listing despite mentioning  up to   mb s  all over the listing  not only that  they show the specs for the sibling a  sd card and it is rated at  up to   mb s  write speed the write speed for the a  is around   mb s for those who are wondering  this may be fine for some  but not mentioning the the write speed when all you see throughout the entire listing is  up to   mb s  in regards to the read speed feels deceptive      
74,5.0 ,                       since almost every review i read from the past year stated that people had received a counterfeit sd card from a third party seller  i would just like to let people know that at the present moment  amazon is fulfilling the sd card orders and the    gb microsdxc card i ordered is genuine and works just fine  reporting      gb capacity  since sandisk uses the industry standard funny math where they count a gb as the same as a billion bytes which is not true  i installed it in my samsung galaxy s  cell phone and it was recognized immediately  and then i was able to transfer files to it from my local network via the android file manager  app      
75,1.0 ,                       while amazon recommends this for the crosstour dash camera that i purchased   the warranty is void if used in a dash cam sandisk warrranty this warranty does not cover use of the product in connection with the following uses or devices  as determined by sandisk    i  normal wear and tear   ii  video monitoring  security  and surveillance devices   iii  internet protocol network cameras   iv  in car recording devices dashboard cameras black box cameras   v  display devices that loop video   vi  continuous recording set top box devices   vii  continuous data logging devices like servers  or  viii  other excessive uses that exceed normal use in accordance with published instructions  the warranty exclusions set forth in points  ii   vii  above do not apply to the following  sandisk high endurance video monitoring microsd cards located here      
76,5.0 ,                       i have two of these microsdxc cards   both are    gb   i actually have more  that i ve used in cameras and such in the past   but  for this review i will focus on two of them   i ve been using them in my microsoft surface pro      edition and my microsoft surface go   both my microsoft surface s have    gb of internal memory   i got them these micro sd cards to basically double their memory   it gives me a place to unload camera files  save my rendered video files  and more   i can unload them anytime needed to an external had drive at home   but  when on the go  they provide me with a lot of extra space   also  they spare the internal computer memory from excessive and extra writes and deletes  since i put files on here that may not stay on for very long   i do keep some files on here for extended periods  but  i like to keep them free enough  especially when traveling  to unload my cameras files   all in all  i ve had many of these cards over the years   never had one fail   never a single error or issue   honestly looking at my amazon orders  i ve ordered at least    of these over the past  ish years   their price isn t bad either   prices fluctuate  so  just watch for a day or two and see if you aren t in a hurry   don t buy off brand memory for important files  stick to name brand      
77,5.0 ,                       capacity was exactly as advertised although i would recommend before you buy any card to check who the seller is   in this case make sure its being sold by sandisk the company and that it is prime approved because there has been a rash of foreign copycat sellers that are relabeling lower capacity cards then underselling the same product if you are looking for a quality card then this one works perfect for the switch and for its price is far cheaper than the licensed product by nintendo or many others   i paid over     us dollars for this so if you find one that is far cheaper and not on sale in addition to not having a prime logo on it   i would steer very clear of such products      
78,5.0 ,                       i try to stick with sandisk because they have always been reliable   i have this micro card installed in a camera that is outside   so far the card has worked through rain and snow and ice and direct sun   it has lasted and works as expected   the only thing i do not like about the card is the packaging   a perforation would be nice so you don t have to use a knife or scissors to open it and worry about damaging the card the price was good too      
79,1.0 ,                       after a few days of use in my camera  it simply stopped working yesterday while out in the field shooting wildlife  i tried via laptop and camera to view extract the images but it would not even be recognized by camera laptop  finally  i gave in and tried formatting the card  and again it simply wouldn t do that also  both in the laptop  formatting failed   and in the camera  it also failed  right now the mini card is a brick  i tried  and lost some great wildlife pixs snapped today  i might add this is the very first card i have ever purchased anywhere that did not function correctly  i have purchased a lot of cards online through amazon and all have been perfect  even when i though what i had bought were fake memory cards      
80,5.0 ,                       i got this     gig card for my wyze cams  i m not use to using memory cards  so i wasn t sure how to install it at first  a few moments of looking and it installed with ease overall  this card works well and serves it purpose  i rated it five stars  it was a little cheaper than buying it from the wyze website which charges shipping  since i have amazon prime  there wasn t any additional charge to receive the product i am amazed at how well these work and how low the price has gotten the last few weeks  putting one of these into your security camera is a super upgrade to the device s storage needs almost no one needs this much memory on a security camera  but at sales prices like these you can t pass up getting them this is a good  product and it makes your cameras  even more powerful this is a no brainer and easy upgrade for your all your home security  devices      
81,5.0 ,                       i read the negative reviews about all the problems with this product on amazon   i decided to buy it anyway  trust but verify   initially i thought i got a fake card as several of the popular test programs reported errors writing or reading the card the real problem turned out to be the small plug in card reader i was using   this style of reader and almost all card readers made before      have a maximum capacity of   gb   they are incapable of addressing memory locations above that point   these old tech readers are still being sold   they are even sold right here on amazon  once i got a modern card reader h testw was able the write and verify files for the stated capacity and the card functions fine in my compatible phone so before you assume you got a fake or defective card make sure the card reader and device you intend to use the card in are both capable of handling a    gb card      
82,1.0 ,                       this sd card lasted about    months then failed  my phone couldn t read it anymore  kept showing up as corrupt  i lost        photos and countless amount of hours of music  i have purchased the same brand sd cards from staples and walmart  those cards are years old and are still working in my camera and my tablet      
83,1.0 ,                       i spent a nice sum of money on this sd card for my nintendo switch  it s a sandisk product so i d expect it to be great quality  it worked wonderfully at first but lo and behold  with just my luck  it died on me basically as soon as the warranty return period was over  it constantly gets corrupted for no reason and decides it does not want the switch to read it updating my review  i went through sandisk support to see if they can help me with the issue i had with the card since they re supposed to have lifetime warranty on their cards  the support staff was very helpful and asked me to send a clear front and back picture of the microsd card  after doing so they informed me that the card is a fake and that it is not an official sandisk product      
84,5.0 ,                       i was looking to maximize the storage on my fire   hd for when i travel      to bring the total capacity up to    gb seemed a pretty reasonable price card arrived  quite securely packaged  that would be an understatement    i inserted it into my fire  the fire showed a card as being present  but would not allow me to access the filesystem on it  i removed the card and inserted it into my linux server   no problems accessing the filesystem that way  i copied some movies onto it  then put it back in the kindle  nope  none of the files were visible then i re formatted the card directly on the kindle itself  then put it back in the linux server where it  again  mounted just fine and let me copy files onto it this time  when i put it back in the kindle  all was good   movies were visible and playable i guess whatever default format this card comes with just isn t kindle compatible      
85,1.0 ,                       the cards i received were counterfeit and not actually    gb  which was confirmed by a few different programs that detect counterfeit cards   i highly recommend testing your own cards  or any sd cards you buy online  as this is a common issue      
86,5.0 ,                       i had to buy this after i lost one microsd card somewhere in my office  you might not be able to be too rich or too slim  but some things are just too small and easy to lose anyway  once i got in this replacement  i was able to quickly format it and add the required os to get my pi back in operation  i did this immediately after opening the not easy opening package so i would not lose another one i really only needed   gb but you never know when you re going to need more so   gb is a bit of insurance against future os bloat      
87,1.0 ,                       windows    was only showing     mb after i installed it to format  about    seconds of perplexed head scratching later  i reach down to take the card out and burned my fingers on it  ive used a few different brands  as well as a half dozen sandisk cards  and have never experienced this type of behavior before  after it cooled  i put the card in a portable reader and the same thing happened     seconds in and it was already warm to the touch with all of the counterfeit card claims i was already a little leery given the usual price in a retail store for one of these is around         i highly recommend keeping your fingers on this for at least    seconds as you toy with formatting to make sure it isn t defective  if it gets too hot  you may not even be able to touch it to remove it and it could end up damaging the reader port on your pc  it was packaged like it should have been  so i m going to go with serious qc issues rather than a fake      
88,1.0 ,                       i bought this for hopes of using it on my business trips  i set the thing up and it seemed to be somewhat working  as a note i work in it and have for over    years so this is not rocket science i placed in the recommended memory card  formatted the card  tried to connect to the wifi which this states it is supposed to be able to  and the device locks up and you cant do a thing with it  i deleted the config  set it back up for motion detect  i came back to my room and here the thing was recording all day long  i looked at the footage and man the clarity is garbage  i set it all back up again  i tried the wifi  that will not work at all  i set it up for motion sense  i tried to format the card  the device says no card present   card is present  i have to unplug it  remove the card re seat the card  plug it back in and wait the several minutes for this to come to a usable device again  and then low and behold  no card again when i tried to format  i went through this procedure three more times and finally the device thinks it has a card  it did this every day  so let me emphasize  and recap the device will not connect to wifi  the device will not stay on a motion detect setting  the device is flaky and most days it records all the time  not motion detect at all  it defaults to loop  and the last day i used it all looked good i went through the format memory disk and all looked good   i thought  and wham i came back to the room  no video was recorded  this thing was a wasted of      i want my money back      
89,2.0 ,                       i bought two of these  the first one works fine and has continued to work fine so far  knock wood  fingers crossed  no whammies  great price for the amount of storage  pretty fast  works with windows and mac computers  nothing to complain about the second one  which i bought two months ago  abruptly and completely died today  as in  none of the many recovery utilities i tried could do anything with it  it was like the partition with all the data on it was gone  i had just copied some mp s to the drive and was going to play a few back to verify that they copied ok when windows reported that the drive was unreadable and needed to be formatted  stuck it in a mac using a different adapter  same story  the drive normally has two partitions on it  a tiny    mb partition and the big    gb partition  the tiny one was still there  but corrupted  the big one was gone  no drive or partition recovery utility could see the big partition at all  they could all see the tiny partition and wanted to format it well  it ll be a hassle to recreate  but there wasn t anything on there that i didn t have backups of  sometimes years of painful experience and resulting paranoia pays off the failure has been a good reminder that sort of thing happens with  micro sd cards  they work great until they don t  it used to be pretty common  but it s been a long while since i ve seen one that died in the middle of accessing it like this one did  and that died completely unrecoverably  i ve had pretty good luck with sandisk products up until this one buyer beware      
90,5.0 ,                       these new  a   class cards are very noticeably faster when used as the os drive in single board computers like the raspberry pi b  normal sd cards are highly optimized for sequential read write  which is what is done in cameras  but a computer os does a lot of non sequential i o  and most sd cards are terrible at that  and i mean really terrible  like hundreds of times slower than  a   class cards swap the old class    sd card in your raspberry pi b for one of these and it will seem like a new computer  the  a   class cards were designed to speed up app performance in phones and tablets  but the benefits apply to single board computers as well  so whether you want to speed up your phone or single board computer  the  a   class cards are the ones to get it won t make cpu intensive software run faster  but it will make the whole system more responsive and eliminate most of the little stutters and pauses that plague singe board computers using sd cards as their boot drive      
91,3.0 ,                       to start off with if you are expecting to get write speeds of     mb s forget it  a card like this would be much higher in price however i knew beforehand this would not get these write speeds but i was hoping i could get the    mb s read speeds but i did not i only tried it on my desktop using a usb     card reader   from trascend write speeds were      mb sread speeds were      mb sfor reference it took    hrs and    min to fill up the entire card with data  and   hr    min to read it using this on a phone   samsung galaxy s   it wasn t too different  the write speeds actually droped to    mb s while the read speeds jumped a bit higher to about    mbs  please note   up to     mbs speeds   means potentially not promised however i could not even get half of the potential speed overall if you can get this card below     go for it   i never thought id say this for a     gb micro sd card     otherwise if speed is important to you go with a faster card probably the sandisk   extreme   line which normally have a gold color   but x  times more expensive i am not entirely disappointing with the card  mine was for simple use but anything actually requiring the speed may want to hold off for those people that doesn t understand how hard drive and memory formatting  work ill list the formated exfat size so you know the actual size formatted       gb     
92,1.0 ,                       purchased in december      for a dash cam  it was actually recommended on the page of the dash cam that i bought  in march i looked to play back a day  and there was nothing there  i reformatted to start fresh and it worked for a day then the next day nothing was there when i tried to playback  then when i returned to the main menu i got the message to insert memory card on my dash cam  it was no longer even being recognized  i brought it in the house and checked it on my computer and there were videos from jan  feb    th  that did not show on dash cam  but nothing for march at all  tried to reformat on computer  however it failed  it is completely useless to me  i am thankful that i discovered this before some incident may have happened  only for me to then find out that my dash cam wasn t recording onto a memory card  this is unacceptable      
93,4.0 ,                       i bought   of these based on the great reviews   my feeling  so far  the camera is pretty good and may be worth the accolades   my review is based only on having just set the cameras up  not a long term review   the setup instructions are provided on a   fold document the size of a tissue   the text has some english grammar flaws   still  the setup went fine with only one glitch   the instructions say to download the app and connect the phone   no problem there   the camera and app sync ed just fine and provided video immediately   great   then instructions then say to format the memory card in the camera while guided by the downloaded phone app   but i kept getting an error saying there was no card detected   the website doesn t make contacting the company for help easy   however  i discovered that unplugging the power to the camera  then replugging saved the day   the camera took a few moments to reconnect with my wifi   then i retried formatting the card  and was successful   caution  the instructions say the formatting will take   to   minutes    and it s true   so be patient while waiting for the formatting   the camera will go offline temporarily and the app will note that the camera is offline   after the wait  however  the camera will return online and the app will again show that   so here are my final comments      downloading the app and initially connecting the camera worked perfectly  including getting video on the app      if the app says no card detected when trying to format the card  try unplugging the camera for a few seconds  then replugging   allow the camera time to reconnect to your wifi  a minute or so   then try reformatting the card per the instructions       the camera will go offline about   minutes during the formatting   i still have a question  however   is there a way to view the camera video from a computer  or only on the phone      
94,1.0 ,                       i bought a sandisk  micro sd memory card of    gb capacity  when placed inside the phone it showed only    gb     gb were lost  when i called customer service  the person said  it was a typical value   this much discrepancy should not be typical  rather an aberration sandisk is charging customer for products that they do not provide      
95,3.0 ,                       when this sd card works  it works well   the problem is that i don t know when if it will or not   there are times when it will stopp accepting files and i have to reboot the phone to get it to work again   i even took the card out   did a full scan for errors to find and repair the errors   so far that has worked         until it doesn t   there were a few times when the card was not recognized by the phone but did recognize the sim card in the same drawer   none of this should happen on such a regular basis  but i m giving it many chances to work right and work well      
96,1.0 ,                       i installed this into my android phone  i used bluetooth to transfer     pictures and   video clips from another phone and used bluetooth again to transfer the files back  the memory broke during the time i was trying to send the files back  the memory can no longer be formatted or used by my phone  i put the memory into a different phone and it is still unable to format  a loss of time and money  sandisk is dead to me      
97,1.0 ,                       bought this item for my nintendo switch  didn t see any signs of tampering with the packaging and the card looked good  no uneven color  bad letter printing  etc    after multiple reformats and failed attempts to transfer my library i downloaded a program to test the sd card  turned out the read write rate was much lower than advertised  about     of what it should have been  and more than half of the card was corrupted  i decided to go ahead and purchase one from a store in town after returning the defective card which worked great  if you do purchase this product i would highly recommend testing it on arrival      
98,5.0 ,                       i don t know why i see so many positive reviews on their  nintendo switch  branded sd cards    you would pay the same price as the    gb non branded card  as you would the    gb switch branded card writing this review solely to help people not to be duped    unless of course you are willing to sacrifice almost double more space just for a design on a centimeter square chip that you ll never see again once it s in your system        
99,1.0 ,                       i bought this last year and was paying extra for this card even tho it s more expensive than other brand but the card was corrupted in feb      after i care back from my trip to buenos aires  i lost all my valuable picture  music  pictures and my samsung phone wouldn t start when this sd card was inside  i tried to contact them thru email giving on the warranty note but they asked me to show them the picture of files in the folder and asked me to tried with another phone and to try with another sim card etc   so many things that they request me to do  i tried to explained them that my phone doesn t see the sd card anymore and then are not even helping or replacing the item for me  very disappointed how they treat customer      
100,5.0 ,                       i had a     gb micro sd in my samsung galaxy   for the last few years  but i finally filled it with all the pictures and videos i took of my son his first year  i refuse to get rid of any of it so instead of wasting my time going through everything and actually cleaning it up i just bought a bigger sd card  perfect solution for a mom of a     year old who just doesn t have the time sandisk makes a fairly reliable product most of the time and so far it s good  i would recommend for anyone getting an sd card for their phone to go big just to avoid having to upgrade later  it s only an extra     or so from the one smaller than this      
101,1.0 ,                       these memory cards are fake ive been using this brand since they came out  never an issue  i installed   cards in   different cameras and just checked them afte thinking i was capturing footage go pro  and they are blank  unable to be rad by mt computer   i purchased sandisc rescue pro recover  and was unable to recover anything  as there was nothing to recover      do not purchase from this company  bogus counterfiet     
102,5.0 ,                       bought this for my sons to use with their nintendo switch  it works just as i expected and have had no issues to report  i have been suggesting this product to all of my friends that own a switch  there are videos that talk about these having better compatibility than the faster cards and with further homework done i came to the decision to buy this  glad i did      
103,4.0 ,                          update   my first  post was based on my new laptops internal micro sd card reader   i decided to test using my external reader plugged into the usb   port   results were night and day jumping from the initial   mbs to   mb   i appologize for my first post   the issue was the laptop manufacturers poor implementation of the internal reader    first review using internal reader below   multiple tests of reading and writing from to usb   external hard drive and internal laptop ssd   only   mb sustained read and write speeds   same result as a usb   flash drive   unimpressive and at that speed really only good for backups   usable space of the    gb card is approx    gb which is not unusual   my purpose for the card was to always have it inserted into laptop and use for imaging pc s and storing image files   however given the  slow  speed i do not believe i m going to use it for anything else but to backup image files   shame really      
104,5.0 ,                       as a proud new owner of a nintendo switch i knew i had to increase its storage size right away   this card bought from amazon and not a third party seller lots of fakes out there people  works great i think after formatting it in the switch i got    gb of usable space   the    gb card at the time i bought the    gb was double the cost just not worth it cheaper to buy      gb cards and get more storage in the long run      
105,5.0 ,                       in        i bought an ibm    gb hard drive which at the time were something in the region of      punt   or pre euro irish pounds  which is like a tesla or something now actually  i accidentally bought two of these  and i really am struggling to find a use for the other one  it is fast  i dont know the figures but dumping   gb of data onto it in one go was writing for about    minutes  i have a usb    g  reader  in a thousand years  some  alien   archaeologist is going to find these washed up on the shores of lake atlantic  and make earrings out of them      
106,5.0 ,                       i bought this to expand storage on a fire tablet  so my son could watch downloaded movies while on the plane for fall break i m always skeptical about low cost sd cards but this one is great no problems whatsoever  the tablet shows it had     gb available  i bought the      which is in line with other cards i ve purchased i put         hd  movies on it and only used about    gb of space so there s lots of room left over for other uses      
107,5.0 ,                       i used the sandisk   g flash drive on tesla model   for the dashcam   but it is full in a short period of time like a week or so   then i tried out the sandisk ultra microsdxc uhs i    gb with the suntrsi tf sd card   it works   so far that is no corruption   i think it will last for weeks before it is full   i can view the video easily on a mac or on the iphone  s plus   i have other set up before but they have a hard time to be viewed on iphone   this is very easy to be viewed on iphone with no problem   the microsd fits right inside the suntrsi card   the resulting size is the same as a regular flash drive   i bought two suntrsi cards and two sandisk microsd cards so i can swap it out when one is full when i am on the road  i am happy with this set up      
108,1.0 ,                       first off  i ordered a new sd card the sd card arrived in what appears to be a repurposed piece of the large bubble wrap   the exterior cardboard packaging of the sd card itself has been cut significantly and taped shut with ordinary  scotch  type tape   the interior protective plastic packaging that actually protects the sd card has also been cut opened and taped shut   in addition to the open packaging  the protective covering has been crushed  potentially damaging the card   it is not worth the risk of placing the obviously tampered with device into any of my devices   this was clearly a deceptive tactic   sending a very obviously used item in place of the ordered new item without customer consent is certainly an inappropriate tactic      
109,4.0 ,                       my   yr old has been playing his little heart out on mario odyssey and other games on his switch lite and i have been hitting the nintendo eshop up myself here in the past couple weeks on my switch    all of a sudden   bam   out of space    i bought a couple of these   gb sandisk cards and    tahda  now i ve got more space than star wars   very pleased with this product      
110,1.0 ,                       product packaging seemed legit enough  the card detected at the expected size  and seemed to do a few writes at the expected speed i stuck it in my phone  and it doesn t hold anything near what was advertised  i was straight up scammed  and am upset  avoid      
111,5.0 ,                       i got this as  expansion  memory for my wife s lenovo chromebook   overall it seems nice   the adapter works and the capacity shows as the proper just under full listed value   the only thing i didn t like was that on her chromebook the slot doesn t let you insert the card adapter fully  it sticks out a little   i had intended for her to simply stick the sd card in and let it stay in the machine effectively raising the innate   gb of memory an additional     gb  but it sticks out   it s not a huge deal she just has to carry it in the sleeve for the laptop and only insert it and put stuff on it if she needs to   a good purchase even if it wasn t exactly what i had intended   plus it s tiny so you could put it in a phone i think      
112,3.0 ,                       this card claims to be ideal for mil cameras which should include dash cams  however  this card requires to be formatted but for some reason win    cannot format this card  fortunately  my android phone can read and format the card    unfortunately  my dash cam cannot recognize the android formatting  when i plug the microsd to my computer  win    wants to format it but can t  however  when it is plugged into my phone  i can access the files in the microsd card through my phone  so i can only conclude that this microsd card had some internal wiring restriction that won t work for windows and only for android  it s not a complete waste of purchase since i can use this to upgrade the microsds on my wife s and my phones  but i am disappointed that this card is made so limited in use  although i can use it for my phone  it was not my intention when i bought this  so buyers beware      
113,4.0 ,                       standard for all my reviews  when reviewing products  i always remain objective and honest about the product or service  i always review with information that i feel others would like to know about the product as i always assume what i m writing will influence for or against the purchase  i always try to go above and beyond surface characteristics and input into quality  value and application  most importantly  i will always end the review with an answer as to whether i d purchase the product again which i believe is the most critical question pertaining to the item  to manufacturers  want me to review your items  just let me know i ve dabbled in off brand electronics in the past in order to save a few dollars   i keep coming back to sandisk because i know it s going to function exactly how i need it to and be a quality purchase   it s great to be able to take a vendor and their product for granted in knowing i have that confidence out of the box   this was the case with this   gb microsd card as well   granted  not much can go wrong here but it was delivered quickly  out of the packaging and in the device within   minutes of opening   i could save a few   by going with a different brand but i just trust sandisk too much      
114,1.0 ,                       decided to purchase this     gb microsdxc card for an upcoming trip out of the county  just like you i read some of the recent reviews warning of cheap knockoff cards being delivered  seeing that its a  sandisk  fulfilled by amazon and at a huge discount  i decided to roll the dice and hope for best  this was a mistake after i put the card in and formatted it  windows    recognized it as a    gb drive  awesome  i was one of the lucky ones that didn t get a fake  or so i thought  i loaded a few files onto it and everything seemed to be working fine  just to double check  i downloaded one of the free programs floating around that verify the integrity of sd cards     minutes in i received an error message saying there was an error with the card  the program said my card had only a little over  gb of usable storage  thinking this might be a fluke i downloaded another similar program  same outcome  as a final check i decided to try and copy   gb worth of files onto the card and a windows error popped up saying there wasn t enough space  this advertised    gb card is really a  gb the packaging and build quality were just good enough subdue my suspicion  i urge anyone purchasing on of these cards to run a check on it  these cards function  properly  and fool windows into seeing it as the storage capacity advertised   if you fill these fake sd cards to capacity they have a tendency to corrupt and you run the risk of losing any files  pictures  media ect  that you had stored on it  purchase these cards with extreme caution  best of luck      
115,5.0 ,                       i use this card to off site back up of key files from my mac pro and my wife s mac book air   it mounts quickly  worked at usb   speeds or faster and has all the capacity needed   i slip it into my pocket after a weekly backup  then it goes into my desk at work  in a lockable drawer  in case it is needed   very comforting to know our priceless photos and other documents are safe  somewhere that than in our house in case of a disaster or robbery      
116,5.0 ,                       there s nothing to dislike about this product  it does what it claims to do  it does it well  and is very reasonably priced   especially when you compare it to the cost of equivalent micro sd cards just a year or two ago i bought this product for my nintendo switch because the core system only comes with a measly    gb of system memory  only    of which can be used for games downloads  i love my switch  but this core memory was just not enough  switch games are smaller in file size than the average xbox one or ps  game  and i will typically try to get physical copies of the larger games anyway  so a     gb micro sd seemed like more than enough after doing research and talking to some techies  the best choice for a reasonable micro sd came to be the sandisk ultra  the nintendo switch doesn t support read speeds higher than     mbps  which the ultra caps out at   so buying a more expensive card that specifically supports that higher read speed would only be a waste of money for use in relation to the switch  i ve seen multiple people test the loading times and performance of games off of higher end cards that are technically more  capable  than the sandisk ultra  only to find that everything is exactly the same  as long as your card can reach read speeds of    mbps or so  you re perfectly fine using it for the nintendo switch the one minor benefit you would get from a more expensive card is a higher write speed  meaning games would download a little bit faster   but if you are downloading games at the end of sessions  and overnight  it would be a nonissue anyway pure and simple     and free shipping  with prime  for     gb of memory on my switch  that s a steal      
117,5.0 ,                       one star on durability  it s not even fair to ask that for things like this  there fragile as is  expect that if you didn t know works as described so it s   stars pros  it workedcons  ok it didn t brew me coffee the dog can t find it when playing catch the cat didn t care about it at all  he just slept through the discussion the wife thought it was garbage and threw it out it tastes horrible when cooked  salt to taste it s not fire proof not bullet proof either the bearded dragons lay on it  making it invisible it was arrested and is out on ppd  so that s fun it drinks a lot     
118,5.0 ,                       i got the    gb model for the sony icd ux    voice recorder  it adds hundreds of hours       hours if you use the  nd best quality audio quality   i ve bought sd cards from sandisk before  and they ve never disappointed me  i always come back to their products because of the speed of their cards  there s not much i can really say other than some other company s sd microsd cards have been faulty  but sandisk has yet to have issues with me   if problems arise  i will keep you all updated  of course       
119,5.0 ,                       popped this guy in my dashcam  it was instantly recognized  and the dashcam formatted it perfectly like all cards  you don t actually get    gb of usable storage  but that s a post for another daytransfer speeds were very fast  and the included full size sd adapter is appreciated  i ve had good luck with sandisk products in the past  so i expect this to last for some time     
120,1.0 ,                       the advertised write speed was   mbps  with disclaimers   it actually tested at   mbps  and was dropping frames while recording hd     p    video  my camera records at   mbps  i bought   of these at        opened    to test it and   amazon won t refund even the unopened    nowhere did i see the terms non refundable purchase before checkout i ve tested at transcend    gb microsdhc class    uhs i memory card with adapter    mb s  ts  gusdhc  u             the tested write speed on these was   mbps  i guess you just have to spend more to get quality live and learn      
121,5.0 ,                       this is the best micro sd card that holds this much storage  i honestly love this product  because i am one of those people that takes a ton of pictures everywhere i go and i needed this to store all my pictures  also since i sometimes do forget to empty out the cards before going out  this has made my life so great  also the price is very reasonable   because i just paid once and i don t have to worry about anything ever again  thank you so much for this great product      
122,5.0 ,                       i used this    gb microsdxc to upgrade from a    gb microsdxc card   was a little tricky transferring the information without any loss to apps and data  ended up using a third party software   free diskgenius program online  to properly configure the card and transfer information  utilizing the whole card   just transferring information resulted in  unallocated space  with a partition that i had to use the software to fix  card worked perfectly  android recognized the full size of the card and everything works flawlessly      
123,5.0 ,                       this card is a steal at the price i was a bit worried when i saw some reviews about counterfeit cards so i was able to run a program called h testw to see if my card was legit or not and everything checked out fine  i ve been able to transfer all of my switch games over to this monster of a card with no problems and when i play the games they load up just fine with no errors  if you re looking for a new sd card look no further get this card before the price goes back up      
124,1.0 ,                       sd card failed after only a couple of weeks  will not read  will not save anything  this was not a good purchase  my previous review was deleted but here it is  in reality i am dissatisfied with the way this was handled  the card was bad  did not work as intended and i wished it was shipped on time  as such i would say stay away  there are other cards and other sellers      
125,5.0 ,                       purchased for my nintendo switch  works perfectly  i originally thought it didn t work because i kept getting an error on my console when i copied my old sd to the new one using my macbook  but apparently the issue was introduced because i used a macbook due to how their files are stored on their sd format  i switched over to windows  copy pasted my data from the old to the new and everything just worked like nothing ever happened also  i learned that the sandisk ultra is actually faster than the sandisk extreme for nintendo switch  this is because the switch explicitly supports the sdxc uhs i  so if you re looking to benefit from the speeds on the uhs iii  you re going to actually lose performance by a   th of a millisecond tl dr  if you re looking for a sd card for the switch  no matter the capacity  this is the highest performing chip available to you      
126,5.0 ,                       i received the    gb micro sd card for my nintendo switch lite today and tested it to verify the storage and speed of the card using h testw  the seller was amazon  and the card is legit  i was concerned about receiving a fake card because of some of the reviews  but fortunately i received a legitimate micro sd card  i will post an update if anything goes wrong with the card in the future      
127,5.0 ,                       what can i say  i got a new cell phone as my other was only    gb and not enough space to hold my     gb of songs and pictures  i saw this and though it would be great the brand i always buy in flash drives and cards and no problems   put it in my cell phone easily with no problems   transferred    gb of music this am and working like a charm  well worth it for the price  now lots of choice for music  without deleting and adding     
128,5.0 ,                       hello i bought a sandisk sd card i have been using sd cards for quite a while now i take many many pictures and videos and sandisk sd card does not let you down it is amazing i give it   stars   if you need sd card the sandisk is the only way to go you know that you get your money worth out of it      
129,3.0 ,                       i bought four of these for use with trail cameras  one of the four had been working with difficulty but when i went to download the photos to my laptop yesterday  the disc was not readable  i tried reformatting the disc on the camera and laptop but neither would work  when i removed the disc from the usb reader plugged into the laptop  the disc was extremely hot      
130,5.0 ,                       there you have it  removable media is used by essentially all smart devices not made by apple  got that jab in early  not really though  i m typing on my iphone  the need for micro s d  cards always has me buying more and more  especially how quickly they keep increasing capacity and dropping prices like my review title states  on black friday and prime day  these things are always discounted and i take advantage of that  all the time  these are sandisk  what groundbreaking news can i possibly state about these cards  buy them on sale and you won t regret it      
131,5.0 ,                       received item on time  the capacity only received a   star due to it is low capacity  but the dash camera i ordered reaches capacity of   gb  personally i would have used a    gb micro card    star for value  in town it would have been double the price  over all rating   star  name brand well known  class    micro card which is better than standard so before you purchase an item make sure which exact fit of micro sd card is made for your electronic i had placed a regular sd micro card in my dash cam and immediately received a message on screen stating i needed a class    in which i immediately came in and purchased online with free next day delivery  received item on time and placed in dash cam   the message went away on screen and all seems to be a okay      
132,5.0 ,                       replaced a    gb samsung evo in my switch  after a few weeks of mostly gaming from installed games and transferring files for pc editing i can say with confidence this card works extremely well  the does are there  other reviews have the numbers up to back that  i won t add to the clutter  these speeds are real  i drug my files from the old into windows     drug them to this  everything works fine  i formatted per the company s recommendation and have had zero issue  this works as advertised      
133,5.0 ,                       i used this for my nintendo switch  and only took like    mins to covert for storing my digital games  now game data does vary  but i currently have     games and many dlcs patches with plenty of room still then as i fill this one up  i plan on getting    gb or  tb for my switch  and move this to my phone or something overall i am      happy and would do it again if i need it  just be sure to do your research on what one is compatible with the devices you want to use them with  the emblems do matter      
134,5.0 ,                       i love the sandisk brand name  i think it equates to quality  however  try as i might  i couldn t get it to work in my phone  my phone would not recognize its existence upon insertion into the tray next to the sim card   i sent it back  but if i had some young person to help me  because the younger you are  the better you seem to intuitively know how to work computers   then i could ve gotten it to work      
135,1.0 ,                       it s not actually easier to buy these online  just go to a store and save yourself the time and effort   you ll end up doing that anyway card dead on arrival  wouldn t show up on my pc in the adapter  even though another microsd card i have did just fine  i made the mistake of trying to see if my camera would read it   no  but the card overheated  burnt my finger  and started to smell  again  my other microsd card has no issues i got this card for convenience s sake  as well as the fact that it was a couple dollars cheaper than others in store  now i have no functioning card  have to drive and take time out to return this doa junk card  and then go buy one in person anyway      
136,5.0 ,                       i like sandisk and usually go to them for my flash memory  when i bought a macbook air recently i was a little skeptical about having such little memory     gb  given my collection of music and photos  to counter that i decided to buy this drive as a form of permanent storage for my itunes library  i had no problem copying over all of the files  over        songs  and it s worked perfectly so far  next i ll get a smaller card adapter so it doesn t protrude so much from the laptop but the card itself is great      
137,5.0 ,                       i just bought this product at a perfect time  it pairs well with the camera i bought that that has a microsd slot in it  i must say  for the size of the card  it has a tremendous amount of storage  and the price is surprisingly affordable  not to mention it comes with its own card adapter  i am happy with these purchase so far  just be careful not to lose it because it is that small   might be hard to handle as well to those with big fat fingers like me        
138,5.0 ,                       this memory card is enormous  if you have a switch  i believe this is the minimum amount of storage you should get  the card is large  fits plenty of switch games  full size and indie games  and it does not load games slower than if you had a cartridge highly recommend      
139,5.0 ,                       i ve tried the premium micro sd cards  i ve tried the knock off  cheap micro sd cards  honestly  in the space of storage  you get what you pay for  i didn t have the need for high read write speeds of the premium cards and the speeds on the low tier cards are atrocious  like  mb sec  which makes any large file a significant time commitment i found this card to be just right in terms of name brand manufacturer  storage size  and speeds  would highly recommend      
140,5.0 ,                          gb is amazing  i installed this in my samsung galaxy note   i now have room for all of my extensive music collection  severalseason of tv shows  movies  photos  and still have    gb to spare counting the internal   gb   the price for this is amazing also  pony up the    and get one  well worth it  i ve never had a sandisk die on me      
141,1.0 ,                       i ordered sandisk  western digital  brand because i was sure that i would receive high quality cards  however this is not what i got   i tested a total of         gb cards with h test  very simple storage media testing application  and found all had bad sectors  two of them were capable of holding less than   gb  one of them passed the first test but failed a second test  i only tested it twice because the others failed   i m confused about this because i normally trust sandisk memory devices  and these cards appear to be sold by sandisk through amazon    sandisk devices purchased from best buy and walmart always test with no problems  its getting really hard to avoid  fake  flash media devices online  not sure if these fall into that category  but based on my experience  i would not trust them  i returned them and purchased samsung cards instead  all samsung cards passed the test with no errors  if you re not familiar with h test  then you should download it and test your flash drives and sd cards  it takes a long time to test high capacity devices  but it could save you from trusting a bad device  just because your computer recognizes the card as roughly the capacity advertised does not mean that it actually has that much working memory  all of these cards showed up as     gb memory devices but only a small fraction of that was actually usable      
142,5.0 ,                       i bought this to replace the cheap  high capacity  microsd card i had in my nintendo switch  and honestly  always go with well known brands  these microsd cards have never failed me  unlike the cheap ones i d bought  never doing that again   and have always come through  they read and write quickly and are easy to keep track of thanks to the sd adapter they come with  the adapter  of course  will allow you to use the microsd cards as full sized sd cards in anything that uses them  which is a definite plus      
143,3.0 ,                       i keep this card in my laptop and use it to store media and backup work files  so far it has performed admirably update  i bought this sd card in may and it worked fine   it is now september  almost exactly   months  and the card is giving me read errors when i stick it in my computer or tablet   it will not reformat and when i try it keeps finishing showing full with files that have previously been deleted     stars down to     when the card was working it worked as advertised   i expect longer than   months of use      
144,3.0 ,                       purchased an    gb micro sd card while it was on sale around the holidays  unfortunately the card burned out after a few weeks of usage  the was being used at the time to store pictures and videos long term  thankfully i hadn t fully converted the collection before the card stopped working  unable to reformat  or wipe the card  thankfully he seller accepted the refund  hence a   star review  maybe it was a lemon  but be careful and test your cards      
145,1.0 ,                       this is the second one of these i ve bought  from a different supplier  and also the second one that has failed in two separate devices  the loss of the money i paid is minimal compared to the loss of the images that were stored on it  i can t get those back  i have used other cards from the same manufacturer of different storage capabilities and they have worked perfectly fine  the two     gb sandisk ones i have bought from two different suppliers have both failed in different devices  i m not buying any of these again  larger  smaller  or different brand  but no more of these      
146,3.0 ,                       dont be deceived by the    mb s speed  tested it using app on my android phone and the read speed was   mb s which is great  but the write speed is really slow at only       mb s so for mobile phone use its ok if you don t need to copy movies via usb to the phonebut not recommended for cameras that need higher write speed for burst shots     
147,5.0 ,                       i needed more storage for my nintendo switch   this card worked perfectly and was able to move all my saved files over from my smaller sd card   would highly recommend it if you are looking at getting more storage on your switch      
148,5.0 ,                       with the expanded capacity of my digital camera  i can now store many more pictures of my local government officials doing illegal and immoral things except the rampant homosexuality  not illegal and really not immoral  but it is strange how these white angry men rail and whine about it ruining marriage but they re getting railed in the dumpster out behind denny s by claudio  el guapo   either way  i can now store waaaaay more photos and videos of them taking bribes and soliciting midget hookers  thanks sandisk     
149,5.0 ,                       i bought this microsd card a year ago and it s still going strong  read and write speeds don t appear to be suffering as i take a lot of video on my phone and transfer to my pc regularly i bought it because it the great value and the fast transfer speeds and it hasn t lost any umph over this last year  i would definitely buy this again      
150,1.0 ,                       i purchased a    gb card i received what appeared to be a    gb card arrived in a plastic bag ran a few tests this is a    gb card what a hassle i expect better from amazon     
151,2.0 ,                       watch the speed of the cards that you re getting to ensure that they are correct for your application  this card did not work at the speed that i needed and had to be returned  i am a semi professional photographer and wanted to use this card as a backup card in my camera  it was slow enough that i ended up replacing the card the next day after arrival so that i would be able to do my shoot as planned  lots of bursting there are online many speed rating sites that should be looked at to ensure you have a card that is the speed you actually need      
152,1.0 ,                       i just got around to working on a robotic print running with a raspberry pi which i had bought this for  when i kept connecting to my computer and saving the coding i kept getting an error  tried using the card on my go pro  error  tried using it straight on my computer  error  i lucked out since the return window for it closed  really blaming myself thought for not initially checking when i had bought it      
153,3.0 ,                       this is about the  th one i ve had to order  they last about a year with video use on a dashcam  on a raspberry pi  they last around   months   these are not designed for heavy read write activity  and don t seem to have any built in wear leveling however  compared to other brands  these last forever  the no names don t go a month in a raspberry pi with heavy usage      
154,4.0 ,                       i trust sandisk  while i did have one card fail they were very helpful in getting the data recovered  so no complaints here  you should never buy an off brand memory card  if so  expect to be disappointed  many off brand cards are made of products that failed the testing process and as they say  you get what you pay for      
155,5.0 ,                       i needed more space  for my micro sd card able smartphone  the    gb sandisk extreme had in there previously no longer met that criteria    gb of space left on the daily not good thing  i do vlog my days and it turns out   gb spent of     p   fps videos per day  getting the    gb sandisk ultra then was a must and memory sizes are getting cheaper      by the time i bought it  i really don t  see the difference  between sandisk s ultra and extreme lineup when using it on my smartphone  samsung galaxy j        ultra s are lesser to the extremes as i ve seen  perhaps if i were video recording in  k  but i can t  with that phone  either way i ended up with enough space to spare that s  what i want      
156,5.0 ,                       works great and is a great value for money  just remember that the file table that windows generally uses only gives access to about    gb of space  reformatting differently may unlock more but    gb is total space not usable space  that s not a defect its just how memory allocation works      
157,4.0 ,                       if you are looking for a large memory card for your child s kindle fire and bought this one  it will not work out of the box the  th gen kindles will not read it as it comes  you will need to reformat the card to fat    doing this is more work than most want to do but is not particularly hard  you will need to use a larger cluster size to get it to format  i found  k to work just fine this card worked fine out of the box on a fire    th gen  and a nintendo switch      
158,1.0 ,                       i purchased this     gb micro sd card for a new motor g  phone   it arrived in   business days and the package was in perfect condition  i put the card into the included adapter and plugged it into my windows  computer  then copied   gbs of music on to the card   i tested the copy on the computer by playing a few random songs and it worked fine   i ejected the card and unplugged it  i then installed the card into my phone and the    gbs showed up in storage  but the music folder was not visible and i was unable to access the music regardless of the many troubleshooting techniques i tried   i plugged the card back into the computer and it no longer showed up as a storage device   i am satisfied with the fulfillment but the product was faulty   i am now using the same type card in   gb from my previous phone      
159,1.0 ,                       i have a   gb sandisk card that works great in my rodecaster pro  bought this larger version for more storage when producing multitracked audio   unfortunately the card i was sent either a completely non functioning card or it s just fake   it is not recognized in the rodecaster or a tascam dr    handheld recorder when i insert the micro sd card into the adapter my computer sees it as   mb    mb the micro sd card also becomes extremely hot   again this was purchased directly from amazon      
160,1.0 ,                       this products are fake  bad quality and wrong advertising  the package says sdhc and the micro says xc but they don t work as xc   i had to throw them to the garbage cause the return time has passed      
161,5.0 ,                       i use this for my nintendo switchhas lots of memory and works great     
162,4.0 ,                       this sd card works great in my lg stylo   only problem is  apps cannot be placed on sd card  only photos and videos but that does help clear up more space on internal storage for apps depending on your device  you ll be able to store apps or only photos video i paid a very affordable price for this sd card    years ago i paid   times the amount for the same storage amount of sd card      
163,1.0 ,                       i kept having problems with my new moto g  phone  like not able to download apps or taking pictures that would save to my phone  i did factory reset to my phone and long story short could not believe my sd card was the cause of the problems  it s a fake card that i had the misfortune of purchasing  not only did i buy this for myself but also my   daughters  so now i m out money for items that can t be used  i really can t tell anyone what to look for when purchasing this item to determine if it s real or not  but i do remember when i installed the card it said something about it will be slower    hope this helps     
164,5.0 ,                       i bought this for my nintendo switch lite in lu of a    gb card figuring i could save     since i will not likely need the additional storage of a    gn card  this seems to read fast but the write speed is significantly slower than the   gb ultra extreme card it is replacing  the   gb card is high performance however and the    gb card is fast enough for my nintendo switch  this card should hold about    fullsize aaa games  i needed the extra space to download borderlands and mortal combat and will have plenty of room with no forseeable need to expand memory again  reasonable for the discount on price but the extra     will get you   gb more and faster write speeds  i wouldn t use this for a camera or phone as the write speed seems a little slow unreliable    but would work fine as backup storage on a laptop      
165,1.0 ,                       it came with a sticker saying that the adapter was defective which was kinda sketchy from the beginning  i then opened it up and plugged it in to my switch and formatted to the nintendo switch and was excited but then kept getting errors as none of the games would fully download    not a great experience with sandisk and amazon  now that i m reading a lot more reviews  i might have gotten a fake or maybe just a bad card  idk  definitely returning and going with samsung for safety     
166,4.0 ,                       it worked for about    seconds and all attempts to recover the card have been unacceptable   the card is reported as corrupt by the phone  a format shows     complete before you start formatting and when it shows the format as complete  it still advises the card is corrupt  however it performs flawlessly in other devices  i have it in a samsung tablet now and it works just fine there   i m going to advise that if you want to use this card in an s  or s   make another choice of card   i am going to put the blame on myself for this because it is  after all  a  u card   buy a  u card  i have confidence in all the sandisk products so i can t give it a bad rating      
167,2.0 ,                       using on my microsoft surface  fast as the memory installed in the surface  i have a     gig surface for cheap   update             i decided to put this card in my phone for a trip and discovered that the card was warped slightly and would not make contact correctly inside the phone so i pressed down on the arc on a table top and it snapped in half   be very careful with this product because it is extremely fragile      
168,4.0 ,                       i ve had dozens of sandisk cards for raspberry pis  dash cams  phones  and other things   never had a problem until now i ordered   of these in   gb capacity  ship and sold by amazon  and opened   of them both packs didn t work right   on my linux computer the reported   gb in dmesg but    gb capacity in fdisk and when i tried to  dd  onto them it hung at    gb then i tried a windows machine with the hp disk format tool which crapped out trying to partition the device just saying  volume too big  which i ve never seen beforeeven when it did write on linux  the speeds were more like  mb s   nothing like a class    uhs   card should perform mine the font looks right and they even have unique serial numbers  although i see on the sd adapter what looks like a date code for             i got these on               i also noticed opening them was extremely hard  compared to other sandisk packaging  the backing you peal off just ripped at the pull tab so i had to destroy the bubble plastic to get the card out   also contributing to my suspicions as to the authenticity   usually the real sandisk ones peal open quite easily amazon s customer service agreed that it sounded wrong and recommended i return them      
169,5.0 ,                       works perfectly with wyze cams  the only issue we had with the first one was  after an hour trying to get it to read the bar scan code we realized the bottom of code on my phone was scooted down a bit so it wasn t reading the code  others having issues with it reading bar code  i wonder now if this wasn t the issue  but once we figured this out it took and read it instantly  highly recommend  especially for wyze cams  we purchased the    gb size after reading on the wyze website that these cams will take up to    gb  however have also read some people purchasing bigger gb and it working  but for our cameras and our needs  these work great  will be purchasing more wyze cams and so with that will also be purchasing more of these sandisk ultras      
170,5.0 ,                       my classic ipod bought it and using this in my phone meant i was able to transfer all my music to the card and use it on my phone  there is plenty of room to spare so i have been putting movies on it for my treatment days  dialysis    helps kill fours a lot easier now  haven t had any problems with the card at all and love it      
171,5.0 ,                       put in samsung galaxy s     the entire memory was there  the phone had no difficulty absorbing the new memory  it gave me   terabyte of total memory  just had to format the disk after install  the phone walks you through it   you can move a lot of apps to the sd memory  especially photos and music  giving more space in the internal memory  great solution  check youtube for visuals on installation  it s pretty easy      
172,5.0 ,                        be aware that these reviews are all blended together for this product  regardless of version seller the sd cards being sold directly by sandisk on amazon are legitimate  and are a great product and value for the money however   due to the popularity of sd cards as well as the relative ease of counterfeiting name brand products  i would  highly advise against purchasing this product from any seller other than sandisk directly  counterfeiters are taking cheaply made sd cards and attempting to print sandisk logos on them to make them look legitimate despite being unreliable products almost every single negative review for this product listed here are from people who unknowingly bought a counterfeit product  don t make the same mistake make sure you are buying directly from sandisk  even if it s more expensive  it s worth knowing you are getting a legitimate  reliable product      
173,5.0 ,                       i bought more games than i thought for my son via the eshop so space ran out quickly  sandisk to the rescue  amazon had the best price compared to local electronic stores like best buy around me  i was able to format it and transfer all the games to this card so i have plenty of room on the switch now  its been about a month and everything looks stable  good to go      
174,5.0 ,                       i bought this as an upgrade for the memory in my phone it seems to be working quite well i didn t notice any delays in speed and now i feel like i can take all of the photos i want i ve had it for a couple months and still haven t had to transfer photos off of my phone yet      
175,5.0 ,                       as someone who has had a samsung micro sd die on me randomly   the only samsung microsd i ve ever owned  by the way  i highly appreciate what sandisk has to offer in their cards  why  because it never has died on me  i have owned multiple cards over the years and this one is no different  it s quick and reliable  this brand is also an excellent choice when using it to hold games and data  for example  if you are soft modding a nintendo  ds for homebrew  as someone who uses it for these purposes or even in smart phones to hold photos  i have no complaints  it just works      
176,5.0 ,                       i use this to make a clone of a pc that i administer  i can pop the card into a usb adapter and mount it as a usb drive  it s incredibly easy and provides me with a backup of the entire machine for catastrophic failures  i still do conventional backups  but this gives me a drive replacement in an easy to carry package by the way  my source drive is   tb  but it s far from full  unlike other backup solutions i can easily plug this into another pc and pull off single files  i can t say enough about the convenience and peace of mind this has given me      
177,1.0 ,                       i have purchased     of these things over the last couple of years  including purchasing   a month ago           one of them  not sure if an older one or the last one i bought  is not detected as a valid drive by both my wyzecam and my computer  it s either fake or has failed  in any case  amazon or sandisk needs to crack down on fraud or increase their quality since the card itself is only     i m not going to bother going through sandisk or amazon   it s not worth the effort      
178,1.0 ,                       when it showed up there was a problem right away   i couldn t get it to be recognized in my computer and the product support team couldn t help   i got it working by inserting it in an old digital camera and reformatting it with that camera   seemed to fix the problem   i ve been using it to backup my computer and save some documents for the past year   now that i m   days past the return date  it is corrupt and even the camera can t reformat the card   so i lost everything on it and can t get it working imho  this is not a good product      
179,1.0 ,                       waited too long to open only to find out this card is apparently fake  won t format in any capacity on three different devices using multiple types of software my advice is open as soon as possible  try to format it  and check the details on the format for disk size  hope you have better luck than i did      
180,5.0 ,                       it s a given that this is the leading product in data storage  but your amazon price is great on this quality item   it goes without saying  that the fast delivery is always appreciated   and did i forget to mention that  prime  no freight charges makes this a  no brained    thanks jeff  you rock         
181,1.0 ,                       as soon as i inserted it into my switch and turned it on  the switch was non responsive  i had done a system update prior to doing this  so my switch was set up for using micro sd cards   no issue there  the screen stayed black and i had to do a hard reboot of it to make it cut back off  i let it sit for a while thinking it was just a coincidence  then i turned it back on and got the same thing  i turned it off again  took the card out  then turned it back on and luckily it still works  it did  however  erase my saves during this ordeal  luckily i have cloud saves enabled and was able to restore my save state i had done some research on this item prior to purchasing it for my switch  and it seems to have some solid reviews  having said that  the product that i personally received straight from amazon seems to be a cheap knock off of the real thing  before today  i didn t know that  fake  sd cards were a thing the packaging seemed a bit  off  when it arrived in the mail  the front and back of the cardboard packaging was not lined up  pictured   and the imprints of the company logo are not lined up with the ink on the actual packaging  looking at the plastic shell that it s in  you can tell that it wasn t pressed in a factory like other sd card holders  the last indicator  one that i didn t get a picture of before i opened it  was that the area over the sd card adaptor was  bulged out  and the lining around it was crinkled  you can still kind of tell from the fourth picture i included above   the top was like that before i opened it i reached out to amazon customer service about the issue  but they did not assist me other than offering a refund without having to return the original item  due to their response to my claim  i don t think they will be looking into this issue further and as a result  you run the risk of damaging your switch or losing your save states by purchasing this item  i m sure some of this product are the real deal  but obviously there are some fakes mixed in with their shipments  very disappointing update  despite the agent i chatted with claiming he forwarded it to someone higher up and that they would be in touch with me to resolve the issue due to it almost bricking my system  no one ever contacted me  do not trust a product because it is an  amazon s choice   and do not put your faith in their customer service  product quality apparently doesn t matter to them      
182,5.0 ,                       if you need a microsd card look not further  i uses this card with an anker microsd card reader for music  and videos in my car  it plays flawlessly  works in the computer flawlessly when transferring or deleting files  here s where it gets good  i accidentally left in my pocket and washed it with the microsd card in it  took it out  plugged it in and it fired up perfectly   amazing  i just knew i lost both  nope  they are both emphatically approved by dad       
183,5.0 ,                       the adapter https   www amazon com gp product b    wzooo ref ppx yo dt b asin title o   s   ie utf  psc  and this sd card https   www amazon com gp product b   jyvknx ref ppx yo dt b asin title o   s   ie utf  psc  work fine on a dell      laptop running windows     you need the adapter because this card istoo small for a traditional laptop with a standard size sd card slot  also  this card passes the speedtest that windows performs when installing it as ready boost      
184,1.0 ,                       it seems this card dosen t want to work with video dash cameras  my old    year old memory card is fine  and apparently is faster than this  i didnt think that in      i would have to worry about such things in memory card  i thought it was ancient ways but i was wrong well now i had to order replacements         
185,5.0 ,                       read and write speed is very good for me  around    mbs  total capacity i got is     gig s  the rest i guess is used for computer install  i installed this into my phone  turning it off first and mounted it  then i used my usb cable and adapter between my phone and computer to transfer movies  all went well  transfer completed successful  i opened the sd card on my phone and the movies were there  but i opened a movie and file corrupted  opened another  ditto  all the files were corrupted  after doing a little google search  i found there was a switch on the left side that had to be in the right position  i also used the adapter i had from another purchase  put the sd card in the adapter and inserted that into my computer card reader slot  problem solved      
186,1.0 ,                       so dissapointed that this wasn t compatible with my son s fire tablet update  even if it stated incompatiple  there was an option to clear the disk   download what was needed from the tablet to make it compatible  i did that  then i selected that the disk wouldn t be permanent so i could take it out  once that was done   i took it out  i dragged   dropped the movies i dl on my laptop to the disk  reinserted the disk into the tablet   voila  available streaming on my son s acct through vlc app      
187,5.0 ,                       received my    gb sandisk micro sd card on time and very grateful for all the help by amazon customers answering my questions before purchasing to ensure i ordered the correct size extra memory for my device  the micro sd card arrived in standard packaging of outter cardboard cover with micro sd card inside a clear plastic bubble and the sd reader slot beside it  my only other concern after reading reviews was a few customers received fake or refurbished  reformatted genuine sandisk cards that were actually lower capacity  so after doing research on tech sites i found a recommended app  sd insight  to install and verify both brand and gb were genuine and represented as sold  i m delighted to share not only was it fairly certain by reviewing the outter packaging all information printed was exactly as previous purchases of sandisk micro sd cards in the past  but within seconds the app verified i received a genuine product of    gb too  i definitely would repurchase this micro sd card from this seller for my cellphone and also in the future for my tablet too  feeling happy about my purchase  it arrived on time  undamaged and so very grateful for both customer feedback help and product reviews that helped guide me in selecting this micro sd card  sandisk has always been a reputable brand and will continue being my  st choice for camera sd cards and micro sd cards for my devices  so this purchase gets   stars       and a definite thumbs up        
188,5.0 ,                       good price and has been holding up well     
189,5.0 ,                       i have always been a fan of sandisk products and i have never had a instance where they let me down  the same is true of this microsd card  i use this card for extra space on my dji crystal sky display for drone imagery  i have had no problem with compatibility however  if you are looking for something with fast read write times i suggest you look at some of their moree high end cards  see images for speeds   i also like the fact that they include a sd adapter  all in all this card gets the job and i recommend for those ned a little extra space on their various devices      
190,4.0 ,                       notice  review is subject to change if problems occur down the road  never had an issue with sandisk before  though i checked online for images to compare  my    gb card and packaging look legitimate  buy from amazon directly if there s a concern about hardware piracy  this    gb model had amazon services inc as the seller and was eligible for prime so i m certain it s authentic i m not alone in reporting that the formatted capacity of the card is    gb  these disks do tend to sell advertising the unformatted capacity took me a while to get the card  into the caddy on my note   but booting up the phone after installing  i had no problems accessing data i d copied to it earlier        camera photos appear rather fast  i didn t run any professional benchmark tests but it s faster than the    gb card i was using before when loading  wow reading others  reviews  heating may be an issue  i only use the card for backup purposes but will keep an eye on it  frequent heavy use might be a concern  and given the tiny size of these cards  heating would become an issue for       seems a good deal  better than      for the same card elsewhere or even      for the    gb version    but there are times for the extra capacity that necessitate the cost     gb  or  rather      formatted  is rather nice  especially for the snappier speed      
191,5.0 ,                       i bought this to expand the storage capacity of my hp x     i can t stand that computers are leaving user to rely on  cloud  storage  i m not a fan of anything that requires subscription fees  and i m not always in an internet friendly environment  so i need to be able to take my files with me  i don t want the hassle of possibly losing a usb drive  and an external hd isn t make for really easy  get up and go  portability  having this card always in my laptop is the perfect solution  it s a sandisk  so i know it ll be reliable      
192,5.0 ,                       i think this is a fairly priced microsd  and i recommend it to anybody looking to increase the storage capacity on their nintendo switch  i have to say one thing though before you buy if you plan on getting all your games digitally you should have at least  tb because some games are    gbs or more  it will be a problem in the future  i recommend buying physical versions of the games you want so you only use up a gigabyte or two of space because it s all on the game card  so there s no need to download the whole game on the console      
193,1.0 ,                       like many others have stated these are not very good sd s  of the two i received one could not be formatted and ended up in the trash   would look else where for memory  scandisk is not the quality it used to be      
194,5.0 ,                           gb sdxc card is used for  mp ptz camera   easy to use and works well   the card comes with the adapter which is nice   the card is packed in a plastic with surrounding cardboard display hanger  i bought several other sandisk cards   one   gb card for a     p camera and two more for  k dash cams   i recommend sandisk over any other memory cards because they work and last   no video problems      
195,1.0 ,                       it s only been   months since i purchased this card but it appears that it can write but not erase any of the files on it   also  i was only able to fill up about   gb out of the    and now i can t do anything with the card   tried erasing the files and or formatting via the phone or via a computer but even though it seems that the erasing is working  the files are still there and no more content can be written   many of the memories  pictures and videos  that we thought we captured are now lost   i also tried to install some aps on the phone to verify the card but the apps are unable to read it     
196,1.0 ,                       i had this card put away for six months until needed  upon using it the past few days it was acknowledged as a    gb high speed card  according to windows   but was not preforming as such  i tested it on my nintendo switch and it did not recognize it as an sdxc card or allow downloads above   gb  on my pc  it took extremely long to upload data onto the card  even when recognized as an sdxc  against a standard    gb card by sandisk i already own  after putting in data past    gb  the system did not show any data in the specific test folders  after attempting to add more into the same folder  it recognized that the data already existed  but could not be seen by windows  man  it feels bad losing     and never knowing until past the return period  please check your products upon reception      
197,4.0 ,                       i bought this product to increase the storage in one of my devices however the product keeps failing it keeps giving me error messages i ve had to format the card quite a few times but the error messages still pops up they still persists nevertheless the card is still able to store information so for now i still use it      
198,5.0 ,                       i saw there were many reviews about getting fake capacity cards   i bought this direct from amazon  no  rd party  in jan        the f probe utility reported it is the correct capacity     gb or so for a   gb card  the linux  drive  benchmark reported an average read of      mb s and an average write of      mb s with an average access time of      msec i haven t used it other than that to comment on any other aspects  but it appears to be a legit sandisk card and should therefore do whatever you expect of sandisk cards   the package claims to be enough for     p video  but      mb s should be enough for  k security cameras as well      
199,1.0 ,                       i bought this because the camera i had purchased said it wouldn t work without the card   the camera was too complicated and not as described on the website   i am returning the camera but stuck with the card that i have no use for      
200,1.0 ,                       i bought this card for a linux pi hole project   the application would constantly hang and i d have to manually unplug the pi to reboot the pi   a couple days later  it would be hung again   i bought a samsung evo  installed the application from scratch and haven t had problems since   i decided to reformat this card and use it in my roku      since my roke started complaining about needing more memory to support the number of channels i have installed on the device    plugged into the roku and the roku performs its own format of the card and begins to make use of it   about a week later  my roku isn t responsive  hung at the initial roku logo boot screen  and the roku device is super hot   pulled the power cord and rebooted the roku   few days later  same result   have since replaced that card with a samsung evo i suspect this little card would work fine for a digital camera where there is only occasional io   but it doesn t work well in practice in a device where there is a pretty constant read write operations needed   regardless  i tossed it   i don t want any more frustration from this damned card      
201,4.0 ,                       i attempted to use this card in my phone and after five different attempts  gave up   i tried every file format  used sandisks own fat   app to try fat    tried every method i could find on the internet  and this card would never mount on my android phone   file transfers were maxed at about  mb sec from my thinkpad to the card  too   in contrast  my old  gb card transfers files at around   mb sec in the same port and adapter   so this sandisk card is either a bogus pirated knockoff  or just a bad card   it also does not have the same official seal on the back that my  gb card has   i m going to keep it for additional storage in my thinkpad  but for my phone and the main purpose i bought it  fail   i would not buy again update   i put the card into my wife s phone and it mounted immediately and works perfectly   so apparently this is a driver issue with my phone   good card for most  apparently      
202,5.0 ,                       been using sansisk nemory cards in all of my cameras for many years  only had one microcard corrupt  never had an sd card corrupt   only reason i ve purchased a number if them over the years was because of demands caused by technology  not dissatisfaction  i reccomend sandisk strongly      
203,5.0 ,                       these work really well with the raspberry pi   that s what i bought them for   used one of them for a foscam camera too   that one had to be reformatted in order to work with camera  but it does work   i like that this one is the latest version of the standard  a     i can t see much difference in the speed in my applicaiton  but it may be faster      
204,5.0 ,                       this card won t take care of you when you re sick  it won t slash your ex s car tires when they cheat on you  what it will do is cuddle your precious data like a your data like a momma koala cuddles it s baby  and protect it just as securely  for real though  i m a video professional and sandisk makes the best memory  from their tough cards all the way down to this card which i use to record in my goggles from fpv drone racing  some of the best memory you can get for the money      
205,5.0 ,                       i bought this to test out my samsung s  tablet which i got from my son it formatted quickly and has a very fast speed i have purchased various sandisk products over the years only had one problem with a different capacity microsd card many years ago when these small footprint cards came out  i highly recommend this size microsd card for convenience and speed      
206,1.0 ,                       card stopped working after only a few months  my phone stopped recognizing it and so did my computer  i tried reformatting it  but that process kept failing  i contacted sandisk customer support and they ask a bunch of questions to narrow down your model and the serial number  i guess they put out a lot of very similar items  they give me an rma   and a label  but won t send a new item until they receive the old one well  the kicker is that i sent this thing in over   weeks ago and it s either delayed or lost in the mail  the usps tracker hasn t been updated in a week   i let customer service know  but they insist they need to wait until the item is received back to send out a replacement  i ask what happens if it s lost in the mail  they reply saying they need to receive the item back  terrific it costs them pennies to manufacture this thing and a couple of dollars to ship it  i ll give them a chance to redeem themselves  but they want to stick to a process rather than accommodate a customer that has been without full use of his phone for weeks  even though he did everything they asked     
207,5.0 ,                       this is a great card   using it to actually run a disk intensive application as a portable test bed environment  far  far faster than i expected to be  doing something that it wasn t necessarily designed for   i had tried other speed class    cards that were marginal  but this one met the need      
208,4.0 ,                       it would be nice to buy a drive  and get the actual storage claimed on the packaging  the drive works just fine  however it s not     gb as advertised  rather it s     gb  i seriously doubt there s    gb of bios or software needed to make this thing run  that said  my tablet only had    gb  and now it has     gb  so  it is what it is  i guess      
209,1.0 ,                       bought this cause it said it was     gig  put it in my switch  didnt have many games  well  i started downloading all my games digitally switch said it was almost out of memory and i m like how  i have like    games   well   its a fake sd card only stores    gigs on it  thanks amazon  you suck      
210,1.0 ,                       dont buy   what a regret  took somewhere north of   hours to write     gb image    i fell asleep so i don t know when it completed but this is stupid  this is junk junk junk junk   returning   what a waste of time sandisk            returning dont buy returning dont buy returning dont buy returning dont buy returning dont buy returning dont buy     
211,1.0 ,                       i went to the site of the   gb micro memory card with adapter   it looked like what i wanted   i ordered the   pack  but apparently the   pack is memory cards only   no adapters  and i didn t catch on until the package showed up  because it  seemed like bait and switch i returned the six micro memory cards i had ordered   after reading the other one star reviews i am glad it was obvious that i did not get what i thought i  was ordering and i could return them before i found  too late  other problems i am wondering  tho  what the reason is that i will not get a full refund      
212,1.0 ,                       wrong item  not as pictured  and you would think amazon would send the right card to expand the memory of my kindle fire hd           it s their own device   my fault for letting the    days go by   busy with work and holidays   so now i m stuck with an expensive and useless card which cost more than my kindle fire      
213,1.0 ,                       my wife bought   new phones and i added   microsd cards      to each phone  today  she complained that something was wrong with her phone  i checked the storage and received a message that the microsd card was corrupt  i had the phone try to reform it and it reformatted to    mb  i checked the return date on amazon and my window closed july   th  this is the  st time i have experienced one of these cards failing   i cannot determine how to communicate with the maker for replacement       i my just look at another company for a replacement           
214,2.0 ,                       this card was  suggested to go with the garmin zumo xt gps but unfortunately it is not compatible with the zumo  it did not recognize that there was a card in the device  i even formatted the card as the instructions called for and it still did not work  i wound up taking the card out of my old gps unit and that one worked  i don t blame amazon for this  i blame garmin for not making their device compatible  they said you can use up to a    gig card but i have found that    gig is the maximum size because of the format change for cards larger than    gigabit      
215,5.0 ,                       i needed extra storage for all my kindle books and photos so i got bigger than what i thought i needed   very happy with the product capacity and is easy to use with clear install instructions   it was harder to set up the applications on my tablet to use the extra storage than it was to install   no issues loading media  deleting or using  highly recommend this product      
216,1.0 ,                       i ve been having problem after problem with getting all of my hi res music to play on my fiio x iii  it supports two    gb micro sd cards  as i ve learned the hard way  a fake card is produced by taking a lower storage capacity card and re coding the software into tricking the respective device that it contains more storage  these cards work fine until they reach over    gb of storage  i eliminated every other possible cause  firmware updates  cables  etc   of the errors  when over   gb of files are added to the card  all of the sudden the software on my pc and dap start having errors and everything freezes and becomes unplayable  once i read how counterfeits are made it all clicked  it it were simply a defective chip then it wouldn t work at all  yet it works perfectly below roughly   gb  clearly fake   i bought the exact same model from sandisk and it works perfectly  you get what you pay for so buyers beware        
217,3.0 ,                       the first micro sd card sold directly be amazon  not a  rd party  was doa  it gave a critical partition error and failed to format  i got a replacement from amazon that successfully formatted  rating only   stars due to the unreliability  i expected better from the sandisk brand but was let down      
218,3.0 ,                       when i first received the card  i was a little suspicious since the packaging seemed slightly off due to so many different languages written on the back   i used a card tester program from vconsole and verified that it is indeed a   gb sd card   however  it is advertised on the packaging as read speeds up to     mb s and write speeds being lower   the program i used to test it was only able to achieve a write speed of    mb s and a read speed of    mb s   i can still use it for my purpose  but be aware that the read and write speeds are much lower than on the packaging      
219,5.0 ,                       i bought this for my samsung galaxy note   phone and i love it  i keep a lot of music  photos  and movies on my external microsd card and haven t had any difficulties with it keeping up when streaming video from the card to my phone display  i also sometimes scroll through tons of photos in albums and have not had any lags or slowdowns with this card keeping up      
220,3.0 ,                       i have purchased   of these from amazon for wyzecam use    of the   have worked great for a year or    purchased one new microsd card for a wyzecam pan and it was dead on arrival  unable to format or use  amazon customer service was great and allowed exchange  overall great  cheap  sd card    unfortunate to have a     failure rate in my experience however      
221,2.0 ,                       the microsd was working fine for the first few months  but after the second month of being in my phone  the unit was no longer readable on any device  i managed to reformat it to exfat after the first corruption  losing game data and photos on in the procedd  however  the card corrupted again another month out and became unmountable  it can no longer be formatted  even after a full deep memory wipe  i scanned it with a partition tool for bad sectors  but it shows up fine  overall  be on the watchout for faulty cards      
222,4.0 ,                       this is weird  i have used it for a year  mostly for audiobooks and music on a tablet  was at about   g when it stopped accepting new data  deleted some audiobooks  they came back  deleted everything  they came back  tried to reformat with     osx and ubuntu  wrote zeros to the disk   my data is still there   usable and readable   but nothing will delete it or turn the sd back into a memory device  maybe getting a replacement from sandisk  depends on how much time i want to spend  my chat with support went through   sessions    please read us the alphanumerics on the back of the card   jajajajajaja  i don t have an electron microscope  or send us a picture with the number clearly visible  jajajajaja  i don t have a macro lens on a bellows that can do this  i defy anyone with their naked eye to read the alphanumerics  jajajajaja  so  if you want permanent storage   get this eprom sandisk was great  sent a prepaid usps pdf   want a guru to tell me how it became a prom      
223,1.0 ,                       this san disk is not returnable  which i can not understand why not  i bought   for the   cameras which was advertised together and i understand now that    gb is way to small for security cameras and i need     which they should have bundled together and recommend and not   gb and now i can not return them or exchange them for    gb which i could do in any regular real store like staples  the   star is for amazon     
224,5.0 ,                       i have been shopping for a micro sd card for my nintendo switch  and for a while it looked like the nintendo branded card were they way to go  after doing a little digging i found that the switch can accept sd cards up to  tb  while they currently only offer branded cards up to    gb after comparing prices  i found this    gb card which was  at the time  the best   per gb i found  that wasn t some off brand i ordered the amazon warehouse deal  so the packaging was definitely not the original packaging  it was just the microsd card in its sd card adapter inside of a plastic bag  even though the packaging was less than desirable  when i inserted it into the switch console it was recognized and i was able to format it so far so good  we ll see how it performs once i put some games on it

226,1.0 ,                       with a   gb card you get   gb   with  a   gb card you get   gb   and so on   this is not a    gb sdcard   it is much smaller   sandisk marketing is lying about the size of the  card  which should make everyone cautious about quality   this looks to be made from rejects of larger media    probably    gb    that failed checks  but could be sold for a more modest size   that would be acceptable  but lying about one thing always means they re lying about something even more important sure enough  i get tonnes of sd card errors with this      
227,5.0 ,                       others have adequately covered the set up aspects  so i ll skip that part of my t   review  after leaving my dogs and my home in the care of neighbors that i trusted for a week  i was shocked to find that i couldn t trust them  this camera was then purchased for surveillance  and it has given me a feeling of security again  the menu and the manual were very easy to understand for setting up the camera  i have the camera tied about  ft high to a post under my deck   yesterday i got excellent color pics of a delivery person  and then b w pics of myself taking out the trash early this morning  and the only evidence that it s taking a photo is that the blue lights are visible   only if you are looking at the camera  i now plan to purchase another one for inside my home      
228,5.0 ,                       this     gb sd card tripled the  disk  storage of my ms surface   for a fraction of the cost of a new hard drive and doesn t use a usb port like a portable drive   the newer laptops are relying on cloud storage and the standard hard drive is a     gb ssd  the sd card reader is probably the next thing to go after the ethernet port and dvd drive are gone as laptops slim down  but for now it s an inexpensive solution      
229,5.0 ,                       need a good offsite backup for my personnel pc at home  i was looking into blu ray writable drives but the speed was crap  besides an expensive tape system my other option was flash storage  my problem with flash is many usb drives will give you good initial speed and then after    seconds the write speed will crater  sandisk has been known for years for making quality sd cards so i decided to give this one a shot  after backing up my drive i copied    gb data to the card  at first the write speed was    mb sec after about  a minute it settled down to    mb sec  the transfer went on for about    minutes and the card held steady at     mb sec   i for a    gb sd card the size of my pinky nail i m satisfied  i think some people who don t see good speed aren t using a uhs i reader to go along with the card  i ordered a sandisk imagemate pro for      thanks amazon warehouse  for that purpose      
230,1.0 ,                       just installed this sd card that was advertised to be so fast and was very disappointed when  during installation  this warning came up saying  this sandisk sd card appears to be slow  you can continue  but apps moved to this location may stutter and data transfers may take a long time  consider using a faster sandisk sd card for better performance    not what i expected from the marketing for this card  i thought this was the better sd card  very disappointed  amazon      
231,1.0 ,                       this sd card is completely slowing down my phone making it it almost unusable  it has been happening for a while and i finally was about to reset my phone the i came across an article about bad sd cards and slow phones  when i took the card out my phone started flying again  im totally disappointed      
232,1.0 ,                       i tried to make this work  multiple times i searched for instructions to get it to work but in the end  i returned it after   weeks after online search how to format sd card i tried every option but the repeated pop up message saying to  format disk  got annoying  i went as far as purchasing a  ultra sd card  upgrade but that too didn t work  on top of that the camera kept making this  powering off  chime and it wouldn t stop  rear camera did not come on it was just a dud supposedly the camera is preprogrammed but the continuous powering off chime  plugged into my cigarette lighter  the brain damage to set up was too much      
233,5.0 ,                       sandisk microsds are a mainstream item for our household   we have multiple cameras each using a   gb ultra microsd card   after trying various cards  the sandisk have been the most reliable   if you found this review helpful  please click the  helpful  button below  thank you   p s   when using with the panasonic homehawk  kx hnc   b   simply inserting it into the camera does the trick   no prior formatting was necessary for us   five stars all the way on this purchase      
234,1.0 ,                       amazon suggests this memory card with a voice activated recorder  the recorder doesn t use this memory card and amazon refuses to do a refund  do not buy memory cards from amazon  prime deliveries are never on time anymore      
235,5.0 ,                       i purchased the sandisk ultra   gb  sdsquar    g gn ma   the card i received is the one advertised  read write speed is close to   mb s  i m using this card in my raspberry pi   b v     and the card s performance allows for the best pi performance  i have a sandisk ultra pro   gb  sdsqub     g ancma  card is my raspberry pi   b  and it runs noticeably slower than my pi   the sandisk ultra  sdsquar    g gn ma  not being optimized for video reading makes this card much more suited for my usage  this card was made in malaysia and the build quality is superb the sandisk ultra pro  sdsqub     g ancma  is optimized for video reading and does not perform well on my pi  it claims    mb s  but i was getting worse performance than the other card  this card was made in china and the build quality is sub par  and there are noticeable defects  i bought this card at a local target and it s not actually sold anywhere else overall  very happy with my purchase  this card  sdsquar    g gn ma  is well made and works well for my purposes      
236,1.0 ,                       bought this sandisk micro sd card in july      for a wyzecam and it s stopped working less than   years later  really disappointed since i ve never had a memory card fail  on any device  ever  have used multiple brands in lots of photo gear and always thought sandisk was worth the premium  never buying this brand again    the cheaper ones in my other wyzecams are older and still going after   years      
237,3.0 ,                       my desktop work mac        and older      macbookpro don t recognize this   gb micro sd card when inserted into the slot  i bought this for my sony a     camera and now the only way to transfer the images is wirelessly  i ve never had a problem with micro sds before  anybody else have this problem  otherwise it has a lot of memory and works in my camera fine  i can t seem to find much information about my problem    gb micosd s work fine  but the   gb is not recognizeable  its really annoying  i record video and i don t have to worry about running out of memory mid shooting      
238,1.0 ,                       why does amazon continue to allow counterfeit items to be sold on here  why  because they would stand to lose a lot of money if they stopped all fake items from being sold  this is bad practice  horrible chi na quality      
239,3.0 ,                       i purchased   of these cameras about   months ago  one camera has already failed  it says it is a no glow  wrong    the lights do come on and it is a low glow which doesn t seem to scare the animals much as far as i can tell  the audio recording is very bad you will be lucky to hear anything  i doesn t do any good to record audio  i m now in need of another camera and i m looking for another brand  it does take nice pictures though  much better then my older trail cam  it was worth the     that i paid for it a while back but not         
240,5.0 ,                       i believe the uhs class   spec is supposed to be   mb second   i was happy to be able to write to this card at a sustained     mb s   usually writing is slower than reading total capacity is                 bytes which is    gb    like every card i have ever had they lie about the true capacity with some explanation about why it is ok to lie i can vouch for the speed and give the real capacity of the card   but having only owned it for one day i can not vouch for it s reliability   i trust my experience and sandisk s reputation that this will be a good card that will last as long ans any quality manufactures card      
241,5.0 ,                       i purchased this memory chip so that i could update the firmware of one of my electronic devices  and it required a microsd card  since my computer had only a standard sd card slot  i needed the adapter  which works perfectly  my only wish is that the card itself came in a little plastic case like other sd cards come in so that i could protect the adapter and microsd card  instead  it shipped in a bubble pack  meaning its protection was non reusable      
242,5.0 ,                       presentation rating  dunno  if that means useful packaging  there is none once you tear through all the hard plastic   i d like a small plastic container with a surface useful for labeling of what you store on the memory otherwise  what s to say   it works fine and is worth the price  indeed  if you recall what memory cost    years ago  the value is astounding      
243,1.0 ,                       just only       months  this fantastic card just died          
244,5.0 ,                       so far so good  had this memory card for about a week or so for my galaxy s   and hasn t gotten defective on me  i bought a samsung    gb memory about a month ago  i know they re different brands  and it went bad after about a week or so later  i was so angry  so i decided to test my luck with this brand and it s been great  love the storage  my s   is packed with vids and pics of my family update            this sd card is still working fabulous and have been recording videos in  k ever since  definitely buying one for my nintendo switch      
245,3.0 ,                       i bought two of these cards a few months back  out of the two only one card works  the other card is undetectable in any device i put it in and can t be formatted  i should have tested both cards before the return windows closed but with memory cards you dont expect problems  regardless ill end up buying another brand of memory cards in the future  quality has definitely gone down from past experiences with sandisk     
246,1.0 ,                       i was not able to put pictures or videos on this device  it kept saying that it was write protected  i tried to turn the switch on the side of the adapter on and off then i tried a new adapter i had laying around the house  it still did not work  i even formatted it back to default  i tried to return it and it said i wasn t allowed  i just want a sd card that works      
247,5.0 ,                          the sd port on switches is underneath the kickstand  make sure your switch is off before installing   i followed those rules above and everything turned out perfectly fine  i think storage wise you get a decent value for the price  i love being able to keep my games installed and not worry about it      
248,4.0 ,                       bought    gb and it s been working for about a year   unfortunately  the card stopped working and i m dealing with manufacturer s warranty process  apparently these a  versions are not recommended for nintendo switch as it requires higher read and writes  the recommend cards are the specific ones made for the switch and models a  and above  the price difference is not much and i would invest in that rather losing data  something to consider there are options for data recovery during the time of purchase which is also a few bucks or simply subscribe to nintendo switch online which i did  it saves my game data on the cloud and not having to wait for process for data recovery  overall it s time and money just choose what suits you      
249,3.0 ,                       the amazon listing for the dash cam i purchased  includes a recommendation for this sd card  after receiving the camera and not being able to format the san disc card  i did some research  and learned that the use of this particular card will void the dash cam warranty  and several youtube vids called it the worst choice  i found one of the sd cards mentioned on youtube and it formatted easily  amazon gave me a credit for the returned san disc sd card      
250,5.0 ,                       this is the first and best micro sd card i have bought   it came in a timely manner  with an adapter housing  for standard size sd cards   however i am using it as storage for a nintendo switch  tm   so i didnt need the adapter housing   it works great  no problems just dropped it into my nintendo switch  tm  and played the ever livin outta some legend of zelda  breath of the wild  tm      
251,4.0 ,                       i use this in my car s dash cam  the unit doesn t support larger capacity cards over   gb so this one works great  it s my second card so i m taking one star off because the first one i had became corrupted  can t be certain if it was the card or the dash cam that ruined it  but  i ve been on the second card for several months without the same problem      
252,3.0 ,                       ordered this december          gb for my phone and to hold    gb of music and my pictures and videos on trying to sync my music      of my library won t sync  today my pictures and videos taken were all corrupt  two different file browsers can t completely pull up information or files on the card  the card says it has    gb available i m going to chalk this up as a very good counterfeit product and shame on amazon for not taking more precautions to eliminate fakes from their website  i d like to order another from here  but     i will shop my brick and mortar stores to replace or purchase all items of this nature i only hope it didn t corrupt any of my vacation media      
253,4.0 ,                       i ordered a    gb card for the black friday      sale  i finally got around to trying to use it in my nintendo switch about a month later and had nothing but troubles  i ran some tests on it and it would only verify about   gb of the card  the rest all showed up as corrupt  i ve never had any problems with sandisk cards in general or cards from amazon until now  to their credit  amazon told me to pitch the bad one and are sending me a new one  if i get a good one in a couple of days i ll either re review or update this one edit ok  so i received my replacement today and ran it through its paces with h testw  it took about   hours to make it completely through a full write verify cycle and it completed without the first error  not bad for a    gb card  this is what i expect from sandisk  i used a magnifying glass and went over the two cards closely  i can t find any difference in texture  color  fonts used  nothing  as near as i can tell  these are exactly the same cards  if the bad one isn t legit  then it s a darned good knock off  i ll leave it up to you guys  fake or a lemon  i have no idea  all i know is that i checked it out in time to fall under the return policy and amazon stoff by it  they sent me a brand new one that appears flawless and i didn t even have to return the old one  not that i could use it for anything anyway  but it s nice not to have to hassle with it so  i m bumping my review back up to a    it would ve been a    but there was some trouble  but amazon made it right and sandisk seems to have come through with this second card  my only suggestion would be to not poke around when you order a card from anyone  check it out with h testw asap  to confirm that it works up to the correct capacity  if not return it  also  don t mess with things that aren t sold by shipped by amazon  you re just asking for trouble and you can t be saving that much  if you are  that should be a red flag      
254,5.0 ,                       plug and play  i purchased this memory car for my new sony nw a   l walkman  i took it our of the package  installed it and the walkman used it    that s the way it should be   packaging sucks on this type of an item  if you don t have scissors or a sharp knife good luck getting it out  oh  and be careful with the knife      
255,1.0 ,                       had this micro sd card in my phone for   months when abruptly my phone s battery would drain and certain apps that were stored on the card went ob the fritz  ended up having to save all my videos and photos elsewhere before i could uncouple the card from my phone  all apps on the card were list  now the card will not work at all  very disappointed in thus purchase  one would think a sd card eould last longer than   months  i would not recommend this card to anyone looking for reliabilty  waste of my time and money      
256,5.0 ,                       i bought this     gb micro sd card to expand memory for my new kindle fire  finally i might have enough storage for all of the things i want to be able to take with me the micro sd arrived with a larger sd adapter   an unexpected bonus  it did need to be formatted  but i had the choice to format either for removable storage or permanent storage i can t comment easily on the picture quality of the sd card itself  because the kindle lets me choose a setting for picture quality of movies and tv shows  so the quality is determined by the kindle before storing the movies or tv shows on the sd card   i also can t comment on the versatility of the sd card  because the kindle automatically moves items from its own internal storage to the sd card  i have not noticed any problems with anything being moved from one storage to the other      
257,5.0 ,                       i hope all my photos attached to this review uploaded  first i d like to say this card is awesome  as long as you don t get a counterfeit card like i first did  the problem is these fake microsd cards are  a complete nightmare  they may be labeled as a     gb microsd card on the package but are actually only      gb  furthermore these fake microsd cards have been modified to display this fake capacity when viewed on a computer  if you attempt to copy more than a few gb of data to these fake microsd card  your data may be corrupted  say goodbye to those priceless wedding photos  the first   photos i uploaded is a real sd card  the second two are fraudulent  i m glad amazon accepts returns on these  check your card with h testw before you loose all your photos  make sure to review the seller if you get a bad counterfeit card  cheers     
258,5.0 ,                       i m using this in my s  active and have had no issues so far  the benchmark i ran have me a read speed of    mb and write speed of    mb  nothing special but performs well enough pictures are quick to take and videos have no issues  playing music is fine and even running emulators aren t a problem  although i wouldn t feel comfortable with having this card being formatted as internal storage  a uhs   class card is better suited for that don t expect any heavy use  like  k    fps on this  but for basic smartphone tablet use  it ll be fine      
259,5.0 ,                       work as promised in both my samsung galaxy note   and a k ak    even though they advertised support up to maximum of    gb only  highly recommended if you need the capacity  i have lots of high resolution flac files      
260,5.0 ,                       i bought this back in february       and as of june       it is working flawlessly   this is quite a bargain price  around      for a high capacity and very fast microsd card and it performs as well as cards     times the cost  the size of    gb is unusual  but is very high  i use it in my new dell laptop as a second  hard drive   since my primary hd is a solid state    gb  not an ideal size for a single drive  i use the sandisk as my second hd  which contains all my documents  music  pictures  videos  etc  i expect it to last many years to come  being solid state and no moving parts  but i still back it up regularly  as everybody should do  especially with precious photos  videos  and important documents   this is highly recommended as an extremely great value from a highly rated company  sandisk      
261,5.0 ,                       had for a few months so far  good for the nintendo switch  i originally got this in anticipation of playing la noire  but in game when i m driving the car sometimes the environment doesn t load fast enough and it looks like i m driving in the sky  i don t know if that has to do with the read speed on this card not being good enough for their optimal requirements  or if it s just the game  this card says up to    mb s read speed though  and la noire requires   mb s minimum  but for all my other games  like splatoon    this card is great  seems authentic  i ve used about   gb so far with no error codes  got mine from amazon as the seller      
262,1.0 ,                       i can t believe amazon is selling these counterfeit fake sandisk microsd cards seemingly directly   very bad business practice  but i couldn t help taking the risk for the price they were offering   needless to say this is going back   first of all it formats as a   gb card   i also did two tests from reputable free tools available on the internet  h testw  as well as chipgenius  and as you can see by the attached screenshots  these are most definitely not sandisk products   on top of that  it is defective   just beware and spend the extra money and get these cards from a real store      
263,1.0 ,                       the sd card looks authenticate  but looks can be deceiving  there s good fakes  too  the card stopped working in a short period of use  it would not mount anywhere  with and without the adapter  i put it aside and some time later i tried using it in my canon camera  it quickly started overheating  smoking  and melted  the back film with the manufacturing details just broke off      
264,1.0 ,                       i had intended on using this card with my new amazon tablet however the card does not work  i tried it in two  other amazon tablets  my phone  and my computer and it s just not being recognized by any of the devices i have used many cards by this manufacture but this is the first time i ever had one that was bad  fortunately amazon is issuing a full refund so i will be purchasing another card in a few days   i guess i was just one of the unlucky ones to get a bad card      
265,5.0 ,                       needed more storage space for screenshots on our nintendo switch  fit perfectly  works perfectly  and it s filling up nicely  no problems with corruption or noncompatibility  highly recommend in general         is great for    gbs  but specifically if you re looking for something to invest in for your switch      
266,5.0 ,                       i was looking to upgrade my nintendo switch storage capacity  and caught a good deal on on this card   i ve used this brand in camera s before  and wasn t sure if it would work in my switch   so i did some research and realized this card does work with my switch   i ve been using it a while now  and no issues   no corrupt data  and it is pretty fast   i ve used it heavily with my switch  and removed it often  and it is holding up great   when it runs out of room i ll probably get the biggest size next time  but it is a huge value for the money      
267,2.0 ,                       worked great for about   months but now all my videos are choppy and freeze   this was the best reviewed one i could find but i knew it wouldn t last based on all the other negative reviews   why is it so difficult to make a quality sd card   i don t understand the physics of it and probably never will  but good ones that last don t seem to exist      
268,1.0 ,                       this is the third sandisk microsd to die in my samsung tablet or my samsung phone  tried to use the warranty  sandisk agreed to replace the chip and said they would send a return label  never heard from sandisk again  so their warranty is worthless  buy something else  there are plenty of other choices      
269,3.0 ,                       the chip is fine  not amazing  just fine but the packaging is ridiculously hard to open  i know it s a cliche that small electronics are hard to open  but this thing takes the prize for most maddening package  first you need to cut open the non tearable outer cardboard  then you need to extract the chip and the adapter from the tiny inner hard plastic packaging  no matter where you cut  it s never close enough  you cut  and everything s still stuck inside  of course  if you cut too close with scissors  you risk damaging the tiny micro sd card  in the end  i had to use an exacto knife to carefully trace along the edges to get it out  there s no reason for it to be so difficult  come on  san disk and what happened to the little plastic clamshell case these things use to come in  the chip is so tiny and easy to lose  a plastic case would have been helpful  instead  after chewing and tearing cutting through all of the packaging  all there are inside are the chip and the adaptor  no case  i ve taken to scotch taping the chip to an index card so i don t lose it  there s no reason for that  again  come on  san disk      
270,3.0 ,                       i bought about    of these cards   years ago and only     of them are still working   fortunately  sandisk has a good warranty  but considering that i m not going to actually use and of the replacements they re sending me  it s kind of useless   i only use  endurance  class microsd cards now   anything else is just too fragile   do not buy these for security cameras  dashboard cams  or anything that has a lot of reads writes   they might be good for a lightly used smartphone      
271,5.0 ,                       just downloaded the app on to my android  plugged in the camera  and    viola    was using the camera   image quality and color are amazing for the price point   i bought this mainly to check my cleaning job on and condition of gun barrels   does a reasonably nice job imaging a bore   the camera fits into a    cal  bore  but the accessories attachments don t   the image of the    is certainly useful without the attachments though i read on a forum that gun bore viewing is best if you have a  reflector  of some sort   inches ahead of the camera   this unit comes with such an attachment   it also comes with a probe and a hook    all of which attach solidly to the camera to prevent losing them while in use   i can see using this in drains  walls  engines  etc you can capture video and still images with either your smart phone or your computer   it comes with three different usb plugs for versatility i can t speak of durability as i just received this yesterday   i will say i already have     worth of fun and use out if it my only criticism is that the instructions are very thin    typical of chinese products  however  it really isn t hard to figure out how everything works      
272,5.0 ,                       i bought this card to use in my dashcam  it had a   gb max capacity  and this works perfectly  considering it is simply writing video cards  the speeds are perfect for my needs  if you are looking for a micro sd card for something like a nintendo switch  i would recommend going with the sandisk extreme for the faster read write speeds  over the years  the prices of expandable memory has gone down a lot as the max capacities made have increased  i spend only around    for a   gbs with an adapter  and that would have been unheard of even   years ago  sandisk is the best in the game for sd cards and this furthers my belief in that  recommended without a doubt      
273,5.0 ,                       i needed one for my phone and one as a backup for my laptop  something small that i could carry in my wallet while traveling   the speeds are good for the tiny size   the  k read write is significantly quicker than a portable hard drive and will aid speed for large syncs of many small files the new a  rating is for iops  input output operations per second  which is to help with application performance  a  is with minimum ratings of      iops read and     for write   the  k speed numbers are many times faster than the samsung evo select  i am a fan of both companies  so just saying for comparison   these numbers will help for sure with transferring many small files in comparison to lesser models i tested both  they came in the typical sealed red and grey packaging   both are legit sandisk products  purchased from seller amazon thank you     
274,1.0 ,                       bought this card to use in a nintendo switch  after slowly filling it up with software  i started getting error messages recently  i started troubleshooting the hardware and this micro sd card  turns out the card is a fake and looks nothing like the one in the picture  i never thought to check it previously and didn t notice the differences  the card is labeled    gb but i am unable to load more than approx     gb without getting errors  after my research i ve learned that fake micro sd cards are an issue for some  rd party retailers  this one obviously got some bad stock   my advice is to stay away and buy directly from the manufacturer   i paid     for the card and feel pretty ripped off      
275,5.0 ,                       when i go diving with my gopro i tend to bring a handful of these   gb sd cards and a handful of batteries  very handy to be able to just store video on these cards and at the end of the dive trip just bring them home and pull the video off of them versus having to carry around a laptop while traveling etc  to have to take the video off while i m on vacation    at this price point why not just buy a bunch of cards like these when travelling and worry about cleaning the cards off later  they store hd video just fine with plenty fps  i also use them in my raspberry pi and they work fine for loading the os and apps on the pi  no complaints      
276,5.0 ,                       i was using a    gb card in my phone     after several amazing vacations and over      pictures later  i was worried that i might loose all of that plus the overwhelming issue of trying to organized that many photos  i decided to just put a new card in my phone and keep that one as a backup  of course the price for this was too good to pass and i think it ended up being cheaper than what i originally paid for my    gb i can t wait to see how many pictures i can store on this card      
277,1.0 ,                       installed in an ip camera for storing pictures and video clips  found that it quit working only a few months after installing it  very frustrating since i had not checked the archive storage because i hadn t needed it  then when i did i find out that it hasn t been saving anything for   months  i thought it was the camera  but when card is installed in a computer nothing actually goes away when deleted and nothing new can be written  info on card is still readable though  so i guess that is the preferred way for a card to fail      
278,1.0 ,                       doa card  delivered jan     in the process of moving it was lost then found  still sealed in the packaged  tried to finally put it in my wife s galaxy tab   tab just says sd not inserted  tried in my own tab  also not seen  put it into the adapter it came with and it s not seen  today is feb   th  and now amazons message in returns is  return window closed  so i guess i ll be eating the charge and buying the wife a new card again          
279,5.0 ,                       bought this unit half way expecting it would be one of those  fake  jobs sold to stupid consumers  ran a memory test on it and it passed exactly as rated  took it to japan and dropped thousand photos on it and even two short videos  performed flawlessly  came back and made big mistake with camera settings and lost half my photos   ran this into a recovery algorithm and got all my photos back  even ones i didn t know the camera took for reference   the full recovery proved this is exactly as advertised with full capacity      
280,5.0 ,                       i have been on the internet since the early      s  arpa related projects  and have seen tech get smaller and smaller ever since  for my cameras and quick backups i have a pile of these microsd cards and thumb drives  as do so many  there are plenty of options and i have been buying sandisk for quite some time now      
281,2.0 ,                       the product is straight forward  memory card  and works like it should  my issue is the product showed that it was next day delivery and it took   days  not a huge deal but as i was out of town  the shipping next day was the reason i went with this seller and thankfully i was staying at a friends house so they are able to get it but now i have to ship to myself again so it was a huge waste of time      
282,5.0 ,                       i bought this micro sd card to upgrade the external storage of my nintendo switch  previously  i had bought a    gb micro sd card  also from sandisk  but not from amazon  i purchased this card well aware of reviews saying they had received fake cards  i am happy to report that this is a legitimate micro sd card and it worked perfectly for my nintendo switch  i followed the directions on nintendo s website regarding swapping the cards and then put the new card  i still have all of my games  screenshots  videos  etc  and i have more storage for more games  very satisfied with my purchase      
283,1.0 ,                       i usually stick to samsung micro sd cards  either the green or red ones  because i haven t had one of about twelve fail on me  they ve all been reliable    this one on the other hand     i started ordering the samsung s because i had so many of these sandisks fail on me  in fact  every single sandisk ultra i ve ever purchased  about    have failed on me i took a chance on this one  ordered directly from amazon  not a random other seller or anything like that  and guess what happened when it arrived  dash cam couldn t recognize it  chromebook couldn t recognize it  phone couldn t recognize it    perfect amazon customer service is really the best though  contacted them and they got me a refund within the hour      
284,5.0 ,                       i found myself running out of space  so i turned to amazon  i found these sd cards which was perfect for what i needed  i bought two of these for the nintendo switch and nintendo switch lite  before the sd cards i could only have about   games now i have around   and still have space  it gave me so much space i don t know what to do with it  i highly recommend the    gb  it comes with an adapter piece that can go into a computer or camera  the piece for the switch is inside of it      
285,1.0 ,                       i bought this because my kindle fire started giving me obnoxious messages about my storage being low   i have no idea why my storage is low  maybe because of instagram and messenger constantly updating   as far as i can figgure  there s nothing that i m able to clear out to make more space   half of it is tied up in things that i m not able to access  don t even know what it is   anyways  i bought this card thinking it would expand my memory and help   it doesn t seem to do anything   i was able to transfer messenger and instagram to it  but they still take up space on my tablet s internal memory   i tried putting some books on it from my computer  but they just jump off the card and back into my internal memory   not sure if i m doing something wrong or what  but this seems like it was a waste of money  should have just got a new tablet with more internal memory   good thing it wasn t too expensive      
286,5.0 ,                       this is a sandisk microsdhc    gb card that brings an adapter  what i like about it is the ability to remove and install into my raspberry pi with different programs on each card   i work with different computers and when you first start out  a computer may seem intimidating  however with a raspberry pi and this sweet card it doesn t matter if you mess up  you can always replace the card and make it easier for you  whereas a computer you have to start troubleshooting components  the downside is  if you re not careful  these small cards are fragile and will break      
287,2.0 ,                       you get good read speeds      mbyte s  but the write speeds are under    mbyte s the write speed is what is important when taking photos and video s   not what i wanted but in fairness  they did not state the write speed  only the read speed  now i know why      
288,5.0 ,                       my new fire    tablet says it needs a class    or better sd card up to    gb  i tried two different cheaper  class     no name sd cards from amazon  neither would work as internal storage with the fire     i went to a local store and tried a u  sd card  the fire tablet said iy was not supported  when i put this sd card into the fire     it asked if i wanted to format it to use as internal storage or use it as portable storage  finally  it was a better value for the money than a    gb that says it is  tested compatible  with the fire     but more expensive than the no name cards that weren t compatible for internal storage      
289,5.0 ,                       i have purchased so many of these microsd cards over the years  i always go with this brand because they are affordable and they seem to just simply work  i ve never had any issues with them going corrupt and messing up  they just work  overall for the price i don t think that they can be beat  for the amount of storage that you get it is a very good deal      
290,5.0 ,                       using the    megabyte card in my lg phone and it works well   i had to buy my phone from the phone carrier  but it is a great phone  and extra media files can store on the internal memory or the sd card   best to store anything possible on the sd card  leaving internal storage for apps and updates      
291,1.0 ,                       i ve been so excited to add more memory to my phone  samsung galaxy s      transferred my videos to the sim card and    they re all lost   error of some sort  all my recent toddler videos are gone and i have no clue how to restore it    i m so pissed  i can t even explain  please just go to best buy or somewhere to get a legit card  or at least back it up first before transferring anything  even pictures i take are not opening up    i m returning both cards      
292,4.0 ,                       sandisk makes very reliable sd and microsd cards that perform very well  so far each card used has worked well and not having proper test equipment can t verify it performs exactly as advertised  i think everyone has various sd cards that break apart or perform less than expected  so far every sandisk card used so far has held together and not been an issue  reliability does count and i feel comfortable using these cards for any or all my cameras  there could be better cards out there but reliability is what this card stands out and i have no hesitation to try a new model when they release a faster card      
293,2.0 ,                       was having issues w a camera  replaced it twice  was told to check memory  reluctantly i did and bam this    gb writes speeds were terrible moved to a    gb of the same model  class and brand all issues went away     gb testing write speeds were  x faster now before i finish  this has not been the typical of using sandisk over the years     
294,5.0 ,                       purchased for kindle fire   kids edition  when you first put it in you get a warning that it is not compatible  but don t worry  you just need to click on the warning and format the card for use  a good value for the size      
295,3.0 ,                       i put it in my motorola g  phone   initially installed it as non removable   the phone complained it could be too slow   so i chose to install it as a removable storage   i thought it was odd considering its speed rating   i didn t feel like figuring out why the phone said it was to slow      
296,1.0 ,                       worked well when it worked  eventually found it burnt with my nintendo switch sd slot melted  while it was charging  sandisk support insists that i need to use the special  nintendo switch cards  sandisk sells  implying that they know this will happen   even though there is no warning on this card  nor is there any mention on their special  nintendo  licensed memory cards for nintendo switch   card that it will prevent your device from blowing up      
297,3.0 ,                       this false advertising has gotten out of control   i know all cards advertise a size that is  rounded up   but this is ridiculous   i bought the     gb card   my win    computer says this cards is really     gb   bullocks      
298,1.0 ,                       i bought two sandisk ultra     gb sandisk sd cards recently  and two    gb ultra cards in       on first use  only one of the     gb cards was working  and neither of the    gb cards worked  when i say a card wasn t working i mean that when i plugged it into my w   pc  using the sandisk adapter   the computer could not see it  or took many minutes and attempts to see it  then announced there were defects on the card  when the latter happened i would hit  scan and repair   but the repair never succeeded  i also tried to format it with the sandisk routine that i downloaded  but it couldn t do a thing  finally i tried several times to load the cards in my two portable music players  but the players could not see them  meanwhile  cards from another manufacturer worked every time   what s going on  sandisk  this doesn t seem consistent with your good reputation   got an automatic response from sandisk    days later   see comments  but it s totally useless  no apology  no suggestion about what might have gone wrong  no offer to compensate me for hours of wasted time  instead  they want me to waste more time calling them back  and supposedly helping them out  well   no thanks sandisk   you have given me zero incentive to help you  you must know about this problem already because there are a lot of reviews like mine  and amazon must be getting plenty of returns    a little customer care could have easily convinced me  but sandisk totally failed in that department       
299,1.0 ,                       the other reviews that this is a fake card are absolutely true   when i received mine  the everything about it look legit   then after using it  found it contained only   gb  not the    gb as advertised   i confirmed the card s capacity using the h testw program  results in pic  amazon responded immediately and refunded my money      
300,5.0 ,                       this is a ginuwine sandisk ultra    gb micro sd card i m using for my nintendo switch lite the storage after formatting you ll get a total of    gb with switch os      as of now this is by far the best deal you are going to get the sandisk ultra    gb it the sweet spot when comes to sandisk micro as card family order yesterday get today around  am i the morning i got to say one of the best service from amazon     
301,5.0 ,                       all    gb  available of    gb  tested good with several memory card testers  is working well and with better speeds than previous    gb card  so i am happy that i got a good genuine card  i called previous to ordering to verify with amazon that it is returnable if counterfeit or bad and they indeed verified that it was  so the previous reviews saying it was not returnable were likely when this card was not being sold by amazon  which at the time of this review  it is fulfilled by amazon  i will update as needed with longevity and reliability details      
302,1.0 ,                       bought from amazon and it is total junk  i cannot say it is a fake but i have always used sandisk and never had these problems before  write speed struggles to stay at   mb s even though it advertised     mb s  it also errors out when files are transferred to it  i thought it was my hardware but i now know it is not  i tested a samsung and another older sandisk and i get    mb s and    mb s respectively  and no errors  this is a crap card  i have reformatted  used different brand readers and   different computers  why does amazon sell what appears to be a fake  and i am not the only complaint  read  there are hundreds better quality control please updateamazon issued me a refund  thanks amazon  this is what good customer service should be      
303,3.0 ,                       lost data thought i was buying from an actual vendor but i don t believe so anymore the first card that i purchased was fake lost about    gb worth of christmas pictures   such a sick feeling to lose something like that contact an amazon after i ran diagnostics on the card and its capacity only tested good for    gb   should have tested beforehand but i thought i was buying from a vendor scandisk  amazon replace the card which does not look like the first one that i received they are totally different they weigh differently the colors are different and on the backs you can definitely tell that there s a difference both packaging s we re identical package the same way at first i thought maybe it was just a defective card but the way these two cards look so different i don t believe so i really believe the first card i got was counterfeit  i really do not understand how this can happen if you purchase this car please test the capacity so you don t go through the same thing that i did and lose precious pictures and video     
304,5.0 ,                       i got this    gb sd card to save games and data for my nintendo switch  it was worked wonders and it reaches the maximum speed for the nintendo switch read speed  you don t want to get a sd card that reads too slow which will cause everything to be slow including the loading of games  i have plenty of room download plenty of digital games on my    gb sd card  i purchased from sandisk seller to ensure i get a legit copy as i read there are fake copies being sold from other sellers  i would recommend    gb or great if you plan on going full digital for games without any game cartridges      
305,5.0 ,                       whenever you look at a product that uses memory cards  a compatibility guide should be the first thing you examine  at the top of every guide is a sandisk product  there s a reason for that  i have   of these cards  nintendo switch  samsung note    microsoft surface go   and they ve worked flawlessly for a long time i m not saying people can t have issues with sandisk cards  yes  i have gotten a bad card out of the package before  but it was only once  and i have bought dozens of memory cards for various needs  in that case  sandisk support was swift and easy  getting me a replacement next day with a prepaid return label to send back the defective card  you don t get that level of support from cheap off brands      
306,1.0 ,                       seller and shipping was fine  my problem was one of the micros memory cards would not work  would not format and you couldn t save anything to it  i contacted sandisk directly because they advertised a life time warrany after numerous emails and photos they wanted along with receipts and packaging they then asked for more photos of the micro sd card because they said the ones i sent were unreadable  i checked the email i sent and the photos looked just fine  after a few of these requests i realized they were just making me jump through hoop after hoop so i told them to forget it  i just won t ever by anything made by sandisk again      
307,5.0 ,                       i got the sd card a week before the lets go pikachu switch bundle came out for my new switch because there are some games you can only get by downloading so i m glad i have a lot of space in the beginning im happy with the item so far  i downloaded   games fortnite lets go pikachu and ff   pocket edition all run great off the sd card      
308,3.0 ,                       i have always loved sandisk products   i choose to populate my   security cameras with the    gb ultra micro sd cards   well i made a mistake   six of the nine micro sd cards failed last week   weird     well  it turns out that sandisk does not warranty this retail card in security cameras   i purchased from amazon i read everything included in the product description and i don t remember seeing not to use in security cameras   sure enough it does say that on the warranty page on their website now   anyway the cards are   months old and are bricked due to a limited number of writes hope this helps some in the future gadget     
309,5.0 ,                       i won the counterfeit  lottery  and actually got a genuine card   yes  this is a known issue with sd cards at amazon   anyway   this works just fine in a nintendo switch  it recognizes the entire capacity of the card  upon inserting it  it will prompt for an update  which is grabbing the exfat driver and license for the techies  the format that nintendo switch uses is exfat filesystem with    kb sectors transferring your existing files is easy if you re coming from an existing sd card in your switch  you just copy the contents of your old sd card s root to some folder on a pc  then format this new    gb microsdxc card either in the switch or on a pc  exfat with    kb sectors   then copy the root contents of the old sd card onto this new one the    gb card  as of this review  is the best bang for buck card on the market right now  considering the only size bigger is    gb and that card goes for   times the price      
310,3.0 ,                       had this thing in my lg g  and it was great for    months  well i started getting extremely long  saving  window times pop up  then my youtube videos to upload started becoming non accessible as well as stopping in the middle of playing from phone  was able to transfer most of the photos and videos from the phone  i tried formatting the disk from my phone and it did complete but didn t delete anything  i couldn t even manually delete the data to try formatting it fresh  tried putting it into my laptop and it states no disk found  could because of different format but wasn t able to format through pc either  really sucks  lost the end video to a rebuild i was doing for my youtube channel  smh  one of those things that you can t get back      
311,5.0 ,                       i thought    gb would have been more than enough for the lifetime of my nintendo switch but apparently not  i decided to just upgrade to the    gb so i won t have to worry about space on the switch for a while i transferred all of my files through my computer and although it took a while  it transferred fairly easily i ve used sandisk flash drives and memory cards for years now and have always appreciated the quality of product they put out  i wouldn t likely use a card this big for my mirrorless camera unless i was going to shoot a lot of  k but normally i don t like having large capacity cards with too many of my photos on them so far it s worked great and i think the price was actually pretty reasonable so it s never been a problem for me to hesitate sandisk products      
312,1.0 ,                       it was neatly packaged  the plastic had to be cut open and isn t resealable  it reads as     gb  which seems normal  it know the usuable space is slightly small for functional purpose  etc  i tried putting a    mb file  so far it reads back on laptopedit  i did a test today via flashdrivetester exe and it read as fake    i am sad and want a refund      
313,4.0 ,                       this card is advertised as    mb second  the first thing i did was to run h testw  free app  everyone should always do this on new cards to spot fakes  h testw reports   mb s read    mb s write which is a bit disappointing  see screenshot attached   the card is    g  which is normal for a    g card  so i don t have a problem with that it s worth noting that i ran the test by plugging the card in using the adapter it came with  and a brand new dell xps i  pc with   g memory and usb c  so the   mb s is totally on the card this card will still work for my uses  in a dash camera  so i m keeping it and giving it   stars      
314,3.0 ,                       in my dell pc i was getting a slow transfer speed with sd cards  it was reading at   mb s to    mb s  but the card is advertised at   mb s  this is with an sd card reader built into the dell pc  i tried the following steps    disabled antivirus   still   mb s to   mb s   dell website   updated realtek card reader driver for my model  still   mb s to   mb s   device manager   disk drives   sdhc card   policies   better performance    mb s to   mb s   realtek website   updated card reader driver    mb s to   mb sso the answer was to download and update the realtek card reader driver directly from realtek s website  this increased the average speed a lot but it is still slower than it should be  the next thing to try is to buy a usb sd card reader and try it in a high speed usb port and see if the read speeds are faster oh  by the way  step   above is potentially dangerous  instead of leaving it on  better performance  you probably want to keep it at  quick removal  otherwise you might lose data  i think any speed increase with  better performance  could possibly be fake anyway because windows might say that it is done transferring but it could still be transferring data in the background      
315,1.0 ,                       i ve had nothing but problems with this card  first  i formatted it and then my phone wouldn t read it  so i re formatted it   same problem  so i bought a brand new phone within two weeks  my new phone reported to me that the card was corrupted and switched to read only   now  i cannot pull my photos  videos  and data off the card if you are reading this  save yourself the money and hours of trouble and do not purchase this card from this seller      
316,1.0 ,                       i have had two separate     gb cards fail  one i received never worked and would just  overheat  when plugged into a device  the other one just up and failed one day  the card was not able to be recognized at a hardware or software level  please note i used multiple readers  devices  oses  etc     i am aware that  counterfeit cards are prevalent but upon examination both cards appeared to be genuine      
317,1.0 ,                       this card works about     of the time with my switch  but whenever a game installed on the sd card needs an update  or currently when i try to download a new game onto it  i get nothing but the most vague and irritating errors preventing play  i ve had to reformat the card several times  meaning i ve had to redownload all my games over and over again  but still get issues weeks apart it looks like the seller is to blame  i find out later after checking back it s some crook with a     trust rating  i m surprised amazon lets sellers like this use their platform  i m not the only one who experienced issues with this seller s micro sd cards      
318,5.0 ,                       i bought the     gb version on prime day for      it was an incredible deal  i tested the card on my laptop prior to using it on my switch  it s definitely      legit  now i can carry a aaa and smaller titles on my nintendo switch with me  i didn t test out the read and write speeds  but it fast enough for what i m using it for  if you re looking to use it with something like a digital camera  and need fast read write speeds  i would probably look at other reviews  but for something like  nintendo switch  it was perfect  i think even at the regular     price  it s still worth it  imo      
319,5.0 ,                       it may say    gb  but upon inserting it into my nintendo switch it comes out to    gb even with the disparity between listed capacity and demonstrable capacity  it is the largest microsd you can get as of right now  nov            it is actually baffling holding this miniscule memory card in my hand  my desktop hard drive from    years ago is literally hundreds of times larger in mass  but only    gb larger          in storage capacity  this thing can hold almost half a terabyte and i could fit it up my nose  it s otherworldly i noticed it loads games slightly slower than the internal storage on nintendo switch  but the difference is basically negligible  tested with fortnite and warframe and completely forgot about the difference in load times after a few minutes when i stopped paying attention  though with the latter it does use a lot of  asset streaming  in particular textures  which will appear blurry for a noticably longer time upon appearing on screen  again  a negligible sacrifice all things considered i cannot recommend this microsd enough  this is  the  microsd to get  and will be until sandisk or samsung or some other manufacturer finally gets    gb working      
320,5.0 ,                       i ve purchased many of these memories  perhaps     over the last five or so years  they have always worked and continue to do so even now  a few of them have been used in outdoor security cameras in    f arizona heat without failure  i have never done a read write speed measurement  but i ve never encountered any obvious slow downs  the prices of these memories have continued to drop significantly since my original purchases  i will definitely continue to use these memory devices  highly recommended      
321,5.0 ,                       i have owned several drones over the years and some have been better than others  but this drone stands out for a few reasons  it s ease of operation and navigation is outstanding  a young child can operate this drone while adults like myself still get the thrill out of flying  plus the whole platform flys so steady that the video is clear and doesn t have that telltale vibration to the picture  steady and clear with plenty of video storage space  i will order more of these and i highly recommend this drone to anyone who wants to fly one  value for the buck is great  quality is awesome  and you can t beat the customer support and service      
322,5.0 ,                       it s a reliable brand and gets the job done  bought this one for my camera and one for my nintendo ds  they work fine and can be formatted too  definitely recommend it      
323,3.0 ,                       summation  card was affordable and i liked the additional storage on my phone  however  both both cards have failed after   years of  normal  use  it is probably easier to just buy a new sd card and move on     i purchased two of these sd cards in         to expand the storage in two moto g  phones  one card was more  heavily  utilized as i moved what apps i could  facebook  fitbit  instagram  to sd storage  as well as music from amazon  the other sd card was not used as much and was just there in case more storage was needed i had issues with my phone that drove me to reset the phone and reformat the sd card several times  after the last reload  i was advised not use the sd card and that was determined to be the problem i completed an rma on the card  honestly  it would have been easier to buy a new sd card rather than go through the rma process  sandisk support verifies the card is dead with you  then you mail it back to them and they send you a new one a few weeks later  i appreciate the warranty support of course overall  it is a good product  you should just expect to buy a replacement or upgrade within a few years apparently      
324,1.0 ,                       i ve used scandisk products for many years and most have been great this one was not i copied     gig of data over to it from varying sources  this took quite a while   it was not the speediest card i ve worked with   again  i ve owned many   this was a slow card in comparison the plan was to then go thru all the files and make sense of everything instead of having my data on     different cards   it was supposed to be a simple solution once all the data was in place  and it showed that it was in place  i was to get to work the next day i fire up my computer  insert the card and poof   nothing   a message pops up stating that the card needs to be formatted  huh   i do a number of test  nothing   i try different operating systems on different units i work with   typically a linux machine fixes everything but not this time   so i then run a disk evaluation and it says again  that this card needed to be formatted and that it had    meg of memory yes  meg  not gig i then contact amazon support  which was awesome by the way via chat they didn t even flinch and said to return it for a full refund that should be enough of a red flag to just avoid this card just get a big usb stick or an external drive for data solutions   if this would be for a camera  tablet  phone or whatever  just get a             they work fine this one did not      
325,2.0 ,                       ever since i installed it  the phone gave me error message saying it was not going to have a satisfactory speed  this was my phone s message    that message appeared for a few days until it suddenly disappeared   then  my pictures started having problems    randomly they would get ruined  with lines in the middle or you would just see half of the picture  they would get broken   in thumbnail size in my gallery they seemed normal  but once i opened them they would open with the defects   i formatted the card and it fixed for a while  but the problem returned a month later when i was taking pictures at an event   i ve lost many pictures   not recommended      
326,5.0 ,                       this is a nice micro sd card to have  i am using it in a wireless security camera which is located outside  as such  the micro sd card does not seem to have any issues working in cold temps  i ve been using it for about a month now where the camera is constantly creating the video recordings    hours a day  thus  i believe that this is good solid product to have if you are looking for a micro   mini sd card for basic use      
327,5.0 ,                       i have the new a    duo viofo dashcam   have actually had it installed   months now   i got this card for it early on and after   months  including many hot and humid days during the summer for weeks on end  the dashcam and more specifically this card have held up   it provides me more recording time than i can ask for and has never failed me once you can now trust sandisk ultra cards in your dashcam but make sure they are a  branded      
328,5.0 ,                       about the card itself  this is a solid value at the regular price  and even better when it is on a deal  works well as an sd card in my samsung phones for amazon  amazon delivered it next day  that was great  but look at the size of the shipping envelope compared to the size of the item   not sure if amazon is running out of envelopes in the right size  or they can t stock the work desk at the pace the workers need to go      
329,1.0 ,                       card arrived today  card could not be read by anything  needed formatting    my camera could not format it    default windows format function could not format it   the format did not complete succesfully    virtual disk manager could not format it   windows was unable to complete the format    the disk shows as    mb    i cleared the disk of any readonly attributes  in case that was the issue   issues persisted sandisk return policy doesn t allow returns for this item   contacted amazon  they were very helpful and provided a full refund   all of the recent reviews  per my default view  read like this one   sandisk should strongly consider getting quality control involved to verify  there appears to be a trend here      
330,5.0 ,                       bought for extended storage for my nintendo switch  i ve been using sandisk products for years with no issues  so it s a brand that i trust for my needs  this works great in the nintendo switch  and the price was a great value for the storage size  two thumbs up      
331,5.0 ,                       i don t know what happened  i normally have excellent experiences with sandisk  all my sd cards are the same brand  but this one sucks      gb   everytime time i try to transfer files into the card  the loading times are extremely slow and they always seem to freeze around         and i m talking about a  gb transfer  something that i can do with my  gb card in less than   minutes  i would return this product but i dont think its eligible anymore  so i m stuck with a  useless card  again this is not my general experience with sandisk  just this purchase in particularupdategot a replacement today and there s a huge difference  now i m      sure that the previous one was defective  no lag  no crashes  it works perfectly fine     
332,1.0 ,                       worked  until it failed after   months   wrote customer service  it s only a    item but i assumed a quick email will get me a replacement  not so   first  i had to fill a long form and submit evidence     then i was contacted with a request for additional information     i said most of the information has been submitted  but the answer was that the information on the submission is not available to the representative  imagine the incompetence        then i was asked for a zoom image of this nail size item  to capture the item number  which is not there at all  but was in my receipt    at this point i said  enough  send me a replacement or forget it      to which the answer was  can t  company policy    i have never encountered such customer hostile service  and what kind of company would not give its service representatives  permission to use their judgement and waive the rules on    items       
333,3.0 ,                       the card i received wasn t formatted  fortunately i m familiar enough with my operating system to review partition information and format it with a exfat file system  but were i less familiar with this operation  it would have appeared to be doa so if anyone from sandisk reads these things    at least once there was a glitch in the production process      
334,3.0 ,                       i purchased this in october       it has worked great until november      when the card quit allowing data to be written  i was unable reformat   fix sd using mac disk utility  i was not given notice of corrupted sectors until it was too late to do anything with this product  i was using this card in a micro usb slot for my macbook to increase my available storage      
335,5.0 ,                       man for the price  it just doesn t get any better  i am using this on the new s   ultra and it can handle what i typically shoot at with no issue keep in mind  for a phone of this caliber  there are a few caveats with this memory card   namely the read and write speeds  it cannot handle  k  p or  k  for this you may need a card label as an  a   which is meant for superior read and write speeds and fast enough for transferring apps and running applications right from the card however  as a storage option for pictures or videos that are at  k    i had absolutely no issues  the card can keep going and i had no problems having it format inside the phone and then within seconds i was able to backup pictures it also works great for the nintendo switch  so if you need substantial storage for cheap  this is your card at the time i purchased the card  i believe i got it on a deal for         they can occasionally go on deals  be on the lookout      
336,5.0 ,                       writing speed       mbyte sreading speed       mbyte swarning  only        of        mbyte tested test finished without errors you can now delete the test files   h w or verify them again h testw v   i have been buying sandisk microsd cards from  gb to    gb for years   i did a test with this sandisk ultra    gb microsdxc card just to check if the brand new card is error free  and it is   i used h testw and here are the results   the warning simply states that it is         mb  after formatting   just ignore it      
337,5.0 ,                       i m always a little sceptical about micro sd cards  since there are so many counterfeit ones on the market  as you may already know  some disreputable sellers modify lower capacity cards  like    or    gig  to report as higher capacity ones  it ll look like a real card  but once you write more data to it than it s true capacity  it quietly overwrites data instead  this one  however  tested perfect i used the free f  utility to verify the card  it wrote the full     gigs of data to the card  then read it back and verified it as good  it got just over   mb s for writing  just over   mb s read  since the card is rated   mb s read write  this card outperforms its class by a small amount  i ll probably end up getting another for my tablet      
338,1.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          it s a micro sd card  i needed something a bit larger for my car dvr  but it doesn t work with it   i can t say it s the cards fault since i can see it on the computer but i haven t used it for anything else  unfortunately the car dvr doesn t see it  so i ll get a   gb and see if that works since i thought i could use it with a     it s not clear on the dvr box so this is what happened update i went ahead and use rufus to format this card to fat   but the car dvr i have still would not work with it  i put back my   gb car and it works again  so i m guessing my dvr limit could also be   gb for the sd card  either way  this card still would not work  i also installed it in my activeon action camera and got an error trying to format the card there i m re formatting the card to see if it will work on my camera again      
339,5.0 ,                       i use it in my android phone to add storage  it is fast   cant tell how fast  no way to run my testing software  but i do access it and store pictures and file folders in the phone  goes as fast as the phone can handle  lg   fit in the phone  installed in seconds and stays put  not really much more i d expect from one of these in any device   it is up to the tasks it was designed for  at least in the period of time i have owned it  came with adapter and case if i want to remove and reuse the  card  elsewhere      
340,2.0 ,                       i have purchased many sandisk cards over the years and this has always been my go to brand   had the    gb in my samsung galaxy s   to hold my music   just quit the other day while trying to add music to it   it will work on my pc with a card reader  but the phone no longer recognizes it it was good while it lasted  but i expected much more than a year out of it unfortunately  i have to find a new brand      
341,1.0 ,                       i generally only buy sandisk memory cards in the hopes that they are reliable and i will not have any card failures  unfortunately  these quality control issues also affect sandisk so this review is simply a data point to record that update          replacement card works just fine   model  sdsquar    g gn ma  serial      yveyg gj          bought new sandisk ultra   gb microsdhc  model  sdsquar    g gn ma  serial      xx    pn  sold by amazon  opened out of retail packaging and it would be detected but could not be formatted in any device tested  i e  tascam dr     canon   d and  d camera  and even win   laptop   since i always wonder if the micro to full sdhc card adapter may be a failure point    on my laptop i tried multiple additional adapters as well as the microsd directly in a card reader   all to the same result  unable to format   screenshot attached   so this is really just to record a single sandisk dead on arrival data point  fortunately amazon quickly processed a replacement for me  so looking forward to that  i have many other sandisk cards that have been working well for years  and a few lexars      
342,1.0 ,                       i would love it if someone would explain to me what happened   i was using all   of these disks on my raspberry pi   but all of a sudden  they reverted to   mib instead of the    gib   this is so weird to me   i wrote them under kali linux  latest  and both fdisk and parted show only   mib available   dd confirms this by refusing to write a    gib  img file   wtf is going on           
343,5.0 ,                       i ve had this since november      for my nintendo switch and it s been great  i had no issues from day one with it reading and being able to put games and screenshots videos on it  i ve just come back to look up just which one i bought and see some bad reviews  the one i purchased was sold by amazon and is exactly what it was stated in the listing  make sure you check it once you receive it and buy from amazon or an approved retailer      
344,5.0 ,                       i bought this card after a failed samsung    gb evo plus class    uhs i microsdxc u  with adapter  mb mc   ga     amazon stood right behind the bad card  im using it in an s      after taking a year to put the data on  carefully removing the card  then the data was gone   i bought this one as a replacement  transfer speed went from   to    on this card and after a frustrating weekend  transferred    g to the new card ultra fast   this is a great  hi capacity and fast enough for me and my samsung phone   great card     
345,5.0 ,                       i have now tested it by writing    gb of files to it and then doing a byte by byte verify with the original files  it passed   definitely not a fake   and great value for the money initially it was very slow and i was disappointed with it   i was seeing max write speeds peaking at   mb s and frequently less than  mb sec   but then i looked closer     the problem is the way that it is formatted from the factory   the thing to understand about a file system is that it is a system   there are a bunch of interlocking pieces in that system all of which potentially affect the speed   especially the way that the flash disk is formatted when i reformatted the flash disk to use a native format instead of the factory format  my disk speed jumped way up   i was seeing write speed bursting to over    mb sec and sustained writes of about   mb sec   with sustained reads at a solid    mb sec very happy with this    gb flash disk      
346,3.0 ,                       i picked this up to deploy in a raspberry pi zero with pi hole installed  since there are quite a few  fake  sd cards on amazon  i wanted to test it out  the results are not super promising with a read speed of    mb s and a write speed of    mb s  advertising speeds up to    mb s seems misleading  while i believe this card will serve it s purpose  i would not trust this in something that needs faster read speeds      
347,5.0 ,                       this memory card works exceptionally well  it s rated a  and can reach read speeds of either    mb s or     mb s depending on which literature you look at  of course it s always up to those speeds  which means you can hit that fast occasionally  but it s not a continuous thing the card is faster than most i have tried  so i am happy with my purchase  i am using it in my lg aristo   which says it can handle a max of    gigs  i have read where other people have put in higher gb cards and it read them all  but i think the    gigs will be fine for me i also installed the sandisk memory app  and used it to move apps and data from phone to the card to help keep the phone speedy  and all is well      
348,5.0 ,                       using it for my nintendo switch after upgrading from a    gb card  works perfectly and able to store more games and photos now      
349,2.0 ,                       i had this in a raspberry pi   w  the rpi  was used as a motion cam  when taking out it was stuck and broke in half  the card looked like it expanded in the slot  it was not in direct sunlight the pi did not get hot  i got my money s worth however will shop for a better brand next time lesson learned      
350,1.0 ,                       i was sent the wrong items  i have purchased these micro sd cards several times in the past and they usually send the correct ones to me but this time i received an inferior version without the microsd card adapter update       i received the exact same wrong item again from this  saletime distributers  company  ironically they misspelled distributors in their company name so that should tell you something   i had to go through the hassle of returning the microsd cards which were   mb s  not     mb s as advertised  and without adapters  which were supposed to come with the product   i would avoid this distributor  eventually amazon refunded me and thankfully didn t make me go through the hassle of returning the cards a second time  i wish they were able to provide me the items through a different distributor though but they said they could not      
351,1.0 ,                       i m with so many others that had a negative experience with this   simple storage from a computer worked but i bought this to use for camera storage and it didn t work with  different devices   i spent   hours on the phone with techincal support from the camera company thinking their product was defective   i just bought a different card and the camera is working correctly   this card is garbage  would not recommend      
352,5.0 ,                       best price for the most gigs  i use this in my   gb samsung phone   great to have this much added storage   havent had to get another and i still have    gb of storage to fill   every photo  video and app are stored on the sd card instead of the phone to help keep the phone from slowing down over time      
353,5.0 ,                       i have worked on many raspberry pi projects and always buy these cards     or more over the years    with a two exceptions i always get the   gb   for the money  getting a smaller card even though it works makes no sense and the price starts going up steeply starting at   gb   i have never had a bad card or a card go corrupt in usage  albeit i am careful to never just unplug my pi s  i always add a power button to them      
354,1.0 ,                       the    gb sd card went bad before i could fill a half of its storage capacity   windows would detect errors  but it couldn t correct them   in fact any attempt to write to the card would just hang   luckily i didn t store anything important on the card   i tried to reformat it  but it only made the matter worse   now it can literally hold less than  mb of data error free   what s the point of such large advertised capacity if it can never be used      
355,5.0 ,                       bought   of these for my boyfriend and i s nintendo switches      gb is plenty for us and even after downloading a bunch of games and taking     s of screenshots  we still have more than enough storage   great purchase      
356,5.0 ,                       i got this so i could play non stop music in my car  it holds all of my music from my computer   which is about     artist and i think maybe about      songs   and it s not even half full yet  i still have plenty of room to load more song  i put my usb input on shuffle and the music just keeps playing without commercials or talk  i love it  i haven t tried videos  i just got the card for my mp  player and my car  i m not going to watch videos while i m trying to drive anyway  but i m happy with the music quality and love  love  love the amount of storage      
357,1.0 ,                       first off  i ve never had a sandisk product fail on me except once  and that was a compact flash card that was counterfeit  i know that western digital has purchased sandisk now  but i ve also had nothing from western digital fail on me either  any item can have a defect  but this sandisk microsd card had   errors before i stopped the test  i just find it strange  it could possibly be a fake  which is what i think it is  whenever i buy memory cards online now  i always test it using a free program called check flash  and i would recommend that to anyone who does the same  better to test it than assume it s good  and have it fail on you and you lose data which happened to me with the aforementioned compact flash card  if you want to possibly avoid this issue entirely  than buy your memory cards a places like best buy  staples  or office depot etc  if you want to see the failed test  see attached screen shots  hope this helps someone  good luck  and buyer beware      
358,5.0 ,                       i purchased sandisk ultra    gb microsdxc about a year ago in order to expand my galaxy s  storage  i primarily use it for storing pictures and nothing else  read write speed is very good  and i have not had any issues at all sandisk is a reputable company and they make quality memory products  and this is no exception  for storing pictures on your camera or phone  this a solid product  highly recommended      
359,2.0 ,                       update amazon was quick to send a replacement  and the replacement worked fine       mb s write speed      mb s read speed  adding one star for the fast replacement   although there s no guarantee or surefire way to tell whether this was a fake or simply a defective card  defects happen  just like with any other products   unfortunately it seems to happen quite often with these microsd cards now  whenever i purchase a microsd card  and before actually using it  i run a program called  h testw   what that program does is write a bunch of files to the card until it s completely full  and then verify whether it can still read those files afterwards when i tested this card  the first giveaway was the write speed   the program was registering a whopping     gbytes sec  yes  gigabytes    as if this was an nvme ssd  pof course once it was done writing  all of the read verification failed   so  hopefully y all have better luck out there  but in my case  this card was completely unusable      
360,3.0 ,                       i have too many cards of various sizes to count  majority of the cards i have are from sandisk and none has ever failed on me  for me  this is a trustworthy brand  i noticed    gb card for cheapest it had ever been  for      i grabbed one  total usable capacity is    gb it had been sitting in a drawer for almost a month  since today was the last day to return the card  i thought  i should check to make sure its not doa or a fake one  passed authenticity test by   applications  flash drive tester      and h testw      but writing and reading speeds are very low  don t stand the  grade  given by sandisk  i really doubt it will work for shooting  k videos or even regular videos i will update as i use it  should it fail or something else happens      
361,1.0 ,                       bought this product  new  from amazon  when i inserted it into my phone  it locked the phone and changed the language to spanish  i had to hard reset the phone  loosing all the pictures and settings  when i went to the sd card through the phone  it showed there was   gbs of data used on it  i had to format the card to keep it from locking the phone again  don t sell recycled cards as new      
362,5.0 ,                       i must buy for your wyze cameras     
363,1.0 ,                       i got this as a backup for raspberry pi    when i placed in my duplicator  it didn t work  i formatted and loaded the unzipped noob download and the raspberry rejected it  i think this may be a chinese rip off  buyer beware  i dumped the   in my wast basket  i have better things to do than returning products that don t work  instead i purchased   more from samsung that have the sane specs  i think these guy s are trying to confuse the product with  sandisk       
364,2.0 ,                       this card died on me after a rather short period of time  i was disappointed  it had to be destroyed in order to protect my data  since nothing could be deleted  this seems to be an issue with flash memory running out of read write cycles  but this should not have happened in so short a period  it should have lasted many years i realized the card was dead when files kept disappearing that it was not copying files  and then using many computers both mac and pc  and multiple card readers including the one that is built into the mac and one built into my pc laptop as well  i was unable to even get it formatted  leading me to the conclusion the card was dead it also has an extremely hard time getting it to connect to my computer and copy files  when it worked out of the package   but copying files worked fine when it was in the phone  until it died   i tried many sd readers  i tried a samsung    gb micro sd with no problems at all  but this sandisk    gb micro sd card had constant problems copying files using many sd readers i also found it to be rather slow when compared to the u  card that i recently got from samsung that is    gb  which i got to replace this dead card overall  i wouldn t recommend this card  because you can get a    gb today from the samsung site for a similar price that i paid for this card  and it s not very fast for the size  although usable   and the issues getting it to connect to a computer was the greatest hassle that seems to be unique to this card      
365,3.0 ,                       it s actually    gb of space  i could forgive if it were    gb of space  but it s    gb  i bought this card for my nintendo switch and i realized the missing space as soon as i inserted the card  i felt cheated  the card is not cheap  i expected what i ve paid for  but it was a disappointing one  the missing space of   gb is a pretty big deal considering the price  just advertise the product as    gb of storage space  don t lie to people      
366,5.0 ,                       bought this due to the switch eshop s    more gold coins for downloaded games so far been using it since christmas and barely got    gbs used up but i have a little under    games downloaded onto the switch  which is amazing  when it comes down to it best bang for your buck plus when you eventually hit the max just unistall all the games you don t play as much or have already completed to get even more space but that ll take a long while to hit      
367,3.0 ,                       results from h testw  size          above average for this category write speed        mb s  not horrible  but on the low side read speed        mb s  about average for this category packaging is pretty  but not reusable      
368,4.0 ,                       i was told that this will work in anything that can take the    gb card and so far that seems to be true   i put it in an iflash xyz iflash quad board for my ipod classic and it works as expected   i haven t tried it in anything else but the designer of the iflash board told me that it should work as it s the same controller chip as the    gb      seems to hold up so far i know the nintendo switch can take the    gb card just fine     but with    games on mine  i still have    gb free  so i haven t tried it in there yet   people say it does work though      
369,1.0 ,                       thought i was buying a great micro sd card  worked great for about two weeks  i was using it in my dji mavic   pro drone  i m on vacation at the moment and have been taking great photos and videos  i wake up to import my footage onto my computer and the sd card is throwing errors on all of my devices  my desk top  laptop  gopro  and iphone tried to reformat the card  i know doing this will wipe the card clean  i clicked yes and no device can format the card  very very disappointed in this product  lost a lot of good footage      
370,5.0 ,                       i bought this    gb card to store music for my dap  upon getting it  i fired up h testw and tested it  there was    gb  gib   of exfat formatted space on the card  it all tested ok     gib is    gb  so i suspect the discrepancy is just the labelling through my thinkpad t    s pcie connected sd card reader  i was able to get completely stable   mb s write and   mb s read throughout the entire test  like  zero speed fluctuations at any point  which i was rather impressed with   i suspect my reader is limited because of the weirdly precise     mb s upper limit  so i would have gotten something like   mb s read like other reviewers if i used a better reader overall  great card  and staggering capacity for this price       and speed that won t take you hours and hours to fill up  just make sure to get the one sold shipped by amazon to avoid getting fakes  and use h testw to test any sd cards you buy just in case      
371,5.0 ,                       i purchased this memory to put inside of a kyocera duraforce pro phone  the phone gives you the option of formatting the memory so it s part of the actual phone memory or it s removable  since i have no plans of ever removing this memory card i went ahead and set it up so it shows as part of the internal phone memory  it works incredibly fast my phone will snap pictures one after the other almost like a professional camera and they save right to the card with no delay  and the phone also recognizes all of the memory  so i m ecstatic my phone is now loaded with music and audible books and i couldn t be happier      
372,3.0 ,                       this thing is absurdly hard to open especially with my eyesight   i kept cutting around it with the scissors but still no luck   i am just lucky i didn t slice into it   my wife finally got the thing open   u guess until theft becomes less of a problem in large urban areas we are stuck with all this baloney my guess is that the card itself will work fine   things that small are a marvel of engineering but i often questions why they should actually be so small   anything larger than a watch could be designed to take a standard sd card   it s like aaa batteries   most tv remotes and phones could be designed for aa batteries and they would have far longer run times   i guess battery companies want to sell more batteries and that tinier is cool or whatever the operative slang for the moment is      
373,1.0 ,                       this sd card didn t work on our dash cam that was why we bought for  we tried another sd card that works  it seem incompatible  this card only works on our security camera update  it stopped working after a months of using  wasted money      
374,5.0 ,                       purchased this to go inside my nintendo switch  works great  i have around    downloaded games on it and they used barely any of the storage  if you are wanting only the digital versions of games i would recommend getting this size micro sd card   great value and a great buy for nintendo switch owners      
375,1.0 ,                       it took me along time of dealing with this cards bs to realize it s fake and doesn t work right i can t format it and it takes hours to delete a few videos off of it  video s can t be read from it i did a lot of research on fake cards from amazon due to their commingling of their merchandise i determined the one i got is fake skip amazon when buying sd cards  go to your local office supply or tech store to buy one      
376,5.0 ,                       i am using sandisk ultra cards in all of my drones and have never had a problem with them  the are very reliable in the performance and storing of my stills and video files  the price keeps coming down on these little wonders and it pays to have several extras on hand  it is also a good way to pass on any production that i want to give my clients  just be sure that you put the micro sd card in the full sized adapter and include a full sized sd container so it does not get lost or misplaced      
377,1.0 ,                       i m very disappointed and sad with this issue  i expected that such issues would not find them on amazon but guess what  i m wrong again  i purchased this card form my kid s nintendo switch console  i purchased all  games digital  it take an eternity to save or loading games  but i though it was the switch problems  but just this week i found that trying to download more games gave me an error  corrupted data  i formatted the card three times  i cant use more that    gb  now i realize very late that i was scammed  the worst thing is that it was fulfilled by amazon      
378,4.0 ,                       was needing a new memory card for my samsung note   and wanted to go up from my    gb memory card  i saw that this    gb card price had gone down so i jumped on it overall  after formatting the card  i got about    gbs of actual storage space  read and write speeds aren t too terrible considering some of the files i am putting on it run about    gbs  it is also nice having    gbs of storage space to have my pictures and movies on  i take a lot of pictures with a nikon dslr camera  when i am not at home  i can pull that memory card  put it in a usb adapter  plug that into an otg  and then download the pictures to my phone  i then upload the pictures to google photos or leave them on my phone to go through and edit  delete  and sort  my phone has    gb of on board storage and then this    gb card  it will take forever to fill up my phone with pictures and  i can keep a lot of memories on my phone side note  always back up your phone to save your pictures and data as well  never trust one device to hold on to those memories      
379,4.0 ,                       i ordered     gb sd card to use for my nintendo switch  after checking nintendo website for instructions i put it in my switch and it kept giving error message  i tried it on my computer and cellphone and nothing recognized the card  i requested a return which amazon granted and a new card was sent in two days  second card works great as it was supposed to do  one thing i noticed there was a difference between two cards plastic packaging parts  the first bad sd cards plastic part of the package was with sticky back  the second order sd card that works had a thin plastic wrap which was easy to tear  this sd card works great with my nintendo switch after the system update  thanks amazon for easy return      
380,4.0 ,                       almost returned this card  it came preformatted and i began using it out of the box only to discover the actual capacity was about half the    gb  win    showed    gb in the properties window  my new note   accepted it as is  tech support gave up and offered a refund   as a last effort i formatted the card in the phone and whoa nelly  the card now operated as advertised  full capacity  transferred my audiobook collection  lots of room to spare  be advised      
381,3.0 ,                       i bought this to put into my phone so i could have the freedom to throw in whatever games  movies  pictures  etc i want  having owned a nexus   which was locked in at    gb  i ve been rather cramped in storage  thankfully the razer   recognizes up to  tb sd cards if i m not mistaken  but the    gb capacity this card gives me after formatting will more than suffice  all buyers should make themselves aware that storage devices need to use part of their own memory to build the file system for the device to find the data on the card  so you will always have less than the advertised capacity see the fine print on devices that says  actual capacity may be less    at least with today s technology had a strange issue with android s os reading the card  for some inexplicable reason it reports the card as having     gb capacity under the storage settings  thankfully  when i connect the phone to my pc in data transfer mode  the pc reports the proper formatted capacity of     gb  so it should be a legitimate card  it made me wonder if i had gotten a fake card before i plugged it into the pc  since counterfeiters commonly hack lower capacity cards to report a higher capacity than is actually on the card  with that in mind you can understand why i might a hacker meant to write     gb to this card but forgot they set their program to write     instead  or something of the sort  the average user assumes the card must be legitimate if it say s it has the amount advertised  this is not the case  and the device using such a card may wind up losing data because it s trying to write to memory that s not actually there  by the time the user figures out it s a fake  the counterfeiter s account on the store is usually shut down  thankfully my card seems to be legitimate      
382,3.0 ,                       when i remove the micro sd card from my phone to use another micro sd card  and i re insert this micro sd card into my phone  my photos disappear  if i go to settings  storage  files the sd card is empty and there are no files stored in the sd card  fortunately  google photos automatically uploads my photos and i have a set of photos stored in my google photos account  but word of caution  do not remove the sd card from your phone or your photos will disappear and read as empty when re inserted into our phone phone   samsung galaxy s  plus  storage location is set to external micro sd card with back up set to automatic back up to google photos      
383,5.0 ,                       this is the one my sony video camera requires  and it really is a perfect match   also works well with my lg stylo phone and fire    tablet   i also have a couple i use to hold the operating systems of my laptops on  just an added bit of security should the laptops grow legs  at which point the built in drive  c  boots just enough in the bios to notify me of where it is before shutting back down again as if broken    for the camera  it records     x     hd for    hours and    minutes or so  with studio stereo sound quality   so i will never really run out of room no matter what single camera project i decide to take on   it worked well in the unusually hot and humid weather we had here recently  i will update  with winter performance if that differs  i don t expect it will  on my tablet  i downloaded all the movies ad tv shows i own that are on amazon s cloud  as well as shifted all apps able over to it to free up internal storage  and i still have most of the space available to store even more   i don t normally keep movies on my phone  but the apps transferred over to the chip actually now perform better  as does the phone now that it has more room to work with for things like push updates to the operating system and the inevitable electronic  paperwork  and ebooks for school  and a few games to keep from getting bored in the doctor s waiting area  etc     i ve never gone wrong with sandisk  and the quality and price point are perfect for my needs   i ve tried others  and all my devices complained about read and write errors with them  so i came back to sandisk      
384,1.0 ,                       you have to send a photo of the serial no  on the ultra sd card   but the letters are too tiny  so no cameraphone can even see them nor scanner   i am out    bucks for a    gb    card lock was probably bad and they tell you to toggle it and make sure it is up as you carefully insert it     
385,5.0 ,                       i was nervous buying this after seeing the reviews  but i took a chance and i m really glad that i did because i use this card constantly in my gopro   black and it holds a ton of footage  usually once i move footage over to edit i delete it from my camera  but i wanted to test out the card so i left a couple weeks on it and it still had a few hours left free  since i m constantly filling up    and    gb cards  i was really pleased to find this card at this price and have it work so well      
386,5.0 ,                       a card reader i purchased from amazon arrived in the same shipping container as the sandisk card   used that card reader to flawlessly move all my    gb photo  to the new card   put the card in my wifes surface pro   and not she can access all the photos   the speed is fine for retrieving photos   the price was excellent     
387,1.0 ,                       this card became corrupted while i was taking a video with my smartphone i believe  but after that i couldn t format it or even delete anything from the card  luckily i could copy and read from it still  i won t be using this brand in the future  google this card and search for can t format or cannot delete files and this card   gb comes up quite a bit  i bought it direct from amazon  not  rd party  it is not fake  i think they have a problem with these      
388,5.0 ,                       i bought the    gb memory card for     and i sometimes see it for even cheaper  at the     price point or lower  i highly recommend this card for every switch owner  if you buy game cartridges then you ll never run out of space with this card  most games i have on cartridge don t require much space on the card other than the save data and maybe a few mbs  as for downloadable games it can vary quite a bit  most first party nintendo games aren t that big  i believe the biggest first party downloadable game i own is splatoon   which sits at   gbs  some third party games like wolfenstein   do clock in at roughly   gbs but that still isn t much especially considering that s a triple a game  with that in mind you can expect most big budget games to be in the   gb range  the    gb card is the sweet spot in my opinion where you will probably never have to buy another memory card for your switch again unless you really love those digital downloadable huge games  but even then it should still take you a few years to fill up      
389,5.0 ,                       i have purchased a     and     gig one of these for my samsung note   and my wife s samsung a    they are way faster than my older smaller cards and i have yet to even come close to filling one up  i do a lot of audio books and i can put    or    on there and not even come close to filling it up  i have been using one of them for about   months and the other just a month or two   no issues yet      
390,2.0 ,                       buy the hp f     i have used it in my work vehicle for    hours a day with no problems  this one  the f     died after only three months in my personal car with light use  customer service is crap   they don t listen to the fact that the camera will not power up at all  the original complaint was that the camera powered up one morning with a  card reader error  on the screen and then shut down   no swapping of cards or power cords would remedy the problem  i told them this and they responded with questioning weather the card was formatted and told me that the card needed to be formatted regularly  or that maybe the card was the wrong card  i told them the card was the recommended card and the i had swapped out the card with a known good card but the problem was that the camera would not power up at all  this garnered another round of  it might be the card  it needs to be a class      g card  along with  it might be the power switch  can you send a detailed video of the power switch   really  we need a detailed video of the power switch because i m too much of a moron to tell if it s broken or not  i sent the effing video and a photo of the class      g sd card and then got no response  i m understandably pissed  a lifestraw bottle of almost the same value was replaced without question as soon as i asked about a problem  this is what i would have expected from hp and why i chose to purchase an hp product rather than one of the many choices from companies i have never heard of   guess i would have been better off rolling the dice on fuyoungsunnyluck enterprises  because right now that sounds like a more reliable option      
391,1.0 ,                       misleading advertising  card is waaay slower than what they claim  i have good sandisk cards  dont know whats the deal with these as i m pretty sure they arent counterfeit  they just suck  read and write speeds in the teens  wont work with a descent drone or camera or phone  i would have gladly spent the extra     or so to get what i thought i was buying  instead i got     of nothing i can use      
392,2.0 ,                       didn t last   months  we ve never had issues with our sandisk s in the past but our last   we ve bought haven t lasted more than a couple of months  one for a phone  this one for a tablet   we purchased these to go into our children s fire tablets for added memory for their movies and not even   months later  it s no longer compatible with the tablet or any other devices we ve tried it with  we ve tried all the online suggestions to reformat  erase  etc and nothing      
393,1.0 ,                       i don t know what kind of cheaply made product this is  i had it installed in my phone  i had the phone format the card to use as storage  after a month it stopped working  my phone said please insert a sd card  i shut off the phone took it out and put it in a usb adapter  i plugged it into the computer and could only see it under disc management  i put it back into my phone and same thing no sd card  i hard to format to continue  it didnt work after format  i couldnt get my data back before or after i formated  i will never buy a san disk device again      
394,1.0 ,                       review is for sandisk ultra    gb microsdxc uhs i card with adapter   sdsquar    g gn ma   bought it         as a stocking stuffer to be used in surface pro   by around march files started to go corrupt   ultimately formatted it  non quick  and reused  but three months later corrupt files are happening again   can t trust this card anymore so it s headed to the shredder or  maybe  sister in law s mobile device   either way i m done with it and do not recommend this product      
395,3.0 ,                       died after only   months use   over    gb of music  documents  videos and images in limbo       oh so very freaking nice       one day all my phone s apps stopped recognizing it  it just quit functioning  my pc didn t see it when i hooked it up my phone via usb  it was invisible  fortunately i was able to retrieve files from it after actually pulling the dead card out and plugging it into a device to read microsd cards directly via usb and i tediously backed up everything to my computer i have contacted sandisk directly for them to honor the    year warranty  their return policy is extremely time consuming requiring images of both sides of card and proof of purchase  i have wiped data and reformatted it before sending it back for a new card  we ll see how their replacement process goes   i will update this review on sandisk s behavior for replacement of their faulty products later on  buyer beware and do backup your data stored on their memory cards frequently  thankfully  i did so  which made data recovery a quicker process update           i updated my review to   stars as sandisk finally delivered a new    gb card yesterday  the entire laborious process took from september  nd      to september   rd      to get another card     days       well this new card is working for now  time will tell           
396,1.0 ,                       i brought a lot of sandisk product over the year  this is the first time i got a defective  i copied     gb of files into this    gb card  it was painfully slow  took about   hours  the worst part is after the progress bar finished a lot of the data are missing when i check the folder  the total file size i copied over is     gb but after it finish copying only      gb are in the folder  the drive is shows there is      gb free  but only      gb of the space is used  i reformat the drive and tried again and the same happened very disappointed at this card    extremely slow   defected     
397,5.0 ,                       honestly  i bought this for my go pro since it recommends the  ultra  higher speed microsd card  however  while i was out on black friday with my wife i bought a      gb standard sandisk microsd card to use   there is no difference in quality or speed on my part  it could be my go pro software speed  but i can t tell a difference  however i can t complain   i couldn t find a   gb standard sandisk  i m not sure  but either way i have no complaint   i just havent found a difference      
398,1.0 ,                       i bought this to back up some files and it is a joke  first of all when it is formatted  only     gb is available not     gb  then when transferring from a very fast ssd drive  it was copying as low as      kb  kilobytes  per second  and averaging about     kb s for smaller files   large video files peaked about   mb s  still nowhere near the    mb s advertised  but then  the default allocation size for exfat is using about    percent more size than a pc drive      
399,4.0 ,                       i originally ordered this micro sd card as a backup option for my laptop  but it won t format to ntfs  so my laptop only recognized it as   gb  no worries  however   i simply installed it into my fire   hd tablet  where it is fully recognized and offers me a very useful amount of storage for movies  pictures  and other files and data  so all is good    stars because i couldn t use it as originally intended      
400,2.0 ,                       unsure what happened but it has switched into read only  was able to download most of my files onto the computer   via phone    plugged directly into the computer but the computer does not recognize it  plugged it back into my phone  phone reformatted it  now says it doesn t support it  attempted reformatting inside the phone results in an error  computer still will not recognize it  completely unusable  goodbye    gb of whatever wasn t a photo or easily accessible media     apps  data  etc all gone     not very happy  guess it s my own fault for trusting the cheap price      
401,3.0 ,                       i purchased this camera as an addition to my existing monitoring system   which consisted of a single nest cam in my kitchen  the nest cam had been used to monitor my senior dog  who died two months ago  but after bringing home a new puppy almost three weeks ago  i found that there was a blind spot in the system  and my puppy seems to have gravitated to it   he s a genius  first  the setup  it was frustrating as all hell  after eight attempts at connecting through wifi  i had to do a wired setup  my modem is in a closet as part of a u verse system  and accessing it is awkward  so that inconvenience was strike one  when the camera finally connected  the app wouldn t find the correct wifi connection  so there s strike two strike three is easily seen in the screen capture from the cam  the cloud  despite using the     mp setting  there is a fog  or a mist  or a cloud   whatever you want to call it   in the middle of the image  it s the same when lights are on  i ve wiped down the lens with a dust free cloth  used to clean my camera lenses   but it didn t resolve the issue  also  despite having extremely high speed internet  panning the camera using the swipe on my ipad isn t very responsive we ll see what happens over the next few days  but  at this point  i m not certain i ll be keeping this camera      
402,1.0 ,                          i should have passed on this card  all was good at first  not even   months after owning card stopped registering in our kindle fire  i ve tried everything  what a waste of money and of course it s out of the return timeframe  and it will not let me contact anyone for support     my original review was below i would highly advise purchasing a completley different card  do not take a chance on this so far so good  i was skeptical about ordering this card with reviews of other customers saying they got fake cards  i ordered directly through amazon and the first thing i looked for was where it was made  the card we received was made in taiwan  which i knew was a good sign  i wanted a larger sd card for a kindle fire to be able to download all our movies on for roadtrips  and so far this has worked perfectly   so this was our answer to problem of not being able to stream our digital amazon content while traveling  yay      
403,1.0 ,                       i got this for my nintendo switch but when i tried to reformat it the switch would say it was reformatted and then restart  once it came back to the home screen it would say it failed i attempted to reformat in my computer as well but it was only going to reformat to   mb  sad because this was a replacement for the first one that was lost      
404,5.0 ,                       used with samsung phone my phone appreciates that i took the two minutes needed to install this card   no longer does my phone yell at me to free up some space so i can take more pictures or add apps that i never use the included adapter is nice so i can also put it in a computer or printer to print off the pictures   yes some people still print physical copies of pictures      
405,1.0 ,                       zero stars   i would give zero stars but for whatever reason that s not an option     aggghhhhheeemmm   make it an option got the mini sd card and could not put anything on it  recorded over an hour worth of footage and lost it because i got a defective card  absolutely ridiculous i am changing the previously stated     of the merchandise i purchase off amazon i have to return because of poor quality or defect to     of the merchandise is crap seriously amazon  you have a very dissapointed customer       
406,1.0 ,                       not designed for dash cams  any dash cam  amazon add said people were buying this with with the roadwitness dash cam  so i ordered it and installed it  there are noise bars popping up on the videos and after i had tried it now  i have to try talking to amazon to get my money back  after feedback from roadwitness they said to not use it in any dash cam  won t hold up      
407,2.0 ,                       i paid for     of my sd card to be used up  for free  tell me where   gbs went from opening to placing inside my switch  because apparently they dissipated into thin air      
408,5.0 ,                       i needed to expand the memory space in my nintendo switch because i ran out of the    gb that came installed in it  breath of the wild alone took up about    gb  it was pretty difficult finding a micro sd card in my area within my budget  until i finally decided to go to the internet and found the sandisk     gb card on amazon for         i m not sure if that price is temporary since i bought it during the holidays   once i ordered and received it  formatting the card to work in my switch is a cinch  only takes a minute or so  and i have plenty of memory spaces for years to come  about     gb free after transferring installing    games  mainly mario  and some media apps   the write speed is about average  but the read speed is fantastic  which is a huge plus for playing games  i highly recommend getting this sandisk card for your switch and  if you re an avid gamer like me  get at least     gb      
409,5.0 ,                       this is one great microsd card  i have a long history about sandisk products from way back since the    s and always had a great experience on this brand name  i knew that i would have the same results buying this product because of a brand new cellphone i got and it needed a microsd card to expand the storage  i immediately reformatted this card the minute i got from the mail and everything ran smoothly with no hiccups or hassles  the download speed on this thing is fast and rightfully so  my only regret about this product is i should ve saved more money that i could ve got a much much larger capacity same brand microsd card like a     gb size  but no matter for i m just only using this card is for storage for my smartphone s  camera for pictures and i m pretty confident that it would take       s upon       s of pictures to fill this up  highly recommended brand name if you wanted to have the very best      
410,1.0 ,                       i use this for photo  video and phone backup in my galaxy s     after i use about  gb everything become corrupt  reformat the sd card and try again  then sure enough as soon as i hit the  gb mark new pictures i take are instantly corrupt  waste of money if you ask me     
411,5.0 ,                       better than i expected   supports very clear video at     p and     p  i didn t try    p    my wife and i were both impressed   i haven t taken it for a ride in the car yet but am happy with what i see setting it up to look out a window at the street   daytime  night time  the wdr adjusts to the bright or limited light fine   i was able to get it to take a     gb microsd and ran it through a full day plus without quite filling up       p    i m happy with that  i had a problem getting wifi to work initially but maybe it was cause the battery wasn t fully charged   read the instructions to make sure you are connecting the correct ssid   anyway after several attempts i was able to access the wifi and it has good range   i plugged it into the usb charger  mine  using the provided cable   i was able to connect with my phone using the akaso app and walk around the house  at least    ft  without any break in wifi   even stepped into another room and it was fine   so since primary use would be in the car i think its great   i downloaded several   minute videos and its fast enough for one or two clips   if you want all of the clips  take it to a computer and download direct from the microsd by putting it in the window i was able to get gps lock  proving that it did sync with gps   i played it back later on the coby player and it pulled up the location on google maps fine for both locations i tested the gps   again  i did not use it moving in the car yet   the coby player is not the most stable  seemed to hang after a couple of video clips   if you just want to see the video  not the gps  use vlc   much better image time synced perfectly when i made the phone wifi connection to repeat   great video clarity   wish i had purchased a second one at that price   and looking forward to putting it in the car      
412,5.0 ,                       love samsung sd cards  they are always reliable  these are perfect for holding linux os images for my raspberry pi projects  plenty of room for holding the os  scripts  and other essentials  if more space is needed for your projects  the   gb cards work well too  my projects don t require too much space  so the   gb is quite enough room  i often attached a usb flash drive to the pi if i need more space anyway highly recommend samsung     
413,2.0 ,                       i was really disappointed that the default setting for this was readable only and no rewrite  this has been a massive problem for me  and changing the settings has been next to impossible  i wanted a device that was store material and from which i could remove the material easily  this has not been possible  i don t know the reason for this  and frankly i don t want to try to figure this out  this should be something that is easy to do  but it is not  be very careful when you buy this because you will get a non rewritable chip      
414,1.0 ,                       horrible  i bought this after my other card corrupted in my phone  put it in my computer and it only said it had several    mb  not the gb it should be  would not format  tried to chat with customer support and they were useless and stupid  they kept telling me i need to use a compatible adapter to get it to work  i kept telling them that i was using the adapter that came with their product  they didn t even read what i was writing  after googling this card  a lot of people have this exact problem with this model very frustrating and several hours of totally wasted time and effort on my part for a brand new item that customer support told me wasn t working out of the package      
415,5.0 ,                       i bought this for my nintendo switch since i intend to go almost fully digital with my game purchases and needed a lot of space  i was a bit leery because of several top reviews over the last several years saying they received fakes    but mine is the real deal and works flawlessly so far   so i ve no complaints whatsoever      
416,1.0 ,                       i ve been using this card just over a year and it is failing  maybe it has already failed   it remains to be seen whether i can recover any of my files from it  i had been using it for a lot of reading and writing  i wanted to spare my hard drive   it couldn t handle it  apparently      
417,5.0 ,                       inserted tiny card in the slot in my new kindle fire hd        turned on kindle and went to  settings    then  storage    with the memory already on board plus the micro card  memory now showed     gb   for the price  this is a great deal   i use sandisk in my camera also   no failures to date in either device   highly recommended      
418,5.0 ,                       i love the extended storage available with this card       gb has lasted well over a year  i still have    gb left     i have not had any issues with this card  or any of the smaller capacity sandisk cards i got from amazon in the past    i bought this new card when i saw amazon was selling this for a great price and need it for a new phone the only thing i don t like is the thick plastic sandisk seals the cards in   you need to be careful when cutting it open as the plastic can be very sharp      
419,5.0 ,                       this micro  sd is great   i bought it for my son s phone   he likes to take pictures of birds   it s a great alternative for the    gb card as it s about     cheaper   in a year from now he will probably have the card full  by then the larger gb card should be down in price   win win situation      
420,4.0 ,                       i didn t know on the samsung s  that that little hole at the top was for the sim card  at first i thought it was the hole on the bottom right  fits s  perfectly  i was skeptical at first but this is the best value wish the picture with this showed you how to install  you don t even need the parts to install  i just used a small paperclip end     
421,5.0 ,                       this review is for the sandisk    gb micro sd card  no problems to report  it worksfine in a galaxy tab a tablet  the actually size is    gb  samsung just listed this sdcard as being compatible  happy with purchase  got it for     on amazon deal of the day      
422,5.0 ,                       still easily a       star review but i did have one fail after two years  i use it for a dashcam so it s constantly writing and rewriting memory  also had to endure high temps in the summer and     degree weather in the winter where i live  so basically i think it failed because of the rigorous work i put it through but still made it two years     
423,1.0 ,                       i bought this less than   years ago and used it very little  it stopped working suddenly during a transfer  was no longer recognized by pc or laptop  i tried a couple of different adapters  nothing  couldn t even see the drive to reformat  just dead   luckily i didn t have any important data on there  the drive has a    year warranty  which sounds great if sandisk cared to make the process streamlined  but they do not  there is no readily available information on what to do when this happens  i wasted my time troubleshooting with the tech support chat person only to be told to open an rma ticket  apparently he couldn t open one for me  i had to type in all the information i already provided in a form  fine  i did that and was supposed to receive an email and a pre paid label to send back the faulty card  that was a month ago and i haven t heard from sandisk        
424,1.0 ,                       stopped working    with very little use      
425,5.0 ,                       sandisk memory cards are the only cards i trust in my cameras   they are the ones that are consistently recommended by photographers online  and i have never had one fail on me  even ones that accidentally went through the wash       when you re out and about taking photos you want to be sure those precious images are not lost due to a faulty card  and i would never buy a different brand      
426,4.0 ,                       ordered on sale during the holidays        works just fine for large file storage  only have a    gb ssd  for the os etc  in my laptop  so this does the trick for my files i also always back everything up multiple times each day to external hds also  nothing gets stored  in the cloud  since  the cloud  is just someone else s computer   if you want a great little free backup program  try dirsyncpro       fabulous      
427,5.0 ,                       so far very pleased  i have a samsung   galaxy  s  phone and i was able to move   transfer photos  videos  and documents to  this new sandisk    gb ultra microsdxc uhs i memory card with adapter      mb s  c    u   full hd  a   micro s      memory card i inserted my new    gb sandisk micro sdxc memory card into the proper slot in the vanja gadget    vanja micro usb otg adapter and usb     portable memory card reader for sdxc  sdhc  sd  mmc  rs m       and inserted the vanja  into the charging port of my samsung s  phone   as hoped   the external device shows up in the phone s menu and you can then choose types of files you would like to   copy or   move  such as  photos  video  documents and non copy protected audio   it is my understanding that the phone may have trouble accessing information if you move apps  you can see the ammount of memory allocated  used  between your internal memory  the old   existing in the phone  card  and the external card  when i was done  i disconnected the vanja and replaced my existing memory card in the phone with the new one   and  my phone seems to be working fine  as i am quite cautious  i copied the data i wanted to save   rather than move  so the old data should still be available on the old card   even though  my old    gb card has been removed from the phone it is not erased as i remember the available memory of the     gb card was approx    gb   plenty for me  and i did not attempt to  format  the new memory card at all  nor need a  driver  so apparently it is not necessary in this instance and the transfer was quite fast  took a few minutes in each category   but showing the number of photos  transfered   copied at a pace of about    per second  which is so much quicker than what i often encounter trying to move photos to my laptop      
428,5.0 ,                       i personally like to download all of my games from my switch and that takes up a lot of memory  my boyfriend thought that this amount of space would be overkill  however i find it to be a miracle  now i have space for all the games i would have ever wanted and i couldn t be more grateful  if you re like me and love to hoard games on your switch  please invest in this microsd card to do the work      
429,4.0 ,                       my first sandisk    gb i bought  sold by amazon com  was a fraudulent   gb card  flashed to appear as a    gb card   this would be devastating if accidentally used  resulting in huge data corruption once you hit   gb of writing   you can download and use h testw for free to test any sd card you purchase  and this is highly recommended   if your card is legit  the program will say it is okay   otherwise  it will say something like     gb ok  and the rest will be  lost  or  corrupted i purchased this very recently  so these fake cards are still in circulation  and are unavoidable   amazon will replace for free  and give you a free return shipping label   as for the legit card i got from amazon as a replacement  it is fast  and works perfectly   it tested perfectly in the software   the font for the fake card was slightly off  most notably for the number        i attached the two pictures i took of the fake and real cards  and labeled them      
430,5.0 ,                       got this    gb drive for     on prime day  however i added      in credit to my account and got     for free so really this drive only cost me      its surprisingly fast for an ultra series and uhs i class micro sd and i think it will perform very well in my phone to expand its storage to a whopping    gb    gb of actual storage on the card     gb stock   im getting reads of   mb s and writes of   mb s which is darn close to my sandisk extreme which is a uhs iii v   card and only gets slightly higher writes at   mb s  also tested the card with fakeflashtest and h testw and they both came back legit      
431,2.0 ,                       seems like others had a similar experience  hadn t had problems with other microsd cards i d ordered through this same product line but this    gb one melted the adapter it shipped with the first time i plugged it into my computer   and don t tell me this is a problem buying third party  i always make sure with these storage devices to buy direct from amazon  could have ended really disastrously  nearly burned my finger pulling it out      
432,1.0 ,                       not sure if i got a defective one but started as    gb and then after few use it would not respond or would not be recognized by the computer  tried reformatting and everything i could find on the web  the capacity showing now is    gb but would not be recognized after few use did not get to use this until after few years after purchase and return window and warranty i think are all past      
433,4.0 ,                       i ordered the sandisk ultra    gb micro sdxc uhs    card with adapter why did i order this i simply ordered out of necessity  my cell phone was freezing up due to lack of space i m not functioning properly  i needed to take all of my pictures videos screenshots off of my current sd card freeing up some space   i didn t want to be forced by my telephone provider into purchasing a new phone   that s a different story    delivery  delivery was reasonably quick  however one thing i do notice  whenever i choose one option free delivery if i m not paying attention it randomly changes  i do understand the need to limit the number of trips the delivery amazon people need to make for my deliveries so i frequently or always choose to bundle the packages for the least number of trips   so i ordered the card and i also ordered a usb     multi card reader   of course i needed the multi card reader along with the sd card which never came together  never read the last i received an sd card  the product survives me putting it together i m into my phone as needed and transferring all of my pictures etc on it   as far as longevity  if i m going to lose my pictures or any of my documents i hope not      
434,1.0 ,                       this thing only gets  mb sec write speeds on average  the fastest i ve seen was  mb sec  this is way below the class    spec that this claims to be read speeds are good  around   mb sec  but who cares when the write speeds are garbage      
435,5.0 ,                       i upgraded my sandisk    gb  earlier version  to this one  needed the extra     gb space   the     gb worked for me for more than a year  no issues at all  despite the fact that i used it as a second drive  inserted       for my dell xps     and used it as the main data drive for my photos      gb of raw photos  with daily editing  lightroom  photoshop       
436,3.0 ,                       i ran h testw to verify storage space  it read    gb but the transfers speed were not even close to the up to    mb s  the write speed was     mb s and read was     mb s  i am glad it at least was almost full storage but disappointed on the read write speeds  for this price i am going to keep it but not as advertised on speeds      
437,1.0 ,                       after reading some of the reviews on this product  i decided to give the    gig card a chance   the product does work and has      gig actual space  this is because of the math they use to fool you on how much space is on the card    so far so good  right   i ran a full test using h testw v    on the card after reading some of these cards may be fake   well  this card is not fake  but i discovered it is also not the card they promised   they promised a card that has up too    mb read speed  my test  which i ran multiple times  showed   writing speed       mbyte s   reading speed       mbyte s  nowhere close to what they advertise    i then did some reading to find out the last generation of this card offered a   mb read speed  the same speed as this card is reading    so they are actually trying to fool us by sending out a last generation card and claiming it is the newer and faster version   most people may never noticed the difference  but when your device lags or crashes because of the slower speed  you will notice   i am very dissapointed with this news as i had high hopes for this order   until they correct this issue  i would not recommend purchasing this card      
438,5.0 ,                       i ve seen some others posting what seem to be false reviews or consumer error the speeds are as advertised  pretty close anyways around   mb s something i m willing to bet people on here dont have is usb      because usb     you wont get those speeds anywho  it s a great product  it is as it is supposed to be  i purchased the    gb version  i just finished transferring all my note   data to it theres another review of a guy who actually showed graph data on the speedsnow i ll put my old    gb in my drone     
439,2.0 ,                       i ordered this sandisk    gb micro sdxc uhs i card in mid february        it worked fine until june           the card failed suddenly   it is not visible on the mobile phone for which it was intended  nor can it be formatted using a pc using the provided adapter   the  return  window closed on march           the  product support  window closed on april            guess i ll be speaking with sandisk product support tomorrow morning     according to the product packaging  there s a    year warranty provided   we ll see if they will replace it     update  spoke with sandisk support on june          they agreed the card was fried  and provided a return authorization or  rma   shipped the old card back  replacement    gb microcard received on june            let s hope this one lasts longer      
440,5.0 ,                       hello  fellow online shopaholic   i m using these    gb sandisk memory cards in my security cameras  they seem to be working great  and they were a great value for the money  they also came with an adapter  so that was a welcome bonus  so my final recommendation is  buy it  you ll like it   friend  if my honest review was even a little bit helpful in your purchase decision  kindly press the  helpful  button  god bless you  and have a safe  happy amazon shopping day        
441,5.0 ,                       this   gb microsd is a great product   it arrive in great packaging designed to protect a somewhat fragile item without requiring a pickaxe to open the package   i plugged it into my dash camera  turned the camera on and shezam    everthing worked perfectly   doesn t sound like a big deal but i am sorely tired of buying things that had to be returned  exchanged  repaired  etc   i will buy this again       
442,1.0 ,                       don t recommend  based on other reviews  it is not worth risking loosing your pictures or videos  purchase from a more reliable place for sd cards  i wouldn t trust this company for sd cards  the card also felt different than ones i have used for years from stores  never had one from this company and this one is different so i decided its more important to be careful with pictures you can not get back if this card decides to give out  purchase from somewhere you know is reliable  also  it is cheaper than what this amount of gb usually is on an sd card so that is kind of a heads up  kind of like  of it seems to good to be true  it probably is      
443,5.0 ,                       me va de maravilla la lectura de juegos  compr  con amazon prime para tener seguridad de que sea original y garant a  la he comprado s lo para mi nintendo switch y la recomiendo      si tienes la consola y necesitas espacio de almacenamiento  la primera vez que la ponga debes apagar la consola y lo otro que pasar  es que actualizar  la consola  para cuando instales juegos se guarden en la sd autom ticamente  lo siguiente que debes hacer es liberar el espacio de la consola archivando todos lo juegos y volver a descargarlos  debes tener guardado en la nube con nintendo switch online  y luego de eso se guardar n todos los juegos que descargues nuevamente en la sd de manera autom tica      
444,3.0 ,                       my dash cam originally included a   gb micro sd card for free  my dash cam has   cameras recording simultaneously and i realized that the capacity barely records    hours of footage  i came across this   gb mirco sd card which is the maximum capacity that my dash cam supports  but be careful when buying memory cards for dash cams  most dash cams have specification on what memory cards are supported  the package for this memory card was very difficult to open  despite sandisk giving guidance on where to cut to open  after cutting the perforations and failing to open  i ended up having to cut up the plastic package using a knife  another problem is that the card heats up faster than other sd cards  will update later  but i might need to upgrade to the sandisk high endurance version of the   gb mirco sd card if i encounter any issues in the future  another problem is that the card does not actually have   gb capacity  since about  gb is not usable  which is very misleading from the product description      
445,5.0 ,                       i got this for my wife s samsung galaxy s  so she could have more room for pictures  videos  music  and audiobooks  she s been using it for just over two weeks and it s been working great  like most of these cards  it comes with an adapter so it can be plugged into a computer or laptop  i used it once to try it out but i have a bunch of those adapters so after i verified it worked i just threw it the drawer with other stuff i don t use very often      
446,5.0 ,                       i ordered two of these cards and both arrived locked and unwritable  so i ordered a samsung card and it arrived unwritable  too  it came with a usb card reader so i tried that and the card now works properly  tried the sandisk cards in the usb reader and they work  too  so  my computer s built in card reader is dead  i believed that i had received fake cards but these are legit and work great in a functional card reader      
447,3.0 ,                       product was faulty on arrival as others have experienced  i was concerned it was no a genuine card as it has a lot of issues but i was able to use the serial number to receive a replacement from the manufacturer  which confirms its authenticity  the replacement card is functioning much better and have had no issues using it in the nintendo switch   i just wish there wasn t such a high rate of failure making a replacement necessary      
448,5.0 ,                       i ve always purchased sandisk cards for my devices in the past because they are reliable  this time i purchased this for my nintendo switch  works perfectly like always      
449,1.0 ,                       sandisk doesn t have a plain  ultra  line of microsdxc cards i found out  i ordered this    gb card for my cfw switch hoping to install games on it but found out it was just made to look like it was    gb  the real capacity of this card was   gb seeing as it had nothing but corrupt sectors after   gb when i ran hardware tests on it  the transfer speed was also an average of  mbps which is not what it was advertised for at all  it didn t even hold anything past   gb and would just error out despite windows and my devices saying there was    gb free  key thought  if its not                        gb or any of those multiples do not get it  it s most likely fake  ended up getting a    gb sandisk ultra plus sdxc from best buy and it works flawlessly vs this fake piece of junk i m returning      
450,4.0 ,                       i got this for my dash cam because it requires a memory card of at least    gb for some reason don t ask me  i had several memory cards but none of them were    gb and this particular format or whatever it is i couldn t find it on here for a while and then it became available and i got it as soon as i was able too      
451,5.0 ,                       i was slightly worried that my gopro would have trouble reading something this high capacity  but it s fine this thing can record   times the footage that i can possibly record before all my batteries run dry  so i don t ever have to worry about storage now  or mess around with multiple cards  or losing them      
452,5.0 ,                       i use this in an android phone and i use a lot of storage  i have around      full length albums between my phone storage and the sd  the sd ask has a app store download of its own called memory zone to help see where things are located and easily move or delete old items this is a lot of storage for a great price and the write read speed is very good  i had a lot of music on my laptop and old phone i wanted transfered to this sd card and it took no time at all i was very impressed if you look for the same item at the big box local retail stores they will charge an outragey price for the same card or even more for a card with less storsge and speed  i have a few hd movies on the card and they play flawlessly  i will be ordering more for some other devices i have      
453,3.0 ,                       straight out of the package   mine wasn t formatted exfat   quick format to exfat or ntfs failed  full format failed   times on a new win   laptop  but eventually worked on another win   laptop   at several  hours  per attempt  that took a minute here and there over a long holiday weekend   even i might have given up after fewer tries  but i had a slow db load running  and hoped to avoid the returns hassle   i haven t benchmarked its speed yet  but file write of very large files is much faster than to usb   device  at least in the ballpark of speeds with a samsung    gb microsd card   based on divergence of reviews  i suspect huge variation in what is shipped  but mine seems fine now      
454,5.0 ,                       not much to say other than to remark on the validity of the sd card i received through amazon actually being from sandisk sandisk is one of  if not the biggest  sd card manufacturer and the quality of their products is the golden standard  so capacity  performance  and reliability goes without saying for these sd cards  however  i have read quite a lot of reviews claiming that the ones they received were imposters and  while i do not claim they are mistaken or not  i can say that my    gb one i received from amazon seems to check out through every test i ve run it through amazon has quality customer care and product replacement return policies for the ginormous corporation they are  so if you have any issues with your product i m sure you can get it worked out within reason  there are a lot of different resources for checking the validity of sd cards online and you can find them all with a simple search on a quality search engine website  if you are concerned  i suggest going that route or contacting local it support to see what they can do for you pros sandisk  enough said  quality and performance cons obviously  verrry slim chance of the sd card being a fake  technology is amazing these days and there are people out there driven to make a quick buck if they ve got the materials and the know how  even giants like amazon can fall victim to these numerous and unethical kinds of practices happy with my purchase          gb sandisk sd card at a reasonable price      
455,5.0 ,                       i priced around and researched many hours for the outside video s and micro chips to use with them  this chip is high quality and large volume and priced economically   i access the micro chip quite a bit to monitor our little rv park and the quality of video s are excellent   the app i use has the ability to snap shot during viewing so when i open the snapshot and enlarge it the quality from this cop is excellent and that is using high def  not the super high ded  i can see faces and license plates clear as a bell i will add an addendum later for how long these chips hold up      
456,3.0 ,                       i bought this to go in a drograce kids camera for my   yr old s bday gift   he tried to pull the memory card out and it broke in half   you are supposed to push the card in and it pops out a little which allows you to take it all the way out   i know he should not have pulled to get it out  but i also don t think this should have broken just from his tiny fingers pulling on the card      
457,5.0 ,                       sandisk never has any issues with their products  they have great products  the    gb is great for phones  tablets  and other microsd capable devices  you can definitely find better products depending on the use but for the most part  it all comes down to minimal differences that the average consumer will not notice  hope you enjoy your    gb expanded memory with this card      
458,5.0 ,                       to be honest  i really didn t need one of these cards  but a decent brand name    gb micro sd card for the price of a nice dinner  i couldn t resist   i had to stretch to find a use for it  and i ended up using it to store and play my wii roms and plugged it into the back of my wii with a usb adapter   i copied over    gb of wii roms onto it and the average write speed  ntfs file system by the way  was around   mb s  not too bad imo   the load times of the roms on the wii are now noticeably faster than the magnetic usb hard drive they used to be stored on   i m sure there are faster flash cards out there  but as of now  i doubt they ll be        gb      
459,5.0 ,                       just did crystalmark against this finally using a usb  port and usb  card reader writer   screenshot of the results attached seeing    mbps read  sequential  and    mbps read  random seeing     mbps write  sequential  and   mbps write  random kind of disappointing write speeds  but i m using it for a raspberry pi so it works for me   i also have one in my roav dashcam      
460,5.0 ,                       i wished i open and test them early  i have another two cards to test to see if they are fake and they probably are since they are coming from the same source  good thing is i still have other sd cards i purchased in the past  i will update the review later updates the second failed too  the third one probably would failed  the other one on the left with the bigger hc i also failed  i have    gb  u       gb  black      gb  pixtor   and   gb are working  the   gb that has the bigger hc i is the only   gb that is working  what a waste of money  i am not sure even sure if i could get a refund but i will try tomorrow amazon system rejecting my attempt to get a replacement or refund for selling me fake sd cards  i have to call in  the last time i am getting bad quality item was the woods for my mattress which broken and splintered  how did these things slipping through amazon another updates i did use multiple files to copy over to the sd card  i even use windows iso which is less than  gb and other linux iso  none of them able to copy over to the sd card  you can also use fakeflashtest to test if your sd card is logically resize to make it looks big right now i am testing the new replacement sd cards which i just received today  i am using win   disk imager to write the data to it  i am hoping this time will will go through   will increase the star review once all three cards are tested and working updates         finally they all work  able to run ubuntu mate  kali and windows iot  for rasbian i am running on   gb version   stars for great customer service even when i received fake micro sd cards for the first shipment  amazon needs to screen those bad items      
461,5.0 ,                       nice add on for an older galaxy note    in my case  phone or any other phone that it works for  great way to store pics  images  music without using your main storage   like with any portable storage  make sure you back up any important data kiddies  because they sometimes fail without warning      
462,2.0 ,                       gave it   stars for   reasons    the bottom leather  pleather  did not stay on during shipping     the leather did not cover the top edge as shown in the picture  a friend bought these and his covers the top edge  see the picture for what i received  tired of sending things back to amazon so will keep but very disappointed  on the plus side  it fits snugly between the seat and the console      
463,4.0 ,                       this works amazingly well  tons of storage in one little package  i use it in my android phone  i record a lot of video  as with all electronic devices and these types of storage mediums  it worked great until it crashed   and that s why i only give it   stars  not that it crashed  but there is always the possibility lots and lots of storage  stores a lot of video  and if you only record audio  this thing will last forever  not literally  just hyperbole       
464,1.0 ,                       my disc failed after eight month it kept asking me to format  thinking that something was wrong i contacted sandisk customer service and provided them with all the information on this disk  like the manufacturer number   well it turns out they just informed me that this is a counterfeit product  and that they re not going to replace it so i m cautioning everyone that buys from this or buy sandisk products to be careful of counterfeit the seller is counterfeit seller      
465,5.0 ,                       i ordered this because i needed mega storage for my nintendo switch   i am not a      digital only buyer of games   but  i have an equal portion of physical and digital titles   when i popped this card in  i was given    gb to use total since some space is reserved by default   i downloaded all my games over again and even transferred all my games from the internal memory over to the card   in the end  i have   gb free on my internal memory and    gb free on my new    gb card   the biggest games i carry are doom  borderlands     and xcom   collection       the other games are mostly below   gb   as for digital titles total i downloaded onto this card  a total of      of course  you have updates as well to various games   overall  happy with this purchase and i still have plenty of space to put more games on this card      
466,5.0 ,                       i ve always been big on sandisk memory cards  they are fast  storage is good  never had any problems with device failure or loss of information  i buy multiples of different sizes for different needs depending on different electronic devices  i love that it came with the sd adapter as not all of them do  the most amazing thing is definitely the price  it was an extremely good deal  so glad i got it      
467,5.0 ,                       i installed this the other day into my new      kindle fire     it was easy to install  guided me through the reformat  and now it s working perfectly   i so excited that i was able to get     gb micro sd card for such a great price   thanks amazon update   i bought   of these as cards  and i installed the second one in my new kindle fire    it worked perfectly and i didn t have to reformat for this one  once it was in  it said i had     gb available  again  thanks amazon        
468,5.0 ,                       am not really sure if this product affects anything accept to save what s being recorded  i played back my footage from my security system and it was very clear as though watching live  i was able to erase some scenes with no problem  the disc locks in place with no problem  so i can say that i made a great purchase with this item and would recommend      
469,1.0 ,                       bought this back in june      and have been using it fir extra storage for my motorola e  play and it did work for a bit but after a couple of months i had a problem where i needed to reformat the card because something had happened  everything went well until just a couple of days ago  currently july      as of the writing  where when i would delete some pictures from my phone but they would reappear on my phone a couple of seconds later  i tried reformatting the card on my phone but now it says that the card is not supported and i can t reformat it on my pc because it does not appear there either  so for a short term solution this is not bad but there are other deals on the same capacity card      
470,5.0 ,                       definitely get this memory card for your nintendo switch lite   i bought this one because i love playing on my switch lite and downloading games  it s worth the money       
471,5.0 ,                       look  sandisk makes the best memory cards  i like these because they are fast  but not too expensive  compared to a normal sd card these are more versatile  i shoot a lot of video  and with the     gb you can get over   hours of  k video on the a iii  that is brilliant  watch for sales  i got my     gb cards for         i also own other variations as well  the     gb is another great option  i recently traveled to greece with two     gb disks and i shot video for   days  they are very reliable and take a while to fill up      
472,5.0 ,                       got this a while ago but forgot about it until i got my nintendo switch     gb one   i put it in and work perfectly fine   no formatting or anything required   switch read it fine playing dlc games  mario cart    darksiders series  ruiner  hades  apeout  all work perfectly fine and smooth   darksiders series have very long load times through out the game but plays smooth  hades only slow load at start up  mario cart   runs quick and smooth with no issues only regret is that i wish i bought the longer capacity     gb      gb is fine for now but first party nintendo games are large so i ll need another one soon recommended and confirmed it works on the nintendo switch      
473,4.0 ,                       bought this to go with the new tablet i bought during the black friday  it works well after i insert the card into my tablet and the speed is enough for running apps and storing pictures and media files  one issue though  my computer can t access the micro sd card through the sd card reader  it tells me that the card needs to be formatted before use but failed to format  i can only transfer files from computer to this card while the card is inserted into the phone and the phone is connected to the computer      
474,5.0 ,                       bought four sandisk ultra   gb micro sdxc uhs i cards  all tested correctly for storing       gb with f write and f read  the packaging guarantees   mb s writes  the card works at about   mb s sequential writes    mb s sequential reads have not tested long term reliability yet but sandisk promises about        writes  that s about    years of nonstop writes at  mb s or four years at the rated   mb s nonstop  with perfect wear leveling  seems very reasonable for a     investment      
475,5.0 ,                       this works in a tf headphone unit   after hours of research  i m still stupid on how the tf and micro sd differ the unit nowhere says tf  so i took a chance and it did work   it supremely tiny      hard to install  and harder toremove mkay headphones design at fault   it s unbelieveable that these go up to   tb              
476,5.0 ,                       always get your sd cards from reliable merchants such as sandisk  i have bought several third party electronics items with generally good experiences  but got burned when i bought microsd cards that crapped out and lost a lot of my data and pictures  if you re buying this  make sure you re buying it from sandisk  and not from another seller  a reliable    gb chip at less than    bucks is awesome  especially when it comes with a warranty      
477,4.0 ,                       encuentro  sta memoria muya r pida  pero creo que pronto deber  reemplazar por la cantidad de material que guardo en el celular  es incre ble que que  sta cosa tan peque a tenga la misma capacidad de mi unidad ssd de mi computadora port til a esperara que bajen de precio para comprar una con m s capacidad      
478,3.0 ,                       it s an awesome card  but what they don t tell you is that it  by default  is formatted as exfat when it needs to be formatted as fat    native windows    won t allow you to do that  i purchased a copy of easeus partition manager to do it  but the free download  according to a youtube video  will work as well  once it has been formatted as fat   with a good partition manager  be sure to run a surface test on the microsd card  it s a lengthy process  but after doing both  i no longer get  memory card errors  or format errors from my dashcam dvr and the video and pictures record flawlessly at all resolutions      
479,1.0 ,                       update  i spoke too soon  after a few days later  this card failed on me  i could neither access any files on it from my palmtop pc nor from my desktop pc with the message  the file or directory is corrupted and unreadable    i had to run a chkdsk to fix bad sectors on the card  i took off   star because of this issue cheapest brand name micro sd card at this capacity  i used it in my gpd win   handheld pc  now i can have half a terabyte palmtop pc in my pocket all the time  forget about laptops and notebooks which are too big to carry these days      
480,1.0 ,                       this card corrupted after an andriod update   i tried to reformat it and after days of troubleshooting i ve come to belief that it is not the real thing   compared to another micro sd card that i have  the serial   is stamped on the back on this fake one   the real sd card  has the a sticker on the back that displays the serial number   if you get one of these and it doesn t have the sticker on the back return it immediately  if you look at the front of my fake sd card  the a  logo is missing as well as a few other differences   this is not the same as the one pictured in the product description   i m disappointed in amazon for not vetting their supplier as i ordered directly from amazon and not a third party seller      
481,4.0 ,                       i bought this micro sd card since i planned to get some digital games on my new switch  i tested the card on pc with crystaldisk and it had the capacity and read write speeds advertised the only issue i have with the card is that it is hard to remove from microsd slots  including the sd converter it comes with  the plastic groove on the removal end does not provide enough grip to remove easily  it often takes me a few tries to remove the card from my switch so i can transfer photos to my pc  i don t recall having this issue with my phone microsd  but i do not remove that one often  other than this the card works great      
482,4.0 ,                       this card was delivered with exfat formatting  i have never had a card delivered that way   i just bought a new computer and i was beginning to think it was defective because nothing was working right  it turned out to be the card s formatting  i had to reformat the card ntsf erasing everything it took hours to put on it  then put everything back on it to work the way i wanted  wasted so much of my time      
483,5.0 ,                       love it especially for the price i got it at     
484,1.0 ,                       bought this card back in       for my dash cam  installed in my dash worked fine since i m able to delete from my camera settings i nevered removed the card  today i removed to try to upload some video to my computer well guess what it doesn t work files say audio only  and i tried it on   different computers  and to top that off it s not even a   gb it came in around     thanks again amazon for wasting my money     
485,5.0 ,                       i bought this for my dash camera because my previous lower end sd card  also a sandisk  just decided one day to quit working  this seems to be solving the issue  as soon as i put it in and turned the camera back on  it was recording with no issue  i have the dash camera set to loop record and after around   months of recording over and over  it just stopped and said memory full  i tried erasing everything and starting over but it would still say memory full  that s why i believe it was my old sd card to blame      
486,5.0 ,                       i use this for my nintendo switch  it formatted with no problem and allowed me close to    gb for storage space  the packaging seemed a bit dirty and beat up  but underneath the sealed parts  everything was in perfect condition  this is the best bang for your buck regarding speed  storage size  and price for the switch      
487,1.0 ,                       sandisk is a brand product and i was expecting the usual quality  but the one i got is toast already just comes up as bad  and i use it to record quadcopter flights and half of them come out as corrupted trying right now to resurrect it  but i think it s fried oh well  buy another one and take this one as the one you will get sooner or later that is a dud      
488,1.0 ,                       usually i have had excellent results from sandisk products   this is first product that was disappointing   unfortunately i didn t open the pkg until return period had passed   since it has a warranty  i am applying for an rma to return it to san disk   we ll see if they stand behind their otherwise excellent product line      
489,1.0 ,                       i got this micro sd card in order to transfer some music files onto my phone  and have them available on the sd card along with perhaps some e books later on down the line  unfortunately  once i received this in the mail  it has never worked properly  often it skips over files  and those files that it managed to copy over were often corrupted  even then it made copying errors for what it manage to copy  such as album art corruption  and strangely enough creating separating out files in new folders  something which does not make sense and something i have never seen anything technology related do  for reference  i bought a     gb or so for the drive itself  and was moving about    gb of music onto there eventually i believed it was a scam  and so tested it using h w  h w managed to write the appropriate amount of gb fake files down  but over half of the data was unusable  either being lost or corrupted  i have put the results in my review as evidence  the usable data space is so unpredictable  and not capable of keeping the    gb of music  that it is utterly useless to me as storage of any kind  thank goodness i didn t use it for precious photos or something irreplaceable  and just wanted my media collection on the go i am unsure whether it was a bootleg or not  but i suspect it might ve been one  the packaging  which would be the most tell tale sign  was alas burned by my husband  upon checking the sd adapter and the card itself  the sd adapter did not have a serial while the sd card itself did it has failed to do as it promised  and i will think twice about buying another electronic device off of amazon  as this is the second time that this website has left me with complete garbage when it comes to technology        do not buy      
490,5.0 ,                       i bought this to enable more games to be stored on  my switch  considering the relatively small data sizes of switch games  i am able to have dozens of games installed at once  which is super convenient  also  it s as simple as popping it into its slot and you re ready to roll  very satisfied      
491,1.0 ,                       i used to hold sandisk at the highest regard when it came to memory cards  however after having to replace   memory cards in a short amount of time    months  i don t feel the same  i ordered this back in may     it is now september  the memory card was for my phone and became completely unresponsive  the device not able to read it  i was able to recover files but unable to format it for further use  this is the second time i have had this issue with a sandisk memory card  i am highly disappointed     
492,5.0 ,                       highly satisfied with my purchase  i took   of these to iceland with me for my vacation and i accidentally partitioned one of of them  when i got back to us i used ease us and was able to recover over an hour of footage of me and my boyfriend snorkeling in silfra  rewatching the footage it was crystal clear and no lag at all      
493,1.0 ,                       well  i m sure it s too late now but i need to warn others  i purchased this card about ten months ago for use with a raspberry pi  i pulled the thing out of my box o  sd cards and plopped an image on it  after hours of tinkering to figure out why i couldn t get the thing to boot  i ran some tests  the speed is abysmal      mbps  and the capacity isn t being reported correctly by any os i plug the thing in to  it s definitely counterfeit  the real mind blower is that it was sold by amazon and came in what appeared to be real  retail  packaging  when you can t even trust  sold by amazon  items  why bother shopping here anymore      
494,5.0 ,                       speeds up operating system boot time  as well as those long ass update procedures standard  yr old usb     usb stick  as well as a standard   gb microsd card  took almost   hours to install updates on the raspberry pi with this card  it took a mere       minutes a  cards are not really supported on the pi   this a  card is a must have for small file and higher iops      
495,5.0 ,                       overall  i am very happy with this larger capacity microsd card  it holds a large amount of data and information  along with the discounted price make for a great buy  although i m aware that there are fakes popping up  the one i received wasn t one of them and has continued to work without issue or problem  even looking at getting a  nd one for another device as having    gb of storage pretty appealing      
496,5.0 ,                       i installed this on my    inch fire tablet   it recognized it  it formatted just fine and then i transferred my books and magazines to the sdcard   however  two days later the fire table gave me an error message saying it had  accidentally   removed it   i could not see any problem   the sd card was still in and had not  accidentally  been removed   has anyone had a problem with this microsd card or with the fire tablet regarding this issue      
497,5.0 ,                       i m very happy buying sandisk micro sd cards  this is not my first  and won t be my last as i constantly seem to acquire devices that use them  have not had one fail on me yet  and they all keep up with the speed demands of the devices whether it s for cameras  tablets  phones  or gaming  currently using this one for a sky  ds  cartridge and it doesn t skip a beat      
498,1.0 ,                       my pc is telling me this is an invalid device  so i put it into the sd card adapter and tried again and again it tells me there is no device  it sees the adapter and the usb reader and assigns a drive letter but says there is not a valid device  so i figure maybe i need to format it  it says there is no device to format i did order a new micro sd card reader just to verify its not my sd card reader  if it is my reader and it is able to read the micro sd card i will change my review to an appropriate review at that time  i am afraid its not going to be any better  i saw others leaving similar reviews but thought maybe they were somehow leaving it on the wrong item since this is supposed to be sandisk  never had a problem with a sandisk item but maybe this is not a real sandisk   what made me think this is when i tried to use the sd card adapter and saw it was a very low quality adapter and was very hard to insert the micro sd card into it      
499,5.0 ,                       this little thing is incredible  i installed it in my nintendo switch and after a quick update the switch quickly recognized the sd card  i mean that it was about a   minute job  open the package  put the sd card in  and update the switch  so easy i was so relieved  and the price of the sd card was very reasonable         it was the deal of the day  so happy with my purchase  anybody with a nintendo switch should get one of these small wonders  thanks you for reading my review      
500,1.0 ,                       i bought this thinking that i would be able to just activate a couple of days before the trip  and just change out sim cards upon landing for use   that was far from the case here   i received a text message upon activation  and thought that this would successfully set up service   when i landed at my destination and changed sim cards  nothing worked   no phone   no internet   no text messages i attempted to use the help number that was provided with this kit  only to be informed that the phone number that i was assigned was not an orange number  and refused to assist me further   i did not have an opening during my trip to visit an outlet store during their limited opening hours  and so i went without a phone for the duration of my trip i know that products like this may be hit and miss   for me  this was a huge miss   do yourself a favor  and get your sim card from a physical storefront or booth after you land   this way  you can know immediately if something doesn t work  and someone present can work with you to get it to work      
501,1.0 ,                       i purchased a total of     gb sandisk micro sd xc  cards     of which were purchased as a   pack   all of which were used for amcrest security cameras   it hasn t been a year and   of the   cards went bad   i ve tested and tried reformatting the cards via security camera  windows pc  and mac   the cards just failed and no longer read or write although the price was great at the time  even better now   i highly regret making the purchase   that s a     failure rate   horrible quality and not reliable   i do not recommend this particular memory card      
502,5.0 ,                       i just received this package today and as soon as i did  i inserted it into my laptop  formatted it for ntfs  and then ran a full test with h testw exe  the total time to run the test was between   and three hours  the sd card passed the test       the program  h testw  filled the sd card with blocks of data and then read them back verifying each one  in this way it both verified the total capacity of the card as well as its integrity  in light of the amount i paid for this card i can only say that it is a great value  i would certainly recommend it given my experience with it so far update  i will add that the measured speeds of the sd card were less than the posted speeds  they ranged from    mb s to    mb s  that is quite a lot less than the claimed speed  i still find the card acceptable though because a  the actual speeds are quite good as it is and b  to expect a card of this capacity and price to operate at those claimed speeds is unrealistic      
503,5.0 ,                       we have tried many other discount microsd cards in the     gb and  tb claimed   and those other cheap ones are scams  at least with sandisk you get a name brand you can trust   and it s earned that trust   of our phones  samsung s  and lg g   have the sandisk    gb  one with the a  and another a  type memory  the a  is snappier   faster to load the data for apps do not buy the cheap     gb cards   while they may say they have that capacity and work for a while   they will all hit a limit  some as low as   gb of actual storage capacity  we learned that you can actually tell the computer how much storage you want to display on any hard drive   and then it shows your used storage percentage of that number with an actual    gb sandisk   that s how much they have  it s real just be sure to buy it direct from amazon or an official reseller or you may get a fake sandisk   which is where most bad reviews come from   fake cards      
504,5.0 ,                       i m always hesitant when ordering sd cards on amazon  as i ve received a fraudulent card in the past   i read a few reviews for this product saying that they received fakes as well  but i think some of these may be due to a card reader that can t handle    gb sd cards   before ordering  make sure your sd card reader is capable of reading formatting a card of this size anyways  i used this in a raspberry pi build and it works perfectly      
505,5.0 ,                       bought this for my paralenz underwater camera that shoots up to  k   fps my camera manufacturer says    gb v   is the required max but this card is rated for a min of   mb sec   and the write speed is undocumented publicly after contacting sandisk  with transfer speeds to    mb sec maybe they won t release write speeds because it performs so well they don t want it competing with their faster rated cards      just speculation of course but this card performs flawless    not only in my galaxy note   phone but also in my camera  leave it formatted in the default exfat and your good after much research it appears its only weakness may be in burst abilities for use as internal memory but sustained transfer rates are great     so much so that  k     fps video was no problem in testing i m also astonished this card works so well in my note    i had a    gb sandisk in before and this definitely feels faster at this point i have the highest recommendations for this card     you can now store mass amounts of  k footage     according to my tests so far  about     hrs of  k      fps i ve found other brands often give similar speeds as compared to sandisk but fail miserably long term in reliability     do you really want     gb worth of stuff lost because you wanted to save a few bucks with another brand sandisk is the most reliable imo and it s amazing they remain at the front of the pack it s not the fastest dog out of the gate that wins  but the one who can make it to the finish line first i own   of these now i can film    k     fps and put    one hour dives in a week long dive vacation and i only use about    gig its great not having to tote a big laptop on my trips i have one just for backup too on my trips    haven t had to use it yet      
506,1.0 ,                       you heard it once you you ll hear it again  you get what you pay for  never used it until now on my gopro   at a wedding and wouldn t you know it    times it says sd card is corrupt please reformat  lost great memories and please  just don t buy it as tempting as it is  i don t write many reviews but i do when i don t want others to experience what i went through  buyer beware   obviously it s past my return policy so i m stuck with a brick of a sd card         
507,4.0 ,                       i ve had chips of this size fail on me before  so i m holding my breath this time  hoping they ve improved quality  i had several projects i needed to combine into one chip i could pop in and take out of my laptop when i needed to work on them  this had enough memory to hold all of those projects in one place  but just to be safe  i keep copies on a  t external hard drive  it s not that i don t trust these microchips    it s that i don t trust these microchips  i ve just had too many of them fail on me  so i have chip failure anxiety every time i push it into my laptop      
508,5.0 ,                       the price was right on this product and it s not a knock off or low quality   when i found out my phone can be upgraded to a    gb microsd card  i was stoked but thought i d have to pay way more than approx       my boyfriend has the same phone and mine worked so well that we bought it again   being able to add a   year guarantee if data is lost for just    was the absolute best   i ve made the mistake of buying low quality sd cards before and have lost so many pictures so i am very glad that this one has a promise backing it   i should note that when we bought my boyfriend s sd card  the price had dropped by about      so keep an eye out  the price is usually under       last  i like that it comes with the microsd card reader  too   one of my laptops has a reader slot for the larger adapter so it s super useful for quickly getting data off of it   totally stoked that i found this      
509,5.0 ,                       samsung galaxy s  in search of massive memory upgrade  just got made   sandisk    gb microsd card installed in less than    minutes using sim card and microsd card access key   nominal     gb card reads at    gb storage  which is to be expected   more good news is that it was simple to transfer hundreds of photos and mp  music file from the pc directly to the sandisk microsd card   highly recommend installing sandisk s proprietary  meimory zone  app from the android play store   now  all of your pc photos and mp  files organized and quickly accessible from the samsung galaxy s    go big  sandisk    gb microsd card  or go home                             
510,5.0 ,                       there are many fake memory cards out there   i even purchased one that was supposed to be    gig and it only tested at   gig   this seems to be a common practice where the manufacture will print anything on the card and hack the allocation tables to show much more memory than is actually usable on the card   this results in data loss which could be very important  photos or videos  i m happy to report that the card i received passed the tests with h testw   this is a free memory card test app that runs on a pc   so i am pleased with my purchase      
511,5.0 ,                       bought it for my new      roku ultra  it was reformatted by roku easily and it did an update on all the apps  works great  saw many reviews when it did not work on an earlier version of roku  it did work on the new      roku ultra     gb may be large for what i need but was cheaper that the  gb on amazon for roku      
512,5.0 ,                       i m a huge music fan  i ve been collecting music since       i used to always carry a hard cover cd case which contained cds   cases  once i got to      this became cumbersome  i reluctantly switched to cd books  now i could carry a lot more music  however  once i got past     this also became cumbersome  around this time mp  players came out  problem solved  even with the advent of  smartphones  i still clung to my dedicated mp  player  once i caved and got a smartphone i still kept my dedicated mp  players  eventually i caved on that as well and began using winamp  switched to mediamonkey a few yrs ago when winamp died  rip    now i m introduced to a new problem  due to the size of the storage options available i couldn t bring all of my music with me  currently about   gb   k  songs   larger memory cards were pretty expensive so i limited myself to the   gb cards and only synced playlists  tbh i ve never been a huge fan of this playlist thing  i liked just having all of my music and randomly picking albums i felt like listening to  the playlist thing forced me to limit myself which was very annoying years later  the prices have dropped significantly  this is what i ve been waiting for warning  be sure to format this card with the exfat standard which supports large sizes  regular exfat will have you pissed off once you start going over a certain amount  haha  the files simply will fail to transfer      
513,1.0 ,                       sorry for the late review as i m quite busy so here s my review i won t recommend it and here s the reason why  i m using samsung s    it reads the microsd card  perfectly but when you transfer movies  mp  files  from phone to the microsd  you won t be able to play the file from microsd  i bought this microsd specifically to make a folder of movies when i go somewhere with no internet  so in short  don t buy it  this is very frustrating but i put three stars because sometimes it works but most of the times it doesnt  i don t give   star to even a garbage products  i give three to this one because it might be that my microsd card is an isolated case  hopefully they will contact me update they re customer service sucks  they don t care at all  i just bought the one from samsung microsd and its working perfectly unlike this one  i don t know if what i ve got is a defect but they re customer service doesn t care  save your money buy other brands  or just dont buy    gb microsd from sandisk   read alot of badreviews online specially from samsung users      
514,3.0 ,                       i purchased this product for my nintendo switch  the games do not load fast  i took this sd card out tested it under the windows environment on my laptop using some software  and was disappointed on the read write speeds      
515,3.0 ,                       i had purchased a     gig a  before  h testw results were    read    write mbps  i purchased another for my kids tablet  i tested the new one and the results are    read     write  tested twice  once with the included adapter and once with a usb     micro sd card reader  same results  i saw others with the same problem and it seems like a big risk trying again  i went with silicone power a     gb  this one has better speed results for the same price     
516,1.0 ,                       i had purchased this card to setup my raspberry pi and it did not work correctly  i used someone else s sd card and the pi booted up right away but this card wont even get detected by my windows    machine   too bad i found out about this recently and can no longer issue a refund      
517,1.0 ,                       this sd card did well for about   months then started to act weird on me    i ve tried using it with   different phones now and none of them can delete or reformat the card  it s a weird situation honestly   i can play music from it on   of the phones but the other read it as corrupted  so basically this thing is useless now        
518,5.0 ,                       after reading other reviews and seeing their photos of fake cards  i was suspicious  but a sale price for    gb seemed worth the gamble    as long as i could truly test the card carefully as soon as i got it  so i went ahead and purchased  it shipped sooner than promised  and though amazon logistics missed their promised delivery date  it still got here sooner than expected  i tested the card via windows free apps  fakeflashtest and h testw  under parallels   the card checks out for the advertised capacity      gb formatted ex fat   and averaged    mb s write and   mb s read  great  it is fast enough to benefit from a usb  sd adapter reader  in spite of having to check so carefully  i am pleased      
519,4.0 ,                       mine appears to be genuine   it factored out at about   gb and comparing speeds with my other a   class    card  the read write was about   mb   your mileage will vary depending on what the hardware you re using and various other factors but guaranteed  it won t come close to    mb   if you want a faster card  buy the  u   for twice as much   i can t say if the card is that great but i ve been using the same type card in a dashcam for over a year now and no issues so far even though temps in the truck probably average    f most of the summer   can t say that about other versions of the card from sandisk   btw  personally i ve never had any luck using these cards for sandisk with  k action cams   lots of streaking  pixalation and skips   cam vs card  i can t tell because i won t spend twice as much for a faster card      
520,1.0 ,                       the card would not work in any device  phone  tablet  pc  unless i put it into the adapter and used the sd slot on my desktop  it actually tested out to be a   gb card  using h testw  but ran very slowly  at first i thought it might be counterfeit but after some detective work i think it was just defective  amazon promptly refunded my money      
521,5.0 ,                       i purchased this item to plug into my new  th gen kindle fire   i was expecting to have to manually move all the installed apps to the sdcard like i had to do with my cell phone   i was quite surprised when  as soon as the kindle fire detected the new card  it immediately began moving all of the apps that i had installed onto it   this only took a few minutes and i m quite happy with the result   i have no problem accessing the sdcard using es file explorer app  as well as the fire s internal storage      
522,3.0 ,                       i bought this to add more memory to my tablet first of all when i inserted the card into my tablet it said it was corrupted so then my daughter formatted  the card and it was fine it was not full to capacity and yet it started stating when i would move files or whatever over there was no space well time is passed and i can t return it so i m stuck with it i just have what i have on it i bought another tablet so i m going to try this again i hope this time that i don t get a defective products but i do know now that if it says corrupt put it back in the package and send it back  i love amazon i buy everything that i can from amazon and since i m a agoraphobic i do a lot of online shopping and amazon is by go to but sometimes even amazon can be a miss thank you     
523,5.0 ,                       the definition of big things in small packages  this product is truly a value for its price offering  it allowed my android phone to have at least    times more expandable memory so i can stream my shows and download my apps on my device at an much more accelerated pace  it arrived on a big manilla envelope with bubble wrap to ensure its safety  i can not have much more to say about this product  it has definitely improved the quality of my downtime when i just want time for myself on my device      
524,5.0 ,                       as i get newer laptops or   in   devices i find it necessary to add more storage  and with these devices now having sd or microsd slots  its is very simple to add ssd storage in a pinch  i use sandisk memory cards are they always work and i never have had any issues with them failing prematurely  however  like any good housekeeping  you should always have backups of any important data saved in multiple places  just in case      
525,1.0 ,                       i bought a few of these over time and used them as needed for my home automation raspberry pi setups  go to open one up today and struggle with the stupid package they use on these cards  one package  it opens up no problem by pushing the card against the thin plastic that looks like its supposed to rip  the second one   not so much  the stupid thin plastic was strong enough to force the sd card itself to split in half  horrible packaging design  good luck opening carefully without breaking the card itself  this was after i used scissors to get down to the card and the thin layer itself      
526,5.0 ,                       i needed a lot of storage capacity for a small price  and this was an excellent choice  i got a couple of these  planning to use them for a handheld game and maybe a phone  i ended up using one in my computer as a memory to burn images from a pet scan that was over   gigs and i didn t have anything else to burn it onto at the moment  i ll be able to burn many more images on to this disk in the future  awesome storage      
527,3.0 ,                       bought this in      and used it in my android for   years  i upgraded to a    gb microsd and after i transferred this card to another device an error popped up showing it as write protected  so  thankfully i was able to copy out of the card all my information  however the card could no longer be used for its purpose  i went through every suggestion online of how to disable the write protection  and formatting  and converting  using software  device manager  command prompt  etc  nothing worked sandisk has advised write protection on a micro sd card isn t something that can be removed once there  and so they will allow a return and replacement for my card  just placing this as a warning for those who purchase this  be aware this might happen  and if it does don t waste time with the different suggestions online  just contact sandisk and be done with it      
528,4.0 ,                          edit   i originally thought my card died  these get very slow once close to full if you think your card has died after loading data on to it wait a long time for the card to be seen   appear on the screen  the delete some data and it should work again  mine became very slow around    gb   needed to be cleared a bit to function fast   smooth again      
529,1.0 ,                       returning  within a week it became corrupted and couldn t be recognized by any of my devices or pc s  unable to recover any data  i m beginning to think maybe the reviewers who are saying these or some of these may be fakes could possibly be true  sandisk is a good brand and i ve never had one do this to me  think i ll just buy my next one at wally world just to be safe      
530,5.0 ,                       sandisk  in my opinion  makes the most reliable memory cards   i have found an odd way to find out how well the cards function   if the battery for a camera  my main use  is low but still functions the camera the card should still record data   some cards won t   i learned that the hard way and lost images as the data wasn t recorded      
531,5.0 ,                       decent storage and works well for my switch  no different from loading using cartridge or very slightly slower than using the built in storage space  but the difference is trivial to its value  i can fill it up with     gb games with a couple of undies and i still have around   gb remaining  i m considering getting a    gb once i have enough games to require such thing     
532,5.0 ,                       i ve never had a sandisk card or drive go bad until i bought one on amazon in may to use in a security camera   it failed after less than two months so i read reviews and was surprised at the number of complaints about phony cards recently i received two new    gb micro cards and both seem to be good   in comparing the bad card to the new ones  it s easy to see differences in the printing on the card   in the attached picture  the bad card is on top   one of the new cards below      
533,1.0 ,                       i was really hoping this was a real san disk card  it was not  font on chip did not match official sandisk and the website on the package was not sandisk com  transfer speeds are slow  thanks for returning the item  tried to use for raspberry pi images  transfer took   days for     gb image      
534,1.0 ,                       this is not a review of the sandisk ultra    gb microsdxc   i have bought more than one of them and they work fine   however  this last one i received is a fake   it s actually only   gb  unfortunately i didn t check until after i had lost my security cam footage  beware   and anytime you buy one from anywhere you should run a diagnostic program on it to see its true capacity      
535,5.0 ,                       i have almost    gb worth of music that i wanted to have in my player  so i got this card first time around sometime last year  worked great  so once i needed the same music on my phone this time  i didn t think twice  problem is  that i didn t look at the description carefully and i bought the card elsewhere   same one except for one thing   it was not a   my songs were not copied properly  disappeared and what not so i promptly returned the other card and bought this one again   no issues whatsoever  so  as per title   this one is great for heavy use  fast transfer  no losses don t make the same mistake i did and buy this card      
536,1.0 ,                       i realized   day outside of the return window that although the cards physically have printed on them that they are    gb  they aren t even a full   gb capacity   i bought these to use in a trail cam  and i thought the cam was formatting the cards to the cams max capacity   it wasn t until today  when i was reviewing the photos that i realized it was the cards max capacity  and it didn t have anything to do with the trail cam   i verified that there was not unclaimed space for the drive also   shame on me for not checking sooner  and this is why i usually always buy things like this at physical stores or directly from a company on the web because amazon usually has counterfeit junk like this when it comes to electronics  and accessories      
537,3.0 ,                           gb is really     gb  while  technically  the card does contain     gigabytes of storage  as in     billion bytes   this is misleading since operating systems have never reported the actual number of bytes this way  rather  they use the binary system where one gb is      to the third power or               bytes  mount this card on any operating system and the amount of storage is shown as     mb  this is what we are all used to since computing devices were invented and these cards are used in these computing devices that report their capacity in the binary form  so why continue the deception  more sales equals more money  or  put another way  one company started doing it and now they all do it and no one company will do it correctly for fear that they will lose their competitiveness when i read the manual for my device and it says  maximum capacity allowed on the sd card is x gb   then i trust that i need to get an sd card that is x gb if i want to fully utilize that feature  i don t want have to try to figure out that  to get x gb  i have to look for a card that has x         gb  in fact  you can t even get a card that has x         gb because the manufacturers make cards with capacities like                         etc  so  essentially  we re getting screwed out of some percentage of storage because the card manufacturers want to play a different game than the entire rest of the industry      
538,3.0 ,                       update  august           tuesdayafter a purchasing this same memory card from another buyer  it s been shown that some of those micro sd cards have to be compatible on both the device being used to record  and the one used to replay playback the recordings  to access the full span of the    gb  some devices  like the security camera i purchased the micro sd card for  can only read up to   gigs of memory no matter how much memory is on the card  so it is possible that i was using a device that can only read up to   gigs at a time  i haven t repurchased this item from this supplier so as not to leave it up to chance  although i will update them from   stars to   stars simply due to my own lack of knowledge at the time  perhaps their product did work as expected   possibly     original post i purchased what i thought was this item on friday november         and thought it was a great deal because it was cheap  i read other reviews about even cheaper ones selling for        that said those were a scam and not the actual product  so i thought that since this one was priced at        at the time  that this one was legit  this memory card is not the    gb micro sd card as advertised  to make sure i was not falling victim to the scams the other reviews talked about  i tried to transfer something well over   gigs      gigs  just to be sure  it told me i needed      more gigs to copy it  that s strange      seeing as how this is advertised as a    gb micro sd memory card  again  this is not the    gb micro sd memory card as advertised    do not buy this if you think you re getting a good bargain  that s not this product         
539,1.0 ,                       i recieved my sd card and put it in my tablet right away  it does not work  keeps saying it has been removed  and then says it is blank  so  thinking something was wrong with my tablet i tried it in my phones  guess what   same thing   i am so upset my son was so excited to get more room in his tablet and plus amazon will not refund or replace saying this item is non returnable ha  thanks guys      
540,5.0 ,                       i come from a background where i shot hasselblad for many years and had to be aware of changing film backs every    shots  even back in the early days of digital with    mb and  gb cf cards i was pleased to be able to shoot several dozen shots before changing cards   imagine how i feel with my canon  dmkiii where i can get nearly      shots on a single card though for my cameras i would prefer an solid card instead of a mini with adapter  this setup works fine with no failures   i thought it was a very good buy  especially remembering when we d spend hundreds for very small capacity cards      
541,2.0 ,                       the micro sandisk came packaged with the smaller disk outside the adapter   when i put the micro disk inside the adapter it got stuck and i was unable to remove it   tried using a pair of tweezers but it would not budge   it would not show up as active when in a usb port   either defective at the outset  or putting it inside the adapter rendered it defective   as the price was minimal i did not attempt compensation  and or covid    hit  rendering this small problem meaningless      
542,5.0 ,                       i have pretty much switched all our sd usd cards to sandisk  i ve tried a number of different brands  some of which were not really the capacity listed on the outside  e g  a   gb card that actually only had a capacity of   gb  or had bad sectors  e g  the first  gb were fine  but above that  whole blocks of memory were bad  this card is fast  both on the computer using a usb to sd card adapter and in our cameras  we ve yet to lose a photo using these cards and the camera cycles quickly shot to shot overall  an excellent choice for camera or general storage use      
543,1.0 ,                           gb card is actually only      that is almost    gigs less than advertised      card is actually    gb  i know the reason sandisk is doing this is because in the old days many believed   gigabyte was      mb  but it is now commonly understood that   gb is      mb  the reasoning behind this false advertising is  absurd because no human is capable of manually counting the memory megabyte by megabyte      
544,5.0 ,                       i received the correct product   i was not deceived   i had concerns about ordering a micro sd card because after reading some the reviews i discovered people are receiving fake sd cards   i was concerned about ordering a    gb micro sd card and it s actually a   gb micro sd card  but my micro sd card was actually a    gb sd card      
545,2.0 ,                       this didn t work for me   i tried using it with my roku and it doesn t seem compatible   i m thinking i need to actually order it through roku so  it may work well for others  but not roku   i gave it two stars because maybe it works well with other brands      
546,5.0 ,                       i ve bought many sandisk products over the years and have been happy with them  this is no exception  it does what it is supposed to do and does it automatically and well      
547,5.0 ,                       i have   android tablets and i find it is best to have     th of memory  as there is more out there to download and me rd entertainment apps    th just doesn t do it anymore  i always get the extended warranty bin case i get a bad chip which has not happened to me personally get with this brand  i personally highly recommend this chip as it works great for me           
548,5.0 ,                       not all sd cards are created equal  there are cheaper cards  but if you need a high speed card for video as required by many phones and tablets  this is the one to get  slower cards may be fine for mp  audio and low resolution video  but if you want to be able to read the text in a video or see the details of a subtle change of expression  then you re going to need a card capable of transferring all that data to the screen without stuttering  sandisk is a leader in memory production at a reasonable price  i ve purchased   of these cards for my devices and none have ever so much as hiccupped once  when it comes to my phone or tablets  there are only two brands i trust with my data storage  and sandisk is one of them      
549,3.0 ,                       i bought this micro sd to use with my dash cam  but maybe i should have read the reviews before  whenever i try to open the files on my computer the reading takes or hangs  when i can open the files  one or two seem to be corrupted  for now i will give   stars and continue testing the product to rethink my evaluation      
550,1.0 ,                       i bought a dashcam from you   the sd card was not included   ordered the     sd card  learned the     has to be formatted in a computer  with no sd slot in computer  you need to buy a reader to plug in like a usb   i ordered haven t receive yet   have my doubts if that will work  as i read if your computer is older it still won t accept that  if it doesn t will return the     and get a    and see if it works   the     had been recommended when i bought the dashcam   i didn t learn the above from the sd book of directions   tried amazon help both online and by talking to   techs and by googling and reading what others had tried   too much time spent on something that should be so simple  they need someone else to write directions   the dashcam is hooked up and waiting  it s a great dashcam except because of the sd problem  can t save anything so basically not any good either   may have to return that too      
551,2.0 ,                       i bought this to expand the memory on my samsung galaxy core prime smartphone   i used the carrier to insert the old chip in my laptop  copy all the contents into a folder and then copy them back into the new chip  the problems i keep having is the new chip does not always stay mounted  even if i download the apps from the google play store instead of doing the laptop copy it still does not stay mounted  works ok in my laptop  just not with my phone   and yes i did check the phone specs to make sure it could handle this amount of memory      
552,4.0 ,                       their stated write speeds are a lol number  this thing iis dependable  it holds as much as they say it will  but write speeds are slow  all in all its worth it of you don t mind a could of hours to fill it with music  i just copied ands went to bed that night and i ve been using it ever since  it works perfectly in my player  and these are        resolution files     
553,5.0 ,                       summary   the sandisk ultra    gb seamlessly adds what amounts to unlimited storage for your phone  i ve had it installed and working well on a      samsung note                          for the last three months after putting the sandisk ultra    gb in place on my      samsung note                           i don t think i ll ever run out of space on my phone  i love this  i never really have to download pictures or video from my phone  and i can permanently store whatever movies  documents  or other files i wish   even after shooting thousands of photos and hours of video  i have hundreds of gigabytes of free space left on the samsung note    the    gb card reports       gb of free space after formatting  using a speed testing application  my card reports write speeds of    mb s and read speeds of    mb s suggestions   after purchase  get an sd card speed testing application to verify that your card isn t fake  and that its performance approaches sandisk s hyped theoretical maximum  don t be put off if you don t reach     mb s or whatever the advertised maximum speed might be  you just want to be somewhere in the ballpark   if you are using android  you can download an excellent sd cart testing application from the play store called  sd card test    on some android devices you can further verify that you have a legitimate  not fake  card by downloading an application called sd insight  note this app is not compatible with the galaxy note   and some other late model android devices  note  i was  not  solicited to write this review  and i bought this product with my own money  i received no compensation for this review and indeed i have no idea who the seller might be  i pride myself on writing unbiased reviews      
554,1.0 ,                       be careful when amazon recommends this with a dashcam  it will fail  it worked for a couple of days then started to fail i contacted sandisk about it and they indicated it is not recommended for this use  extra small print on the back of the packaging  amazon refunded  thank you  and i purchased a lexar at a lower price and higher write speed      
555,1.0 ,                       i bought a package of   of the    gb to go in some trail cameras i bought   after formatting as directed i used the cameras at a storage facility because of some theft problems   after some thefts occurred i really needed to see the info on the disks     out of the   did not record anything     as it said card error   i will not ever buy again   the one disk that worked only got the area where the thefts did not occur   had these disks worked as they should have i would have caught the thief on it   beware when buying these disks    from now on i will buy at local best buy or other electronic store      
556,5.0 ,                       i bought this to add memory to my phone to store pictures from my trip to jordan and egypt  it did the trick nicely with plenty of room for all of the photos  it took me a minute to find them when i turned my phone off then on again after a flight  after a brief gut wrenching fear i had lost some   but i found them and they are stored nicely  highly recommend      
557,5.0 ,                       awesome micro sd card  lots of space and quick   i use this for our nintendo switch and have no problem with games being saved on it and running smoothly   i have   games on it so far  and have     plus gb left  lol   so it should last for years   get this when it s a prime deal or like a black friday deal  harddrives and storage devices always goes on sale during those times      
558,5.0 ,                       this microsd works perfectly in my nintendo switch  capable of holding my entire game collection at once    and that includes several major rpgs and first party titles i haven t noticed any slowdown using it  except in games that are notorious memory hogs  dqb   botw  and that s not storage related      
559,3.0 ,                       i bought   of these    worked and the other was corrupt and would not give access because it said it was damaged  and that was of course after i had moved everything from my phone to this card  it lost half of my music and pictures  i got it for storage so i would not lose my files       got screwed on that the other card that works is great  i have so much storage on my tablet now      
560,5.0 ,                       i received this today for my wifes surface pro    i inserted it in the micro sd slot behind the back stand   the reason my wifes had this for over   years and i never knew it had a micro sd slot  i showly pushed the sd card into the slot  til it clicked  i had a   gb in it prior  make sure you unmount it first  i didnt and it still showed the   gb card  i unmounted the new    gb drive  then removed it for the surface pro  and reinstalled it  it read    gb  which i guess is the norm i would recommend this card i found out that you can move apps  told the sd card google how to move apps to a a usb drive  or the micro sd slot both do good job of making more sysytem storage  my experience was the micro sd slot was slightly faster      
561,1.0 ,                       i have no idea how to buy an sd card  this is advertised as being fast enough to save pictures and music on  yet my hard drive has to be my storage by default because this speed is not high enough to store directly to the card  very disappointed  i guess i have to buy a     card to get what i m looking for which is a card that is able to store both my music and pictures on an sd card  san disk is garbage    my music won t transfer to this card  i was ripped off  save your money or throw it out of a window  same result wasted         
562,5.0 ,                       i needed a class    micro sd card for use in our car s dash camera because the old micro sd card i had laying around did not work fast enough and was constantly causing problems   i bought this card because it looked like a good product and the price was right   i have been pleased with the read write speeds of this card and will definitely buy another if i need one again      
563,5.0 ,                       i was kicking myself for downloading smash bros instead of buying the physical copy   it quickly ate up all the space in my   gb microsd card   i literally could not play the game because it needed to update and didn t have the space to do it   i knew it was time to upgrade my storage i was only going to do like a      but then i realized that i hate buying games and keeping up with them and having to store all those bulky game cases   i so splurged and went for the big boy    gb card   so glad i did   realistically  i won t have to worry about storage space ever again yes  this product does work with the switch   you ll need to format it which you can do just by doing an internet search for nintendo switch sd card formatting   you ll get a hit for a nintendo site where they tell you how to do this   format  plug in  go also  if you are upgrading your current storage for the switch  you absolutely can transfer everything over from your old sd card to your new one   literally just format the new one  and copy and paste all the files over   super simple   next to no effort  you are good to go no glitches or hang ups finally i must say that i bought my    gb microsd card from an amazon warehouse deal   absolutely fantastic   so glad they do this   it s always great to get discounts on returned damaged opened items   worth it every time      
564,4.0 ,                       this micro sd card arrived quickly   i loaded it on my surface pro    windows      no problem recognizing the card   the file information showed that there was a total of    gb on the card  with  mb being used by the card   so that is about   gb short of what it advertises   i find that most drives  cards  etc  are usually somewhat under what they advertise   using my usb c port i copied about   gb of data over to the new card   write speed averaged around   mb s with highs around   mb s   not bad but not    mb s   not sure what the speeds will be once i install it in the surface   can t speak to durability as i only received it today   overall seems to be good   will revisit the review if any problems arise  or if it performs better once it is installed in the surface      
565,5.0 ,                       this is the second    gb micro sdxc card i bought   the first one was for my phone  because i take so many videos   that was months ago  when i first got my samsung s   and it s still a very reliable storage device this second one is for my new surface pro    because i wanted to pay for a better processor while sacrificing on internal storage   adding this micro sdxc to the surface pro turned out to be an excellent decision   i saved a lot of money overall  and i have a storage device that i can pop out to any device i choose   on the surface pro  the micro sd card slot is tucked in under the stand  so you never have to worry about accidental ejection when you re on the go delivery was fast  too   i recommend the seller and the product  especially for business use and for surface pro users      
566,1.0 ,                       was warned not to trust reliability of sandisk sd cards     wish i had listened   sure  near cheapest option s  out there   clearly  there is a reason for that   do yourselves a favor   don t fall into that trap and later regret it as i have   couple extra    for a sony card or similar   well worth it and avoiding the frustration  loss of recorded media data   and as we are now kicking ourselves you expose yourself too if you take your chances with these     regret      
567,1.0 ,                       i m honestly too pissed to write much of a detailed review  card comes write protected and it cannot be removed  the write protection prevents the card from storing information so it could not be used to upgrade the memory card in my galaxy s   absolute bs and is of course beyond the return date because switching the memory card in my phone was not urgent and i d assumed it would be fine  in order to return to the company you have to fill out a detailed form and wait for who knows how long  don t waste your money on a possibly bunk disk  now i have to put my old memory card back thankfully i didn t delete everything  and order a new memory card from a different maker and seller  would give negative stars if i could      
568,5.0 ,                       used this card to expand the memory of the spouse s surface pro    no issues  it recognized it immediately  can t say i have used or will ever use the adapter it came in  the adapter got tossed into the junk drawer to be examined by my kids years from now when they go through my house after my passing i recommend      
569,5.0 ,                       fast shipping  no damage  worry free got the    gb microsd for my lg g  fit   gb  system used   gb   other apps used  gb  undeletable  unmovable apps packaging for microsd is very subtle but it is designed in a way to make your day easier  you can open everything with out scissors  very thin plastic film is over the microsd so you just need to carve the outer edge with your finger or pen to get it out  and the microsd stays in place in the center so it doesn t just fall off or fly out while your opening package  subtle but i noticed these features  my focus was to not to drop the small memory card the whole time but i didn t need to worry about that installation is easy  if you ever changed a sim card you will know what to do  newer models of phones will have a slot where the sim slot and sd slot are either on top or on the sides  you will see a small tiny hole  penetrate the tiny hole with some force behind it once located with your industry standard pin  i took a picture for this for comparison  for people who might worry they won t be able to penetrate the tiny hole so those individuals don t panic  if you never received a pin  you can use regular paper clips to open the slot and mcgyver your way forward  you can see they are both long enough   smooth to not cause damage to your smartphone upon entry and they both have similar girth in size which is always nice  also please do not use needle pins they are too pointy and uncomfortable for your slot i bought   microsd cards  first one had no issues and was ready to go in a second  second card however ran into a hiccup  don t wanna use the word issue because the screen was giving me  corrupt memory card  warnings and in the notification bars but after opening the sd file application all from the drop down notification bar the memory card scanned itself and optimized according to the phone  this process took   seconds very happy with this purchase  will buy again  have a great day      
570,5.0 ,                         i have tried so many different sd cards from various manufacturers  at various price points  in the name of trying to save a few bucks  it was really important to me back when a    gb card cost     or more  they all do the same thing  so what s the difference  really what i ve found is that it can be extremely aggravating to put up with when the card does not perform well or does not perform at all  i have heard warning stories about cards that are advertised as one size and actually are another size  causing data loss  with that in mind  i have never tried using the very cheapest card or too goo to be true card deals  but i have purchased cards on sale at the drugstore or even tried some strange brands  what i have come back to is that it s just not worth the trouble now that prices have dropped so low  when i am trusting     gb of data to a single card  it s just not worth my time and aggravation to have a card that won t perform  furthermore  sandisk cards like this one are all fast enough  i m not a pro photographer  and i don t have time to figure out whether a card is class   or class   or whatever  i just want it to be good enough that it can keep up with my devices i have now purchased several sandisk cards  and each and everyone of them has arrived in perfect condition and works perfectly every time  they are faster than any other card that i use and i ve never suffered data loss  i am putting this card into my fiio x ii digital audio player  and it works just fine  during the initial data transfer i have already noticed that the speed is adequate  and i never experience skipping when playing uncompressed high resolution audio files  i have the same card for my nintendo switch  and it works perfectly the prices on these are so good now you have no excuse but to buy good name brand like sandisk  just buy it and don t worry about it      
571,5.0 ,                       this m    gb card meets my expectations if you expect for the card to meet the representations on the box  dream on as  none do but if you are looking for a fast card adequate for go pro camera or basic     p digital photography this card will serve let me begin by saying that this card was bought used directly from amazon  i always have success buying items subject to counterfeiting directly from amazon because it was used i decided to put it through the paces  after all it wouldn t be the first time a buyer does a switcherooee i used a program called h testw and used it on the sd card slot on my computer h testw filled the whole card up with files and then verified it so i confirmed that i got the whole i think it was    gb  but sdmaid on my phone says    gb formatted  and its result was   gbs write and   gbs read it took more than   hours to fill the card with files than verify the info but the result is that i m positive the storage is actual storage and not software tricks i tried some other programs to benchmark the card and had good results finally after confirming the card is the advertised capacity and not fake storage  i put in my phone and used a program called cptd or cross platform disk test and got a sequential write of      mb s write and     mb read i think that the limiting factor is the speed of your phone and controller not the card anyway i m satisfied with the speed  real life results  of       mbs write and      mbs read is very respectable  plenty fast for     p recording and video which i use i am very happy with my purchase made directly  from amazon      
572,5.0 ,                       i would to let people know that this is what you need for yr roku ultra  easy to easy slips in right under hdmi socket it goes in with the metal side up push all the way in and will load automatically then just select format     
573,4.0 ,                       ordered this put it in my fire tablet hd    said it was not compatible  i then tried it in my fire tablet   and got the same message come up  i sent it back  i read several reviews that said it worked with fire tablet  did not work with either of mine   i am sure if this card had been compatible it would be fine  previous cards i have bought have been good      
574,1.0 ,                       i have two of these  both of them error when copying data from a pc to the card  the card constantly disconnects from the os  then you have to reinsert it  start copying  and it does it again  some of the videos that i copied over work on the original pc but then when i copy it successfully to the sd card  they don t work  it took me   days to copy over   gb worth of data because it got to the point that i had to start copying individual files over so they would not error out or the card would stop being read      
575,5.0 ,                       its a good memory card i wont lie  it is a bit high on the price even though if you live in a place that has dollars as currency it shouldn t be much for you but even so i think its worth it  i might buy   more  for my phone not sure if it would be useful but i might buy one for camwra it is great i take  k photos a session a day when it comes to sunset so thats alot and its been holding up good      
576,5.0 ,                       ordered a couple for my car s cameras and work fine  front and rear  just formatted  installed and was able to see the high quality recordings as well as the capacity of them  highly recommended      
577,1.0 ,                       apparently  i have a fake card  i bought this for my brother s switch about   years ago now and everything was working fine  i was able to download games and store on the card until recently  it started to give us the dreaded error code             i already tried doing the normal reset remove card from switch that nintendo support says  no luck  can t download any games from the shop anymore  it ll either download halfway or barely a few seconds without crashing looks like i ll have to buy an official switch micrcosd from local retailer for assurance      
578,4.0 ,                       not all storage cards are created equal   they are rated for different speeds   this one works well for me and my purpose  but it might not be as fast as you d like for other purposes   that said  no need to pay for more speed or space than you need  or in some instances  can even use  this is good value for money and i am happy to have bought it      
579,5.0 ,                       this was the third upgrade to my switch since it was released   this doubled the previous memory card i had previously installed   there is a very noticeable increase in the speed of game loads from this card over my past two cards   this item goes on sale often  even a better time to buy   quit archiving your games off of your switch when running out of storage  this will hold your whole library with lots of room to spare   and many of the popular switch games just keep getting bigger in download size      
580,5.0 ,                       incredible performance in my lg aristo    the specifications for my phone say that the maximum supported sd card is   gb but it magically works just fine  it really does increase the performance of apps even though android     does not support moving apps to the sd card  for example using es file manager to browse video files  the video files thumbnails load very quickly  another example would be using minecraft with external storage  saving and loading is at least twice as fast compared to the   gb high performance card i had before and saving pictures and videos to the external storage is much snappier when using the photo gallery and swiping through recent pictures  it also was ten dollars cheaper than buying an equivocal card at target or walmart  the funny thing is they provide equal capacity cards for higher prices that are normally not sandisk  for example polaroid cards are more common at target  i love sandisk cards  i ve never had one fail just like i ve never had a western digital hard drive fail for no reason  only buy sandisk if you value quality long term and never want to second guess your cards      
581,3.0 ,                       i ve heard horror stories of faulty fake wrong sd s being delivered instead of the real deal  and i m pleased to say i had no such issues  it s a sandisk sd  and for the most part it s everything i expect  however  unfortunately  it s packing only      gb of space  which is  imo  lower than it should be considering it s a     gb card  i know it s almost always a tad bit lower than advertised  but    gb seems like a lot of lost space  as such  i m shaving off a couple stars i purchased the sd card for my nintendo switch  which of course was an insanely easy installation process  i had no photos or videos to transfer over so it made things even simpler   better yet  i got this during a holiday deal for like       off  so all in all it s not like i lost much from the missing   gb  that being said  there s no way i d buy this full price moving forward and i ll continue to wait for sales on items like these to compensate for the lost space      
582,4.0 ,                       well i got this memory card for my best friend cellphone as a early christmas present  i put the memory card in the slot and it read it really quick it didnt ask for a format but i made sure it work right   her phone storge was full so i just transfer the data and her stuff to sd card and it was a bit fast so far she said it work well  il be updating my review in a couple months and getting her point review on the sd card  the only thing i didnt like was how it arrived seem they had fold it and stepped on the sd card but everything work      
583,5.0 ,                       i bought this to go into the fire hd   tablet i just got  i love having pretty much unlimited storage when you are using your device   this will make sure you don t  it s sandisk the world leader in digital storage  that makes it a product you can trust   depend on    i will buy this again great product   a great price          
584,5.0 ,                       sandisk is a reliable brand  and this product is no exception  i bought this for my kindle fire because there is an upper limit to the size of microsd card it could accept  been using it for a while now and transfer speeds are good  capacity is as listed  and it s been pretty stable other than one trip through the airport where i lost some data  easy enough to replenish from backup  but still a curious event   that hadn t happened to me before and all the factory built in storage was fine  but this is a good buy   go ahead and make the purchase      
585,3.0 ,                       so far it s nothing to write home about  this sandisk     ultra sd card is advertised at     mb s  when my pc is only getting a top max speed of      mb s  when i have one of the latest hp ryzen    amd processor    gig ram  when this model was released this year  this really makes me wonder how sandisk is measuring their processing speeds  i m nearly done transferring some music and it never got close to their advertised speed of     mb s   hmm very disappointing     
586,5.0 ,                       i bought this to upgrade an older galaxy note   smart phone because i tend to hold onto things that work and work well  which this phone has  a quick bit of research showed that as a   gb supporting sdxc compliant phone  the note   should support any sdxc card up to and even surpassing    gb  happy to report  it does indeed i m getting the full available volume of space on the card which means i ve increased the originally rated  maximum supported  space of the device four fold  and with no odd problems showing up the card is much faster with read write speeds as well  i can load up a  gb file in under a minute  whereas the older   gb card i bought around   years ago took about     minutes to do the same as a performance booster  this card has been a good purchase i ve used sandisk cards for digital photography and they ve always performed exceptionally well  i see no reason to believe that this card won t perform just the same if you have an older phone or other device that supports   gb   sdxc cards  microsd or other form factor  in exfat format  then you should quite likely be able to use an sdxc    gb     gb or even    gb card in it without issue    sdxc being able to in theory support up to  tb in size  not that we may ever see a  tb microsd card  but one can dream      
587,5.0 ,                       i bought this as a dedicated card for my nintendo switch  it was really straight forward to install  and gave me all the space i could ever need  we ll see how durability ranks up  but since it s not being loaded unloaded  the possibilities for physical damage are really small  and i know that sd cards are well known for their low failure rates      
588,4.0 ,                       unlike larger cards you do not want to insert and remove this thing to download pictures   i noticed that in my camera it normally takes several tries to get it to click and stay in the camera   the larger cards are my favorite because i can pop the card out in the field  insert another blank one  and download the photos from the one in use  so  i suggest you put this card in once and leave it there   and only load this card at home on a table with a cloth underneath   if you drop this tiny card on the floor you won t enjoy trying to find it  fortunately  i had that experience with a garmin once    never again      
589,5.0 ,                       i ordered this to go with a new portable cd player that i just bought because it plays both cds and tf card files   the tf card works fine and it holds a huge number of audio files   i have used other sandisk products in the past and have been pleased with their reliability   if there is any problem with the card  i ll add a note at a later date      
590,5.0 ,                       so i just got the    gb version in the mail  due to negative reviews i was very worried about how my msdcad would turn out  so lets get to the point  it is easy for scammers mess with the cards to make them appear bigger than they actually are  so it is important that once you get your card that you download a software called h testw  i used it and after about an hour or   it reported no errors  everything checks out for mine regarding that concern   i got this card for my switch that i  at the time of writing this  am still waiting to receive  i may update as time goes on  but so far so good update   got my switch  set it up and began downloading the following games   zelda   breath of the wild  mario kart   deluxe  and fortnite   so far the games are downloading without issue    which have completed  the microsd is working as expected  the write speeds could be faster however  but for the price i paid and size it is not so bad for an sd card   i reccommend this over any nintendo branded m sdcards     
591,1.0 ,                       when i inserted the sd card into both my pc and my samsung galaxy note   i could not format the sd card  after trying this numerous times i found that the storage capacity of the supposed     gb sd card was  only      mb  i am upset that such faulty and misleading product is being shipped and sold through amazon and that one of the few ways to tell that the one i received was a fake was to open it and insert the card into my pc  i would not recommend purchasing an sd card of any type through amazon and sticking with the brick and motor stores for this      
592,1.0 ,                       this card screwed me over  worked fine in the beginning  then of course we get to our vacation and my kids camera doesn t work  so she didn t get to take any pics in hawaii  which is why i bought the damn thing so we get home  i assume it s the cameras fault  it won t stay on  it won t charge  get a replacement camera  charge it up  pop in the sd card  and wow  all of a sudden the new camera doesn t work either  after tons of switching out chargers and wondering if i got the cameras mixed up  turns out it s just this stupid card  which amazon now says is not eligible for return      
593,5.0 ,                       great capacity for new s    phone from quality manufacturer  love sandisk products   work well  great warranty  wanted decent sized memory for picture video storage to augment built in memory and have not been disappointed   what can you say about memory cards    they work  and keep on working   have only had one fail on me  not a sandisk one  over many years of electronics projects and use   always buy memory thru amazon   getting genuine products at good prices      
594,5.0 ,                       man  what an amazing piece of technology   to be able to fit    gb of data on something so tiny   i was really surprised it worked on my galaxy tab       model    it is only supposed to support up to a   gb micro sd card   bottom line  it lets you add a huge amount of storage space to portable devices which are capable of using them   in order to find out whether your device s  is one of them  check the reviews  or call customer service tech support at the company which manufactures it      
595,5.0 ,              your browser does not support html  video                          the product came neatly packaged for the goal to use as a gopro memory card  the product was       real and has a total of     gb space in a     gb micro sd card  that space is normal for a     gb space micro sd card the item works great  simple and easy to use  get it for anyone looking into video editing  filming  or even video games for that nintendo switch      
596,5.0 ,                       i install this into my surface pro   and it was recognized immediately  this was twice as much storage as the surface originally had giving me a total of    gb   i checked the speed and it looks to be only slightly slower than the internal drive   i am very happy i  found this micro sd card on sale as i really like the  sandisk products      
597,1.0 ,                       it worked great in my zoom h   i used it for couple months and one day displayed on my computer as corrupted  i tired reformatting but with no success      
598,5.0 ,                       there is not such thing as writing speed mixed up with transfer rates  the description says   transfer speeds of up to   mb s    and later on  it says   read speed  up to   mb s no  this micro sd is not capable of writing at   mb s  it is capable of writing up to about    mb s maximum and reading is around    mb s  i used it in action cams and even though it is capable of recording  k   fps  the quality is not even  due most probably to the limitations of this sd card  it is remarkable that it could bear the recording of  k videos though        
599,5.0 ,                       read and write speeds are pretty good  when your sd card reader slot can fully utilize those speeds   storage comes out to    gb after formatting  honestly  i m probably going to run out of storage after an extra     switch games  currently have    full titles with nes online    demos  and youtube  but it s definitely an excellent option for an expanding library  haven t used this for a smartphone  but for those with expandable storage smartphones i highly recommend this card as it s a great way to store plenty of hd and uhd videos  quality photos  and music      
600,3.0 ,                       previous sandisk cards have worked well  but this one couldn t be formatted and turned out to be fake   reviewing  other reviews with photos from people who received fake products  the packaging matched one listed as fake   glad i spent the time to test this card and was able to return it easily   the real products from sandisk work well  but it s hard to give many stars when this happens   buyer beware      
601,5.0 ,                       i ordered this for a new smartphone primarily to store a collection of audio files i have amassed over the year from various purchases   i previously ordered a third party    gb card only to be disappointed that it only stored   gb and was obviously manipulated   ordering this brand name card  while it did cost a little more  was well worth it and is what was advertised   it does appear slightly less than    gb in my phone but that appears to be due to the phone s limitation  when i stuck this in my windows pc it was accurate   it also doesn t report as a slow card either   definitely worth considering spending a little more to be reassured you get what you pay for      
602,2.0 ,                       it initially worked fine on my moto  x phone  but after   month i ve been unable to move any media to it  after i format it  it shows up as  corrupted disk  in the storage settings  after a while it comes back to normal  but then i can t move media anymore  again   format it  it shows up as  corrupted disk   and so on i had the phone replaced  but i continue having the same issue with this sd card      
603,5.0 ,                       hard to think that there s     gb in a tiny microsdxc card that s the size of your pinky nail  i m using my sd card on my nintendo switch  i mainly buy physical games  but now a days they re putting half of the game on the game cartridge and the rest has to be downloaded to the system  well  i was running low on space  i deleted all my games from the system memory so everything will only be on the sd card  but i haven t noticed any slowdowns  and if anything i actually think that it runs faster from the sd card  i highly recommend you get an sd card for your switch so far it s working perfectly fine  but if anything goes wrong i ll update my review      
604,5.0 ,                       my dash cam quickly recognized the card after i reformatted it to ms dos  fat    i initially bought microsd from another brand   yeah  that one was fake and not reputable   my cam didn t recognize that card   however  the sandisk microsd is legitimate and was extremely easy to setup with my dash cam      
605,2.0 ,                       the microsd itself is nice and work well on my gopro hero   in     p    fps or even in  k   fps so the writing speed is correct  i m not using my gopro much so even after few month i didn t had to plug the card to backup  store and format it  the only times i had to edit i ve don t it over wifi on my phone so today i tried to connect the car on my laptop using the provided adapter and    it doesn t work there is literally no way to make it work on my computer which have only a sd card port so obviously i can t return it anymore  so i have to but an adapter which basically cost the same price than the micro sd itself        
606,1.0 ,                       i ordered three of these to go in three dash cams i purchased as gifts   i found theses after doing a search on amazon for cards that work in dash cams  search was  dash camera compatible sd cards   naturally this item came up and after reading some reviews and checking out the warranty available on amazon it did not indicate what i discovered after receiving the item and going to scandisk s website where you find the real complete warranty that clearly says not suitable for dash cams and usage will void the warranty   this is somewhat deceitful andcertainly misleading  the description should clearly say not for use in dash cams and doing so will void the warranty   i ended up buying the correct card from scandisk  naturally the correct one is almost twice the price so not being related to bill gates  i had to choose a   gb instead of the   gb which is preferable in my book   why do reputable companies insist on leaving out important info such as voiding warranty   oh well  caveat emptor      
607,5.0 ,                       first of all the man who delivered this deserves an award or a good raise  no sooner than he got out of the amazon delivery van my  hardly speaking english  neighbors two german shepherds were aggressively running at him and he was quick on his feet and avoided what could have been a vicious attack resulting in one of us have to take extreme measures to stop them  i ve never seen someone get that close to getting attacked  hats off to you buddy   as for my review  i reviewed this just to shine a light on how dangerous amazon delivery crew can have it and if you have a big breed dog keep them in your control  as far as the sd card  with a baby you re constantly taking videos and photos and i have cattle so i m constantly taking pictures and photos of them as well  my phone fills up quickly  the sd card provides me with the ability to take them store for later dates and revisit ones i have bought over the years via computer  phone  or any pharmacy with a photo center i can pop this bad boy in and print off what i need  i take a crazy amount of pics and videos  so it takes me about a year or so to fill up a   gb  so i opted for the    gb  i m hoping this one lasts a little longer  a good tip is to write the year with a fine point sharpie marker on the sd card its self  i never keep the plastic piece that it goes in  i was thinking this year i may go with letters and write in a journal the corresponding letter  tape the sd card beside it  and what all is on that particular sd card  like baby s  st bday  father in law s bday  christmas       thanksgiving       it would be cool if they made a case for these that holds      with a place for descriptions  like those photo albums with lines beside picture for comments  but for your sd card      
608,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       top card doesn t work   bottom card works  bought the top card june         for a nintendo switch and the games would download to     and then suddenly i d get an error  when these cards went on sale recently i bought a new one just to see if it was the card  i could not believe how different the fonts were  check out photo  also the color of the bad card is off  slightly more purple and less red   sure enough  i was able to download games to the new card without incident  the real product works great but i just can t justify giving   stars when i had this experience  buyer beware      
609,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this product is not what is advertised  it ended up being a  gb card sold as    gb be careful  do not buy      
610,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i had this for my dash cam for about   months  worked fine then it suddenly went out  the computer wont even read it anymore   i emailed about the warranty     years   i got told dash cams void the warranty   i just read the entire warranty and this site as of          and there is nothing about dash cams voiding warranty   i wont be buying another one due to the customer support

613,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i always use sandisk and think they are top notch  however  beware of fakes  i got an obvious fake microsd card  and the retail package had obviously been opened before i received it      
614,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       beware of fake cards  the capacity shown on fake cards can be modified to show a size greater than what it actually is  ex  a fake    gb card having only   gb instead  some unknowing person could use the card without knowing it was fake and find that the data was corrupted when it got past   gb or encounter a very very slow transfer rate past a certain point to check if the card you bought is legit or not use fakeflashtest  fast  and h testw  slower but thorough  this will delete the content on your card so backup whatever you have before using it the speed and pictures i got from my legit    gb card are attached  your results may vary  the product code is edited out for product support issues      
615,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       dead on arrival  i was never able to format it  the worse part was that when i tried to pull it out from my laptop card reader  i burned my fingers touching it  the card was extremely hot  i took it out using a piece of cloth and once it cooled off  i could see that part of the adapter was melted  if i would had leave it plugged in more time it could have easily caused a fire  i have been using memory cards a lot  this is the first time something like this happened to me      
616,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i love it  works great in my galaxy note    fast enough that i can throw pretty much anything at it  if you re wondering  modern android versions  starting with lollipop  as i recall  have the ability to read up to   tb of external storage  while this    gb card is the maximum capacity you can currently buy   the leading manufacturers are feverishly working to make larger capacity cards  for now  though  i think    gb is enough to handle all the  k video i can shoot    don t be fooled by unscrupulous sellers  particularly on auction sites   i won t name it because there are a lot of fake cards here  too   who list ridiculously large capacity cards for astonishingly low prices    you don t get what you pay for  they take cheap  generic cards  usually no more than   or   gb  and rewrite the card s firmware   re label it to make it act and appear like a larger card       gb     gb or higher  there are tons of listings out there for   terabyte microsd cards  of course there s no such thing  and when the physical memory of the card is reached  your device will simply start overwriting data    and your precious photos  videos and other files will be gone forever  in fact  one third of all sandisk cards on the market are counterfeit  you can avoid all this by installing and using a free app called sd insight to determine if your card is legitimate
