0,5.0,                       this mouse isn t flashy  minimal buttons  but you know  where others have fallen after the repeated misshandling of my mice   this one has survived many drops onto hard surfaces  moving  and just general bad handling that comes from   year olds  and still works like a charm on pretty much any surface i ve used it on to include shiny boxes as i needed to do homework while moving to a new house  so  yeah  i ll give this thing a   star rating      
1,5.0,                       great mouse  very basic  but well constructed  i ve been using it regularly  but it s had no issues despite frequent plugging and unplugging  constant transit  and frequent bending on the cord good sensor  works on basically all surfaces edit  so after a three months of frequent use  my mouse broke  this is the second time i have ordered this mouse  and both times it broke the same way  the base of the usb cord  where it connects to the computer  needs to be held at a very particular angle to work  the quality of the connection degrades until the mouse no longer works at all i don t regret purchasing this mouse  but going forward i think i ll buy wireless mouses  i d rather spend     on a wireless mouse which lasts me a couple years than spending    every three months because the connector cable keeps busting on my mouse      
2,3.0,                       this mouse is solid and gets the job done  but the scroll wheels of both of the ones we bought squeak   is annoying enough that we can t use them   maybe others wouldn t be bothered  but even my coworkers on calls can hear the squeaking and it s distracting   tried a drop of oil but that didn t help   so   stars for otherwise working  but just can t use this mouse otherwise      
3,3.0,                       sometimes the left button doesn t do anything  but  this might be my computer acting up  don t know  however  the wheel gets into a mood once in a while and makes a scraping noise as you use it  that goes and comes at will  not wheel   this is a tiny bit annoying   but for a bargain mouse  i ll work with it  i m slowly switching to a tablet anyway      
4,2.0,                       i was looking for a cheap mouse to use for a couple of months and was excited to find that amazonbasics had an option   unfortunately  this mouse is so small my  larger then average  hand tends to cramp up after a few minutes of trying to squeeze it sufficiently   there are plenty of other cheap options that feature a full size mouse   this is more like a travel mouse      
5,2.0,                       my first mouse to completely fail  the mouse was erratic shorting out and then failed completely   otherwise a regular no frills mouse  not what a serious gamer would select   not the mouse if you have neck  nerve or hand injuries      
6,4.0,                       i grew tired of the wireless mice not working after a few months  typically with those  the left side goes wonky  not to mention the batteries they go through  this plugs right in and hasn t had any issues thus far  seems to be built like anything else on the market  it has a great click and tracks well the only minor complaint is lack of additional buttons such as forward and back  which i was spoiled by  outside of this small personal thing  this works well      
7,3.0,                       bought in september  lasted until january when it started confusing right and left clicks  it s not a huge issue  but makes a lot of things way more difficult than they need to be i do a lot of gaming though  so it s likely it s just not built for that kind of wear and tear  perfect if you re just using it for work purposes though  not good for extensive gaming      
8,5.0,                       i bought a set of    of these mice  they held up well to middle school students ising them daily  they are small and lightweight but very sturdy  my middle schooler have given their stamp of approval      
9,5.0,                       you re probably thinking that the  amazon basics  mouse is poor quality   well  you d be wrong  this mouse surprised the heck out of me with its solid quality and durability  its perfect for every day computing  definitely for office computing  i marked   on gaming because no one  needs  a naga or gaming mouse for gaming  this works just fine for it      
10,5.0,                         shipment was well packaged and arrived on time  i plugged the mouse into a usb port on my wife s hp    chromebook and it worked instantly  this is a comfortable  optical mouse with long cord  which excess i gathered into a closed loop  next to the usb plug in and secured by a couple of electrical ties   with very smooth tracking on a conventional mousepad   so  to clear up the confusion of what will and what won t work on the hp chromebook hp chromebooks are different from other chromebooks unlike their competitors  they were engineered at google  not hewlett packard  they do not contain the drivers that others may have built into their systems  despite the fact that they are bluetooth enabled  no external apps  drivers or programs can be uploaded into the google chrome o s  while that may be viewed as a shortcoming in chromebook comparisons  the hp has in my opinion  superior features that negate that difference the hp chromebooks will run on a corded mouse  with no set up  receiver or batteries required  and the amazon basics   button mouse fills the bill at a very reasonable price  my only recommendation would be  for shipping to add a brick of cheddar cheese with their mouse  for the operator      
11,5.0,                       i had been using a logitech mouse for around   years or so and one day it stopped working   i ordered this mouse because the price was low   this product definitely amazed me   it is small and compact  no battery needed   you simply connect to the usb port and that s it   i love it      
12,5.0,                       this mouse is perfect for me  many people prefer wireless mouses to wired ones like this mouse  i have two objections to having a wireless mouse    when a wireless mouse falls  it always seem to bounce way underneath furniture and searching for it on my hands and knees is not my favorite activity at age       buying and replacing batteries frequently gets so tiresome this mouse addresses both of these problems  if i drop it  i can retrieve it easily since the wire functions like a tether  it never needs batteries  what a great technological advance  ha ha  also it is a perfect fit for my hand and feels very natural  like most amazonbasics items this mouse functions well and is reliable  as a bonus the buttons produce very satisfying click sounds  this is what a mouse should be like  in my opinion  and the price is good at       edited to add  i am now     and for whatever reasons  i probably drop my mouse from the table to the floor at least a dozen times a day  i m not even kidding  and attribute this to old age and clumsiness  this mouse is indestructible     lol  this would be a great mouse for a kid  too  because it just doesn t break  i guess i get a new one every couple of years  but still  this mouse is the very definition of the word  rugged       
13,5.0,                       i bought this for a friend of mine  she broke her other mouth period or it just quit working on her period either way i bought it for and she really likes it  it looks comfortable  she doesn t complain about it  just plug it in and it starts working right away  so i m glad that i got it for period and it s a good deal with nice price and everything      
14,5.0,                       after buying two apple mice     to use with my macbook pro  and having both of them fail miserably   for over     apiece     i found this one on amazon for a mere      i ordered the first one a while back  it connected immediately   and until recently  probably after couple of years use at least  i have just started having an issue with it  sometimes  while scrolling up down  i find that the wheel does not connect so   i ordered another one  again for a mere     hear me  apple     to keep on hand for when the first one finally decides to bite the dust as of today  i have not had to use this  nd one  but it sits in my  stash  of equipment  silently awaiting the day when i will find that i need it the  st  as i have said  is still scrolling for the most part    clicking away  but i know that it will probably give out eventually   again     stars to a well made purchase        
15,3.0,                       works well  should have read the reviews because it is a dainty mouse  i don t have large hands and it still feels small to me  would probably be great for a child or someone with very small hands  like donald trump the material feels good and it works great  and no irritating corners or edges  other than the size  i have no complaints  if you have larger hands  look around and you can find other alternatives at this price point      
16,1.0,                       i just bought this instead of the logitech as i have had decent results with amazon basics products in the past and it was slightly cheaper   it was the wrong choice this time   amazon basics products are usually missing one or two nice features  but other than that  are solid replacements at a decent price   this mouse however has started to change my perception of the amazon basics brand for the worse   reading some of the other reviews  it appears that they created a decent product originally and then started cutting corners over time until the value provided was not worth the price  even though discounted the scroll wheel squeaks whenever i use it   and if i am using the mouse with a window  then i am scrolling quite a bit   this is not an old mouse  i just bought and started using this mouse   it grates on my ears and saps my concentration   for the price  it is not worth the trip to the ups store to return it   i will probably just save it with a note to only give or lend it to someone i don t like very much       or realistically use it while waiting for a decent mouse if another mouse stops working      
17,5.0,                       we had the original mouse from our computer that we bought waaaaay back in      and it was getting to be pretty frustrating to use  i saw this for    and figured why not  i m so happy i made the purchase  it shipped super fast and for a    mouse it is everything it should be and maybe a little better than i expected  of course like i said before our old mouse was a complete turd so that is the context i m going off of but still  the amazonbasics mouse seems to be extremely responsive  comfortable  and it was plug and play which was nice  i had it unboxed and functioning in about    seconds  it works perfect for what we use it for  internet browsing  light gaming  general computer usage  and i don t really see why i would ever need anything fancier      
18,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          it s small which makes it a nice fit into a laptop bag  it doesn t use batteries so that s great but the pros don t go much further than that  i haven t had problems with the clicking yet like others have reported but my scroll wheel just stopped working  i ve seen videos on youtube that teach you how to open and repair this yourself but i really don t want to  i honestly really liked this before things started breaking on me  i might buy another but judging by the reviews here these aren t very well made  do yourself a favor and skip this buy      
19,5.0,                       i purchased this because it hurts my hands too much using the pad on my mac and i am always on my computer for school and wedding planning  it is so easy to use  you just plug in the usb  the cord is long and it works on so many surfaces  i even use it on my bed  just on my comforter  you don t even need a mouse pad  i have had it for a few months now and love it      
20,4.0,                       i just wanted a basic mouse to use with my laptop and i didn t want to spend a lot on one  this fit my needs perfectly  it did the job  it scrolled easily  fit my hand nicely  etc  very comfortable and natural to use  i would ve given it a   star review if not for the fact that only a week into using this  it developed a pronounced and exceptionally annoying squeak every time i spin the mouse wheel  i am considering returning this mouse and getting a different brand update  i wound up returning the mouse and amazon sent me a replacement  i ve had the new one for a few months now  and have not experienced the squeaky wheel problem with the new mouse  so i think i got a bad one the first time around  i ve updated my rating to   stars  up from    because the new one works great  but beware that the quality is inconsistent with these      
21,4.0,                       i bought this thinking it ll be terrible   well  for less than   usd  this mouse is actually really good   it s a touch on the small side but oh well   i use the mouse for some fps games and a bit of gta   when i don t want to look for my controller   the scroll wheel is knotchy  and i like it   i d recommend it for most people if you re on a budget      
22,5.0,                       i bought one of these for each of my kids since they are doing remote learning and are using their laptops all day  i have been thoroughly impressed with them and feel like they were a great purchase  love that they just plug into the usb port on the side of the computer and don t require batteries that need to be replaced and doesn t need to be paired to the laptop      
23,4.0,                       my original apple mouse was dying  and my nephew condescending said   we need to get you a new mouse   which was weird since he neither lives with me or buys anything  and i ve been using macs for longer than he s had motor control  but i bought a new apple wireless mouse for something like     and enjoyed it for a few months  then i realized that no matter what i did to the settings  i couldn t seem to control the tracking on it  and for things like google maps  it would zoom in and out uncontrollably  and the battery replacement reminders were driving me nuts so i bought this    basic mouse with low expectations  but was immediately pleased as soon as i plugged it in  at both the mouse and the mac s os   it was recognized quickly and was in action within    seconds of leaving the box  has no batteries to replace  and it tracks based on my movement  not its own wacky interpretation of it it was silly of me to hesitate to buy this because it s so cheap  price  in this case  is no indication of functionality and i recommend it      
24,3.0,                       this is a basic mouse that certainly fits my needs at a very low price  i got tired of changing batteries in wireless mouse s and don t mind the cord  i should have considered another reviewers comments about how you hold the mouse  i put thumb and ring finger pinky on each side of mouse with two fingers  one on each button on top  because the mouse is kinda cheap  the plastic section on top is thin and ever so slightly overhangs the bottom half of the mouse  this plastic edge cuts into my ring finger it ll do but i will try to find a smoother housing next time      
25,5.0,                       i tried wireless mice from various brands for over a year  yet all of the ones that were small enough and comfortable for my hand never lasted more than a few months  i was heavy into overwatch when it first came out  and it really sucks when your mouse starts to crap out on you mid match  i went through   wireless mice during that time  frustrated with that  i decided to go with a simple wired mouse to use until i could research and hopefully find a more reliable wireless  well  it has been two years now and i am still using this one  i even bought a back up one just in case and still have yet to need to pull it out  sure  the cord can be annoying sometimes and more buttons would be convenient for hotkey use  but this   button mouse has been enough for me and way more reliable than any of the wireless ones i have tried      
26,5.0,                       i have purchased this mouse several times for use in my classroom  and i have never had one break or work incorrectly or anything  i ve had some of them for more than two years    they are easy for the kids to use  i ve tested them myself as well  and although i rarely use a mouse  i like them too    i mostly use them for my desktop computers or for the occasional child who prefers to use a mouse with a chromebook   the price is great on these too   this is my first choice when it comes to a mouse for sure      
27,5.0,                       we have half a dozen cordless mouse and they all go in the sleep mode and keep lagging after some inactivity   i got  tired of them and  decided  to try a conventional machine  this corded puppy works      all the time  smooth and reliable      
28,4.0,                       my hands are small so the size is fine for me   i got this because all of the dell mice i had ended up with the same issue of registering single clicks as double clicks   i ve had the amazon wireless mouse for years and it s been working great  so i figured i d try to go with them for my new wired mouse   it s been nice so far  except the clicker isn t as snappy as i would like   i can t click as rapidly as some mice  because i have to lift my finger higher than my muscle memory takes it in order to actually register a release of the clicker   not that much of an issue except for certain computer games where precise timing is important      
29,3.0,                       update  i had purchased one of these before and it worked well but it recently failed  it only lasted about a year and a half but for    bucks i wasn t going to complain so i purchased another one  this one works but the scrolling wheel has an incredibly loud and annoying squeak when you use it  i think i ll buy another brand from now on original review  i got this to replace a mouse that had become unresponsive  it s actually better than the more expensive mouse i replaced  quiet and great for smaller hands      
30,5.0,                       i like the product  i was nearly convinced not to buy by some of the reviews on here  in addition someone told to stay from amazonbasics items but from my use of this mouse      i will not discriminate or eschew amazonbasics productsi am using it on a new hp windows    home edition  and it works effortlessly on multiple surfaces as i am one of those people who think mousepads are a waste of  i hope it lasts forever i am under a month it terms of using this mouse      
31,5.0,                       i have had a wireless mouse for over a year and a half and have hated it  always sliding off the computer stand  i love this one that connects to the laptop  now when it slides off it is only by and inch or   and is right there by my hand      
32,3.0,                       i first saw the problem with zoom   it took me forever to track it down to this mouse   a mouse shouldn t die this soon  or if it does  the symptoms shouldn t be so weird   no no no   the problem was not with the mouse   it was with my usb splitter   so i ve purchased a powered splitter      
33,4.0,                       i ordered to this to replace my broken mouse  it s not anything crazy but it gets the job done  i use a desktop and some of the reviews said the cord might be a bit short for desktop use  when i opened the box i didn t think that the cord was any shorter than any of the other mouses i ve owned in the past  although  it seems like most of these basic mouses are made with a lapto user in mind  i ve found the cord is just long enough to use the mouse comfortably  granted  my computer is a full size tower and sits directly below my desk with the usb ports towards the top of the back panel of the case  if your desktop is not close to where your mouse lives you might have some issues with the length of the cord  the other thing i will say is that the mouse is not huge  i wouldn t say it s abnormally small but if you have larger hands and like to grip the mouse with your palm this probably is not the mouse for you  i m female and have small to average size hands and the mouse fits comfortably in my hand but your mileage may vary      
34,3.0,                       i wouldn t expect much from a   button wired mouse at this price point  it s a very basic mouse  suitable for the most basic use  it has worse than average jitter and performs poorly on shiny surfaces  it is completely  unusable on glass  a mouse pad is essential with this model      
35,5.0,                       a computer mouse is a fairly dull  mundane piece of equipment  either it works or it doesn t so yes  this mouse works just like you d expect a mouse to work what took me by surprise is that the computer runs faster now   than even using the touchpad  your mileage may vary  but hey  for six bucks  you can t go wrong  the worst that ll happen is that your computer works like it always did      
36,5.0,                       i got one of these for family by chance  but i loved the feel of it so got one for myself a bit later the case and buttons have a softer feel to them  i m not sure if it s rubber coated or a soft plastic the sensitivity is good enough for most things activities and even works well for moderate gaming the scroll wheel feels smooth with small notches that do not make click sounds while scrolling pages the cord can be a little stiff but it doesn t feel like it s going to break like some other mice the back has a bowed point that fits well into the center of my palm  something i wish more expensive mice had overall this is a very quiet and effective mouse      
37,3.0,                       with the ad sales to tell you is that it s much smaller than a regular mouse  unless you have a five year old s hand  it s pretty much useless because it s far too small  and i am a    year old male who does not have super huge hands      
38,3.0,                       the rubbery surface of this mouse deteriorated over   years and became this sticky mess  i had to throw it away even though it was working just fine  i will never buy another mouse with this soft covering texture  better to get hard plastic  the softness doesn t feel any more comfortable anyway      
39,5.0,                       i bought these for my classroom   th grade  to use with the school laptops to save time and improve tests scores  instead of the pad on the laptop which is inefficient    i was caught totally off guard by how much they liked them  many students asked how to get one for home because they liked them so much  if you are unaware    it is extremely hard to impress       year olds     biggest win of the year  haha     
40,3.0,                       this is a very small mouse and not comfortable to use for a man with average sized viking hands   i expected it to be similar to a standard logitech  but is     of the size  by volume   everything else seems to click well  at least so far   the resolution seems quite good for the price   it s much better than many and i can stand to use it for cad without feeling like the cursor is jumping around   the wheel rolls without any annoying clicking noises or too much rubbery feeling resistance  which i great   the middle button also seems to work fine   i d give this a     if it weren t for being tiny      
41,1.0,                       this mouse worked fine for several months then all of the sudden my computer would not recognize the mouse   there is no driver  it is supposed to be plug and play  but it fails and now i need a new one   i have tried different ports with the same result      
42,2.0,                       it seems well made  but i can t yet speak to durability i don t need the scroll wheel or the right side button and would be happy to be rid of both  maybe i ll figure the latter out eventually  since i bought a    k mac  however  i ve used only   button mice  this one makes it far too easy to hit the extra button by mistake  an incredible nuisance  just short of dropping it into the trash      
43,4.0,                       kids got chrome book for the pandemic school year  yucko to the touch pad mouse contraption didn t want some fancy expensive mouse  got a couple of these  they are accurate  comfortable enough and exponentially better than a touch pad  you won t regret this for a replacement mouse if you don t need gaming      
44,5.0,                       while this mouse is by no means a fancy mouse  it is very good for what it is  it provides simple left and right click and a middle scroll wheel  clickable   i got it initially because my old mouse kept double clicking whenever i clicked  this one has worked perfectly so far and has even been able to withstand some minor drops and travel      
45,5.0,                       i m a computer  geek  so i am always fixing friends  and family s computers  it s easier to take just their machine and use my own monitor i keep in the same place along with a basic keyboard and a basic mouse  this is exactly what i needed  amazon basics are great  i didn t need anything fancy or expensive for fixing computers  i just wanted something decent and basic  i bought two so i can geek out and work on two machines at once  lol     
46,5.0,                       i bought this mouse about two years ago  it started registering left clicks as right clicks a few weeks ago and i ended up throwing it away even though i tried to make it last a bit longer by opening it up and cleaning it out we have a few other mouses around the house that i tried to switch to  but i couldn t really stand them  so i ordered this for less than     again and got it the next day i really like this mouse  for such a low price i don t mind that it ended up dying after a couple years  i considered buying a few just to have them around in case it dies again      
47,5.0,                       the only real downside is its size  i have larger hands  so it is definitely a little small for my tastes  but this is about the average size of mouse that you d find at schools  libraries  and offices  not a huge deal  but if you want to use this mouse a lot and have bigger hands  consider a larger mouse  of course  it comes down to you grip the thing too  i like a nice palm grip  the cord is also a little thin  you can see that from the photos  so don t be rough with it i love amazon basics  i really do  this mouse has a nice solid feel  it s usb  it ll work with anything  the top is a matte finish which makes it a little bit more grippy  buttons are solid  mouse wheel includes the button press  the wheel spins easily  but not completely freely to avoid accidental scrolling  slides just fine on a mousepad ergonomically  it doesn t seem designed one way or the other  it s symmetrical and i think it would feel just fine for left handed people if you want programmable buttons  back forward buttons  or some crazy dpi and lights look elsewhere  this thing is a simple barebones mouse that gets the job done  and is a great value      
48,5.0,                       i purchased the amazonbasics   button usb wired mouse to replace a    year old logitech   button wired usb mouse that was no longer working correctly   i travel quite a bit with my laptop and rather than having to worry about batteries for a wireless mouse  i ve always preferred a  wired  usb mouse the amazonbasics mouse has been working great with my hp laptop  both the tracking and scrolling has been very smooth and responsive   i use a lot of keyboard shortcuts when using my computer  so i had no need for a more expensive mouse with extra buttons   weighing in at only     oz  this mouse is light  but still sturdy   practically adds no weight to my computer bag when traveling  it fits my hand well and i haven t experienced any fatigue using it   i ve used the mouse with my imac  too  and it works very well  smooth tracking   scrolling  overall  i m very satisfied with this mouse   as the name states  if you are looking for a reliable  basic  mouse  this amazon basics mouse is a great deal      
49,5.0,                       i purchased this mouse nearly five years ago in december       looking for the cheapest option  i didn t expect it to last half as long as it has  it s still going strong  for the most part  i use it for my macbook pro setup that s connected to a monitor  occasionally  i use it for slower paced games such as stardew valley and portal  but it s done alright with games like left   dead as well  i have small hands and the mouse is comfortable enough over extended periods of use my only issue with the mouse  which can be expected given its age  is that the right button sometimes goes out  with a few forceful presses  it s back to normal  this may become annoying after a while  but at this price i wouldn t mind purchasing another i can t speak for the quality of the mice being sold now  late        but if they are anything like the one that i purchased almost five years ago  then i highly recommend giving it a try      
50,5.0,                       i bought the amazons basic mouse and keyboard for a dell laptop that s a pain to deal with the trackpad and keyboard built in while doing my work as a sound engineer for a tv network  the corded mouse works perfect and the drivers work well with dell and windows    on it  the attached picture is of the dell laptop showing why i bought this mouse and the usb keyboard plus amazon had a better deal for their products then other retailers at the time of purchase      
51,5.0,                       this is a terrific basic mouse at a great price  i m a mac user and all their mice of late have been troublesome  the mighty mouse uses a  touch sensor  for the right click but if your finger isn t in just the right place it won t register  the scroll ball is great for left right movement but it can t be removed so it can t be cleaned properly  it s also very large and to me fits oddly in the hand  the blue tooth mouse is also troublesome as the touch surface is the entire front end so accidentally stroking it will scroll the window  this mouse corrects all that with physical  tactile buttons and a rubber wheel with soft detents  it s also sized well  i have large hands but the smaller mouse feels easier to use  with good  basic design and a great price i feel like this is a no brainer for anyone wanting competent functionality      
52,4.0,                       if you have large hands  move along  when i found my trusted and expensive razor naga mouse dying  even after cleaning and doing maintenance  i was desperate  i did what i often do  and got on amazon  i wanted basic and small  so i decided on this basic mouse  and ordered it  it is a little smaller than my other mouse  but for me it s fine  i m using it with a microsoft win   nontouch screen laptop  it works great it was easily plug and play  if it were a tiny bit bigger  it would be a little better  but i don t mind the small size  not at all  ood job  amazon  it makes surfing around your site much easier with a mouse that works             i m dropping a star on this mouse  i ve noticed lately  when i paste something  the mouse doesn t grab the selection  instead it pastes what i had previously selected      
53,3.0,                       it worked  plug and play  no problem   the problems i have with it  in order of most to least annoying are it has a lower profile and is smaller than my oem dell mouse   i don t have large hands  but i am a little arthritic  so the mouse doesn t fit comfortably in the curve of my palm   i m sure that if you don t have arthritis  and for anyone with smaller hands  this will work for you the cord is shorter than my old mouse   the cord is about   feet long and is just short of the limit of my cable management it has a rubbery coating   while i do like the tactile feeling of these coatings  they seem to rub off in high use areas after a year of use   maybe this one will be different  though it wouldn t change my review rating based on my first complaint      
54,4.0,                       i was surprised at how comfortable this mouse is  and the price is perfect  yes  it is corded but it feels a lot better than the logitech wireless mice i ve been buying for the last couple of years and those cost     times the price of this     month update  the mouse is now having occasional issues with the right click button  obviously the mouse is still worth it because of it s low price  but i do expect to replace it within the next couple of months      
55,5.0,                       over all i m happy with the purchase this is a little smaller than i anticipated but after using it for a couple of days i adjusted and am fine with it  for the price of it you can t go wrong and it has not given me any problems at all thus far i went ahead and bought a second one for back up along with it expecting that like any mouse i ve had over the years that it too will one day be worn out  i m at the computer quite a bit and i ve worn out keyboards as well      
56,5.0,                       exactly what i wanted in a mouse  no frills  points  clicks and scrolls just like it s supposed to  hell of a deal  good size  not so small that you ll click the wrong button by mistake  good long cord  great price when you ve been putting up with a mouse that s ready to die for a while like i was  it was great to come home to this on the porch  amazon s vaunted   day shipping meant that i ordered it on wednesday  and it finally got here monday      
57,5.0,                       this is a surprisingly good mouse  when the small travel mouse that i use for my laptop died  i decided to just get a amazon basic mouse to last until i can get a better one  but so far this has been a really great experience and i don t know that i ll bother getting a different mouse now the grip is very matte and seems to have a thin rubberized coating  i don t know exactly what it is  but it s very easy to grip  it s lighter than my gaming mouse i use for my desktop  but its not as light as you would expect from the price  it s constructed very well and is comfortable to use for the price  this mouse is totally worth it      
58,5.0,                       bought as a gift for my grandchildren   they can be destructive and this mouse seems like it will be durable  time will tell  it works excellent  i buy a lot of  the amazon basic products and have been very pleased with them all      
59,4.0,                       most people  including myself  don t need any more mouse than this  it works well  scrolls smoothly  clicks crisply  and the scroll wheel is just fine and not too loose  i like the fact that the surface has a satiny texture rather than a glossy finish  which makes it more  grippy  and comfortable  i use this from browsing the internet to gaming  it s a huge improvement over the touch pad mouse on my laptop easy to set up and get started with  my only complaint is that  when i got it  there was a little nub of plastic left over from the molding on the right button  inside the crack between the two buttons above the scroll wheel  this would cause the buttons to bind up against one another  i simply took a razor blade and trimmed off the nub  a five second fix  and now it works      update july       i got five years of good use out of this mouse before the left click became unreliable and unresponsive  just bought another one  can i get another five years of of this one  we ll see      
60,5.0,                       perfect laptop mouse  great value  hate using a touchpad so ordered this through amazon prime  tripped over cord on my old one  which i d had for years  during football game and bent something  new one arrived as promised with the usual excellent quality  whew      
61,5.0,                       i am simple and this mouse is perfect   if simple is for you  then save your money and buy this product      
62,3.0,                       needed a new mouse  this looked acceptable  nothing outstanding  nothing negative  received in good order  and held it at the ready for the day my existing mouse became too much of a haasle to use  so in tried to plug it in four days ago  the cord  the power cord  from the mouse to the pc  is too short for my purpose  if you have your machine  pc laptop  whatever close by your side all the time  this mouse is fine  if you have an office or area with equipment placed where it is most convenient for you  but not close  this mouse is not for you  the cord is too short      
63,5.0,                       so far i have not found a amazonbasics product that i don t like   this mouse is great   fits perfectly in my hand  is very responsive with smooth operation   my ten year old even prefers this mouse while gaming over his  cool  one that has led lights all over it my only criticism is that the cord is about a foot short   my tower is on the floor  left side and by the time i run the cord behind my monitor it doesn t reach   i had to pick up a usb extender to make it work   if you cpu is closer you will have no problems and love this mouse      
64,3.0,                       there is a standard mouse size  this isn t it  it s way smaller than it should be  and given what it is  and what it s meant to compete with  it shouldn t be this small  it s hardly smaller to pass a cost savings onto me  given there are bigger names making standard size computer mice for less money  costing sometimes over     less  if you re looking for a regular computer mouse with the standard   button design  and you re expecting a standard sized mouse  miss this one      
65,4.0,                       it s hard to rise to poetic heights when writing a review of a mouse   you can spend a goodly chunk of change for a logitech or apple mouse  they re nice to look at  but functionally not really any different  so you just want an optical mouse with left right buttons and a wheel  which is also a button    this one will do the job   for some time  amazon has provided a number of products that inhabit the  add on  world   these are the things you buy when you purchase a camera  memory cards   a tv  cables  or a computer  mouse keyboard    these are typically the places where the unwary customer gets nailed with inflated prices   to their credit  amazon makes these inexpensive alternatives available  they work fine at a fraction of the price   i have no complaints with this mouse  and i really can t tell it apart from others that cost twice as much      
66,5.0,                       continuing to stick with a wired mouse  i ve found that this one withstands the many drops to the floor that i seem so often to cause when moving my laptop about  this is my second one and it has already gone through much mishandling  the first one finally gave up the ghost after a couple of years of cord yanks and floor collisions  with its durability and price  one can t complain  recommend      
67,5.0,                       every time i review an amazonbasics product  i always mention how much i love these things  the electronics are great quality  while still being inexpensive  we have the amazonbasics mouse  paper cd shredder and the dual usb car charger  all of the products work exactly as described  no issues whatsoever as the name states  they are very basic  left and right click buttons  scroll wheel  laser  the track pad on my macbook will no longer click and drag  and sometimes won t click at all  i ve been using this mouse since  it was cheap and it works on my bed  memory foam  ymmv  which is important to me  as it s the only place i really use the laptop  overall  i m very pleased with the mouse and it s held up very well  even to a bit of abuse from being stored with the macbook every night      
68,5.0,                       this works fine   it s nothing fancy   i bought it for travel and because i got sick of replacing batteries in my wireless mouse it does what it needs to   i can t really speak to gaming  as i use it for work  and it s fine for that      
69,2.0,                       since           i ve been through   of these meece  today           the  th has lost its right click  as best i remember  the others all lost their left click  it works fine for a while  time was  i would open it up and try to fix it  but those days are over      
70,2.0,                       i m really sorry amazon  i love everything you do but this mouse i couldn t use because it feels too small  i already have small hands and i think the mouse isn t long enough for me to fit in my palm  so that my hand could t rest if that makes sense  plus the scroll wheel is too far back for my finger to reach without lifting my hand up i m sorry i know i m being way too specific here  but just wanted to explain what i meant by  too small         
71,3.0,                       i have had a wireless mouse for the longest time but once my kids started using my laptop for games and homework  the thing kept going missing so i decided to go old school and get a wired mouse  the mouse works great as long as it is in one location but i had a few weeks where i had a lot of traveling with my laptop and the cord has begun to split  it does still work even in its current condition but i m doubtful it will hold up for another round of work travels      
72,4.0,                       i bought this mouse over two weeks ago and i ve been using it often ever since  the mouse has a matte feel to it and it connected well with my macbook air  it s the      version   it has a long cord  but i never removed the tie and left it tied together since the shorter length is fine with me  i personally think that both the left and right mouse buttons aren t too loud in terms of clicking  the scroll wheel is subtle and i d have to scroll a bit more to navigate up or down on a page  when i first used it  i noticed that when i would scroll with the mouse  the page would go the opposite direction  if i scrolled up  the page would go down and vice versa  that s one thing i noticed about the mouse in comparison to other mouses that i ve used  regardless  i ve gotten used to it  but i would have to adjust to other mouses that scroll the opposite way      
73,4.0,                       i ordered   at the same time  one worked flawlessly  the other was unresponsive at times  i had to get a replacement from amazon      
74,4.0,                       for the price  it was a great buy  i wouldn t recommend it for individuals who have bigger hands  though  i find that it is noticeably smaller than brand name mice from bigger manufacturers and can potentially be a little annoying for those who may be used to comparable products made by dell  hp  etc  otherwise  for moderate use  it works just fine      
75,5.0,                       as i wrote in the headline  this is a basic corded mouse that works exactly as expected  i was looking for something that would point  scroll and click  and the mouse performs very well  as a bonus  it s smaller in size  making it a good fit for kids  hands  as well  if you have a large hand  i d definitely recommend looking at other mice  since this is on the smaller side  and will likely make prolonged use uncomfortable      
76,2.0,                       it started fine but three months later and the scroll wheel has gone buggy  you scroll and scroll and the screen crawls  i turned my scroll wheel sensitivity all the way up and it still stutters and skips  not good  other mice don t have this issue  any device that you consider replacing after such a short period of time is a bad sign      
77,5.0,                       after years of replacing batteries in my wireless mouse for a laptop that sits on a desk  i finally got a clue and ordered a wired mouse   no more worries about batteries  no more worrying about turning the mouse off when i stopped working   i love this mouse   seems adequate material wise   the connecting wire is very long  can go around the laptop if necessary  i have not had it long so i cannot speak to durability  but i have probably saved its cost in batteries already gave it   stars overall  because i like it     stars for materials because it is only adequate     star for battery because that is na     stars for durability because i do not know yet so that is neutral      
78,4.0,                       i bought this  to replace the  wired one i have been using  for years    mine was  starting to make  squeak  sounds  and was  just a  travel one  that was powered  by  usb    i had  battery one  but  didnt like  replacing batteries  and had them  die  on me  in middle of game  so  i  just went to  the cheapo  travel one     this  one is  a nice  replacement  build  quality is  very nice  it is  low profile to your hand and glides across  mouse pad  easily    for the price  it is a  very  good  deal         
79,5.0,                       a sweet mouse with all the features for those who can t use a wireless mouse  great price and fast shipping can t be beat      
80,5.0,                       i have been using this little mouse all day  i bought it so that i could better work with a  d modeling app  i have a mid      macbook pro running sierra  the interface was seamless  i just plugged it in and went to work   it fits my hand comfortably and best of all  there are no batteries to deal with  nor a charging port the cord is a good length and no downloads are required   i don t need an optical mouse since i will use this only when i find the trackpad a bit awkward  plug and play  simple and cheap and gets the job done  i m very pleased      
81,4.0,                       pros   at    it is cheap enough to not to worry if it breaks or you lose one  works exactly as a mouse should  perfect size for travelcons   probably too small for bigger hands  i prefer to use larger size mouses for the ergonomics   mouse s cord is way to small if you plan to use it with a desktop computerconclusion bought three of three mouses for an office environment  this mouse does the job while being cheap      
82,2.0,                       had it for quite a while  but the top of the mouse has turned into a sticky  gooey mess   tried cleaning it with several products without success   it was inexpensive  but i would not leave it in a warm workshop or it will not take it a mouse with a hard plastic cover is more tolerant   this is probably true with any mouse with a nice soft finish      
83,3.0,                       did not realize the right middle finger would continually the right toggle  the previous mouse was not as wide and narrowed to be able to maneuver easily without making contact with the right toggle  have used this new one for several weeks with fewer mistaken right clicks but each one is a continued annoyance      
84,5.0,                       my wireless mouse was jumpy and sluggish and i tried replacing batteries several time which did not help  decided to go old school and replace with wired mouse  this economical solution is excellent  quick on the click  and no batteries to replace  highly satisfied with this and other amazon basics electronic purchases i ve made      
85,3.0,                       though the buttons and scroll wheel feel pretty good  there are lots of sharp edges on the plastic molds which makes it uncomfortable to hold  i sanded down the edges  now it feels better but my mouse looks ugly  on the upside  my mouse doesn t freeze anymore like my wireless mouse  also laser is super strong  i got in my eye couple times and it was painful      
86,2.0,                       primary problem is with the button  double clicking would intermittenly work propery  had to click    time to get something to open  and when i wanted to press and hold to drag something  it wouldn t grab  so had to keep trying until it finally worked  since this is the primary purpose of a mouse  i am very disappointed and cannot recommend      
87,1.0,                       as soon as i installed this mouse  it started squeeking as i turned the wheel   and the squeeking never stopped   avoid this one      
88,5.0,                       pros small enough for kids hands    and   year old hard for kids to lose because it s attached to the laptop  unlike wireless  does not run on batterieslength is good for a desktop computer came in a very sturdy package the mouse  clicks  when pressed  the kids know if they pressed the button or not  scrolling up and down is easy for the kids light weightthe price is affordable they have had them for about a month and they have not broken them  and they are very clumsy  cons the length was a bit too long for my kids laptops  but no biggie i just used the wire that it came with to make it shorter  otherwise  it would be a good length for a desktop computer i wish they made these for lefties  my kids had to adjust i would recommend for people that are looking for something affordable and for people that need to buy multiple ones      
89,2.0,                       i wanted to like this wired mouse  it had a decent feel to it when i first plugged it in  not a high dollar mouse by any means  but it felt pretty good in my hand  it was fairly quiet with the clicks and i liked the length and width of this mouse  could have been a little bit bigger to be a perfect size for a wired mouse  but personal preference is taken into consideration here  i have large hands and cant use the smaller peripherals  the downfall with the amazonbasics mouse for me has been this  i have purchased two of these  neither one lasted very long at all  by not lasting long  i mean the first one lasted a few weeks and developed a noticeable skip of the cursor when using the mouse  no  it didn t happen right away but within   weeks i couldn t use it  the second mouse was a bigger disappointment as it lasted   weeks at most  then started doing the same thing  skipping and acting as if it were having a seizure when scrolling over buttons or links on a page  it happened frequently  i use a wired mouse  company policy  daily  sometimes up to    hours in a day or more when adding in personal time  i have to be able to count on my computer and peripherals    keyboard  mouse and monitor for my job  this amazonbasics wired mouse was just a disappointment for me  i wanted to like it  but i have never owned any mouse  wired or wireless that didn t last for at least   year to    months minimum  many have lasted     years for my systems  i saw a couple of other reviews saying the same thing about the mouse acting up during use and the cursor problem  i am very surprised the reviews are so high  did i want a replacement or to try it again  no thanks  third time is not the charm      
90,5.0,                       been using this amazon basics   button usb mouse for more than a year now  works flawlessly at least in my experience  nice fit on the hand and tactile surface  the scroll button click works well with cad programs too  i ve purchased multiples of these mice and have had no regrets      
91,4.0,                       when i got a new pc while deciding on the keyboard and mouse to buy i went with amazon basics as the price is lower  the comfort level is average but not great for long work sessions  it is a laser mouse so it works pretty well on that end  it has a plastic feel although that s to be expected with the lower cost mouses      
92,3.0,                       warning do not buy if you have respiratory issues  to start my review this product was late and i am a prime member   though i was promised by an amazon representative it will not happen again   the product itself arrived in my mailbox   it had a very strong smell of cologne  detergent  or perfume   once i opened it the smell became evident   i got a mouse pad with it so i thought it may have been the mouse pad s chemical smell   however  it surely was not   the smell came from the mouse box  i opened the box and smelled the mouse and it was indeed the mouse that smelled of that substance   i have asthma and whatever this substance was immediately triggered my asthma   i am going to attempt to wash off the smell because i really need this mouse to finish some work the mouse works fine as a mouse  no complaints there  all three buttons work   it would be a five star review if not for the hideous smell   so if you don t mind those sorts of things and don t have a respiratory issue then you should be golden with this      
93,5.0,                       this little mouse give you solid return for the price  it functions well and feels of strong quality  my only issue is that its a little small for my hand      
94,3.0,                       for    not much to complain other than that you should probably fork over a little extra money for a mouse if you plan to use it for more than ten minutes at a time because it is super uncomfortable to use  the buttons have a nice click but other than that you re better off with a laser sensor mouse that is more ergonomic      
95,1.0,                       i bought this because i could not get used to using my laptop   i was raking lessons on using the laptop  i was used to using a pc and bought the mouse to make it easier for me  covid came and the lessons stopped after one lesson  i got to use the mouse once before it crapped out on me  it was a waste of money and would not recommend it for anyone  i tried it with my pc and it didn t work with it either      
96,5.0,                       i am a gamer  student  worker    i need a mouse that can work on a table  desk  or in bed  i have no complaints with this mouse  it was cheap  it is wired  wireless mouses can drive me nuts when the battery runs out   i am right now using it  it is comfortable for my hands  nice size  smooth    no complaints  let s see how long it will last      
97,5.0,                       my cousin has a laptop that has one of those finger thumb sensitive  mouse pads  that worked irratically    and her laptop didn t support a wireless mouse   this mouse worked flawlessly upon arrival and i located the w   setting that disabled the builtin mouse pad when this mouse was connected   a win  win       
98,3.0,                       i received this today and notice that the wheel squeaks when rotated   sounds like a mouse i guess    i can live with this annoyance since returning it would be a hassle      
99,5.0,                       if you re looking for a cheap  durable  basic mouse  then this amazon basics mouse might be the one for you   i bought this   years ago and am just starting to have intermittent issues with the left mouse button  but as far as i m concerned    for a mouse that lasts    years is a great value      
100,2.0,                       this mouse is smaller than any other supposedly  standard  sized mouse i ve bought   it is substantially smaller than the basic mouses you have no doubt used from hi volume pc manufacturers   take a look at the ventral view photo   the portion of the mouse that should be under the heel of the hand has been unaccountably abbreviated   nay  amputated if you want a smallish mouse  almost a mini mouse   this one is for you   it is reasonably well constructed and has no other faults      
101,1.0,                       the three buttons are too sensitive when clicking  for example it s too easy to click when you are scrolling  i would like a little adjustment to  stiffen up  the clicks update  after using it for about an hour or so i went back to my old mouse which still had it s issues but worked better than the new one  this mouse is way too easy to click on things you don t intend to  after buying a string of these over the years  this is my last one      
102,2.0,                       this mouse is slightly smaller than my old one  which could be a pro or a con depending on your hand size and the intended use  i e  for a laptop   the scroll wheel works smoothly and the buttons are easy to click  i started noticing odd behavior immediately after i installed the mouse  i would sometimes have to hold down the left button for a moment before it would properly left click  too light or too quick a touch would result in the equivalent of a right click  something i ve never seen before  the mouse driver and double click speed settings are correct  i think this mouse is just defective  i ordered a kensington mouse in a box at the same time and that one works fine  it s slightly larger and has none of the strange left clicking issues  i should have skipped the amazon mouse and ordered two of the kensingtons instead      
103,5.0,                       update  on a colleague s advice  tried it at home on a desktop mac with work software  i m never going back to the mac wireless mouse  no squirreliness as the cursor moves across the screen how do people get through the workday on a laptop without a mouse  i d rather eat ground up thumb drives than drag my fingers across that ridiculous pad thing so  yeah  using this thing fairly screams   i love windows       not that i do   but i don t care  it moves when you need it to move  it clicks when you need it to click  it plugged in and installed itself in less than    seconds      
104,5.0,                       i used to only use the trackpad and then i started playing video games bc what else am i gonna do in       so then i wanted a relatively cheap mouse and this does the trick  i ve had it for   months and nothing has broken or changed or frayed or rubbed off  i am really not picky about the mouse i use but there is nothing glaringly wrong with it so if that s what you re looking for at this price point i d recommend it      
105,1.0,                       it i use it for email  surfing amazon  fb   not gaming  yet it seems like it would be horrible for gaming  i dunno i for some reason put off ordering  finally gave myself a dope slap and cut loose with th    i hoped that i could turn off the annoying finger pad  although it works good  and use the mouse i often ham fist the finger pad   thus  get a mouse  right but   this pos   it is sooooo sensitive i can barely control it i need to hold my finger above the buttons  else it registers a click seriously  touch it and it is a click one gazillionth of an inch travel and it registers you can t rest your fingers they must hover over the button it is very distracting   i can only use it a few minutes at a time cuz the slightest touch and you are either deleting  or paying  or going to another page perhaps there is an adjustment that can be made and this is my fault no instructions explaining sensitivity      
106,3.0,                       based on past good experiences with amazon basics products i took a chance but in this case you get what you pay for     spend the extra money on something better i travel with this in my back pack and one has already fell apart i had my previous microsoft mouse for     years before the tsa killed it     you get what you pay for      
107,3.0,                       this was purchased in oct       a year later i have to buy a new one  maybe i expect too much but it seems this should work a bit longer i ve been thru this before with much a cheaper mouse from china  lol  aren t they all from china    i could have bought   of those cheapies for what this amazon basics cost  it seems i fell for the  amazon  name  expecting somehow it would be a better quality  the next one will be a cheapo  live and learn      
108,3.0,                       bought this mouse to replace on that i have had for years  the price was right  the mouse feels fine in the hand   good response to clicking what i do not like about the mouse and why i gave it   stars is that its a bit small compared to a normal mouse  it causes alittle strain in the arm after long usage from having to hold mouse with hand closer to edge of desk  if this mouse was about an inch in length and width it would be a perfect mouse other issue is that the cord is to short  i am right handed and have the computer to my left  pluging mouse in back usb gives less length to have on my right side this mouse would be better suited for laptops and for those with smaller hands still  good price till i find a mouse that i would like better      
109,3.0,                       this is the second of these mice that i ve purchased  the first one lasted about   years  but started having some sort of problem with the buttons  clicks weren t being recognized   almost like it didn t recognize when you let up on the button or something because i was having horrible problems trying to highlight text etc  sooooo    i ponied up another     to replace it with a new one  this new one works great  but the scroll wheel makes an incredibly annoying squeaking sound  gah  i may try to take it apart and see if i can oil it or something   i ll probably practice on the old one first   but this may just be a case of  you get what you pay for  and i may have to go find another brand  it s just hard to find one that isn t wireless these days  and i get really tired of the batteries dying on my constantly  harumph      
110,4.0,                       i needed a new mouse for my desktop and didn t want to pay a lot because computer mice are incredibly simple and shouldn t cost a lot  this one was super cheap and the quality seems good so far and it works perfectly but it s too small and the ergonomics are not the best  i guess that s what i get for not spending more on a fancy ergo mouse  nothing at all wrong with it realistically though and if you have small hands this might be the mouse for you      
111,5.0,                       i wish i d bought a wired mouse years ago  this works so much better than my last two wireless mouses which cost so much more  required batteries  were frequently subject to interference from various wireless signals like from my smartphone  and ended up crapping out despite gentle use i guess sometimes  low tech  has advantages      
112,2.0,                       this mouse is certainly on the small side  but has a nice texture to it  which provides decent grip and feel   the click action is light  with minimal noise  requiring a light touch howeverthis mouse frequently loses its usb connection to the computer   windows doesn t have much info on the drivers for it  and its unstable as result   once a usb connection is lost  you have to restart your computer to get it to work again   simply unplugging it and plugging it back in does not work   this is not a one time occurrence  this has happened three times in the past several days      
113,4.0,                       this mouse was put into place to replace an aging logitech mouse  it s fairly light  which can take some getting used to if your other mice have some heft to them  some reviews recommend disassembling it and putting in some washers or weights for mass  i ve gotten used to it pretty quickly the biggest challenge i ran into is that the cord      meters  isn t quite long enough to reach to a desktop computer which isn t really close  if you have a computer under the desk  or a desk with holes to direct cords  you may find that it can be a little taut sometimes  if this is the case  look for one with a   meter cord  kensington s budget mouse   k     us is good   if you re working with a laptop  all in one  or a computer on your desk  they you will probably want a shorter cord      
114,5.0,                       i have to say i kinda love this mouse   it s extremely lightweight and cheap and perfect for my kids let me explain   i love logitech  it s my personal mouse of choice  however  my hand me down mice to my tween and teen haven t held up well  the problem is consistently the usb end   not sure what my kids do with them  but they cease to work after a month   doesn t matter if the mice are used or new   it s a death sentence to hand them to the kids enter the amazonbasics cheapo mouse   it s been   months and it s plugging away   the bestest part about this whole arrangement is that if something does go wrong  it s inexpensive to fix summarycouldn t be happier  this is not a mouse i would use because i like a mouse with some weight and one that is wireless  but it s a fantastic option for my tween and teen and i d suggest it for younger children too it works  there is no dongle to use   and if it breaks it s cheap to replace      
115,5.0,                       very ergonomic and accurate compared to the large heavy palm mice   these palm mice  ironically  are supposed to be more ergonomic  but in moving a mouse with your palm   you are forced to use the large muscle groups in your arm and shoulder   with a smaller and lighter mouse  you move the mouse with just your fingers  so the wrist and elbow ideally hardly move at all  reducing wrist strain   also  the smaller muscles in your hand are much more suitable to fine detailed work like moving a mouse to highlight a single character on the screen  or illustrating   after all  you would not want to write calligraphy with a pen at the end of a pool ball just because it more  ergonomic   would you   you would use a small and light stylus just large enough to grip comfortably  but no larger      
116,4.0,                       this is a solid cheap mouse so i m giving it   stars  it isn t quite as comfortable and ergonomic as my logitech mice  mouses    but you can t beat the price      
117,5.0,                       wow  reviewing my past orders for a different reason  i just realized that this little mouse  which i purchased almost   years ago for about      is the only mouse i have been using ever since  and i mean using it for hours and hours on daily bases  never had one single issue with it honestly  i never had such a good long lasting mouse before  regardless how much i paid for it      
118,5.0,                       it is not  sexy  like a magic mouse from apple  however  i could buy    of these for the price of one magic mouse  at the rate i break my mice   this is an easy decision  this mouse is definitely not as pleasing as the magic mouse  but when i come to learn how to use it best  it will be my most cost saving purchase ever      
119,5.0,                       this amazon basics mouse has less of a  hump  than the logitech m    corded mouse   i bought the amazon basics mouse for our school where ladies and children would use it  with smaller hands    i like the larger m    logitech mouse for myself   men  if you don t need the mouse to fill up the inner curve of your man size hand  then this amazon basics mouse will be fine      
120,4.0,                       i regularly use a  gaming  mouse  because of the high dpi for the price  by comparison  this is a really  really low dpi mouse  with such a low dpi  you may notice that really small movements are not registered by the mouse  so beware of that  due to the low dpi i would not suggest using this for gaming or digital art purposes  but this is a fantastic mouse for in case your main one breaks  or you want a wired solution for a laptop pros  small form factor makes this a really portable mouse  and it certainly feels robust enough to really throw around  and that this price  it is not like you would be too concerned with it breaking   high quality material  while this is a really light mouse  it does not have that  cheap plastic  feel to it  the frame of the mouse does not creak or flex even when intentionally trying to crush it in the hand  very solid design cons  small form factor  this mouse is really small  i have a bit of a large hand so having this mouse be so small starts to ache your hand a bit with prolonged use  short cord  this mouse has a pretty short cord  so using the rear io ports is almost not an option if you have a full tower or have your computer more than about a foot or two away  small dpi  really small mouse movements will not be recorded  particularly noticeable when performing small circles with the mouse  the on screen mouse will seem floaty and this problem will be more noticeable with a higher resolution screen      
121,3.0,                       it s a functional mouse   my only issue with it is that the right mouse button is very sensitive and placed in a position that i keep accidently pressing it   it s an annoyance   i bought two mice when my old microsoft mouse final went bad   this one and the rii   i ll be using the rii      
122,4.0,                       the mouse seems to work just fine  although i haven t used it much yet  no cursor jumping around on the screen like i ve had with other mice  my only issue is the excessively long cord  i ended up winding the cord behind the laptop and plugging it in on the left side while using the mouse on the right      
123,3.0,                       it s just ok  my wireless mouse continually got knocked on the floor  so i got this so i don t have to keep picking it up  i can just pull up by the cord   internal laptop mouse is broken  the l mouse click came mashed down  for the money  i just gave it gentle pull and now it  clicks  ok  but don t expect much  it is just a cheap  chinsy  mouse made in china sold under the amazon name  was going to send it back  but what the heck  it works now      
124,5.0,                       i received this mouse on nov          and i have no complaints up to date  when i was looking to purchase a new mouse i was very focused on ordering a gaming mouse but honestly  why  i used to play all of my pc games with a mini travel mouse and it worked just fine until it took a shat on me  its okay  it was free   so i decided against spending tons of cash on something i didn t really need and instead bought this simple amazon basics mouse  i love it  its actually quite nice and i find it to be very comfortable  i seriously recommend this mouse to any and all because its inexpensive but extremely effective  i ve carried it with me in my laptop bag many times and accidentally caused the clicker panels to rise up but i simply pop them back in to place and they have never stopped working    note  they are not flimsy  i just carry allot of stuff in my bag        
125,5.0,                       i bought this mouse for exclusive use with my work laptop  which i frequently port around with me in a timbuk  laptop messenger bag  i specifically went with a wired model for a couple of reasons  first  i ve had bad luck with bluetooth mice frequently losing connectivity  my theory is that this is due to interference with other bluetooth devices   i m almost always using my work laptop while also talking on my cellphone with a bluetooth headset  whether or not that s the reason  the bluetooth mouse solution wasn t working for me  second  my laptop just barely fits into the laptop sleeve in my messenger bag as is  meaning it will not easily fit if i had to leave a usb receiver plugged in for a traditional wireless mouse  i figure if i need to plug   unplug the usb receiver easy time anyhow  then i might as well just use a wired mouse this mouse is on the smaller side  but that s fine considering i m using it with a mobile laptop on the go  nice rubberized surface texture  very light weight  cord is approximately    long      
126,5.0,                       that it lasted   months was amazing   with kids banging about a and dog that likes to jump over the side to my lap having a mouse that will keep working even after being knocked down repeatedly is wonderful prior fancy  ie expense name brand  mice only lasted     months at most   very frustrating   if this gives me another   months  as i expect   i ll be well satisfied      
127,5.0,                       i picked up   of amazonbasic   button usb wired mouse to replace some aging and dying hp mice   they work great and fit your hand nicely   the only thing i can say negatively is they are very light   the mouse weights only   oz   the hp mice we replaced weighted     oz   now you wouldn t think that     oz  would make that big of a difference  but it does   it took us a few days of using the amazonbasic mouse to get use to them being so light   so allow yourself some time to get use to the mouse being very light weight if you looking for a very good mouse and don t want to spend a whole lot of money  then pick one up      
128,5.0,                       can t really attest to battery life or durability just yet  but this is a very comfortable to use  perfectly fine mouse for everyday use  works every bit as well as those costing far more  will update review if this mouse turns out to be less than durable  but i m very happy with it now      
129,5.0,                       this is a great mouse for school  work  and normal use  i would suggest something else if you are using it for gaming or anything that requires a really sensitive mouse      
130,5.0,                       it s a mouse there are no fancy additional buttons that fall off the moment you touch them  no  ergonomic  irregularities that in reality exacerbate your rsi  no batteries that run out whenever you least expect them  no  anti bacterial  rubbery parts that start rotting  smelling awful and crumbling in just a couple of weeks it s just    an ordinary mouse that does its job  nothing more  nothing less      
131,5.0,                       i ve had wireless mice  trackball  expensive  cheap    you name it  this is a great basic mouse that does what you want it to do  i ve had this in service every day for almost a year with no issues  i work from home so this is used       hours a day with no issues  accurate  no jumps  easy to use and reliable  perfect      
132,5.0,                       this was an emergency purchase  i d somehow managed to brick my way pricey brand name suitable for gaming mouse    like i  needed  new drivers    this little black rodent was rushed to me  was accepted kindly by windows  and if i d quit eating at my desk  it would probably be a little cleaner    but it would work just the same  which is as good as i ve seen in thirty years of meece    disclosure  i am not much of a gamer       
133,4.0,                       i like this mouse overall  it s a good size for my hands  not too big  simple  cheap  all in all a serviceable choice  i first ordered one in      and it lasted several years  by       it started to degrade  and it would  you know  like  register extra clicks  that sort of thing  i replaced it with another of the same  and again  similar performance  now in       the new one has finally begun to suffer the same issues  so i d say it has a lifespan of about   years it works  it s fine  obviously it would have been better if it lasted longer  but i do feel i got reasonable value for the price  and i wouldn t feel bad about buying it again  i will say if you have larger hands  it might not be  like  ergonomic or whatever  as it is a small mouse  so  be aware of that      
134,5.0,                       i bought a few of those tiny cheap mouse from frys and who would think there will be a problem with mouse  well  it double click with just one click and so annoying  this solved my problem  it worked just the same as my old branded mouse      
135,3.0,                       this mouse  for all points and purposes  does the job it s supposed to do  helping me click on things  it is smaller than i expected though which makes it a bit less comfortable to hold and i don t even have large hands  also  the buttons click a bit too easily  i ve found myself accidentally clicking on many occasions  i m not sure if it s just the buttons or also due in part to the small size  but that is a bit irritating  otherwise  it does everything a mouse should technically do so i can t give it too low of a score  for the price  it s fine  but i would recommend something else if you re not strapped for cash      
136,5.0,                       these mice work good  i ve already owned one that lasted about a year   then quit working  i replaced it w  one from a store irl  and that one only lasted for a couple months  so back to amazon i came to buy   of these mice  they both work fine  one i m using   the other i keep in a drawer for when this one quits  the only problem i have w  these mice is my fingers twitch  and i right click a lot by accident when my fingers twitch  it would be nice if the buttons weren t so easy to click by accident i guess      
137,5.0,                       everything feels good   scroll wheel works good   feels good   can push it in for adjustable functionality    mine is set to open a link into a new tab  i used to have a mouse with a button on the left side that i set to go back a page while surfing the net       that would be a nice addition  but this is just fine for what it is   a basic mouse      
138,5.0,                       i had one of the  high tech  mice with buttons on the top and side  the side buttons are  back  and  forward   and i have big fingers  so i was constantly clicking these annoying buttons by accident   i hated this  high tech  mouse more than i can describe  every time i touched it  i would end up losing my page or place   so annoying   all i wanted was a basic mouse   no frills   no secret buttons or bars   just a plain old mouse  this  is that mouse   just a wheel and two top buttons  and i love this mouse as much as i love my wife these mice are super comfortable in my  really large  hand  and my wife likes them as well  even though she s got a little teeny tiny hand  one mouse for us all   try this mouse  you ll love it   i promise      
139,5.0,                       received this a couple of days ago  and immediately plugged it into my mac mini   it works so much better than the apple  magic mouse  that i had ordered with the mac  there is no comparison   admittedly  i come from a    year windows pc background  so a long time mac person will no doubt take exception to this  but to me the mm with its trackpad like button arrangement is just too weird  plus it s built in battery must be recharged by plugging mm into a usb port  and of course you can t use the mouse while it s recharging   i tried it for   months  but no more   this amazonbasics mouse does exactly what i want it to do  and nothing that i don t want   mm goes back into its box      
140,1.0,                       i bought a few of these in        it took about       years of heavy use for the left click to get unreliable   for the price  i figured this was an adequate lifespan i bought four more in october        first thing i noticed was that the new ones were noticeably flimsier in construction   second thing i noticed was that surfaces the      model had no problem with  the      model wouldn t work on   had to buy a mousepad like it was      third thing was that one of the      mice completely died after about    days of use   amazon says it  might  be eligible for replacement until october      but doesn t actually give me a button on the website to return or replace this product   for       i don t expect a lot of mouse  but i do expect more than    days      
141,5.0,                       though my laptop has the usual scroll mouse thing built into it  i can never seem to get it to respond the way a regular mouse does and thus i get frustrated and put my laptop into tablet mode just to not have to deal with it  after purchasing a laptop table tray for when i want to use my laptop on the couch  i decided to get a basic mouse and a basic mouse pad to use with it  this does the trick and the price is good      
142,5.0,                       i love this mouse  because it does exactly what i expect a mouse to do  it doesn t require a battery like wireless mice do  this simplifies life  which i like  it is symmetrical  and can be used for either your left or right hand  you would just have to change the primary mouse button setting in your windows computer settings  under mouse    click windows   or    icon in lower left corner of screen  click settings  gear icon   click devices  then click mouse  then click to change the primary mouse button from left to right  or vice versa  you don t have to purchase an expensive  left hand  mouse  this can be helpful if you re getting carpal tunnel like discomfort in your right index finger      
143,5.0,                       like other reviews have said  this mouse is shorter and not as long as a normal mouse the way you would expect it to be   so after saying this  why the  star review   its absolutely perfect for my kids   my kids are using the computer a lot more now and it fits their hands perfectly   its easy for them to use and is comfortable for their hands   its helping them to be more proficient with their computer skills and that is a win for me   if you need a mouse for a child or teen  i highly recommend this mouse   if you are looking for a mouse for an adults hand to use  especially if used frequently  you might want to consider an alternative      
144,1.0,                       this mouse is garbage  don t waste the     stopped working after a couple months  just needed an extra emergency mouse for home when i forget my mouse at work  this constantly connects   un connects   then reconnects  and the cycle goes on  not worth it  a n n o y i n g      
145,1.0,                       i bought this   months ago   now it cuts on and off while i m using it   in addition to working only intermittently  it makes that annoying connecting disconnecting sound  i think the cable is failing  it s not my usb ports    time to go back to a cordless mouse   for twice the price i could probably get a mouse that lasts ten times longer      
146,5.0,                       i debated going back to a wired mouse  gave some of the reviews here a read  and realized others were experiencing the same frustrations with the cost  the batteries  and ineffective and imprecise mouse control   i am soooooo enjoying having a mouse that works with precision again and it was sooooooooo cheap      
147,5.0,                       the good  wonderful feel  texture  and very light movement of the cursor   easy to click right and left buttons with an slight audible snick sound   it is smaller than my old dell mouse that i can no longer purchase  but very comfortable   it has a smooth scrolling wheel that i can barely feel  which is good   and absolutely quiet  also good  the bad   cord is way too short for my pc computer box because it is on the left side on the floor  and i am right handed  i need a     inch long usb cord to connect it to the rear where the mouse was supposed to be connected so i could thread it behind the computer desk  the monitor  and have it reach comfortably on the right hand side of the keyboard  i m keeping it  because i had one usb slot on the front of my computer  that i liked to use for uploading my camera photos  gps  etc   now i can t do that  so i m going to have to find another wired mouse that will accommodate my previous set up   i prefer wired  not wireless summary   good for the money and quality  especially if you only have a cell phone   those with desktop p c   lap tops or notebooks should find this fine   if you have large hands  you will probably prefer something else   my hands and fingers are on the short side  size   gloves  so i find it comfortable   i ve purchased the new mouse for the second time now  and gave it   stars now  instead of     if you found my review helpful  please let me know by checking the box below   thanks      
148,5.0,                       i was clueless when my mouse started acting really weirdly  it never dawned on me it had died  but after my computer actually sent a message   replace your mouse now     i walked down to the corner office supply store  you know  the huge one  and the only mice they had were really expensive  so i came home and ordered this one  very excellent product  three buttons  works really well      
149,5.0,                       its a basic simple mouse  left  right click  and middle scroll  has a usb connector so its not wireless  cord is at least   ft long  i m a semi gamer and it last a good amount of time  i do buy extras to have them on hand cause what seems to break  st is the left click  you click it and half the time it doesn t respond  again this is after a fairly long time  i ve bought several and will continue  i recommend      
150,5.0,                       this mouse is just a tad shorter than my oem hp tower mouse but there is less effort clicking the buttons because it is shorter i don t know how that will pan out for the long haul in the ergonomics department i had both of them installed on my tower at the same time  i have nerve damage and this superfluous configuration gave me some ideas about a new crutch i bought this for my new win   laptop because me   touch keypad mouse   disaster      
151,2.0,                       has excellent hand feel  is smooth and effective  is compatible with chromebook  windows    and windows    the matte finish is pleasant to the touch and in appearance  durability appears to be a problem  however  in my sample  the wheel developed a defect after about   weeks of moderate use in which scrolled content would  bounce  as though the detector inside the mouse had broken free or was flapping  result in a signal opposite to the intended movement immediately after using the wheel to scroll a page  at first i figured this must be a problem with software or cpu load  advertising  right    but when it persisted across multiple machines and different operating systems  it was clear that the mouse wheel was the culprit  i m buying another because it is inexpensive compared to the value  but i m hoping that the first one was just an anomalous defect      
152,4.0,                       this computer mouse is a good value for the money  i gave it four stars because the device is too short and too thin for a person with big hands  to use and analogy  a professional basketball player has much larger hands than a little old lady  they obviously wear different size gloves but they both use the same mouse  the size of the mouse is good for a diminutive woman but way too small for an adult man  personally  my fingers extend way beyond the edge of the mouse  this mouse is essentially too short and too thin to be ergonomically comfortable for an adult male  ideally  a computer mouse should be custom made to fit a person s hand  but this is not possible      
153,4.0,                       i already have the same style amazon basic mouse  bought a few years back  that one works just fine so when it was time a second mouse  of course i just got one more it s loud  the damn thing squeaks like a mouse complaining about the lack of cheese if it were easy  i d send it back  demanding another one  amazon  this is really poor  i expect better update received a replacement from amazon quickly  hooray this mouse has been fed  no squeaking     changed review from   to   stars      
154,5.0,                       this mouse is very comfortable to hold  it has a kind of silky finish on it that feels soft   and it works fine  on my windows   pro computer    just plug it in and go  it s cheap  too  overall  an excellent value for the price details  it s a three button mouse  well two buttons and the scroll wheel can be pressed to drag pages   and it s a laser mouse  no mouse ball    do they even  make  mouse balls anymore  oh golly  i hope not      in other words  it s your standard usb corded mouse  the cord is a few inches shorter than my previous mouse  but that s not an issue for me since the mouse is beside my tower      
155,5.0,                       my battery operated mouse finally ate it  and that is not the cheese i am referring to  the one thing that disappoints an old fart who is accustomed to buying something once and making it last forever is the planned obsolescence that forces us to constantly buy new   when it comes to modern technology  i have about half a dozen mice i can no longer use  this one  is sleek  charming  quiet  easy to operate on a variety of tabletops  responsive  quick  and i am not suffering the carpal tunnel pain because it does not sit so high  it is well designed and very efficient and a godsend since i am a ms veteran user  and even though the mousepad works  i actually find the positioning and the poise i must maintain to quickly navigate using the mousepad makes my hands  wrists and arms hurt  i also make many mistakes with the mousepad  yeah  i am old now  i get to accommodate my age  and this mouse is the answer  love  love  love this mouse      
156,5.0,                       who would have thought that an ancient piece of equipment like this would ever be needed again  but i had a recent computer crash in which the wifi wad not recognized  by the machine  and without wifi i could not startup the reboot procedure  with this wired into a usb port  i was able achieve a complete reinstall of all programs      
157,5.0,                       since i have a mouse that is plugged in to my computer   i have never had a problem with it not working for me  like the battery operated mouse would always do   there is nothing that i dislike about it  it always works for me at my stationary computer      
158,4.0,                       i was hoping this would be a full size mouse but compared with two other standard mice i have it s about a half inch short and not at tall      
159,4.0,                       this mouse is tiny  unsuitable for daily use  presumably should be marketed as a travel mouse rather than a basic computer mouse its movement feels tight and responsive and smooth  the tension and the tactile feedback of the buttons and the wheel are excellent but it is so tiny that it makes practically no contact with my palm  its motion is controlled primarily by the two side fingers but this alone is imprecise and thus the button fingers get involved particularly when doing quick precise motions or vertical motions  and this means many accidental clicks  try minesweeper   it s also easy to accidentally click the mouse when moving one s hand back to it  it requires more attention and effort to use than my old intellimouse explorer     which is a large mouse with a curved design whose purpose i hadn t completely understood until just now  this amazon mouse was not designed to be easily picked up or to be held without active effort  but other than that  it s great      
160,4.0,                       you pay for what you get  which is a decent  no frills mouse  the button action is soft and it s not the world s most high resolution mouse  but it more than suffices for office work  it also doesn t have any annoying  unnecessary led lights however  i m not a fan of the rubberized top  which can wear away and get sticky over time and is kind of difficult to keep clean since it absorbs oils from your hand  in fact  one of these amazonbasics mice that i have seems to have permanent sticky residue from the rubberized coating wearing away  and i ll probably have to discard it despite it otherwise working fine  next time i ll probably buy a different cheap mouse without the coating      
161,5.0,                       it took no more time to receive the amazonbasics   button usb wired mouse that it would have to make a special trip the store  and the price was lower than any other  even considering my wife s employee discount at walmart    opened the packaged  plugged it in  it works flawlessly note   i rather strongly prefer a wired usb mouse over a wireless one   my mouse is almost constantly in motion and i ll run down a battery every day  so the one wireless mouse that i tried was a real nuisance most important to me   it solves the problem i wanted to solve   after several years of reliable operation  my old logitech   button wired mouse had started developing odd symptoms   it would double click when i pressed the left button about   out of   times  and the problem was getting worse   copy and paste had become nearly impossible   dragging files from one spot to another was more likely to fail than succeed   i searched the web about the problem   a few sites bad mouthed different versions of windows   many offered to sell me their software that would surely solve the problem   but most simply added up to    your mouse is broke   get a new one  this mouse is a little lighter than the old logitech mouse and has a slightly different shape  so it took about    minutes of mouse intensive operations   d modeling  actually  to retrain my brain   the cord is a little stiffer  so i had to adjust the routing for the wire at the mouse end to make sure it had enough play to stay in place on my slippery mouse pad    it doesn t really need a mouse pad  i just like to protect the mouse from any accumulated grunge on my desktop       
162,4.0,                       needed something to replace my aging microsoft intellimouse explorer      the old mouse still works great  but the rubberized surface is starting to get a bit tacky  so i wanted another one of those   except they don t make that particular style anymore  there is sort of a replacement  but not hearing good things about it   so i wanted just a inexpensive basic mouse to use while i shopped for something more to my liking  this amazonbasic had the features i wanted   three button  wired    inexpensive   so i got one of these  it works  it s a bit smaller than i like  but it seems to be doing the job  the cord is plenty long enough and since i m just doing basic computer stuff and not video gaming  it more than adequate for my needs  i m satisfied with my purchase      
163,2.0,                       usually amazon basics products are good and priced reasonably  the problem with this mouse is that it has hair trigger buttons and it clicks just by placing your finger on it  sometimes it double clicks when you want a single click  this may cause severe problems by changes in your directories you didn t want occurring in a blink of an eye and you not knowing what happen  the horizontal movement is accurate      
164,5.0,                       it can get very frustrating when your old mouse stops working  and sometimes it s hard to tell whether the problem is in the mouse or the computer  my old usb mouse began double clicking when i only single clicked  and it was a real pain in the neck  you d click next and the computer read it twice so you d advance two screens and have to back up  stuff like that  i dug up another usb mouse to test  but it had the same issue  so i suspected it was a problem with my settings or the operating system  i checked and rechecked everything to no avail  slowed my mouse clicking rate  etc    then ran across a piece of advice saying that often if you test using another older mouse  it is prone to the same problem  which has to do with a degraded switch  bouncing   so i chucked both old mice and ordered this one excellent price  performs as expected right out of the box  nothing to download   i mean  all that stuff that we expect nowadays  i don t like mice with additional buttons and stuff  so it s perfect  i did mark it just a   for portability because it would be a little bit more hassle to wind up the cord every time i take my laptop out  so i use wired mice strictly at my desk  and use a wireless when i go out      
165,1.0,                       works well for the price  seems like it should hold up at least as well as my previous mouse that came with the computer  it also glides more smoothly than my last mouse and i don t think it s just because it s new  i think it s because the glide pads on the bottom have a better layout   design  it also has a matte finish so is starting to show wear where my fingers go  this is why i gave it   stars figuring if they used a glossy finish this would not happen so quickly  there s really no improvement over any other regular shaped mouse either so it s not a   star item update         the mouse still works ok but the soft touch finish has been peeling off almost from the beginning  once it s off i ll have a regular old hard plastic mouse versus one that looks like it got a sun burn and has it s skin peeling off  i probably would have just bought a logitec or other higher priced one if i know this would happen  it does look kind of gross but since it works it s silly to replace it for only that update         the peeling is getting worse and it stopped working for a bit  i had an extra mouse though so used it for a bit instead of this one  finally after being fed up with the amazon one not working i slammed it down a couple times and it decided to start working again  i guess a short got reconnected or something goofy like that      
166,4.0,                       there s absolutely nothing special about this mouse  it is a generic red led optical mouse with three buttons and a scroll wheel that goes in one direction  that s it  it feels light    only   g     of which is    m of thin usb cable  despite that  it doesn t feel necessarily cheap    the plastics are sturdy and don t seem to flex oddly  it glides on three teflon feet you don t buy this mouse because you are shopping for a great mouse  you buy this mouse because you need a mouse overnight and you do not want to pay     for it   and for that use case  this is a  great  mouse      
167,5.0,                       battery life  it doesn t take batteries  oh well    yeah    it s great    not to expensive  works well    nothing more annoying than using your pc and having an intermittent mouse button  great replacement   i don t like wireless    the battery always goes bad when you are in the field miles from a store   so yeah    nice  gonna buy a spare    they are not expensive      
168,4.0,                       mouse quality is decent  the material is very smooth and conveniently shaped for the hands to grasp  however the layout of the buttons is a bit flawed in design  the side click buttons are a bit too close to the center mouse wheel button  so there will occasionally be errant clicks when left clicking or scrolling  clicking the mouse wheel  it is something to consider as you will have to adjust to the mouse s layout  otherwise the product is good quality and cheap  arrived on time in just   days      
169,4.0,                       i am deployed to afghanistan and needed a kvm setup as the unit i work for gave my stuff to the upper chain of command  that being said  i was looking for inexpensive and functional  the reviews for this mouse sounded like it would fit the part just fine for my mouse  it is just a simple two button   wheel mouse  the wheel also functions as the third button  the shape is slightly different from any other mouse that i have used  the bottom flairs out to the top and the middle  just behind the buttons is little wider than normal  i have found that if you use three fingers to operate the mouse leaving your middle finger on the wheel that this shape is actually nice as it my little finger and thumb rest nicely on that mid section all in all i think this is a very functional   capable little mouse  it is inexpensive and does what it needs to do  is this a good replacement or alternative for that cyborg rat    not by any means  that is not this mouse s intended purpose  if you are just looking for a simple mouse that is inexpensive  i would recommend this mouse any day i also like the flat black look as opposed to the glossy black      
170,4.0,                       i purchased a two pack of these for my    year old to use with his laptop  he loves playing roblox on his computer and was pretty rough with his mouse  and broke it  i wanted a suitable replacement and seemed to have found it  the computer  running windows     recognized the mouse and it installed with no problems  it s small enough for his little hands  scrolls smoothly and the buttons and scroll wheel work fine  the usb connector fits nice and snug and doesn t wiggle in the port  my son has no complaints  and i like that i was able to get two for less than i would spend in a chain store for one  please note  this mouse is smaller than a full size mouse and more appropriate for a child or an adult with smaller hands      
171,4.0,                       this mouse may be cheap  but it actually feels sturdier than my twenty dollar mouse that stopped working in less than a year  this mouse doesn t feel cheaply made  which surprised me  i was expecting a cheap  light built plastic mouse that rattled when you shook it     i got none of that  no rattling  it isn t a light feeling plastic   what i mean is   it actually feels solid and not  hollow   i really hope that makes sense the buttons are smooth and surprisingly somewhat quiet  of course they can be heard upon clicking  but it isn t loud like some of the other mice  mice  meece      mouses       the scroll wheel has been flawless as well  as has the actual movement of the mouse pointer  i have to give props to amazon basics for this item  i m surprised   but in a good way  it makes me want to try their other products      
172,2.0,                       i ve had two of these in less than a year and they ve both completely stopped connecting with my laptop after months of struggle with them  i know the price is nice but these don t last long at all and i barely used them so if this is something you ll be using a lot please buy a better one     
173,5.0,                       i hate batteries   especially in mouses   mice    this wired mouse works perfectly   no more changing the batteries   mid stream in thought   arrow pointer fails      
174,5.0,                       like the name says its basic  two buttons and a scroll wheel   button  just plug it in  trust me it will work with your computer no software needed the good  the part where you put your hand on the mouse is textured kind of like the kindle fire s back  doesn t show finger prints  i got this for using in a automotive setting so the mouse will get dirty but since its black and has that texture the grease doesn t show up and the texture works great for my dirty hands the bad  its slightly thinner than my logitech wireless mouse i use to have  but we re only talking about a hair difference but its noticeable  this is not really a problem but its the only bad thing i can think of why should you get this and not the wireless one  all wireless mouses run out of battery life when you need them most and also when you don t have batteries for it laying around  wireless is extra maintenance and cost  but this mouse is just plug it in and use it til it breaks  just my opinion      
175,5.0,                       bought this mouse because of the usb didn t want a wireless one because the one i had previous got dead  tried to change the batteries even and still no go  i figured my next one would turn that way too if i didn t use it a lot  so here we are    it s easy   does the work  click there click here  there is a red light under the mouse which is obviously the beam of the whole thing to make it work      
176,4.0,                       its just a basic corded mouse  if all you need is a usb wired mouse with two buttons and a scroll wheel why pay more  i needed a mouse to use occasionally on demand  i don t use it as my primary mouse on my primary computer  not because there is anything wrong with this mouse  i just like something else for hours per day use  but in a pinch when you need to plug into a computer for some miscellaneous reason  this is just what i need      
177,4.0,                       serves its purpose for its price not looking for anything fancy   as it says amazon basics   only one down side is sometimes the left and right mouse button become mixed up and its as if i am right clicking when i am left clicking  right clicking and left clicking again will make it go away not sure why it does that   but it has had excessively heavy use   duno never seen that before otherwise good product      
178,5.0,                       needed a   button mouse to better use a cad cam on my mac  this is perfect for that  it worked right out of the box  it s super light and the buttons are really easy to push  which sounds like a funny thing to say  but the ones on my old gateway mouse that i was using were really hard  after an hour or so of use there was definitely some fatigue from that  that s what sent me looking for another mouse this thing is great  i have some pictures for comparison      
179,1.0,                       i have been using this mouse for a couple of months now  when i first started using the mouse  the scroll wheel wasn t perfect but it worked  now the scroll wheel has almost entirely stopped functioning  the buttons and the tracking work as expected  but i would not recommend this mouse if the scroll wheel is important to you      
180,1.0,                       everything is perfect except the size   everything  here means the matte texture  the button action  the wheel movement  pressing the wheel as a third button  the overall shape  the only problem are the dimensions  it feels more like a travel mouse than one you can use at your desktop full time  the whole mouse is barely longer than my fingers  please make a full sized version  will buy it instantly      
181,2.0,                       what s the deal with mice getting smaller these days  mouse was smaller that expected from front to back and even more annoying is that it s low profile  it doesn t naturally touch the palm of your hand when using it  you have to push your palm down to it to make contact  i think the most annoying thing as that when i gripped it naturally  the right mouse button was depressed   all the time it has a very nice grippy finish and it  clicks  nicely  i m sure someone out there could use this mouse but it s not for me      
182,5.0,                       why spend more for something as generic as a mouse  it works    been using mine for years  i don t notice a thing when using it  and that s the point i ve heard some people complain about their mouse failing  this is common for all generic cheap things like mouses  i ve had mine for years now  had no problems myself  but then again i take great care of my things  and don t usually have problems in general but amazon has a great return policy and this comes with an industry standard warranty  so rest assure if anything goes wrong  amazon has your back  amazon didn t become a     billion dollar company by burning their customers who made them so big a mouse is a mouse    buy generic as cheap as possible  especially if it s branded by a company who stands by their product and most importantly appreciates and backs their customers happy computing  cheers      
183,5.0,                       i have two laptops and i usually get tired of using the touch pad on the keyboard  i have missed using a mouse and hearing the scrolling and clicking like the good old days  great price  great quality  and very easy installation  just plug in the usb and it start using  i am using it as i write this  if you are trying to decide between this one and the wireless  remember that with this one you wont have to worry about connecting to bluetooth and worrying if the connection is poor for some reason  this one is very straightforward  yet old fashioned and convenient  the wire isn t too long so you can wrap it around when you re all done      
184,1.0,                       here in covid times  i wanted a  nd mouse to reduce the amount of stuff i have to move when i take my laptop from the office basement to the main floor of my house   i detest track pads  so a mouse is very desirable for me  also  in my basement i have a multicomputer set up with an a b switch for the mouse   keyboard which i d prefer to keep assembled   thus i got one of these mice  right away  i discovered it was not the most comfortable for my hand  however  i figured i could make do since i would be using it much less than the mouse i keep in the basement  unfortunately the right mouse button now works only intermittently  in spite of a relatively small amount of use      
185,2.0,                       having purchased two of these mice  i cannot recommend them  on both occasions  the devices died after only a few months of use  i understand that this product does not represent the top of the price range  and comes with a limited lifespan somewhat implied  but even in the price range these do not do well  similarly priced mice that i ve had experience with  mostly logitech  have lasted years  i also find the amazon mouse to be a bit smaller than i d like  and it s buttons seem a little too light  giving it a tendency to twitch click  someone else might like those aspects  of the mouse  but the concerns of durability will apply to most users      
186,3.0,                       good basic mouse  but very low profile generally speaking there are two kinds of mouse users   clawers and palmers   clawers grasp the body of the mouse with their fingers and the palm is usually kept off the mouse body or in very light contact   palmers rest the palm of their hand on the mouse body and move the mouse using their palm as opposed to their fingers clawers usually like a low body  light mouse  which this one is   palmers usually like a higher profile  heavier mouse this mouse is suited more to clawers than palmers   it s very light and low profile   no bells or whistles  two buttons and a clickable scroll wheel works fine   just not what i d like ergonomically   on the other hand  it s for my work laptop and i m not going to spend for a good mouse for that       
187,1.0,                       when i use the right or left mouse button  it does something other than what it is supposed to  example  i use the left mouse button to position the cursor at the beginning of a line of text  instead of the cursor  i get a menu that is only supposed to appear when the right mouse button is depressed  i will never purchase an amazon basic mouse again      
188,1.0,                       good while it lasted  about     months each is all i ve gotten from two orders of this mouse   the cost is good but the inconvenience of not being reliable takes a recommendation off the table      
189,5.0,                       price  price  price  this mouse beats every other mouse  dollar for dollar i used to buy the run of the mill logitech mouse  and would break     of them every year  they were easy and cheap to replace  so whatever  this mouse actually feels nicer  it s a slightly softer feeling plastic  and a little smaller than the logitech  this fits in my hand a little better than the logitech as a result these are actually even less expensive than the logitechs  too  i bought three of these for the price of two logitech devices  so far  i haven t actually used the two backups  i purchased these in august      edit february       i just wanted to add that these things are very durable too  the way my desk is set up  the wire from this mouse sometimes ends up by my feet  and when i get up to walk away  i would kick the wire and send the mouse careening to the hardwood floor  i literally do this multiple times per day  the mouse still has not broken  i ended up giving away the  rd mouse  because i m content with having just two of these edit october       still using my original mouse  haven t even opened the packaging on the backup edit may       i got some adorable pet rats several months ago  the amazon basics mouse is one of their favorite foods  i ve had to replace two of these this year when my ratties got a little carried away with them  i try not to let them near my desk anymore      
190,1.0,                       garbage  i usually love amazon basic items and could probably find a useful item to purchase every day and probably love most of them  however  this mouse is not one of those items  the middle scroll button about half the time would recognize a click when i would click the left mouse button  i d be skimming a webpage then the click activated and my scrolling screeched to a crawl  my last mouse cost me    bucks and lasted many many years  don t try to save a buck  just spend a few more and get something that s better quality      
191,1.0,                       when it works the product is good  unfortunately  i discovered late that it is not reliable  it sends out   commands with a single click  the  debounce is not good  i used it for trading and i ending several time with   orders instead of one  that way i discovered the issue  i think that amazon labs should spend more times in testing their product  and to specify the level of reliability  and the specific applications where is recommended  for sure it cannot be used for active market trading      
192,2.0,                       i had a previous generation amazon basics mouse which served for a few years with no issues  the new mouse is a little smaller and not as comfortable in hand as the last one  but the worst of all is that after just a month the cursor started jumping and moving by itself all over the screen  not recommended      
193,2.0,                       there are very few positives to this mouse  one is the price  its extremely cheap for a mouse to just have around when you need it  i wouldn t use this as a daily driver as i m not a huge fan of the shape  the second is that it does work as a mouse  kind of this mouse  in my opinion  is very poorly designed  my major issue with it is that the laser on the bottom is pointed sideways and casts it light down and to the left  now if you are a right handed mouse user and you are working on a surface with any kind of reflectivity now matter how small every time you pick the mouse up to adjust it s position the laser light will bounce and catch you in the corner of the eye  it drives me crazy  to make matters worse my mouse likes to double click sometimes when i only click once or click and hold without releasing  i can only guess that i got a bad left mouse button but who knows i would not recommend this to anyone with a mildly reflective desk surface that is a right handed mouse user      
194,1.0,                       i ve used amazon basics mice a lot in the past and have really enjoyed the  bang for the buck  they d provide  they were never the best mouse available  but for the price they couldn t be beat the most recent one i ordered a little over two months ago started out fine  but now makes an obnoxious squeaking noise whenever i use the scroll wheel  it sounds like a real live mouse   and that s not a good thing      
195,5.0,                       i know most people are not into the  wired  mouse anymore what with bluetooth wireless now available   but here s the thing     i already have a wireless mouse but end up forgetting to turn it off so the batteries die   over time i end up spending more on batteries than on the mouse itself   also  the inevitable  wiggle wiggle wiggle  click click click  i have to do to get the wireless mouse to wake up   annoying   so  i decided to go  old school  and purchased this wired mouse   love it   it s has the dual action click buttons and the wheel to scroll up and down on a page   i m not sure i m going back to wireless again   i highly recommend going  old school       
196,5.0,                       this mouse is small  won t be good for people with large hands   and you can tell it s a cheaper mouse  but for the price  it s the best you ll get   it s been reliable and solid as a mouse for an old computer that sits around and needs to be accessed from time to time   if you re using your mouse more than      minutes per day  i would highly suggest finding one that is better  and more ergonomic for not too much more      
197,3.0,                       this is definitely not for tall people  i m      and can palm a basketball with ease   this mouse is not your normal sized mouse   it s like a hybrid sized mouse  it s not quite as small as a laptop mouse but it s definitely not as large as the usual desktop mice i m used to using  the mouse functions fine  i just find the size annoying      
198,2.0,                       i ve bought this mouse to use until i could purchase a name brand  it s best only to be used for emergencies  it s not a long lasting mouse  the tracking is not good   i have to search for where my mouse pointer is   it simply disappears mid use  after a couple or so months of use  the mouse will suddenly  lose power   meaning  it goes dead  i have to unplug it and reinsert back into my computer  for a few dollars more  purchase a name brand  or purchase this one if you need a mouse right away and don t want to spend a lot  but be warned  it will not last very long before problems become self evident      
199,4.0,                       decent mouse with a functional design flaw  this mouse does its  job and for the price  it s actually a pretty good deal  the biggest issue i have with this mouse is that when i right click  the right click button gets stuck half the time  the reason it gets stuck is not because of the mouse itself but because of the design like most right handed people  i hold the mouse with my thumb on the left side of the mouse and my middle finger on the right side  the problem is that my middle finger touches the side of right click button and when i do click it with my index finger it gets stuck they could fix the design by doing one of these things  make the buttons shorter so the middle finger has enough room to hold the right side of the mouse without touching the right click button  currently it s almost   inches vertically  they could probably shorten it to just a little over   inch  make the mouse bigger  i m starting to think this mouse was meant for    year olds or anyone with small hands  my hands are medium sized and i think this is way too small      
200,2.0,                       i started using macs in      when the system was still on a floppy  so i ve had many   both at work and at home   since i was down to my last functioning usb mouse  i decided to get this one so i would have a spare   checked to make sure it worked   and it definitely does just fine with mac os catalina   but it is already wearing a sore spot on my finger   the edges are sharp  not curved  and the seam where the right button meets the edge and the back part of the mouse is rough   the inside of my ring finger literally catches on it   so  this mouse is fine if you need one that is cheap and works  but ergonomically it really sucks      
201,5.0,                       i was looking for a replacement for my worn out usb apple mighty mouse to use with my imac and found that they have been replaced by a wireless mouse  i decided to try the amazonbasics   button usb wired computer mouse and have been very happy with it  the shape has taken a very small amount of getting used to after years of the apple mouse shape  but the build quality and performance are very impressive for the extremely reasonable price  it doesn t feel cheap at all  the mouse was plug and play on my imac and the right click button gives me pc style right click functionality too  i would buy another one      
202,5.0,                       the click isn t very loud  good   the scroll wheel is very nice    smooth  though you feel the ridges as you scroll  which is good  you can feel how many  ticks  you ve scrolled  good quality  would have appreciated if the logo wasn t on the top  but it s fine      
203,2.0,                       i replaced my failing microsoft mouse with this one this week   i figured all the great reviews were enough to justify the purchase   within   minutes of using this mouse i noticed my hands started cramping   after using a larger mouse like the microsoft mouse  this one is not comfortable for me   i will keep it as a backup for our laptop with seldom use   getting a dell like the one i use   hours a day at work      
204,5.0,                       i used to purchase expensive mice for gaming and labor intensive tasks   i had purchased a logitech corded mouse  but finally the laser started to go out every few seconds   i decided to buy this simple little guy with my amazon credit card rewards  freebie  i really like this mouse   it feels great  and i have big hands   on the mac  the cursor tracks perfect and the left   right click functions are durable i m very happy with this mouse      
205,2.0,                       well  i should have not had my expectations up for these  i have bought several amazonbasics gear before  but these fall way short of the quality   expectations   this mouse was to replace an old mouse     but now the amazonbasics mouse sit in the closet for that  just in cases moment there is a cheap feel to them  and they do not glide that well on a smooth lacquer finished wood surface   my other mice  logitech  work just fine would i buy these again  no   i don t recommend these  i have used microsoft and logitech brands  and this was my first amazon mouse  which i am disappointed      
206,4.0,                       i like a wired mouse because i don t want to be hassled buying and stockpiling expensive batteries   or possible losing my mouse     my husband s mac mouse requires batteries about    times a year   on the other hand  with a wired mouse  the cord takes us space and can tug at it causing it to skew in a direction you don t wish it to go in   you decide which issues you want to deal with this mouse is certainly cheap enough to give it a try   the buttons are responsive and the size is perfect to fit within your hand with the buttons just beneath your fingers   maybe a little too responsive as i often right clck when i don t intend to   i expect that i will learn to avoid this over time   the tracking wheel is not as responsive but works well enough   one feature that i miss from my old    three button mouse that only lasted a couple of years is a retractable cord that limited the cord clutter and the tendency for the cord to pull at the mouse and cause it to skew from the intended direction  are you listening  amazon     for    delivered to you door  this mouse is a very good value i want to add that  after finding the trigger happy right click button a problem  i rolled a tiny piece of masking tape between the slot that separated the top and the bottom on the right and the problem was solved   now i have to press a bit harder to use that function      
207,5.0,                       it does a great job sitting in the box  i m sure it works and that it s vanilla  i just implemented a workaround while this shipped and then got distracted  very  mouse like  are you really reading reviews about a    wired mouse that s advertised as  basic   it s a mouse  it helps you buy things on amazon  if you re super concerned about it  buy something expensive and be disappointed and complain in a review      
208,4.0,                       what s there to say about a mouse  it s a mouse and it works   you can spend more and get a fancier mouse that would have a lot more customization buttons but unless you needed that for gaming i wouldn t bother spending the extra money  this mouse worked perfectly for what i needed  a cheap mouse that allowed me to play league of legends if you ve ever played that game you know trying to hit skill shots with a trackpad  is just horrible  well this mouse did just that  i didn t need to install anything it worked as soon as it was plugged in and i was ready to go  it s a great mouse for it s price and i d definitely buy it again      
209,3.0,                       i ve had this mouse for a year and a half  it worked great  but a few weeks ago started malfunctioning  the left click button now starts triggering the right click somehow  you get what you pay for  it s a cheap mouse  it s not designed to work for life  i d recommend it before buying a cordless mouse  it s smaller than i prefer  honestly i ll probably just buy another one because of the price  but i d pay a few dollars more for something a bit higher quality  but  higher quality  mouses  mice   are usually wireless  i hate using batteries  even rechargeable  or are gaming mice with tons of obnoxious lights and buttons i don t need  now let s see if i can submit this review and order another one without right clicking myself to death      
210,4.0,                       i brought this mouse  late october       originally because i brought a cheap mouse from ebay that only lasted me about a week before it started double clicking  i did some research and found out that when your mouse randomly double clicks it s a sign that you should change your mouse  so after surfing and gaming it finally started to double click yesterday  but it lasted a lot longer than one from ebay  surprisingly enough my compaq mouse  which isn t usb nor wireless aka the mouse slot on older pc s  lasted for several years until it couldn t click no more  now  i don t know what s happening to the quality of mouses nowadays  they are not what they used to be  it still works but it double clicks  which is annoying  i might buy another mouse  instead of this one  since i m still on the hunt for a mouse that can last several years without breaking the bank  it works and it s smooth but buyer beware because results  how long it lasts  may vary update            you can make the mouse last longer by switching the left and right buttons  since i m a cheap skate  i will keep using the mouse until both sides double click become unusable      
211,5.0,                       this is truly a basic plug in and go mouse  no bells or whistles  and works as expected the only issue i have with it is the size  it is smaller than the standard ones you get from logitech  and because of that  it is difficult to get used to  if you have arthritis in your fingers or hands like i do  this smaller size may not work for you  i find i have to curl my fingers to properly use this amazonbasics   button usb wired mouse  black   which in turn causes discomfort and sometimes twinges of pain i will be keeping this mouse for a backup  but will replace it a logitech soon simply because of the comfort factor      
212,5.0,                       never thought i d be writing a review for a wired mouse  but i am really into this one  there have been too many times where i ve brought my work laptop home and didn t remember to bring a mouse   that meant that i d steal my wireless mouse from my desktop  but then i couldn t use that until i switched it back  and sometimes that caused problems with recognizing the mouse keyboard when trying to wake it up  now i can just grab this mouse when i need it  it s small  light and works greats  i am a fan of wired mice  because they don t need batteries and always work      
213,5.0,                       works great  feels great for the price that you get it for the mouse is light and works well and is responsivethe materials it s made from feels a little cheap but you get what you pay for  so it ll probably be worn down quickly if heavy usage but for a cheap mouse this is great  and the size is perfect for medium sized hands i d say         
214,2.0,                       at first it seemed like a good basic mouse   i needed one because my laptp s trackpad doesn t work well anymore   but after a couple of days  the middle part when i need to use to move up and down started to squeak   at first i tried to ignore it but it was getting really bad and loud   it was so stressfu   i thought i could just try to live with it  but not pssoible   will return  sadly      
215,4.0,                       this is a basic laser mouse with   buttons  absolutely nothing fancy here  it is simply a low cost replacement upgrade for the few who are still using ball mouses    star deducted for the short cable length as the prior ball mouse s cable was able to reach the computer usb port without needing a usb extender  this one did not  forcing me to purchase a usb connector  if your mouse is going to be located more then     feet away from your computer s usb port  find another mouse with a longer cable  the difference in price will be less than the cost of an extender      
216,3.0,                       functionally  the mouse works well and precise  but the other reviewers were right  the mouse is too small to be comfortable  and the buttons are too sensitive so that i can t rest my fingers on them and often click them inadvertently  i managed to wedge a tiny piece of foam underneath  that made it better  and hopefully i get used to the small size  would not recommend      
217,5.0,                       i prefer usb computer mouses because  in my experience  they are simply more dependable than wireless mouses   this mouse does exactly what i wanted it to do   it is small enough to be used with my laptop and large enough to be used with my desktop   i am completely happy      
218,3.0,                       i m a  clawer  and hold the mouse with my fingers on the side   the design of the mouse is such that there is a sharp edge  not cutting sharp  but still uncomfortable  where the fingers touch   its a design that is small and inexpensive to make  i wish i d spent more money and purchased one with a more ergonomic design   not worth sending back  my contribution to the landfill      
219,5.0,                       we come from a very technical house hold  and we are a house of gamers   we were firmly in the razor camp until we had a few of those go dead before their time  for their cost   we purchased a few of these as spares and fill ins  and a few of the computers still have them attached   these really can not be beat for the money   you plug it in  it works  no finicky software needed   they have a very nice no slip texture to them  but so far they really seem to stay pretty clean as well  no gunk and sweat build up   the cord length is nice  i can not see how anyone could beat the product for the price that its offered for here   no its not a     dpi mouse  but really after years and years of gaming  ive never set mine that high anyway   if you need an economical mouse  even for a part time fill in  this one is the mouse to get   you will not be disappointed      
220,5.0,                       we ve been living with a couple of     drugstore mice for a while  that  in retrospect  sucked finally in frustration  i searched for the cheapest usb mouse on amazon com  lo and behold  it s an amazon basics mouse  i ve had great experiences with amazon basics in the past  so we ordered two of them they did not disappoint  optical tracking is so  so  so much better and smoother than the drugstore mice that it isn t even funny  they re far more ergonomic as well  with a nicer surface finish and more tactile feedback in the clicks  they look great as well simple  black  elegant for just a few bucks  this is a mouse that could be a primary  everyday  heavy use mouse for       of the population and do the job perfectly      
221,5.0,                       just a simple plug n play usb  corded  mouse   length of cord is realistic  approximately   feet long   sensitive laser with quick and simple movement  can be adjusted via the mouse settings in control panel  which eliminates the rolling all over the mountain top  old mouse with roller ball version  and having to  find the ball  if bottom came undone   the mouse it replaced was       years old and you had to use the adapter to plug into the usb port    the mouse is not ergonomic or a gaming mouse  it is a simple basic mouse  it s for the laptop for the kids to do their school homework      
222,5.0,                       this is a comfortable  pretty standard    button   actually   buttons and a scroll wheel  mouse   sides and bottom are flat and top heel is slightly convex to fit the natural curve of your hand   it is very responsive   it s not a mouse made for gaming or rapid fire repetitive clicks  but a nice  function mouse for those of us who work with them on an almost constant basis      
223,4.0,                       when my logitech mouse s scroll wheel bit the dust  i knew it was time to get a replacement  problem was  since i m on a fixed income  and it was near the end of the month  there wasn t much money available for a good replacement   so  i looked here on amazon  and found a low cost replacement  which  as it turns out  was just as well  because the amazon basics mouse works just as well as the notably more expensive logitech mouse did the only flaw is  the mouse is a bit small  but that s sort of subjective  given that not everyone has the same sized hand   nonetheless  this mouse is a bit small for my hand in any case  it s a pretty good  basic wired mouse      
224,4.0,                          from the lack of a strain relief on the cord and the resulting loosening of the wire contacts i guess that s pretty good for         but i ll never buy another mouse without a strain relief on the wire  silly me for just assuming there d be one there  in a product at this price point   my replacement will be a phillips model    same price  but with a strain relief visible on the wire in the photo on the product page   maybe i ll write a review of that one  once we know how long it will last       
225,5.0,                       i bought this almost a year ago  dropped it hundreds times and it s still functioning like normal  lasted longer than all of my previous devices update  it s been   years  since i bought this and it still works but with a couple of issues due to me not taking care of it  it sometimes disconnects because i bent the wire near the usb plug multiple times throughout the years  overall  a mouse that has been working for    years is amazing  i m buying a second one to replace this one and hope it last longer if i take care of it      
226,5.0,                       the clicking is positive but very quiet  the wheel for scrolling has a clear  quiet  but clicky type action  compared to those that are totally smooth where the wheel just goes and goes  almost too easily  like the logitech mx anywhere   i like this best because it works great  using it with a mac mini  because i ve gotten tired of some hiccups with mac  including this new mini  with bluetooth  one downside on this amazon basic mouse  the edges where your fingers set on the top of the sides is not as well shaped as other mice  so it s a little less comfortable to me  it s comfortable  but not as comfortable as various other models of mice      
227,5.0,                       i bought this for my son for remote learning for the school year   he has a chrome books from the school and it can get a little daunting to always be using that pad to move your arrow on screen   plugs into side of chrome book and just made his stressed life easier      
228,2.0,                       i have owned several of these  they work very well but after about   years the rubberized non slip coating  on top surfaces of the mouse  where your hand rests  starts to degrade into a sticky crumbly mess  at that point you have to use alcohol and your fingernails to peel and scrub off the coating  takes almost an hour  leaving the plain plastic underlying surface  and it s very hard to get all of that crud off  or you can throw the mouse away and get a new one   which is ok considering the price  the rubberized coating is apparently there to make the mouse feel nice under your fingers  but it would have been better to leave it off to begin with      
229,5.0,                       i bought this because my old clunker microsoft mouse was finally losing it s ability to reliably right click only once   on a whim and because of the great reviews i read on it  i decided to give it a try i ve only owned it for a month but i love it   the size is perfect   it s larger than most budget mice  i believe there s a customer photo showing a comparison  but not grotesquely the click of the buttons is solid and it feels well built the wheel is smooth with a gentle click as you scroll unlike my microsoft mouse   you could most likely hear me scroll through webpages down the hall of my apartment building the      dpi is perfect for me as well       dpi has always seemed to slow therefore i ve had to fiddle with the mouse settings to make it  feel  quicker one tiny thing that thrilled me when i noticed it   most mice some with four slick rubber plastic feet or nubs on the bottom to make the mousing smooth   i always end up sheering one or both of those things off   with this mouse the rear nubs  where your palm would sit  are indeed one single nubby   i feel i ll be less likely to sheer this off   nothings worse than a three legged mouse we shall see how long this little guy lasts   my microsoft mouse lasted almost a year      
230,1.0,                       i bought five of these for my classroom and i was initially excited because they were comfortable and seemed to be ok  within a month every mouse had issues with either the left or right mouse button becoming stuck or the assembly underneath the button breaking malfunctioning to the point where the mouse is useless  stay away from this product        
231,4.0,                       not a bad little unit   it seems a bit small for me  but as it s for a female friend it seems comfortable for her   she didn t have a lot of money to spend  so i went on recommendations alone  and i m pleased that i think i did well by her but i ll critique this like it was for me   bear in mind  my usual mouse is a razer deathadder       so we all know that this  amazonbasics   button usb wired mouse  will never reach the razer   i wouldn t like using this mouse for myself  as it feels a bit small and even worse  it s uncomfortably light   however  it seems to track well  and the buttons are nice and responsive      
232,5.0,                       you need a mouse  yes and you want it to last for a long time  yes and you like shopping on amazon  yes and you like to hear from people who also shop on amazon who have bought the product and have had no issues and have good things to say with the product in the tenure that they ve owned it  yes then buy it already     
233,4.0,                       it s a decent  disposable  low cost usb mouse  as a sw engineer  i use mine       hrs a day      days a week  these usually last       months before i have to replace one  the wires are what causes them to die     i m guessing they eventually break internally from stress  or become disconnected inside the mouse  the latest one died on me yesterday  i bought it in jan       not worth my time to pull it apart and try to fix it  can t complain though  for what little they cost anyhow   wished they would last longer  i usually buy     at a time to make sure i always have a spare   as long as you buy one knowing it s not going to be a long term relationship  you will not be disappointed      
234,4.0,                       it s simple  it s got great response to movement  it s honestly a surprise to me that i like this mouse so much  i use a logitech g    at home  and i couldn t possibly recommend another mouse more  but  my cheapo boss bought one of these for a work computer  and i ended up stealing it to use on my computer  out of all the cheap mice i ve bought and used over the years  this one has the nicest feel hell  it feels better than the apple magic mouse and that thing sells itself based on ergonomics alone  if they made a wireless version of this mouse  i d buy that too i have huge hands and i can still claw grip this mouse with ease  never had issues with it  even tracks movement perfectly without a mousepad color me basic  i m impressed      
235,1.0,                       purchased in early april       and the left button stopped responding in early september  pretty much garbage      
236,1.0,                       as someone else reviewed  mouse is fine if you like to use your fingers   but it is too small for palm support   if you rest your palm on the swell of the mouse  your fingers hang off the buttons   this wouldn t be a problem  but the middle mouse button is then way to close to your hand      
237,5.0,                       i m used to very nice mice and keyboards  i used to think you had to pay at least     to get something half decent  but this has changed my mind this mouse tracks with no issues on both my wood desk and my run of the mill mouse pad  the surface is soft to the touch and does not feel like cheap plastic  the scroll wheel is also very nice things that could be better the amount of force required to press a button could be greater  making it so you can rest your fingers on the buttons and them not click accidentally it could have more weight to the whole thing  as it is very light  however i can see others enjoying how light it is this mouse is very nice for people who just need a mouse that is cheap and works well without any headaches this is no porsche  but it s definitely at least a nissan altima      
238,5.0,                       this is more or less the amazonbasics version of the logitech b      both are basic mice just for web browsing basic business use   if you don t need to do anything special or any kind of gaming  these are the mice for you   decently built  ambidextrous  optical  cheap and ergonomic this is a good backup mouse in case your main gaming mouse goes down or if you want an alternative mouse just for everyday use      
239,5.0,                       i have a project that requires a pc  my magnificent other had one i can use  but it had no mouse  thank you  amazon prime  it came the next day and works perfectly  improving my workflow over using the clunky track pad that came with the thinkpad      
240,5.0,                       i really like the feel of this mouse  and my son is jealous because he likes the aural feedback  if you don t have clicky mouses  then don t get this mouse  but if you like hearing your mouse so you know it s actually doing something  this is the one for you   i have a logitech wired trackball that i love as i live an breath  and when it dies  hopefully a long  long time from now   i ll get another one of these   thanks amazon for making a great mouse for a little money      
241,4.0,                       this mouse is going to take some getting used to   and that s a good thing   i have used my old one for so long that i am used to it but it started having the trouble of double or triple clicking whenever i would just hit the button once   made highlighting anything a pain in the butt   so  i ordered this mouse because it was one of the cheaper ones that looked like decent quality the sensitivity on this mouse is astounding   where before i would have to use my entire mousepad and sometimes pick the mouse up and move it over to cross the entire page  with this one  i move it just a little and the cursor whips to exactly where i wanted it   no picking up needed   it s a comfortable shape and i really like that it has a matte type finish on it   makes it feel more secure in my hand so far  the buttons and the roller are working smoothly imho  it s a great mouse for the price      
242,3.0,                       very good basic mouse  it s cheap and dependable  i bought this to replace two logitech b    mice  both of which developed a clicking problem in about a year  it would click multiple times when you click once   the only issue is that this mouse is a little smaller than other computer mice i ve handled  and i have small hands   i suppose it s just something you get used to after a while  but it s something you should be aware of update  after   years  the mouse has developed a problem where the right click keeps triggering when i left click  i suppose i should buy a more expensive mouse  this is the fourth  cheap  mouse that has developed a problem after a couple of years      
243,5.0,                       i have purchased several of these amazon mice over the last few years  and they ve all worked fine   i m a light gamer  and it works fine for my gaming needs as well   i use this mouse both at my desk  and also in my travel bag   it s a very light mouse so good for travel   i just wrap and tie up part of the cord to make it shorter when traveling my biggest complaint is that the price has gone up recently   you might be able to find a name brand mouse for the same price nowadays      
244,4.0,                       it s too small of an office mouse but it s good enough for airplanes in the first picture  you can see that the cord length is a nice amount for people that don t have a usb port directly next to them  it s not ridiculously long  but these days cases and keyboards have multiple usb ports so if you plan to use this for gaming  it s not going to be a problem if you have small hands  otherwise normal big hands will have trouble with the grip  i wouldn t personally use this for fps or high dpi gaming because it s not as professional  high dpi  or robust with features as normal gaming mouses  it s best for airplane business work  gaming is a tougher feat as an office mouse the lack of annoying features and general simplicity is what stands out  when i do school work or other things that are non gaming related i can t have large amounts of buttons placed all over the mouse  you plug it in  you left click  right click  middle mouse button click  or scroll  it s that simple the mouse wheel is one of the first things i tested out and it gave a bit of resistance  which is exactly what i want with a non gaming mouse  when it comes to office work  the sensitivity of the scroll wheel is important because on a lot of gaming mouses if you hold down the scroll wheel and drag the mouse down it can go from page   to page     in a millisecond      
245,4.0,                       i ve only had this for a couple of weeks  but so far  i love it  i wasn t sure if i wanted to get this one since it was so inexpensive  i figured  you get what you paid for  but many people rated it high  so i took a chance  i haven t had any issues i only paid       plus tax  i m sure i ve paid more for lunch at burger king than i did on this mouse  so if i can get a few months  use out of this  then i got my money s worth  and any time beyond that is a bonus  i m just thrilled that i don t have to buy batteries any more or worry about leaving my wireless mouse on by mistake this mouse is slightly smaller in size than other brands  also  it s shorter in center where my palm rests than my microsoft wireless mouse  so i have to lower and close my hand a little bit more to rest my palm on it  that doesn t bother me  but i don t know if that would be an issue for people with arthritis      
246,1.0,                       the mouse seemed to function well  if a bit small  for   days  but after being dropped once    feet onto carpet  really     the left and right click buttons popped out of their alignment  i spent about    minutes trying to reconfigure the cheap plastic bits without ripping off the buttons entirely  but only managed to snap one off in frustration  for a    mouse  i m not all that surprised  but was hoping the build quality would hold up to such minor abuse      
247,5.0,                       i was surprised to see that amazon con had a mouse exactly like the one i was using  i wore mine out and it was not functioning anymore  i have been very pleased with my purchase  i have noticed that amazon has more products under the amazon brand  and the prices are very competitive         amazonbasics   button usb wired mouse  black                         in my book  right on amazon      
248,5.0,                       i really do not see any problems with this mouse and do not see any of the problems some other people have commented about  it just as good as my brand name mouse that i have been using on my other computer for years that cost me more then        at a brand name store      
249,4.0,                       so far so good  i m glad i purchased this for everyday use   the scroll button on my old mouse broke and this is just as good  especially for the price      
250,5.0,                       great little wired mouse  slightly smaller than most  it also has a low profile  the surface glide is great and very responsive  the buttons don t need to be depressed very far  allowing for quick clicks   overall  this is a really great buy for a mouse to use in day to day computing   good quality for a low price      
251,4.0,                       i wish i had spent more money to get one with a better feel   this one feels cheap    i have to press the buttons very carefully or it doesn t work   i spend most of my day on a personal computer  and this mouse doesn t impress me      
252,2.0,                       its fine for an inexpensive mouse  but    months seems like a pretty short life    the scroll wheel still works but the mouse itself doesn t work   still has light  but nothing happens    other mice i e owned have lasted way longer and cost only marginally more      
253,5.0,                       i like a corded mouse when i use my laptop  i find that i have more control than when i use the trackball or finger pad on the laptop so i always have a corded mouse available   at work  at home  in my briefcase for some reason my regular mouse  dell  started acting up   it would cause the pointer to skip and when i right clicked on an image it would skip all around the screen  annoying  so i needed a new corded mouse i found this amazon one and honestly bought it because of the price   super inexpensive  i wasn t expecting much but when it arrived i started using it and was very pleased at how precise and easy to use it was  i was probably using the old broken one for so long that i had forgotten how nice it was to have one that worked correctly  anyway  very happy with the purchase and will get another should the case arise      
254,2.0,                       i have bought approx   of these   i respect amazon basic s devices   but these mice are not well protected where the cord meets the usb   that flimsy connection causes deterioration and failure after a few months   i wish i could say buy but i say do not buy until design is more substantial   i d rather pay more and be hopeful the product is made to last      
255,1.0,                       most uncomfortable computer mouse i ve ever used  it s cheap  so you expect it to be cheap  but you also expect it to be designed to fit the human hand  apparently one of the corners cut was any consideration for the customer being able to hold the mouse without straining their hand because of how incredibly small it is and how low of a silhouette it has  this is just painful to use for any length of time  not recommended  buy something else on top of that  the cord is incredibly short  so it s recommended only if you re using it for a laptop or your desktop tower is right next to you  the plastic feels incredibly cheap to touch  those are flaws that are forgivable for the sake of a lower price  the thing being so small it immediately causes pain when you use it is not  avoid  avoid  avoid      
256,1.0,                       i really liked this mouse when i got it  it worked fantastic for about a week  super easy to set up  just plug and go unfortunately  that was about it  it just suddenly stopped working  completely unresponsive after about only   days  very disappointed  i would ve exchanged it and tried again  since it had been working so well  but i need a replacement immediately  so instead i just returned for refund      
257,3.0,                       i ve ordered two of these mice  and both worked great for a while until the left button started randomly triggering the right  this is incredibly annoying and not a fluke as it happened to me twice with mice from two separate orders and other reviews state they experienced the same problem  if you need a mouse for light duty this one is fine  but this mouse will fail if used as a daily driver      
258,5.0,                       decided to replace my trackball mouse with this basic plug in mouse and to my surprise this basic mouse works so much more smoothly   don t know why but perhaps being plugged in design makes it more responsive   but i find this to be much better   and it was so inexpensive   i also like not having to wonder if the battery needs to be replaced   no battery   i may look for a similar plug in mouse now but in a larger size      
259,4.0,                       good basic mouse   nothing fancy  nothing weird   it just plugs in and works   i m using a macbook pro   two buttons and a scroll wheel   wired   some people say the mouse is very small but it s only a bit smaller than my old mouse  microsoft    it fits my hand well  smaller side of average for an adult woman       
260,5.0,                       according to another review there s two kinds of mouse users   clawers and palmers  i m a clawer   i use my thumb  ring finger  and pinkie to move the mouse around  rather than resting my palm on it and pushing with my whole forearm  after burning through a few wal mart mice i decided to take advantage of amazon prime s free shipping and ordered several of these to keep on hand to replace failed mice   stuck  em in a cabinet and promptly forgot about them  but now that i have to work at home during the coronavirus situation  and not wanting to screw up the travel mouse i keep in my laptop case  i remembered i had these  hauled one out of the cabinet and plugged it in  what can i say  i plug it in  the light comes on  i move my hand  the mouse cursor moves  woo  wild times  probably not  but  it s functional  does the job  and doesn t look hideous or feel like i m holding a dead rodent or something  it s a mouse  get over it            
261,5.0,                       i have a little refurbished chromebook that i love  but the touchpad just can t function like a regular mouse  my main issue was with the occasions that i needed to copy and paste  i know there is a way to do it using the keyboard  but it is very cumbersome and i always have to look up how to do it  sometimes regular scrolling can be a little wonky too   this little mouse plugs right into the usb and works like a charm      
262,5.0,                       when you need a mouse for basic functions or when on a budget this is it  i bought it just to configure a mining rig i was building and i actually fell in love with it  it has good quality  and it is comfy and pretty responsive  would buy again      
263,5.0,                       there is nothing fancy about this mouse  but it works great  if you have a job that requires hours of mouse usage every day or like to play intense computer games  this probably isn t a great option  but for general e mails  web browsing  and occasional document reading editing  this mouse works great      
264,2.0,                       there is one major reason why after using the amazon basics mouse that makes me still think that the logitech m    is still the best budget mouse out there and that is due to the size  this amazon mouse is just too small and that s saying something as i have small hands myself  if the m    is so good  why did i try this one  simple  i love amazon and for        it wasn t that big of an investment risk pros   it s cheap and from amazon  amazon fanboys will agree with me   love the matte black surface of the mouse  doesn t feel like you paid less than     for it  good dpicons   really small  making it more ideal for fingertip claw grip mouse users  palm grip people stay away   technically should weigh less than the m    but actually feels a tad bit heavier  mouse is very slim  making it feel even smaller due to your inside palm not having a place to rest  another reason why palm grip users need to stay away neutral   mouse scrolling is very silent  i personally prefer the notchy  clicky clacky scroll wheel like the m    i personally think this mouse is a bargain if you order in bulk for school or lab uses  however  i would find something else for everyday usage unless you have a really  really tiny hand  if you re looking for a lightweight yet cheap everyday mouse  you must take a look at the logitech m     i swear by it and prefer it over the much more expensive mouses i ve tried      
265,5.0,                       i ordered this mouse for my  th grade daughter to use with her chromebook  so far  it s working well and she s happy with it  it s a basic mouse  nothing fancy  but that s what i was looking for  the cord seems a little thin  so we ll see how durability goes  overall  i d buy it again      
266,3.0,                       after owning this item for the past several months  i must say  this mouse works as perfectly as it did since the day i bought it   the scrolling is smooth  the wheel in the middle and buttons have never once became stuck  the length of the cord is perfect  it has       dpi so the pointer on the screen never lags  it s compatible with my windows      bit os  now windows       bit   and  due to the material it is made out of  there is absolutely no sign of wear or dirt   with older mice  the buttons would have a tendency of forming dirt and the daily use would become noticeable i would say the only downfall is that it s a wee bit smaller than your standard mouse   if you have huge hands or suffer from carpel tunnel  then you should probably look elsewhere   otherwise  i couldn t be more happier update     jan         well  as it turns out  after   year and    months of normal use  the left mouse button is no longer able to double click after the first few attempts thinking this was a computer related problem  i swapped it out with an older logitech mouse that i had purchased in              to my surprise  it still works like a charm i wish amazon would stand behind their products   there s no reason why a    year old mouse should outperform a recent  more modern day version from close to   years ago      
267,5.0,                       this is an old school mouse   if you like the old logitech mice  then you ll like this amazonbasics mouse   it fits the same in the hand  but it has a rubbery covering that gives it better grip   i have three of these amazonbasics mice  and i wouldn t trade them for any more expensive mice   i hope they keep selling this exact model   it s perfect      
268,5.0,                       i bought this to use with my security camera dvr   the dvr sits about    feet away up in a corner on a shelf   the receiving usb unit is on the back of the dvr   after reading about how many of the mice do not transmit well i was concerned   this model works great considering the distance as well as obstructions      
269,1.0,                       after a couple of years of use  i started hearing that windows sound when a device is plugged in and then unplugged   over  and over  and over  it took me days to troubleshoot and i finally figured out that it is this terrible mouse that was malfunctioning and causing my pc  and me  to go crazy  amazon sells millions of these  so i m sure their algorithm won t allow my review to help anyone avoid buying this bad mouse  oh well      
270,1.0,                       i needed this mouse to replace a logitech mouse that went bad the chord is significantly shorter than the logitech mouse s chord given my configuration  the pc is under and to right of the desk  this mouse is useless would have been nice to see specification of length of chord  or perhaps i just missed it the price is low  so i will absorb the cost and chuck it to experience      
271,2.0,                       original review this mouse is cheap   in both senses of the word there s nothing wrong with it  mind you  i tend to think simpler is better in terms of mice  so i wasn t out to get anything fancy  and this definitely fits the bill  it s slightly smaller than my last one  both in length and thickness  but it s not as little as those awful miniature ones  and it works exactly like it ought to it is  however  super chintzy  it doesn t have nearly the heft or sturdiness of my last mouse  it feels like i could crush it just by squeezing too hard  if i hadn t somehow busted the scroll wheel in my last  hp brand corded  mouse  there s no question that i d prefer to keep using the old one  if i d known just how cheap this one felt before buying it  i might have paid a few extra bucks for another hp one but i didn t  and as i said  there s nothing wrong with this mouse  it works fine  and i ll keep it and use it  if you don t mind having an extra light weight mouse  then definitely get this    you can t beat the price  if you would prefer something a bit more substantial  though  keep looking edit  ok  so i m dropping my rating from   stars to    after only a day or so of use  the right mouse button has started to stick  as in  i press it down  and it doesn t come back up   and in the couple days since  it s already gone from an occasional irritation to nearly every time i click it  i can manually pull the button back up  but good grief  i haven t dropped the mouse  or spilled anything on it  or even used it with dirty hands  so there s absolutely no excuse for this  cheap  indeed      
272,5.0,                       i plugged it in  my computer said it was programmed and it worked very good  curing the problems that i was having with the old one      
273,5.0,                       this is a basic mouse  which is exactly what i wanted  a lot of the current market is geared towards gamers  yay   and while i love my gaming mouse  my stress reflex has me randomly pressing side buttons when i m trying to type up word documents  slight annoyance  i know  but depending on what you ve programmed those buttons to do  it can potentially conflict with macros in other programs and once you ve had to reclick to re enter your document about      times  it makes you want to smash things or at the very least get massive eye strain from all the eye rolling frustration user friendly  plug and play      
274,5.0,                       if you place your hand on top of the mouse and use your shoulder and arm to move it around   then this mouse won t work for you  you need to rest the heel of your hand on the table and move the mouse with your fingers and opposable thumb  if you have never tried this  claw  approach  you should try it  now do it   it makes it easier to use the mouse  and to eat a sandwich and maybe have a beer at the same time  cheers      
275,4.0,                       i use the amazon basics   button mouse for regular computing needs  either with an amazon basics keyboard or with another keyboard  i ve used the amazon basics mouse for many years  i generally replace my mouse every       months  and the amazon basics mouse does what i need a basic mouse to do on a budget why not   stars  well  like any wired electronic appliance you re going to use on a regular basis  the cord likes to get tangled up with all the other cords of other things  and if the cord was just a foot longer it wouldn t need to be untangled as often  or that s how it feels   other than that it s just a basic budget mouse  nothing special except for the price  but that s the point i do use it for gaming  but most of the games i play aren t as mouse performance heavy as many games where people buy a specific  gaming mouse  for  i occasionally notice a bit of latency in a game from when i click to when the click  takes   but it s not enough to really effect the kinds of games that i play in terms of comfort  i hold it with my thumb and pink of my right hand on either side  holding the mouse  then my middle finger on the mouse wheel  my right pointer finger on the left click button  and my right ring finger on the right click button  it s comfortable enough  i use it quite a bit  but it s not a very comfortable mouse for other people that i ve sometimes lent the computer  they have a different mouse posture and find it to be uncomfortable for periods longer than about       minutes      
276,5.0,                       i own two of these  one for each office  when i arrive  i plug my macbook air into a display via      amazonbasics mini displayport  thunderbolt  to hdmi adapter                        and      amazonbasics high speed hdmi cable       feet    meters  supports ethernet   d   k and audio return                         this mouse is plugged into      apple wired keyboard with numeric keypad compatible with mac os x v          later versions  mb   ll b                         it s a good setup  and i m pleased the mouse  just works   with os x  i recall making a few adjustments to mimic my windows behavior  including a chrome add on for middle click support   but otherwise it works well  and i don t notice any difference when switching over to windows via bootcamp as for gaming    i ve owned    buttoned gaming mice before  and while they can be nice  this is just as good for games with less keybinds or gamers with a casual style  e g  terraria or don t starve together   given the simplicity of this mouse  i expect all of its functions to outlive more complicated mice      
277,1.0,                       short cord i bought three of these for work to try  the click buttons died on all three within   months  we have mice at work that have lasted over ten years why buy this when you can get a kensington k     us or a logitech b    for the same money  i can t believe that amazon puts their name on these      
278,1.0,                       i admit i was cheap  i bought this and tried to install it but the computer did not recognize the mouse  but here is the odd thing it is not present in my amazon order history  i think this may be on purpose  my suggestion folks is to just spend more and go by one at office depot      
279,4.0,                       a good mouse with a nice long cord  appears to be solidly constructed  i have large hands and did an amazon search for  full sized usb mouse  and this mouse was in the search results so i ordered it  it arrived today  right on time  it is a smallish mouse  i m a bit disappointed      
280,5.0,                       this mouse is one of the best options has a long cable that allows you to use it freely  the weight is ideal for the size the buttons are soft  the construction materials are quality and durable giving enough time to work  the usb connection is easy to install  the optical reader is fast and works well on various surfaces      
281,4.0,                       i recently purchased this mouse for my son s laptop  the embedded mouse on his laptop was sketchy  and he needed something with a little more precision  considering that he stays on his laptop a lot and often eats and drinks while on his laptop  i decided to go with an economical  basic mouse and that is exactly what you get with the amazonbasics   button mouse the setup was almost instantaneous  he hasn t had any issues with the mouse since he started using it and he prefers it over the embedded mouse he s happy  so i m happy      
282,1.0,                          edit   i have only had this   months  and it is already messing up  i click on the left button  but it acts like i clicked the right button  at first  a week or more ago  i thought it was just the occasional mistake  but it has happened almost every click today  it is exceedingly irritating   and it is getting worse  not worth it  do not recommend almost every mouse i have ever gotten was too big for my hand  this one is perfect    i m not saying they were gigantic compared to my hand  just a bit too big  the latest before this was kind of heavy  it was wireless  therefore had batteries in it   had the gaming buttons on the thumb side that my cat would push trying to get me to pet her  and would put itself to sleep way too often this one  on the other hand is a light weight  slim  and comfortable mouse that is nothing fancy  but it works      
283,4.0,                       i used this mouse for some months  perhaps eight  then it failed  it was a spare  so it failed after the    month return period  the wire is thinner than most other mouses that i ve had and right where it enters the body of the mouse developed a problem  if i pushed the wire directly into the body  the mouse would work for a while  however  it soon got flaky again the fix  there were no visible screws or other fasteners that hold it together  but i finally found the single screw on the bottom under the label  that allowed me to open the box  inside is a well designed layout  with a route for the wire designed to remove stress and even a ferrite toroid to impede rfi  however  that first    degree turn was where the problem was  i proved it possible to strip  join  solder  and insulate the wires to repair  but only someone with the patience of job and the wisdom of neville chamberlain should attempt on this inexpensive  disposable mouse      
284,5.0,                       great price for a simple  basic mouse that works great   i am one of the people who curve their hand up over the mouse rather than laying it flat on the mouse   i find the mouse very comfortable  wheel turns smoothly  responds great   my kids also use my computer  so the mouse gets a lot of not so gentle use   it still works like it did on day one   very  very pleased      
285,5.0,                       so happy to be rid of having to constantly replace batteries  also  my previous two would frequently loose their signal   the cursor would disappear   had to turn them off and then on again to get the cursor back  i love this mouse  if the computer is on the mouse is on  i have a large screen desktop and have plenty of usb ports  i am only sorry that it took me so long to turn this corner  the size is fine  not smaller than others i have used   i have average size hands       
286,5.0,                       i bought one of these mice  mouses       years ago to go with my new laptop   i work on my computer all day and have spent untold hours using and abusing it every day for     years   i m talking at least     hours a day   sometimes more     to   days a week for     years it still works after about     years of this constant  endless  never ceasing abuse  the mouse wheel got finicky when it was humid   at about   years of constant abuse the left click button started occasionally needing extra force it still works though for the price  i m beyond pleased   a normal user could probably get a decade  or more  of reliable use out of it   i m buying a new one to replace the old one because lately it ll occasionally release when i click and hold  even with a harder left click   that s it s biggest problem after     years what a trooper         
287,5.0,                       update   my mouse finally failed after four years  for the price  this was an adequate life span  since i was satisfied with the this mouse  i have order another when my old mouse died  i went looking for another mouse  i wanted a usb mouse  this mouse met all of my requirements  so i searched the   star comments to see if there were any show stoppers hidden there  there were the usual  it didn t work upon receipt or broke after a short use  after five weeks  there have not been any reliability issues  the only other comment was that it was small  i looked at the dimensions  and it did not look small and appeared to be the same size as my current mouse  i believe that these reviewers were use to the large ergonomic mice  as stated before  the mouse work immediately  and it size fits my hand well  if you are looking for an inexpensive  wired mouse  that isn t the size of a full sized car  this mouse is for you      
288,5.0,                       i m pretty rough on mice and broke my last one s right mouse click button  bought this amazon basics one and it s perfect for me  great shape for my type of grip  clawer  as the other reviewer said  and also  i just have really small hands  so the size of this fits well      
289,5.0,                       not the most portable due to the cord  however  i enjoy that it is a corded usb mouse  no more changing batteries or looking for the separate uncorded usb like my previous ones  this is such a great value and what i need for my laptop to select  copy  and paste my online assignments  copy information for works cited pages  and just great when shopping online and doing my lesson plans  this item was better than expected for the price  thanks amazon      
290,4.0,                       i am really impressed with this mouse   i am only reviewing within the parameters of point and click  not gaming   i didn t expect much more than a traditional mouse  i like the texture of the surface  it s not smooth and slick  but smooth and velvety   your fingers don t glide off the buttons  they stay in place without being sticky   i can imagine it would make for some fierce wow action or spamming   i m  a homeschooling mom of   kids  when the other two need a mouse  this is the one that will be bought for them   it tracks wonderfully too  no problems there   it would be great for a desktop as the cord is long enough to be plugged into one side of a chromebook and brought around the other side with lots to spare   we simply bind the extra length with a velcro tie      
291,1.0,                       this was a spare so i just started using it  noticed that browser tabs were occasionally disappearing and pages randomly being opened magically  realized that it was the scroll wheel cooking off  i suppose i should have tried it during the return window  will know to do that with amazon stuff in the future      
292,4.0,                       i use the mouse right handed with my index on the left button and middle finger on the right  i feel there is a mild amount of lateral movement of the left button that when i press  it is enough to cause friction onto the right button and cause an accidental click i also have frequent accidental clicks of the right button when i am gliding around the mouse  i m not sure if the resting weight of my middle finger is a bit too much or the resistance of the button is too little  but regardless  the result is less than satisfactory with that said  i feel my hand has adjusted accordingly in the weeks since i started using the mouse as i ve had less mis clicks  also  you can t beat this price         
293,2.0,                       not happy  for       amazonbasics mouse not working within    days of purchase  i had to speak with two representatives and one supervisor  phone call was more than    minutes  and all i get is unfriendly  insincere customer service  for a product was manufactured by amazon and is under amazon s warranty  an online form should be available for quick replacement for amazonbasics products  instead of calling amazon to speak with clueless unfriendly or hand tied employees one of them told me to contact the manufacturer lol    what a hassle  good news  after the hassle  you need print label and ship it back to them  they insist on getting the defective       mouse back   enjoy the    minutes wasted lunchtime drive to ups store       
294,5.0,                       almost didn t buy this after reading the reviews  but for the cheap price i thought i d try it   it s not that much smaller than my old mouse so after a few hours of use i didn t even notice the smaller size   yeah  there is a louder clicking noise  but again after a few days i rarely notice it  besides there s usually background noise in my house    plugged it in and it s been working great ever since   could be i love it so much because i put up with my failing mouse way longer than i should   can t beat the price and so far i love it      
295,5.0,                       we ve purchased two of these so far  and will soon be purchasing another  my youngest son had a very hard time using the magic mouse on my imac to play minecraft  so we purchased the amazonbasics mouse for him to use instead  my older son had been using one on his computer for a year or so  and it worked great  now  however  my husband keeps stealing the one connected to my imac to use on his laptop  i think we have too many computers   so my youngest son gets upset every time he goes to play minecraft and he s left with only the magic mouse  so i think we re going to become a three amazonbasics mouse family very soon  which  at that price  is very hard to complain about      
296,5.0,                       i work at a library and we ve just gotten several new computers for staff use   along with the larger office model  we also have six laptops with the usual  touch pad    i really hate these   they re so     well  touchy   as a result   since it turned out i wasn t alone   my boss bought an amaznbasics   button usb wired mouse   i have small hands and usually have difficulty w  a larger mouse   this is a perfect size for me  and i love the textured surface   i have a new laptop at home and have been struggling w  the touch pad  so i bought one of these for myself   i couldn t be more pleased   i ve used both cheaper and more expensive models in the past  but this is the most comfortable  responsive and quietest of them all   if you are considering this purchase  you will not be disappointed   this is a great little mouse  and the price is pretty sweet  too      
297,3.0,                       work great for my kids  palm size  but when i borrowed it to use it for extended periods while remote working i found i was holding it in my fingertips like a little toy  made my hand and shoulder sore  it doesn t have the height of other mice and there isn t enough material on the back slope  bought a different  full sized  replacement and the problem was solved  i m    with average hands      
298,3.0,                       overall i m satisfied with the quality for the cost but there are some slight problems with it  first off its a small mouse  not as small as a notebook mouse  but smaller than the logitech mouse i m use to using  i don t think this is a really big deal what is more of a big deal is   months after i started using it the mouse wheel acts strange  it often rolls backward on the screen after i use the wheel even when the physical wheel is not moving  also when i use it to scroll a lot it can lock up  clicking the wheel like a button once to set it into a different mode and once more to go back to normal mode seems to fix this but its annoying  i would blame chrome for this but i never had a similar issue with other mice i ve used   so i really think its the cheap amazon basics mouse i think for my next mouse i ll pay a bit more for something physically larger and technologically more reliable  but i m not going to stop using this cheap mouse  its definitely worth what i paid for   this would actually be really good for children considering the size and price      
299,2.0,                       well after it took almost a week and a half for amazon to send me a mouse that that i paid for   day shipping for   and   reorders   the mouse finally came  im disappointed  as this mouse is very very small  its only useful for little kids or someone with very small hands  its not really ideal for adult computer use  wasted all that time for nothing  wish i could get a refund but i dont want to know the hassle thats going to take  ill give it to my daughter or nieces for christmas with their laptop or something  only good qualities is that it feels durable  dpi not perfect  but decent  outside of that        just order a different mouse      
300,5.0,                       i bought the amazonbasics keyboard and this mouse as well because i really loved the keyboard  i also had to replace the boyfriend s mouse because the old one was slow  i had to move the pointer in one direction over and over to finally get it to where i wanted it and usually had to click several times to get it to respond  this one  however  has no such problems  super responsive  i barely have to move it to get it to where i want  computer recognized it immediately when i plugged it in so no need to set anything up  cord is super long but great quality so it stretches to the tower that s on a nearby bookcase  we don t have it next to the monitor  without pulling the mouse with it  the material is great quality  no fraying or exposed wires yet at the usb end and my boyfriend tends to abuse his technology  the roller rolls easily and smoothly and the size is great for both my hand and his  his hand is much bigger  he s a man after all   plus  you really can t beat the price  i will be buying another when this mouse dies  however long that is  still holding strong after all this time        
301,5.0,                       it works exactly as i hoped   great   i had previously gotten a cordless mouse which did not work and i had trouble returning   i don t do gaming  so i can t speak to that   it is a mouse and works like a mouse  so i am unsure how to mark the other questions   i am liking it   one neat thing is that because of the cord  if the mouse gets separated from the laptop  i can always find it easily      
302,2.0,                       for the price  i won t be sending it back  not worth my time  but i had wanted one with just a tiny cord on it  i have had the mini mouse which is perfect for my lap top which is always up at my bar  i am sick of getting long cords all tangled when i don t need them  i will put this one up for an emergency but will keep shopping for the mini one      
303,5.0,                       easy to connect and easy to use   i am hard on wired mice  i get tangled in them  get them tangled inside the workings of the recliner  kick jerk them out of their usb port  etc  and the cord s pay the price   so i had to have a new one  i tried two different mice  one wired and one wireless  before i got this little beauty   the cheap wired mouse was hard to click   took real effort   whoever heard of a mouse that s hard to click  right   well  it exists  and is not for the     crowd   trust me   then i got a more expensive wireless mouse  but i don t use a mouse pad and that one didn t work well on the arm of my  leather  sofa   plus  it kept sliding off the arm of my sofa and getting lost   this one though  works like a charm   it feels good in the hand  and the matte finish doesn t collect fingerprints or dirt   it doesn t slip and slide off the  leather  arm of the sofa on its own  and it works beautifully      
304,5.0,                       its cheap  well  built  fires right up   used on imac  mac air  pc    why get a a corded mouse   ever tried using your computer when your wireless dies   it is a nuisance especially on apple products   so this is a back up mouse for me   it has laser tracker which mean it can be used over about any surface except glass  but i used it on my glass covered desk by putting a piece of paper under the glass    the surface is covered in a very slightly grippy plastic   it makes it easy to hold but it is still just slickness enough to keep clean   it tracks well and has good positive clicks count me as a fan of amazonbasics since this is my third purchase      
305,3.0,                       good tracking but doesn t fit very well in the hand   i think it would be better if the top had more grip but it is slick  not like glossy plastic  which you can grip   this is a smooth rubber which isn t very grippable    i really liked my old microsoft optical mouse but i can t buy them anymore   this one would be good if it was a little bigger and not slick   my hands are medium size   i feel like i need to use my thumb to pinch it to keep it in my hand  and the top does not engage my palm  so i feel like i am exerting too much energy to use it   maybe that s how small mice are  i know i just don t like this one   but it s inexpensive      
306,4.0,                       it is what it is  a super basic and cheap mouse to get the job done  if you game at all you will find that the texturized coating on the buttons wears off relatively easily so be careful with that otherwise it does exactly what it needs to do  be a mouse  no issues with the cord  no lag or anything like that  then again  i m not on some huge gaming rig playing games at     fps  i m on a laptop doing a bit of casual gaming and the rest of it is normal web browsing and typing for work  my game of choice since i have had this mouse is diablo iii a super click happy game like that is not what this mouse is meant for  regardless  it still loses a star since the coating wore off in only a couple weeks of use
