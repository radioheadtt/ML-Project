0,5.0,                       we were hoping to play a few games like roblox on the pc  and learned it required a pricey cord  okay fine  we found a cheap one then we discovered that none of our computers  even our   year old gaming lenovo laptop  had enough to run it super disappointing  but i guess we should have researched better the graphics are pretty good and so far the two games and several demos we ve tried out are pretty fun i    f  tend to get mildly motion sick when i play this  so i only do it in blips the rollercoaster game literally made me so sick i had to lay down trying not to puke for like    minutes i know  i m pretty hardcore anyways  of motion sickness is a thing  try one before you buy one i m looking forward to buying a few  games  although i m somewhat disappointed at the limited selection of free activities considering how pricey this thing is  but  alright  i get it all in all it was a hit with my daughter not perfect  but what is      
1,4.0,                       i received mine only today  so i haven t played with it a ton  but to me it s a solid   stars out of     why for the price  it is a fantastic entry into vr   i m a mac guy  so having an all in one system finally cuts the cable between the headset and a pc that i don t own   i can toss it in a backpack and take it to a friend s house  and not worry about lugging around computer along with it my cons so far   my eyes are somewhere between   of the   ipd presets   i haven t found the setting that feels comfortable  but i m trying to move the lenses  between  the presets to find it   it s close  but it s definitely not right   this is the reason i didn t give it   stars   i don t love that it s tied to my facebook account  which i knew beforehand   and i d like to know more specifics about what they track   if they re just tracking what i m playing  then i don t mind that they show me targeted ads   but the quest   has cameras and a microphone  and i d like to know if those are sending any information back to zuck      
2,1.0,                       do not buy the oculus quest    if facebook disables your account you re out of luck facebook disabled my account and now i have to return it      
3,1.0,                       we are now awaiting our third oculus quest   to show up  the first one had good lenses but now has   dead pixels  squeaky controllers and looses connectivity when you turn around too much  we love the product but it seems oculus has no quality control on what seems to be a difficult item to manufacture with precision  we have read of people going through    units to get a good one     maybe the quality is going down as our first two units were initially very very good  over time one set has started to fail after   weeks  but thinking about it      weeks isn t very long   if you go down this road make sure you have stamina for returning   reordering the product        
4,4.0,                       must have a facebook account to set up oculus    i set up  a new facebook account just to use oculus   and set every privacy setting at max  then facebook disabled account for no reason after  hr of having a new account  i did not set up a fake account   used my real name and info  did not even make one comment   or post a picture  never even used facebook  facebook still disabled my account even though i followed all community standards   i am unable to set up my oculus   headset without a facebook account  i am now forced to return headset before my last return date for a full refund since it will not work without a active facebook account  so glad this happened within my full refund window with amazon  headset is worthless without facebook account  oculus go still works fine because you don t need facebook account to set one up if you can get your headset set up then it seems like a nice vr headset when i try to log on facebook now this is what i getif we still find that your account didn t follow our community standards  it will remain disabled we re always looking out for the security of people on facebook  so until then you can t use your accounti complained to oculus since i had an account with my oculus go headset   sent them   emails about his issue  facebook asked for picture and phone number but did not ask for id  my vpn showed i was in panama and this is the only reason why i think they disabled account so quickly and for no reason  after sending picture account was listed again  i now can use my quest    don t even try to use a fake name or account  read below whyhaving a facebook account should not be a deal breaker for this fine headset  i did not put any pictures on it and put all settings at max  which means only me  there are a lot of setting you have to change but after doing so i don t feel threated by facebook  all the ads setting and links i put on no   off   or max which is only me  i did not even put app on phone because i will never use  it  i just signed up to use  oculus    all setting on quest are just for me  i will never use facebook for anything else  i have no pictures  no friends  no links on facebook don t use app on phone don t even have it installed  no phone number on my account  just block everything and don t use facebook for any contact to anyone  all setting on oculus are at max  privacy  there are a lot of youtube videos to show you how to max privacy setting and there must be over    that you have to change including the ones on oculus app and the oculus   headset setting  since not using facebook don t really see the big problem  just think about all the crap amazon knows about you  they know so much because you use it  facebook has made  more privacy setting you can lock down but it sure takes a while to find them all  a lot are hidden on purpose buy you can close almost all of them  i was surprised how many i could lock down  will probably  never even log on to facebook again  no reason to unless they give you more privacy options to close quest   blow away oculus go  it has the xr  chip in it  they are loosing money at         this is the best freestanding vr you can get  no wire to expensive pc needed  everyone should get the  ravpower filehub to use with this once dlna is supported  gives you unlimited storage capacity on your headset  oculus   can then have apps stored on it while ravpower can have everything else plus it can keep headset charged up while you use it would give it   stars if not for having to have facebook account and spending so much time changing  their privacy setting to max xr  chip is so nice as of          after over    email contacts to oculus  dlna is now supported    this now works  with the ravpower hub and is  so nice  now that dlna is supported and i can use my ravpower hub with it  along with having all setting on headset set to only me  this is now a a fantastic vr headset  what once i only gave a one star  i now give   stars  ravpower has no issues even with  k on its own  g wifi network sending it to the oculus    you can install any portable hard drive to it and send it all via wifi to quest   keeping quest   drive empty to load up on apps if you like      
5,4.0,                       the quest   is better and worse than the quest   pros   slightly higher resolution  but you can still easily see the individual pixels   we are nowhere near a  retina  screen resolution yet   definitely less screen door effect   the layout of the lcd pixels actually makes a bigger difference than the actual resolution   the pixels look much cleaner now cons   lack of fine ipd adjustment   i used   mm on the quest   and i m using the same   mm setting  ipd    on the quest    but i m seeing chromatic aberration on the sides of objects   there s like a rainbow outline around objects against a white background   i think this has to do with the layout of the lcd pixels and an ipd setting that s not my exact size   when looking straight ahead  i can easily see the edges of the lcd screen with my peripheral vision   this is on the ipd   setting   it s probably much worse for people who use ipd   setting quest   is an upgrade and a downgrade at the same time   i wish they made a  pro  model along with this one that doesn t make any sacrifices   yes  it s important to have a      model to get new vr users  but also make a high end model   i want to experience the future of vr now  even if it costs more      
6,4.0,                       if you re looking into stepping into vr gaming then this is hands down the best way to go about it  it s around the same price as a nintendo switch and definitely cheaper than the new xbox and playstation  at the time of this writing   and what you get is amazing  there s plenty of killer apps and amazing games that you should definitely try out  there s just about everything for everyone  and the best part is that you can use a cable to connect it to a pc and play even more games  which is wicked cool  battery life isn t all great but that s to be given  and the reliance of having a facebook account may get a little irritating  but other than that the quest   is amazing  it s by far my new favorite platform to game on  the   gb one is the one i own and with file sizes of games and apps  is more than enough for me  plus  it s priced at       way better than spending thousands on a valve index     
7,3.0,                       i am a vr software engineer and i had to upgrade my oculus quest to oculus quest   among the many advantages of the new headset i can highlight    it s cheaper than the first model   it s lighter and smaller   has a better resolutionbut unfortunately  the model has quite a few cons and those are pretty significant    unlike oculus quest    this model is relying on facebook account  which meansa  if you get banned on facebook for whatever reason  and they can make up any these days   you loose your oculus profile and everything on itb  your privacy is no longer that private   no improvements to the battery life   although it s lighter  if you really want to make it comfortable  you have to buy the  elite  strap from oculus for another       if you need to connect your oculus to pc for whatever reason  such as using sidequest   you will need a usb   usb c adapter   controllers are battery equipped  and although they last long  you still need to replace them from time to timedecide for yourself  if you want to upgrade from quest   to quest    if you re not too concerned about the cons  i d say  yes   because with the     strap  this thing is really more comfortable and tech advanced oh and if you re thinking whether to buy an oculus quest or another vr headset  i give all my votes for oculus quest for all of the great reasons it brings  that s gonna take another other post to explain   but most importantly it s the hand tracking feature that allows you to put aside the controllers and simply use your hands in most vr apps and games welcome to the future      
8,1.0,                       my facebook account was disabled a few years ago when my profile picture caught the attention of an alt right facebook group  after repeated death threats being sent to me  which facebook ignored  my account was disabled and facebook asked me to send them a picture of my photo id to prove who i was  apparently one of the tactics people use if they are targeting you is having a large group of people report your account to facebook and trigger a bot to disable your account  i sent my id to them and they never fixed it  so i gave up and stopped using facebook  now my account is banned and i was told it can t be renewed  if i try and make a new account they ban that one too  this means i can t use this product i ordered and all my games that i linked to a new account from my quest   are gone too  hundreds of dollars worth of games  don t trust facebook and don t buy this      
9,1.0,                       got it yesterday  right out of the box the right controller s trigger squeaked      
10,1.0,                       when i bought this i thought i could play any vr game   nope   first of all you need a stable internet connection to go to facebook   then you need an account that meets all of their changing guidelines   then you need their approval to have an account   all this so i could try to play a vr game that i already own   would buy this again  no   i don t use facebook  i bought the wrong device   oculus got all these great reviews  but it sucks if you want to play steam pc games in vr   you can steam your desktop to vr  but that isn t a vr game  i bought the wrong vr setup  a donkey took off it s thong wrong      
11,1.0,                       would be zero stars if that was an option   never had a facebook account and decided to create one with fake name not realizing that it was against the rules   immediately disabled the account   tried to create one using my real info and that was immediately disabled   sent a photo to verify account and they still won t enable it   so now it s going back because having to have a social media account to use it is the most ridiculous thing   i ll order the valve index and wait until they have stock      
12,2.0,                       vr needs wider audience  but this product seems to go toward the opposite direction smaller face pad means people with big head will have hard time wearing it smaller sweet spot means you ll spending more time adjusting  and small vibration might make everything blurry again smaller ipd range and its horrible adjusting mechanism further deters its future customer controllers is bulkier and the holding pose doesn t match any real life handle i m really worried that it will cause similar effect google cardboard did  a cheap but low quality product that destroy consumer s trust in future vr products      
13,1.0,                       i have a previous oculus account and try to merge it with my facebook account and it wont merge so i reach out to support   i am told it will take       hours to fix the software issue  many people can go to the hospital  have a baby  and get back before this is scheduled to be fixed  jc died  was buried and rose again before this will be fixed  pitiful oculusedit    days later still waiting  no feedback from oculus   awful support     they could really learn from amazon how to give support      
14,1.0,                       right after the return window passed the voice control when your in multi player stopped working  now can t play with any one that s at a different residence  i can hear them they can not hear me in any multi player function now i can t play with anyone unless there next to me so they can hear me  took all the fun out of playing now that i can only play by my self   this shouldn t have had a defective this early in owning it  disapointed took away what i bought it for to play with family an friends now i can t      
15,5.0,                       i am not a gamer but i have had a great time with this vr set    there are lots of fun things you can do and the vr just blows me away most of the time   the sound is fantastic and the quality of the display is amazing    for what you get the price is fair i think i would recommend getting the more expensive one with the larger memory you will fill up the   g one quickly if you play games   i find most of the games a bit expensive but i don t have a good feel for what they cost on other platforms   they seem to be from free to      there are a lot of lower priced ones around      which is not bad   i would like to try some of them but spending     for a game that i probably will not be able to play or maybe even like is hard to justify   you can return some games within   days so that is a nice feature   i think it was worth the money and i enjoy the puzzle type games a lot      
16,1.0,                       we ve had this for a week and i m very  very disappointed  first the usb link cable didn t work  got a new cable but it s not compatible with my pc  which is a top of the line  recently built gaming pc  cable connects to my mac but mac does not support the oculus app only iphone does  oculus app on my pc kept crashing during install  had to delete all files and re install app   times before it would work  comes with a very short charging cable  the quest   died within a hour of being fully charged  then both controllers randomly disconnected and will not re connect  then the quest   went to a black screen and will not show display  i tried resetting to factory settings  uninstalling all files  re installing app and followed multiple online tutorials and videos and i can not get this to work  i keep seeing these same complaints over and over  this has wasted too much of my time and money       
17,5.0,this headset is great  is lightweight  is comfortable it allows you to run any kind of vr experience  exercise and enjoy games  videos  experiences and explore like you never had before  this beats any console like playstation or xbox  you buy this headset and you need nothing else   pros     wireless  needs no cable connected to anything but has the option to connect the cable if you want to play more graphically rich or intense games      comfort  it is far more comfortable that is predecessor  is great for both child and adult content     experiences  if you are not looking for games and are interested in exploring watching videos and seeing something knew  get this  the experiences are amazing     games  the are tons of great games  if you like shooters get onward or pavlov  if you like fitness get creed or thrill of the fight  if you want battle royal population one  there is a ton of great content in the library     fitness  some games are a full workout but even the ones that are not will keep you active which is far better than any other console experience where you are not using your body  good games are creed multiplayer fitness and thrill of the fight     friends and family  connect in this virtual experiences with other friends and family even if they don t have a vr headset you can show it to them and pass it around for fun for everyone  if they have a vr headset too then even better you can interact with them while being distant and connect like is not possible in traditional videogames or even videocalls     portability  this is a stand alone headset kind of like a phone  it is small  light and easy to put on  you can take it on the road with you   cons      facebook account required  this means you have to make a facebook account even if you not planning on posting anything or using it at all  your profile will not be shared publicly unless you choose to  this wouldn t be a problem if it wasn t because facebook has a garbage term of services that lets them ban your account for dumb things like using an alias or having multiple accounts or sometimes for no apparent reason     strap  you have to get the     strap is way better than the original one and is totally worth it  but even the     strap could be far more comfortable  they need to put more work into the straps     weight  they reduced the weight but they need to reduce it further or have the option to remove the battery  when you walk outside the boundaries it goes black fairly quickly this is not helpful if you want to pause to get water without taking off the headset 
18,3.0,                       long story short  pros   very cool experience but when you get used to it it s just ok  the main reason is that most of the     videos and games are very old and basic  cons   facebook required  if you don t want to use your own  open another account  you will be blocked eventually   very heavy and it hurts after a while   battery life is very short  about two hours but you can t hold this long with such a heavy setup on your face anyway   eyes will hurt after a while  the lenses are super close to your eyes   the strap is junk and this is one of the reasons it s so uncomfortable  but they sell a good strap of course for additional       most of the videos are old from         nothing new is made anymore  i don t know why    but this makes me think about the future of this platform   very limited games library  again not much content made for this platform  just search yt for good games and you will see that everyone is doing the same games   everything cost you money  you need to buy everything and always  there is only one free game that is kinda cool but that s it  you buy games and then you pay for additional options in the game it s not there yet       
19,5.0,                       i have been into vr gaming for years now  i started with an htc vive back in late       and never looked back  at that time  the pc vr gaming experience  both the htc and oculus offerings  had finally become everything that gamers had been promised since the    s with  the lawnmower man  and nintendo s ill fated virtual boy  although i have long preferred the htc tracking system and hardware builds  both companies offered an experience unlike anything before them when the time came to upgrade from my htc vive  i purchased a vive pro  and was even happier than expected with the improvements over the original  i had an almost perfect vr gaming setup  with two exceptions  price  and the fact that i was tethered to a computer with a large wire for anyone who hasn t experienced wired vr gaming  i promise it s more limiting than you d expect  especially when playing games like  thrill of the fight   a must have for vr exercise  or  pavlov   price is pretty self explanatory  but i will mention for the sake of comparison that i had over       invested in my first two vr setups  including both headsets  the gaming pc  and peripherals now on to why the oculus quest   is so amazing  aside from graphical fidelity  oculus  aka facebook vr  is now offering a setup that is better than the original htc vive setup that i had in       for       i purchased this on release day because my vive pro is currently out of service due to a sensor failure  and i still need a wireless adapter to  untether  my experience  when calculating the cost of a replacement sensor and the wireless adapter  those two components alone cost more than the quest   s entire setup  and this setup is wireless out of the box  doesn t require me to mount sensors on my wall  and doesn t require constant tuning troubleshooting of my gaming pc to ensure the best experience  you open the box  put it on  and it just works  and you never again have to worry about getting tangled up in wires after giving this glowing review  i will admit that you will never get the graphical quality from this headset that you will get from a vive pro valve index   a good gaming pc  but for almost all of the games that i play  the experience is better on the quest   simply because of the wireless aspect  if i want to play half life alyx  or any other game with incredible graphics  i ll need to go back to the vive  but for my daily  vr workouts   i ll stick with the quest   and beat saber thrill of the fight if you are looking for your first vr headset  you ve found it  even if you already have a gaming pc  i would still recommend the quest   and an oculus link cable instead of a pc based vr setup facebook is currently selling these at a loss to introduce vr to a new audience  and to pull hardcore steam valve htc fans like myself into the oculus ecosystem  and they re doing a great job  but take advantage now  because they may not ever sell hardware this good at a price this low again      
20,1.0,                       after buying and waiting a month for it to be shipped and finally opening it wouldn t turn on sometimes or wouldn t turn off  unexpectedlyit took almost a week to get ahold of someone and after     day increments they told me to wait   more days to get a shipping label so i could wait another week for them to get my device then waiting another   weeks for my new replacementthe device is now totally unusableand i m still waiting for a shipping labelor some kind of helpsupport is terriblethe device was a pretty amazing experiencebut after reading multiple other reviews this has happened to allot of other people     
21,3.0,                       i m trying to write an unbiased review for this item  so the consular has nice features such as specifying the game play area and giving you warning if you were about to move outside it  user friendly and ergonomic controllers  high resolution of the display  etc however  the games are not so high quality  which is somewhat expectable given the limited processing capability of the headset  i would say the games would be fun for teenager but as an adult  i didn t enjoy it at all  graphic of the games are so simple  simpler than games on your smart phone  research this and watch some youtube videos before ordering      
22,2.0,                       it s a great piece of standalone hardware that can be enjoyed without wires  without an extremely high end gaming pc  or better yet  with    and is extremely affordable for what it offers that said  while i d like to talk more about everything it gets right  there s some real drawbacks that i need to make some noise about    a facebook profile is mandatory  everyone knows this by now  but i m still bringing it up  i already had an account i d previously deactivated  because i was tired of falling into the skinnerbox loop that had me closing fb in boredom and immediately re opening it out of habit while the hiatus was healthy  having over      of quest games tied directly to my fb s account integrity means that i basically wouldn t feel safe posting ever again if i wanted to  yesterday i got an automated    day post block for a meme i posted in       and it s not even close to violating the stated community standards  but i m not important  or  i quote   dangerous   enough to get a chance to appeal it to a human employee    unless i want to go through a  rd party company that front loads the fact that i m probably not even going to get my case reviewed in short  participation in facebook is demanded  and in practical terms  so is being absolutely silent while they curate which propaganda is going to be shoved in my face when i log in to keep my profile buoyant  because they re holding a whole lot of paid for software hostage and are contractually allowed to pull the trigger if they  or a robot that can t detect nuance  irony or sarcasm  decide i m not sticking closely enough to their script  cool    speaking of triggers  my right trigger squeaks  loudly  and permanently  it s received a ton of breaking in  and still  the only thing that silences it is flooding the housing with plastic safe electric wash  and after a few days it always comes right back  on the entire quest   system  the right trigger is by far the physical input you ll use the most  and fresh out of the box  i had this cheap bedspring sounding squeak pulling me out of any attempt to get immersed  i only found a fix after doing my own research  because they re not going to acknowledge a hardware fault unless you go after them about it   dodging a lot of bad advice  like using wd     and further research clarified that people who have this issue were having a miserable time getting an official fix    so i guess i m feeding my touch controller electric wash indefinitely  the way a car uses gas  that s an unanticipated cost for sure    the unit s bootup stage is becoming increasingly unpredictable  and it seems to get worse with every update  you ll usually hear the startup chime and get the oculus logo  but about a quarter of the time now  i m greeted with a black screen and refusal of all additional input from the power button  you can t force a restart to let it try again  it ll just hang there in limbo for sometimes over a minute just deciding what it wants to do  other times it ll report that tracking was lost and the prompt will just sit there and stare at you for   seconds before it lets you set up a guardian  for a device that s clearly intended to be picked up and played for quick sessions  this really sucks  and standing around blindfolded in silence while a computer ignores you is probably the fastest way to start questioning your life choices overall  the quest   is a praiseworthy device  but it comes with enormous caveats that you re unlikely to be warned about amidst all the hype      
23,1.0,                       just the thought of this thing tracking my teen daughter gives me the creeps  you need to send in your id for verification  your state id  or drivers license you want headaches all day then get this thing  seriously tracking your every view and movement is insanely like       absolutly no way  we have grown to be too complacent with having no privacy but i think this is the next lever of surrender of privacy  forget the bells and whistles stay far  far away      
24,4.0,                       i got this on release day  it is the first vr headset i have every had  so far  i am quite pleased with it pros setup was easy and quickwireless is amazing  i use this all over the house  as long as you have a little clearance graphics are pretty awesome  immersability is def propped up by this audio is better than i expected with the placement of the speakerscons have to link it to facebook account   puuuuukebattery seems short lived ish  but there is an addon you can buy that effectively doubles battery life and counterbalances it for more comforthead straps are sorta annoying to get just right  another model i tried had a knob which fine tune tightened and that was really nice overall  i am pretty happy with the purchase  and would recommend it      
25,1.0,                       is just pos    fuzzy to the point where you can t read menu   you have only   points to adjustif non of them work you are of the luckthe concept of  k is just a joke   worst vr i ever try   the google cardboard is sharper     head strap is the cheapest item in the set not sure if facebook shop for it in the dollar store please try other vr sets    and those who write and post positive reviews should be shame of them self        
26,2.0,                       doesn t match my eyes its a little blurry even though i ve tried all   len positions and moved the straps up and down  what a disappointment i m returning this and going back to my rift s  not impressed at all      
27,5.0,i m giving this five stars because of the price  even though there are some slightly annoying things  it can take a bit of work positioning it on your face to get it as clear as possible  the face pad absorbs sweat  and since i m using it mostly for exercise  i need to buy something like a silicone cover or a more easily washable replacement pad  unfortunately  there are no brand chinese options  which i don t trust on my face  and most everything else is out of stock  it should include a good silicone cover in my opinion   compared to the model i tried a few years ago  the pixels are barely visible  and overall the clarity is good  the view isn t very wide  but again   price  i was going to return mine because it looks like there is something on the inside of the lens or something  but i read that this is from light reflecting around inside and off your eyes  it comes and goes  so it may be just reflections that change with the content  i wish i could compare it to another to know if mine has an issue   i m amazed how powerful the processor is   haven t experienced any stuttering of any operation  streaming a virtual desktop from one computer to the headset  using virtual desktop app  and then casting to another computer worked great   most people probably know a little about what these things can do  but it takes a while to get the complete picture  the details can get confusing  and we re still learning  for example  i bought a link cable because a youtuber said it allows you to play pc games and see the pc desktop  but there is a wireless option  uses wifi   the virtual desktop app  that cost about      the cable didn t work anyway  so i returned it  the company that makes the virtual desktop app has an accompanying desktop app that does the streaming  that let s you see the pc desktop in various settings  but you need to install the large oculus desktop application to play pc games with the headset  but none of our computers have a graphics card that is powerful enough  you need a beefy computer to play pc games on the quest     but you don t need a computer at all to use the quest    there are a ton of games that play natively on the quest   that you download from the oculus quest app store  the computer inside is powerful enough to support decent games  there won t be the visual detail of a playstation  xbox  or pc games  but that doesn t detract from the potential fun factor   my son is currently experimenting with sidequest  which is a desktop program that makes it easy to  sideload  applications  separate from the oculus app store  there doesn t seem to be anything wrong with doing that  and provides a bunch of extra applications and capabilities   my     year old dad asked  what do these things do for you    i ll try and do my best to explain  if you are going to purchase one and want to discover things for yourself  then don t read further  what follows is more for people who aren t very familiar with these vr headsets   the headset has two displays so each eye can see a different image  allowing it to simulate depth perception  this is a big deal  even though the display isn t as clear as a nice monitor  the headset makes you feel like you are really  there    more on what  there  can be later  i live near mountains and find that a picture doesn t ever allow a viewer to get the feel of the scale and magnitude of the view you experience when standing there  i think this is because as you stand there and look around  your mind forms a detailed internal model of the mountains as you move your gaze around  when you look at a picture  the depth is hard to  see    you have to infer distance intellectually  not automatically  and even if you could pan a picture back and forth on a computer screen  for some reason you just don t get the same impression  the difference is dramatic to me  so when you are looking through the headset at a  d scene  your brain accepts that you really there   the headset has cameras in the four front corners that track your head movements  and the position and orientation of the controllers you hold in each hand  so when you turn or move your head  the view of the virtual world moves very precisely and close to what would happen in the real world  this can really help avoid feeling of nausea  i personally get a little sick if i play a  d game on xbox for a long time  when you pan your view left and right  the mismatch between what your eyes see  and the inner ear signals reaching your brain cause nausea  once it sets in  it can last for hours  so having the headset move the virtual world to match your head movements  when standing still and looking around  is way better  this only applies when standing still  the opposite is true when you move in virtual space  some  d movies move you through virtual space  or a game may allow you to push the joystick to move around  i find that this makes me feel sick immediately  if the app has an option to  teleport  instantaneously to another point in space  then it doesn t make me sick  the quick transition is handled better by our brains  some games have options to mitigate these effects using blinders  motion blur  or vignette effects when moving  this limits what you see when moving  so you can kind of see what is happening  but your brain isn t getting overloaded by it   besides tracking your head movements  the cameras track the position and orientation of the hand controllers  this allows you to precisely point to things in vr  or interact with vr in other ways  there s a demo application that lets you pick up a virtual paper airplane and throw it  the airplane and other objects appears right in front of you on a desk  you reach out and position your hand over the object and pull both triggers to simulate gripping the object  to make it less annoying  it doesn t matter where you grip the airplane   it orients automatically  you perform a throwing motion and release the triggers at the right time  there is a ball on a string that you can punch  like tether ball  i mention these only as examples  it s completely up to the application how hand motions translate to vr actions  a soccer app could make your hand movements affect the player s feet  because the headset can t track what your feet do  but most apps require hand actions  and the game mimics your real life motions in vr  which is very intuitive   the quest has the ability to track your hand positions without having to hold the controllers  it does a great job of seeing your hand and finger positions  but it is limited in some ways  if you touch your hands together  it can t tell what it is seeing and your hands disappear in vr  and it isn t as precise as tracking the controllers  so if an app requires precise pointing  for example  you ll have to use the controllers   given that the device can display any virtual  world  or space  and each controller has two triggers  two buttons  and a joystick  the possibilities of what these things can do is huge  they ve been around for a few years  but they aren t mainstream just yet  the oculus quest   is selling well and the future looks bright   when you first turn it on  complete set up  and log into your facebook account  required   you ll see a couple of virtual flat panels with icons  just like any operating system  the look of the interface will change over time  the controllers emit a virtual pointer that extends a few feet in virtual space  and the exact spot they are pointing to is shown with a small white dot  you click the main front trigger to select the option you are currently pointing to  you can open the app store  a browser  the  tv  app  settings  etc  of course you can open an app that you ve downloaded and installed   there are a ton of options  here are some examples  you can install the netflix app and watch content while sitting in a virtual rustic lodge  with a big screen surrounded by stonework  there are many other options for viewing  d video content  these let you fly over mountains  or view ants up close doing their thing  and everything in between  you can browse any web site  some web sites contain  d apps that you run by clicking the little headset icon  typically  to jump into  d mode  there are educational apps   i saw one where  you  are in an artery and can reach out and examine white and red blood cells  you can view concerts or other entertainment  like comedians  very  close up   there are social apps where you can visit with other people in various virtual environments  there are virtual games like paintball  i found that games that allow you to shoot arrows are really cool   you bring the controllers up and together  pull one trigger to grab the string  and then pull a controller back from the other to draw the bow  letting the trigger go lets the arrow fly  you can shoot surprisingly accurately  there are apps to create artwork and  d models  who knows what people will dream up   when i first started using this device  i found myself sometimes stuck  not knowing how to exit the app  in general once you figure this stuff out  most apps honor the common conventions  but some do their own thing and you have to experiment   there are options to record a movie of what you are seeing and doing  or take a screenshot   personally  i m using the fitxr exercise app the most  fitxr is a punching and dancing workout app  my legs and arms are tired from punching at balls and ducking under beams that come at you  so far  i haven t felt any tedium exercising this way  you have to focus and keep moving and you just lose yourself  there are a number of these types of games  beat saber being very popular  but i think they can be much better and more diverse  some more advanced exercise apps require a monthly fee   some games require you to move around a little  to keep you from running into walls or furniture  the quest has two ways to define your movement boundaries  once defined  when you get close to an edge  a virtual mesh wall gradually appears  and disappears when you move away from the edge  if you move outside the boundary  it goes into pass through mode where the game stops and you can see your room through the external cameras  you can either define a small circular boundary right where you sit or stand  or you can draw a boundary of any shape to match your room obstacles  in the second case  it shows your real space through the cameras and you draw the boundary line on the floor by pointing and drawing with a controller  very slick  at first  it was hard to trust  but as saw how well it works  i don t worry anymore  even when i go to a different floor to get a drink or something  and come back  the boundary is still defined perfectly  and i can continue the game   i hope this helps some decide if the quest   is for them 
28,5.0,                       i am a supreme novice on vr but am so impressed  learning new things to do everyday that i use it  i am definitely outside of the target market area but this is great  have purchased a few apps and acquired several of the free ones that come from oculus  be ready for motion issues especially when you are up in the international space station  keep telling yourself it s only a game when you have a t rex roaring two feet in front of your face  the one drawback i have found is a challenge to find directions or explanation of game icons  at least to me   the app wander is an example  there are icons but i am not sure i know what to do with them  i will eventually figure it out but a little frustrating      
29,5.0,                       it really pains me to say it  but this is a good buy   i ve been waiting to fully get onto the vr bandwagon  and this finally made it affordable and enticing enough for me to do so   i ve heard of a lot of weird situations happening where people s accounts are getting banned simply for merging their oculus account into it    from what i understand  a lot of their accounts are being reinstated   think about it    facebook wants you to use the product   they want you to be buying things from the store  and allowing them to harvest your sweet sweet data   i have confidence that before long  everyone will have access again now  onto the specifics  this is first and foremost a standalone system  which is great   the ability to play in any room of the house without bothering other people is huge   the native software catalog isn t huge yet  but i m sure that it ll continue to expand  you can get a hell of a workout with this thing   i m at a point in my life where i would rather have bamboo chutes jammed under my fingernails than walk on the treadmill  so making exercise fun again was a godsend   i feel better and better every day  and i m losing weight   i tell people  remember how when you were a little kid  you would run around on the playground all day   it wasn t necessarily that you had killer cardio  its that you were having so much fun that you didn t even care that you felt like your lungs were on fire   that s how this is   notable games for this   beat saber  and  pistol whip   for pc gaming  this isn t completely there yet   the oculus link is still in beta  and the only other option is an app called  virtual desktop  which allows you to pair your device to your pc over wifi   i have a top of the line gaming pc and  ghz wifi router    neither of these options are spectacular yet   with oculus link  the positions of the controllers seems to stutter and lag occasionally   it doesn t make anything unplayable  but it is just enough to throw off your groove in a rhythm game   with virtual desktop  i consistently have issues where the virtual world s rendering seems to lag behind my head movement  whipping my head to the side leaves me briefly looking into a black screen until the pc wifi catch up and show me what is actually supposed to be there overall  i m extremely happy with this purchase   it fits perfectly with my lifestyle  and it makes me feel better      
30,1.0,                       bad setup   the set up seems easy it walks you through each step and you think you are all ready to go but then you try to purchase a game it tells you to enter your pin  there was never a prompt to set up a pin while setting up your account  done by syncing with your facebook   in the app has a place to reset your pin but since you never set up a pin the you can t change it because you have to know the previous pin  so anyone thinking about getting this for your kids for christmas make sure you set it up because customer service takes one to two business days to get back to you if you send them a support request      
31,5.0,                       omg amazon you have really  really  reallllly made my      christmas a great one   i was so upset that the actual price        oculus quest   was on back order until january   i searched everywhere even in other countries but no avail   so i went ahead and ordered it sun  dec   th on amazon and planned on printing the order with the picture of the oculus quest   and wrapping that so the kids knew it was coming   everyone knows that is not how parents want to give present to their  kids at christmas time   needless to say i was pretty upset and rather sick to my stomach   today is tue  dec    th and i get an email saying my order has been delivered   i think most everyone is like me this year and have been ordering multiple items through amazon so i wasn t sure what it was   opening the box i see yes the oculus quest     i was shocked  stunned and actually started to cry   my kids will be happy and some what surprised but it won t come close to how surprised and happy i was when getting it   thank you so much amazon      
32,5.0,                       i had the original rift for    years   this is such a huge upgrade over the original   better screen and of course  wireless   not having wires is such a big difference in vr   i would compare it to living in a house with and without air conditioning   it makes the vr so much more immersive  and the better screen is the cherry on the top   the original rift had very grainy screen  you can easily see the pixels   the quest   screen is so much more clear  i cant see the pixels   so  the experience is a huge upgrade   but not everythign is perfect   the battery life is only about     hours with heavy usage   a lot of the games on the rift are not cross buy  so you have to buy them again for the quest   yeah  i could hook up a cable to my pc and play rift games  but that would defeat the purpose of it being wireless      
33,3.0,                               i had the original quest just prior to this  the quest   has better hardware but the fit and feel are a large step backwards  and i assume why the price is so low in addition to the burden of mandated facebook where they ll no doubt monetize your info  the quest   strap sucks compared to original quest headstrap  the lenses have only   positions so pray your face is perfectly one of them  mine isn t    the original quest had a slider so more ability to fine tune  i was hoping for another slider with more range  my sight was best at the extreme end of the slider on original quest   you may have to use aftermarket silicone or foam seal to fit you to one of the   lens settings  most games aren t optimized yet to really see much of a difference graphically so if you have the old quest there s no rush it didn t save my game progress when i switched over from quest to quest     not sure what i was supposed to do or even if it s a possibility so look that up ahead of time i did get screwed with buying games inbetween headsets  there were several weeks from when i sold original to when i received pre order   i didn t like one of the half a dozen or so games and requested a refund immediately after i was able to download and play  i was told i was outside the    day window  despite me explaining the situation that i had no way to play it  the base model should have    gb   these tech companies rip us off constantly on memory  memory is not that expensive if you want to be generous  you can say that by the time you buy an after market headstrap and seal you will have spent the same amount as you would have on the old headset  which retailed for more than the quest     gb price  but you have the benefit of better hardware      
34,3.0,                       so i m in the ring of thrill of the fight fighting ugly joe kid  i accidentally hit the oculus button and find myself back in my lobby  i leave and get back into the fight but i don t have a left boxing glove  what s up  anyway i m in the   th round and i m going to finish this fight so i continue on and win  just bragging  i come out back into the gym and there s my boxing glove on the floor except i can t pick it up  my right controller completely will not pair with the oculus anymore  i go online and this is a common issue  i try the tinfoil solution this works for about    minutes then again right controller won t work  i do all the suggested things  i remove the battery for a minute to let it reset  i remove the battery for the day to let it reset  i unfair and repair an unfair and repair and unfair and repair  nothing  it s dead  lucky for me i bought this in november and it s still under amazon s return policy on january           i contacts oculus support then they told me to do the same thing that everybody online told me to do  don t get me wrong  i love the freaking thing  i enjoy it immensely it is absolutely great for workouts i have fixxrthrill of the fight  and even pistol whip is apretty good work out  but i m gonna wait until they address the problem before i buy another one      
35,1.0,                       nope   it was totally unnecessary   ridiculous being forced to link with facebook  intrusion of private information even when adjusting privacy settings  a total shame too because it is an amazing vr headset  there s enough information about this item by performing an online search that throws up multiple red flags  as long as facebook enforces these policies i cannot recommend this headset and suggest looking for a different product      
36,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this is coming from a new vr user the last time i used vr was when i was using my gear vr   the oculus quest   is so easy to set up   all you have to do is put on the headset and follow the instructions   the only thing i have to complain about which i will not take off any stars for it is the head strap   i ll probably end up ordering the head strap that is for the oculus quest     other than that this thing blows me away i would highly recommend purchasing one of these for other than that this thing blows me away i would highly recommend purchasing one of these for yourself  and immerse yourself in vr      
37,1.0,                       after having it for   days i have begun to see malfunctioning  right now it is at the point where it does not work out at all  you cannot play any of your games pretty much if you do not have a boundary and in order to have one  your  tracking  needs to be working  after spending a lot of time researching and watching videos i noticed others have had this problem  however  they were able to fix it by restarting  this is not the case for me  i have almost spent      on games to not be able to play with them because my quest   console doesn t work  i reached out to customer service to exchange it for another one but no response yet      
38,1.0,                           on the headset      for facebook login required      for facebook bricking headsets because of how the customer wants to use their device      
39,5.0,                       i ve only had my quest   for two weeks and i m already loving it  i ll try to make a shorter review without missing essential points  the quest has very nice quality display  with barely  if any screen door effect  you re really getting a great package here  the box alone can be used to store the quest until you get a good case the controllers come preloaded with batteries  all you have to do is remove the contact tabs  a nice hard copy manual and health  safety guide are includedthe major difference between the quest and pc vr is the quest is a little more limited in hardware specs with that said  it s a big step up from the original  and there s some amazing games on this thing that will keep you going for hours i can t say enough good about the crazy amount of enjoyment i ve gotten out of the games on quest so far  there s practically something for everybody can t say enough good about the crazy amount of enjoyment i ve     
40,4.0,                       awesome  but it wears off quickly  at least for me  and i m a    year old grandma   why  because  unless you play games  there aren t that many options  almost every     clip on yt is less than a  five min experience  unless you decide you want to see other cities on foot  but then motion sickness sets in  it s awesome that it feels like you are really there  pounding the sidewalks among strangers that you try hard not to stare at  out of politeness  but i personally got very sick during my walk through london  and it was enough to not wanting to walk anywhere again  so  no walks  and no games  still  i liked this    mb oculus thing so much that i didn t want to give up my vr adventures  and so i began to choose those activities that had limited motion like standing on the deck of the starship enterprise  watching elephants up close  flying at warp speed through a wormhole by the trappist system in space and visiting the holy land  i swam with the sharks underwater and i walked  slowly  on the china glass bridge  it was all fun  but it eventually wore off  also  i suspect that the motion sickness may also be caused by the graphics  which aren t always great and could stand improvement  all in all  i saw myself using the oculuss less every day  and i was sorry  because such great potential  and very few options available  unless you are a child and like silly stuff  which i call trash  of which there is a lot  for instance  virtually all the games  and i checked  have you holding a weapon of some sort because you either hunt    others  or are hunted  little wonder our society is so violent  so anyway  yeah  it s fun  exciting  makes a great gift but perhaps there should be more organized entertainment available for non  violent oriented individuals  perhaps skills teaching  tutoring  quality and realistic experiences that last more that a minute or two      
41,5.0,                       it s been a month since the quest   arrived and it s been fun  really more than fun  it s been an entertaining adventure and a really bizarre  amazing and immersive experience  i m     and i use it for so much  like  tripp meditation and qyiet mornings in the tropical sun  supernatural for workouts at exotic locations around the world  watching shows on amazon prime on a gigantic screen  the expanse is incredible on quest    playing immersive games  ping pong on eleven  disc golf in rec room   and visiting landmarks and places around the world is it perfect  no  but its very impressive  now excuse me  i m about to take a spacewalk outisde the iss        
42,4.0,                       this thing is really cool  is magical very comfortable  adjustable  completely wireless  the games are really cool  vr chat is a ton of fun  the only thing that made me take off a star is that facebook forces your to have an account to use this thing my suggestion   if you don t already have a fb account  do not create one on the browser  use the oculus app  otherwise fb might flag it   you won t be able to use the headset until it gets resolved  also  if fb ever suspends your account  u lose access to all your oculus stuff    their customer support is non existent for blocked accounts  tho oculus support may be better with this      
43,5.0,                       i have the cv   oculus go  and psvr  i have to say im very pleasently surprised how far technology has come over the span of only a few years  easily  hands down  the oculus quest   is my replacement over the cv  rift  the clarity is so great  hardly any screen door effect  the pass through feature is amazing when setting up boundaries  the motion controllers are fluid and react great so i guess ill be tearing down my oculus rift sensors   packing away the rift and selling it because this paired with a oculus link wire does the job and i can play it through the pc and portable beatsaber is fluid  pistol whip plays very well  i cant wait to load up walking dead saints and sinners on it  it is going to be great   i highly recommend this                
44,5.0,                       i ve owned the rift s combined with rtx      super  and it wasn t nearly as clear as the quest   the resolution is awesome  and i can plug it in my pc        
45,5.0,                       i gotta admit i was completely dumbfounded by how far vr has come   i held off on getting one but my buddy talked me into trying his and i was hooked   while most games the graphics are not all that impressive  we are talking borderline original xbox to maybe xbox    level graphics  the overall game play is impressive   the sensors are stupid accurate for the controllers along with headset   the  guardian  system they use to keep you from running into things and setting your boundaries works extremely well   the speakers are surprisingly awesome for being pretty far from your ears  you would never know it by the rich full sound they make a couple small complaints though    st being the battery is pretty crappy   i get about  hrs of game time before it needs to be recharged  which by myself  hrs would be fine but with   kids who want to play it too i find the battery is dead alot  thankfully it charges fairly quickly though  about    minutes to an hour my other gripe is the lenses     they are super easy to smudge  god forbid it touches your forehead when putting it on other wise you will have one blurry eye  it can also be a challange to adjust the headset so the picture is clear  at least for me   i find i have to find the proper eye width setting then have the head strap super tight for the view to be clear my last gripe is a software issue with their party chat  that needs some work for sure   their chat system is often overriden by games so its its difficult to maintain connectivity to your friends  its like the system wants to force you to interact with strangers and not just your friends with all that said  yes i would recommend this to others  its just to much fun to not recommend   their first person shooter games are a blast but if you want a true mind blowing experience play google tilt brush  you feel like freaking tony stark  even my wife who doesn t like games was blown away by that      
46,1.0,                       i would like to be able to comment on the merits of the headset s performance design in terms of comfort  audio video quality  refresh rate  latency  etc   but since i got locked out of my oculus account when i tried to activate the quest    it has been completely unusable  so i have no idea how good or bad the quest   is the best part is that this also locked me out of my oculus rift and oculus quest   st generation  at the same time   so now i have   headsets  technically    since i bought two quest  s  that are completely useless   no account   no vr   customer service has been unresponsive      
47,2.0,                       i used a friends quest    which pecked my interest in this vr model  not sure about spec differences  but i can tell you the quest   headset is a little smaller then quest    so my glasses don t fit  even with the eyeglass little extender piece   useless  the head straps are crap  headache after    minutes with those adjuster bars in the back  gient step backwards in comfort design all and all  pretty disappointed in this new model      
48,5.0,                       i was looking for a  fun  fitness alternative and something that would get me up and moving  the quest   fits the bill perfectly  yes  you need a real facebook account to use it  but since i ve been a facebook and smart phone user for over a decade i figure they already have all my info so it doesnt bother me  i got this primarily for fitness and play beat saber and fit xr  both of which give a decent cardio workout  when i use it with my bluetooth earbuds it s a fully immersive experience  some people may find they get a little queasy the first couple times using  my suggestion is to ease into longer use and don t over do it and you ll adjust to the vr environment without feeling ill  would definitely recommend as a way to be more active while having fun      
49,1.0,                       the actual headset is very nice  but everything else surrounding oculus and facebook is the worst experience of my life  oculus support is flat out useless and will mark your support tickets  that s right they only do support tickets  as  solved  without even contacting you  merging my fb and oculus accounts straight up broke my oculus pc app making my quest   essentially a brick and nobody seems to know what to do about it  after submitting several tickets and waiting      business days  i ve gotten no help and even ignored by oculus support  so despite the fact ol mark zuckyboy lied to all of us about not forcing quest users to make a fb account but he also singlehandedly removed all the excitement for vr that i had  do yourself a favor and either wait for them fix their broken product or do yourself one better and buy headsets that haven t been tainted by facebooks malicious little grubby    fingers      
50,1.0,                       do too having to have a facebook account to use the headset if anything happens to the facebook account your headset will be banned and you will not be able to use it again  you will lose all the games you have bought with no refund people are getting banned by facebook for just linking to the the headset  if someone on facebook reports you becouse they don t like something you said  you are banned  you lose       on the headset and all the money you spent on the games too facebook will ignore you and oculus will ignore you  this is a scam  do not buy  wasted      and now all i have is a paperweight      
51,5.0,                       this could be the best product i ever purchased  i am amazed how much oculus squeezed into one device  it is a self contained gaming system  video and movie viewer  exercise machine  meditation coach  should i go on  the only  negative  is you need to set it up with a facebook account  but after that you never need to go on the facebook app  so what they track your every move  who doesn t these days   for      i dare you to find a better way to spend your hard earned cash  one caveat  buy the halo strap   on amazon  and throw away the cheap head strap that comes with the unit  other than that you need nothing else   check out the tripp app for all your meditation needs      
52,1.0,                       my unit kept getting stuck on  setup    i first spoke with their tech support two and a half weeks ago          and we determine that it was stuck on the left controller s firmware update   i rma ed the left controller which was received by oculus on        they said that they were going to send a replacement  but i still have not received any shipping notification  one week later   dealing with oculus has been one long ordeal yes  i could have returned the whole unit to amazon for a replacement  but i would have to wait until amazon had the units back in stock   plus i would run the risk of receiving a defective replacement and going through the whole cycle again      
53,5.0,                       this is my second quest the first one being the original and all i can say is i love it for what it is damn good vr game play with out all the cords  is it worth it you ask  well yes it s very well worth it and you are only limited to your play area or you can make it a massive play area you can play in with out all the cords or wires being attached to you and a pc  graphics are also amazing for it being a stand alone vr headset and i personally feel like it s just going to get better  also some may see it as a down side that you must have a facebook account to use the headset but who doesn t have a facebook account already  like seriously what do you have to hide if you are not doing anything illegal you already carry all personal info on a cell phone ok now back to the subject would i say get a quest yes of course i would its mobile its mobile vr gaming at its best  oh and before i forget you can also hook it up to a pc that is vr ready and go to the main oculus website and download the rift app and play pc vr games as well and steam vr games      
54,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this is the most awesome thing i have ever owned  i got my daughter one of the be headsets that u put your phone into and the games were so limited that i ended up taking it back and taking the plunge to get this  and i am so happy i did it s amazing i ve never played anything virtual reality before this so i was amazed it s so cool the first game i purchased was job simulator and it s pretty cool i can t wait to see what else i can do with this  the headset is very comfortable and being i have glasses really glad it came with a glasses spacer and then that way my daughter can where her blue blocker glasses with it too  it s so easy to install and maneuver they made it very user friendly  i m completely satisfied with my purchase  if your looking to get a vr headset don t waste your money on the ones u put your phone in just take the plunge and go for this one it s worth every penny   also go for the    gb cuz   gb fills up really quick      
55,5.0,                       i bought this for my kids and did not expect to enjoy it as much as i have   i find myself impatiently waiting for them to get done playing   take a break so i can have a turn   as a longtime migraine sufferer  i thought there was a good chance that it would trigger headaches or dizziness for me  but to my surprise  i find it quite comfortable   fun to use and it hasn t bothered me a bit   it was very easy to set up and start using and it feels balanced  secure  and comfortable on my head   i also like how easy it was to set up the play area so you don t bump into things   i didn t realize it had cameras on the outside so you can actually see the room when you re setting it up   this technology is so amazing   very happy to have splurged on it   i know it s going to make this cold covid shut in winter so much more fun      
56,5.0,                       battery   i cant complain get about  hours and    minutes  ish  on full  i play it connected to my high end pc so i get       hours with the  party link   ft usb c to usb c cable ipd   only has   setting and mine is    so for me the first setting is great with no complaints herefov   not bad but coming from an index i can tell the difference   if this is your first vr headset it will be great purchase  pc vr   doing a great job doing pc vr games like half life alyx  beat sabers and vr chat  the real selling feature for me is being able to play pc vr using virtual desktop  with a sidequest patch  makes this a must buy over any other headset at this time cons    terrible head strap and wish i could order the elite strap but it seems to sold outoverallif you are ok with using your fb account then this is a great and wonderful device for the price and you wont find anything close to what this is for the price      
57,1.0,                       the guardian feature is one of the most annoying features ever added to anything  ever  it has never come in handy once and seems to only exist to annoy the user  i keep getting warned that i m about to  hit my boundary  when i m stationary in bed watching a video  however  when i m actually doing a physical activity  my arm collided with my wall with zero warning from the guardian system  this is proof it only exists to irk the user  and the only way to turn it off is to have it so dark in your room that the guardian can t tell the boundary  this is hard to explain but i think users will know what i m talking about  besides that  it s not as revolutionary as i expected  the quality was not much better than the vr on my android phone  the facebook account thing is an atrocious thing to require of a customer  but didn t affect me much because i have a facebook  there is no easy simple way to update apps  i definitely regret my purchase and wish i had invested in one of steam s vr sets  as those seem to have a lot more flexibility in what they can do than the oculus      
58,4.0,pros  lightweight and smaller in size improved battery life for controllers runs warm not hot grayish white color surround sound and bassy speakers little to no screen door effect good screen color contrast improved battery controller life wifi   for pcvr experience  good hand tracking   cons  headset battery life at   hours        not user replaceable lens technology from quest     tick pd adjustment       eye view to lens visual stability is finicky requires facebook account to use                                first impression review  my background with vr is me coming from mid tier phone vr  oculus rift s  then finally the oculus quest    i was find with the rift s performance but i eventually got sick of the wired experience and internal stereo experience   my first impression on this was overall decently pleasant  i feel they cheaped out on the box packaging compared to the rift s  but i am fine with the sacrifice for the decrease in price  everything comes with a set of instructions although not as in depth as i hoped it to be  a short charging cable with a  a plug in charger   controllers with mitsubishi batteries  and a stretchy strap          build quality  i feel the build quality feels really good  it definitely feels smaller in size but heavier than the rift s  imo that gives me a good feel like this little thing is packed with a lot of tech inside it  in terms of color i had the impression of this being a marble white color  but in fact is a slight shade of gray with a matte bumpy texture that feels like it is resistance to scuffs compared to the rift s  the controls however is matte at a grayish white with a smooth texture   the only thing i don t like about this is the speaker arms feels like that is the first thing to break off if you are not careful or the first thing to wear down  you can pivot the arms up and down for your comfort in conjunction to where the strap rests on your head          controllers  the controllers are slightly bigger and is said to have improved battery utilization from quest    i find it big for my liking but it works fine  no complains  i have no issues with the performance and hand design of it after hours of use  hand tracking is available for this if you don t want to use your controllers on home screen  though some games supports it          speaker  the speaker blows the rift s and previous headsets i have owned out the water  the speakers are located in the inner side of the headset arms  the first time i put this on  i was hit with surround sounds and good bass that i feel like i am actually in the game  i really don t feel like i need headphones to improve my experience but that is always an option  i have played with the quest   for a fair bit and i feel like it is the same  if not better  there is also a earphone jack which thankfully they kept          battery  the battery life is just okay  the headset lasts about   hours for me which is good enough for each sessions and prompts you for a break from the vr world  i have probably nearly drained it for cycles and my controllers are still full  facebook did mentioned that they improved the controller batteries so that could be the result  i still have my rechargeable batteries for my rift s  i will have to see once my stock battery drains out and use that to see if there are any changes   there is experimental modes where you can turn on   hz but that will most likey decrease your standard battery time below   hours  since the battery is big enough to only provide   hours  expect this to get worse over time due to degradation and they do not sell replacement battery for it   tracking  i feel the tracking is pretty good  i have no issues so far  latency is more or less the same from the rift s and can play fast paced games just time  i have i have yet to play around with this in various games since i will need to make those purchases in the future          display lens  the lenses are improved to      x      from the quest   at      x       this is close to  k display and image quality is very good  i can barely see the screen door effect without even trying  i think even when i try to  i can t really see it  this is a god send in visual quality from the rift s and the contrast is decent and pops out in color well  i feel like my eye do not strain as much compared to before   as for the lenses  i think it uses the same lenses as the quest    it is good however imo  i think the lens design is a bit finicky  compared to my rift s  i feel like my eyes go out of alignment from center so easily and causes the sight on the edge of my eye go blurry or have god rays  it is bothersome  especially when you are playing games with a lot of head movement or workouts  i find myself re aligning my eyes to the lenses to hit that sweet spot  this is sometime i do not experience with my rift s   the fov  field of view  is supposedly the same as the quest    i definitely feel like the fov is slightly smaller than the rift s and kind of reminds me of putting my eyes through a binocular as an extreme example  this gets worse if you have the spacer or or wear glasses  the best way to work around this is to adjust it so that your eyes are close to the lens as possible   pd  pupilary distance  is something that i feel is restricting  there is not much information regarding what group the pd adjustment corresponds to  you move the lenses left or right with your finger to make changes to the pd and try it out by trial and error with the   settings  my pd is around    and i don t feel like being grouped up with a few milometers of error which bothers me  you can move the eye adjustment and make it so that the number is in between to make half increments but who knows if that will cause damage overtime as there is a nudge feel for each number          software  as you may have know  this is now owned by facebook department  you will need to sign in with your facebook account to use this quest    i did encounter an issue with setting this up with my phone and i found that i had to reinstall the app to show the quest   pair on the phone  after that  i set everything up to private and hopefully my games are for my eyes alone without interruptions and worry about my data going public  if you have any issues with your facebook account  i recommend you to send a support ticket with oculus facebook to address with that issue          overall  i pleasantly enjoy this headset very much  i have more freedom to walk around and bring this headset anywhere without needing my computer  just don t use this outside in the sun  it is just a matter of time what content will come out for this  this may not be for everyone  like the pd adjustment or if you find something about quest   bothers you like god rays in the lenses and fov then it may not be for you  if you are new to vr  this will highly suit your needs to give vr a test run 
59,4.0,                       i remember years ago when vr first started coming out and it was extremely clunky  and i made a mental note to check back in into the future once vr became good  we have arrived     it s easy to conceptualize where we re heading into the future with even better capabilities but this is an amazing piece of equipment  the games are great and the web browsing is amazing  if you get my drift   my only complaint is that since oculus is owned by facebook you need to link account   which is absolute bs   though if you take some tedious time creating new google account and new facebook account you can fulfill the requirement to access and use the device without handing them all of your personal information on a silver platter  so  lose a star on that and i think their sales would be higher if they decentralized the creepy data farming aspect  all in all a great and affordable device      
60,4.0,                       the headset is nice and fun  that s not the problem it s the account  if you can t access your account you can t do anything  this would not be a problem is oculus support was better  i ve tried to contact them but they never replied and have little help for facebook linking issues  if it didn t require facebook to run the account and just  have one account for the whole thing it would be smoother and not as many problems      
61,2.0,                       i love the oculus quest   and wanted to love the    some things i love  the size and weight is great  the graphics are a little better than the first  you can also definitely tell that the processor is faster  los times are shorter and the games are more fluid  the one fatal flaw  however  is that there are only   ipd settings on this one  if your pupil distance isn t exactly one of these three settings  your experience  will be blurry and nausea inducing  that s what happened to me  so great system but only for a percentage of people      
62,2.0,                       pretty disappointed  being untethered is great but the quality of these lenses is garbage  lots of fensel effect  washed out app colors  bad gamma correction  blurt edges  my several year old vive with gear hack lenses look a thousand times better  this shouldn t be the case  on paper the quest  should crush it vader is fun taking a star away for lack of multi user support  want to let your kids use it  get ready to have your game data over written  thus lack of local accounts abc forced tie in to face book is tiresome horse hockey buy from a vendor that dose not think it owns you and the device you paid for      
63,3.0,                       to make it short  the headset is absolutely stunning and very easy to use  if it weren t for the facebook account requirement  it would be an easy   star product  however  the notion that fb will get telemetry data about every single game you play  how you play and tons of more information makes me kinda hesitant to even use the headset  worse  if fb decides to block your account for any reason whatsoever   your shiny      piece of new hardware is rendered useless      
64,5.0,                       this is the most fun you can have at home   you will find your virtual world can be better than your real world   i use it for workouts  supernatural workout is amazing   and for travelling to places that i may never see in real life  like a  d     degree tour of notre dam being reconstructed    expect to pay        per game  while some are free  and most tours are free   i ve had it for a month  purchased the smaller memory  and am fine with that size memory   you will love it and want to share it with people  because it s so amazing      
65,5.0,                       who cares if fb owns it  everything about your information is already out there one way or another  to have a device free from wires and yet still be plugged into a conputer for pcvr games is amazing  i tried the psvr but i dislike the move controller  the joy stick on each hand is what should be standard  if it isnt already  for the     dollar price difference from    to      theres no question  get the more memory  overall  im looking to get thr battery extender to counter balence the front  its not huge issue by any means  every vr headset will have wight  regardless  but if the headset and controller is     then this battery extender back head strap is the last         
66,5.0,                       ever since i graduated college and i kind of lost interest in video games  this invention truly re kindled this love and in an immersive way here is what i like  dislike about oculus pros   immersive  just watch a free     video on youtube and you are instantly transformed into an alternate reality    you want to visit moscow  boom  you are flying over the red square  seriously this is beyond cool   no wires  this is my first vr  i ve read about previous generations of vrs with wires can t imagine having to wrestle with these wires while playing  so glad this does not require any   graphics are great  responsive and realistic in some applications and gamescons   fit  it can hurt after a prolonged wear  battery  you are lucky to get   hours of continuous play  sound  the built in speakers are ok  not great  connecting app  to connect the app to the headset  to watch what the player is seeing  is spotty and does not work all the time      
67,1.0,                       hardware wise  really slick package at an amazing price   too bad i ll never know how it works  as it will not pair with my lg android       phone  even though both are connected to the same wifi   the  help  page linked in the oculus app for debugging pairing issues  says i kid you not  after your headset is paired  tap controller or headset problem   then select connect wi fi     that is the extent of their troubleshooting help   totally  astoundingly  useless      
68,2.0,                       we were told this would support rift games   it does not   we were told this supports steamvr games   it does not   the current library has only about    titles     of which i actually wanted to play   i ve had this for three days now and have completed one of the games   the other gives me slight motion sickness and is on the boring side  so i don t play it frequently  today i spent about    minutes browsing the quest store looking for something that would interest me   nothing   then i put my headset on and looked at my available games with great disappointment   i then removed it and powered it down   i have nothing interesting to do or play on this   this is incredibly frustrating and disappointing to me   i am one of those people who really doesn t mind buying a console just to play two games  but i have never put one down three days after purchase out of boredom   the novelty of vr itself wore off in    hours   i really hope some of the rift or steam titles quickly make it to this platform or it will go back   had the docs been truthful about the lack of backward compatibility  i would have waiting several years to purchase this platform   however with a non user replaceable battery  i am not going to let this sit around and wait for titles while the battery ages out      
69,2.0,                       overpriced toy   not like the old nes days were at least you get a mario brother to play for the price   it s bad enough you spend a high end ticket price for this strap on fb and it s constituents already selling a high end strap  basically telling us customers the strap that comes initially with it is garbage so be prepared for the sticker price   at least the games have a good return policy if you don t play more than   hours  you can return them for a full refund within    days  however  the games aren t anything now to be excited about lost its luster after about    minutes of gameplay    if you want to play minecraft or roblox  then you re going to need to spend the extra  cash  for a special link cable to pc  you re going to need a hi end computer capable enough to run the games with the headset   just another paperweight like most of today s systems        
70,5.0,                       the oculus quest   is a completely different gaming experience  when you play it feels like you re in a completely different world with endless possibilities the games are so fun  super hot is a must have   on console it s a pretty cool game   but on vr it becomes a completely different and more amazing game  the only con i have to say is the battery life  it s not the longest lasting   but it works and has a decent amount of play time before charging is required  the only reason it has bad reviews is because of people who hate facebook   its powered by facebook and it says so on the box  people act surprised that it requires a facebook account when it was never a hidden detail   ignore the bad reviews     
71,5.0,                       the first time i tried vr was on a friends oculus rift s and his beefy pc  a set up that cost him about   grand  not long ago i tried another friends original oculus quest  both of those experiences where mind blowing  i have wanted to get the original oculus quest for some time now but i held off  i am glad that i did  i bought this thing as soon as i saw it advertised  i haven t had for long so i can t speak to its longevity but i will definitely update this if i notice any problems with it  the resolution per eye is higher than even the valve index  a       dollar headset that still requires a good gaming pc to run properly  the      hz display is not amazing but it s more than acceptable  tracking is very accurate and feels very good  i have noticed that everyone is more or less prone to motion sickness but mostly it depends on what you are doing or what game you are playing  however  it does require you to login to facebook  this personally does not bother me  however  if it does bother you  look elsewhere  and whatever you do  do not use a fake facebook account as if facebook finds out that you are using a fake account they will ban you and you will lose access to all the games and software that you payed money for  overall this headset offers a very good experience  it is ideal for any who wants to try vr but does not have a powerful pc  or for someone who want a fully wireless vr experience  amazing      
72,5.0,                       bought this for my grandkids and it has been the hit for the holidays  everyone plays it   grandkids  kids  parents  grandparents   the device provides access to a number of games that puts the players at the center of a virtual reality experience  as an combat vet  i decided to try the game onward   woah  what an amazing experience   the game placed me in a cartoon virtual world full of enemy combatants  and provided a number of options for me to engage the  enemy  to survive   this system can be a lot of fun   some people may have a hard time getting accustomed to the vr experience  especially if they are prone to motion sickness  this device and games  however  are well worth the money      
73,5.0,                       we have had this guy for a while now and love it so much   it has some mild issues like battery life and some extremely minor tracking issues  but i think that is just because we grab the headset cover and smudge the cameras to much   the battery life thing is a catch     on home hand  it keeps you from wasting your life away gaming   on the other hand  sometimes that is exactly what you want to do   i works great with an extra long charging cable and you can even use a portable backup charger to extend its life too   i use an anker power brick when i want to go the distance   the updates have been great so far  with new features added every time   the latest  multi user accounts  is the one i have been waiting on and i am so stoked it finally dropped   not all the games have merged over to shareable just yet  but hopefully  in the near future  they will be   it is great for isolation workouts  hanging out with friends virtually  or just visiting places you have never been to   if you are looking for a great way to get into vr  this is the very best   go for the larger hard drive   you never know what you will want to add and  yes  it can be linked to your pc if you want more content then what quest has to offer   all in all  just get it   you will not be disappointed         
74,1.0,                       you fork out      to get this product just to end up seeing in the setup that you are required to have a facebook profile and to be logged in at all times in order to use this      product you just purchased owners of the previous oculus were apparently notified that they will be required to abide by the same rules in   years  so basically  the company is saying   thank you for your money  but this is still not really a product that you own   nobody sees this as a high level scam  is it because they are a well known company  it might be legal  but it doesn t make it morally right or fair to the customer at all with all of the data collection issues facebook has been exposed for  i see it this way  you are paying      dollars to be forced to use their social media platform in order for them to collect and possibly sell more of your personal data you are limited to the games they have unless you buy an     cord to hook to your pc to play more      
75,4.0,                       it is a very good headset for the price  but even so it needs some tweeks to be decent pros   very powerfull more resolution and more stable than quest      with link is the cheapest and best option for pcvr under     usd   as standalone product without pc  it is the best vr headset right now with a lot of games and experiences    option with virtual desktop and sidequest to be a usable wireless pcvr  some issues with alyx and beat saber  but seems better on other games  cons   the elite strap is a must  because it is very front heavy    the battery seems shorter than the quest      the ipd adjustment is not comfortable    needs some tweeks on the resolution side for standalone pcvr  dev mode sidequest   to enjoy at the fullest      
76,1.0,                       i thought people were being overly dramatic about the whole facebook account thing and being deactivated  nope  it really wasn t that impressive when it was working but now they re useless conversation pieces sitting on our end table   we thought we d give it to the kids at the beginning fo the holidays to try and cheer up a really bad       i bought two  not worth it  why facebook would lock out an account i have no idea  and now i can t even complain on facebook or use facebook messenger to talk to our family in other parts of the world   be gone with happiness  save your kids the misery and just give them a large lump of coal or go get a rock from outside and set on your table and just tell everyone its the new occulus system  that way your kids wont get all excited then have their hopes dashed  they re just disappointed from the start   i m also out the money from the games i bought   such a joke   too bad it wasn t owned by amazon   consider yourselves warned   don t ruin your holidays like we did   i suppose if you d like you could always give it as the perfect end to      to sum up what a awful year it has been and truly end the year on a massively disappointing christmas note   i find the irony hilarious for some reason even though i m totally out a boatload of money      
77,2.0,                       i have purchased and returned two of these quest   headsets  every single one has either a dead or stuck pixel in the middle of the left or right eye heard many times this is a production issue oculus support is horrendous   so i thought i d buy from amazon instead since they have a better return policy    will update soonso far not impressed with quality control of the headset   games are great and this would get a much better review if it were not for the dead stuck pixels in the last   headsets        
78,5.0,                       this oculus quest   vr headset has turned the vr world on it s head and making it a true gaming console for every serious gamer  you can even watch  d movies and get the true  d functionality  so many things you can do besides watching a movie or  d movies  you can play games but theirs a whole assortment of different type of games e  g   regular way to watch  immersive       interactive  it s just amazing  the oculus quest   will keep you entertained for hours and you won t even realize the time spent  i had to buy a battery because the oculus doesn t stay on long enough for me  yes  i m on for hours and the time goes by so fast chances are you re going to get hooked just like me  the graphics  the games  the movies  and the number of options available is by far more entertaining and makes this purchase a no brainer  i read all the hype and i m just another happy vr user contributing to the hype  i gave it   stars because it s worth every penny  just take a look at all of the vr headsets our their and the oculus quest   is the only standalone this cheap  i also bought the htc vive custom audio strap  more comfortable and has built in audio phones  vr power battery  which allows me to use my headset for up to   hours  trust me  i ve not come close to playing that long but i ve played for more than   or   hours  a lens protector  and a stand that i can sit my headset and controllers on  the stand is easy to use and works great i don t know what else to say about my new oculus quest   other than  if you re looking to buy a new vr headset and want to save hundreds of dollars  still get the high video resolution  powerful robust processor  and not have to connect to a computer every time you want to play  then this a no brainer      
79,1.0,                       resolution is a little better than the go  but overall it s useless it only works if you have a facebook account if you create one just like i did  it s gets suspended for review i verified my email and phone number  still not good enough i guess they want you to upload at least   months of your life  and have   hours minimum daily fb time  it s annoying  now it s up to fb to decide when i m allowed to use this device  that s just insane      
80,1.0,                       my facebook account was banned after contacting my oculus account  because of this it bricked my headset  after i spent close to      all of my games are gone  i will be returning my headset but i will not be able to get my      back  so tldr don t buy it  its a scam to get your personal information and money      
81,1.0,                       overall a complete disappointment     a facebook account is  required     the oculus pin created at the website can t be used on the device itself    any failure in wifi causes the device to become inoperable the big selling point here is that the headset is untethered  unfortunately it is  tethered  plenty in other ways  i can t recommend this to anyone until this product is fixed       is too much to spend for a technophilic advertisement for facebook  i can t believe the oculus division produced this drug      
82,5.0,                       first     
83,2.0,                       i have been using vr since the oculus dev kit     i have owned multiple headsets from oculus  htc  and my go to for pc vr is the valve index   like a lot of people  i had a quest   and played it with friends that don t have pc vr and never had any issues with it  games played well and it was as clear as expected  with the resolution it has  the specs on the quest   made it a no brainer to upgrade and i was excited to have it arrive today  on launch day    of course  i couldnt wait and jumped right into it   now  im sure the limited   ipd settings will be fine for many people  but for me  none of them hit the sweet spot   the middle is the closest  but at this setting  i can only play for about    minutes before feeling sick and when i take the headset off my vision is off   i had a similar issue with the pimax  k  which is why i sold that headset after months of waiting for pimax to fix the issues  which  to my knowledge  is still an issue for many people in the pimax forums  so you may have no issues with the one of the three ipd settings   but you may  and if you do  the headset will be a challenge to use for any amount of time   ill give it another shot tomorrow  but this is the pimax issue all over again  so i dont think it will work out well   no matter how many times i attempt to use it      
84,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i absolutely love vr  my previous vr experience has been from playing the psvr  but this adds total freedom  no wires to hold you back  love the controllers and the tracking feels great  i love how i can safely move around which adds a new level of gameplay  now i can take a full approach for bowling or freely move around a boxing ring  very happy with this purchase  i also purchased the elite head strap with the extended battery and case  love it  can t wait to see what the future holds  go buy one  you will love it  where s the psvr      i don t think i can go back to wires       
85,4.0,                       let me start by saying the last vr i used was back in        the osvr   it cost about     and came with  no controllers   oculus rift was the big boy back then and priced like it  with their controllers   unlike rift  there was a ton of hoops to jump thru to get osvr to work and it did fine with steam etc for about a year seated    then collected dust   like computers  it seems every     years something appears that pushes us forward   advance   years and i finally see a price point with controllers that looks interesting and gets a lot of hype on the internet   hey  facebook bought out oculus a while back for   billion and they have deep pockets to make this a success   and right off   yes  it looks like it will be   wireless standalone or linked to pc with steam games    amazon prime movies and other ways to watch movies and tv   it really does do it all   and looks  good enough  doing it  the hype is real    it is a very good and easy to get hooked up device   as a stand alone device it couldn t be easier   and has its own little store to spend your money at and install games with nothing else needed   well  you have to have a phone and their app and facebook account and then you re good to go   using a  quest link  or even a non quest link cable with good quest reviews on the cheap  mine was    bucks   still works just as good if you hook to a pc   or good enough    this will allow you to play your steam and pc vr games on the headset   youtube is your friend to figure all this out  the first program i installed was called virtual desktop   making an access point to my pc wireless   danged if that didn t work about as well as the  link  cable    and it shows   hz as an option   but without it or thru the link its   hz headset for me   so there is some play on sales pitch at launch   or i have something mixed up   but i am still grinning while i continue to figure it all out      bucks for a vr headset and controllers  launched by a deep pocket company pushing vr tech further  yeah  i had to try it people hate that they need a facebook account   why  if not them  you would have an oculus account   same difference  they have owned it for a while now   just like microsoft  google  twitch  twitter etc etc   if you are on the internet  you are hooked up and data tracked by someone and from everyone    oh yeah  you can hide from your family on facebook that you bought this   lol   but why  its a great price and performance product   and it is only going to get better       
86,1.0,                       i ve been looking forward to this vr headset since they announced it  i pre ordered it as soon as possible  and i didn t even care if you had to log in with facebook  i didn t have a facebook account  so i made one about a week before i was getting my quest   in my excitement as october   th grew closer  october   th comes  i get my headset  i try to log in to use my quest   and start buying games right away  and i was stopped in my tracks to find that facebook just disabled my profile the same day  why  i would also like to know  i filled out the appeal they asked for  sent them a picture of my driver s license  which is super messed up btw  and i have no idea what so ever when i m gonna be able to use my headset  it s a      paper weight sitting on my desk  if facebook s algorithm decides to disable your account  your quest   will completely useless  you ve been warned        
87,1.0,                       very disappointed   the quality appears to be mediocre   appears and feels cheaply made   the head strap that comes with it is poor and very flimsy   the fit of the headset is poor and uncomfortable   the ipd adjustment appears to be poor design      
88,2.0,                       pros        absolutely amazing realism  truely does feel like your are in the game  lightweight and video quality for movies is very good  free games and apps were surprisingly good as well  cons       let s get the worst out of the way first  battery life  with no games downloaded and fresh off a full charge  you get   hour playing time tops  cut that down even more once you start downloading games or stream to a device  yes you can play while charging  but the cord gets in the way alot  second issue is freezing  after about   hours of use in   days  it had froze on me   times and just shut down and lost all game progress  last issue i found was how little room for error you have to see clearly  if the oculus isnt sitting on your face just right  things get blurry  i never could find that happy medium between having them loose enough to be comfortable  and having them tight enough not to move  at the end of the day i ended up returning it  just had to many problems to justify paying     bucks for it      
89,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i just got in the oculus quest   this week and have been loving it  i ve been always interested in the vr space for a long time and felt like now is a good time to get into it  mainly with half life  alyx available as the first huge aaa game to focus on vr picking this up on pre order at      was the perfect price for what they have to offer imo    hz  increased resolution  overall improvements over the last quest seems like the perfect combination for entry level vr  seems sort of hard to say entry though  because my experience thus far is phenomenal  utilizing the controllers for grabbing and detection of your fingers is super neat  grabbing objects  throwing them  shooting guns  dancing with a robot  it s nuts and it s easy to experience in the first tutorial i immediately ordered a usb c   ft cable to go along with it to hook up to steam vr   oculus link on my desktop and it worked perfectly  loaded up half life  alyx  and took off  everything worked well with the game and highly recommend running through it with this  all i needed was the one cable and a capable machine and i was good to go  i was absolutely blown away by the experience with the quest   and half life  alyx  it was like nothing i ve ever played before getting up close and personal with one of my favorite franchises if you re interested in vr  i would highly recommend checking this out  i will say the only downside so far is there is a lot of pressure on the forehead without the  expert   advanced   upgraded  headset add on for     or something  for now i ll just keep adjusting the headset  but it does limit some length of time i d be able to play for as far as  screen door effect  goes with a lot of vr experiences that people discuss  i do notice this just ever so slightly if your eyes aren t adjusted to the lenses  but i assume there s only so much sharpness you can achieve at the moment with this resolution overall  i highly approve and can t wait to check out more games with this  hope it helps      
90,1.0,                       can t play any games that require a pc because you can t sign into your oculus account on a computer   i m in a loop   it prompts you to sign into facebook  you sign into facebook  it prompts you to sign into your oculus account  repeat  repeat   wanna watch someone play on your phone screen   it says you can do it with your oculus account   only problem  you get on the same exact sign in loop   if you re thinking you wouldn t merge your facebook account to your oculus  wrong   it requires you to   facebook is more concerned with mining our data than giving us a good game system   i m not even going to attempt to describe my utter disgust with this system   according to reddit  ppl have been having this problem for since the product was released  and customer support has no answer   how hard could it be to let me sign into the oculus account i m required to setup to use the headset      
91,1.0,                       got this for my    year old as bd gift  just to learn it requires a facebook account  exposing my kid to social media jungle  hell no   returning this garbage back just because of this  will never buy this brand again in a million years with these odd requirements  this is the last thing my family needs oculus and zuckerberg can kiss my business goodbye       
92,1.0,                       i am a vr enthusiast   i own most of the mainline vr headsets  vive  vive pro  index  quest    cosmos  and play vr a  ton this headset is an atrocity to the fundamental rights to ownership of your hardware imagine if being blocked by facebook disabled every device you own   all your computers  game consoles  monitors tvs  controllers  phones  headsets  all movies  music  and apps you have ever purchased   this is the future we will all live in if people allow travesties like this vr headset to thrive   do not buy this unless this is the future you want to encourage facebook has the power to block ban deny you an account for any reason they see fit and even revoke your ability to use your device you paid for   even though i haven t done anything wrong  i am one of those people that has been denied   if your device account gets banned and you re outside the return window  you re sol and have a multi hundred dollar brick on your hands   good thing i was able to return my device  thanks  amazon    i encourage everyone that owns a quest   to return their device   this is unacceptable i don t care if your kid wants this for their birthday   if you want a decent future for your children  you will not buy this for them if we live in a future where some power hungry  greedy  malicious company like facebook is allowed to control the lives of people in this way  we are damning ourselves to a future of subservience and slavery   giving up rights is a slippery slope also  the first one i received had charging issues   after i opened it from the box  and it shoved an update down my throat i put the headset down and went away  came back much later in the day and it was dead   plugged it up  and it was weird with charging   i could get it to turn on sometimes but it wouldn t go above a few percent and kept discharging   i made an exchange and the second one i got all the way to needing to sign up for a facebook account and facebook refused to allow me to have an account   there are no people to contact to help me    it s like google s customer service   there are no people to contact  there is no support   there are only bots and computers and they will block ban you and deny you the ability to use the hardware you paid for with literally no way to contact anyone to ask why or argue    see my screenshot    we have already reviewed this decision and it can t be reversed       
93,1.0,                       had a much deserved   star review of the quest   due to the inability of getting oculus fb customer support to fix the facebook  merge  operation they conducted when registering the device   funny thing was  it appears that someone out there doesn t like those bad reviews and reported it as a violating of  amazon review standards  say what   i gave a legitimate review   anyway  here s another richly deserved   start for the quest     fact is  facebook  who own oculus  have badly mismanaged the rollout of this product   it s sad  really  because it could have been a great device given the specs   the registration and toa for this product need to be redone before i would advise anyone to buy it   also  i would be careful with the purchase of all oculus devices until the clean up their poor customer support operations      
94,1.0,                       facebook account required  not a fan     
95,5.0,                       at first i couldn t get it to sync with my phone even though i had the latest oculus app  someone suggested deleting it and installing it again  after that it showed the quest   as an option under  pair new headset  just played half life alyx streaming over wifi using virtual desktop  amazing      
96,5.0,                       let me start by saying that my first contact with vr was about   years ago with a demo of the original rift  it s impressive how far technology has come in that time the visuals are great  sure you can get much better graphics on a next gen console or gaming pc  but the experience of completely different  everyone i ve shown this loves the feeling you get and are blown away by hope immersive this is  couple that work some good headphones and you really get lost in the world if you got the chance dive in  you won t regret it  and the whole facebook thing  well i don t really use it much so i don t mind the mandatory requirement  let s have it google has to a lot more on me than facebook       
97,5.0,                       most amazing vr experience to date  the performance of the product for the consumer scale is outstanding  have used with the oculus store games and on steam  performs amazingly if the setup and environment arrangements are done properly  be sure your lighting is adequate  also  be sure when using steam or connecting to your computer with the oculus link cable  not included  that you log have the oculus software downloaded and installed  may take a while to download  and that you enable the oculus link cable when the prompt pulls up  otherwise you have to unplug the cable from the headset and plug it back in to get the prompt to pop back up  main thing is to take the time to do things properly and you won t be disappointed in the product  performance wise  this is a phenomenal headset for a decent price  also  i definitely see alot of value in the inward out tracking as opposed to systems that go outward in  movement is very fluid without any latency  hand controls are intuitive and work well with the in game functions  feels like a second set of hands after you are used to how to navigate them  be sure to use the straps for the controllers  they will save you from accidentally throwing them  screen resolution is amazing and the colors are on point  highly recommend  only downside is you must link a facebook account  just take the time during setup to block the access that you don t want to permit  of course storage must be allowed in order for it to function and run games  be sure to set your sharing parameters as well in regards to your facebook information  same as you would choose on the facebook app  overall it has not disappointed      
98,5.0,                       lighter  better visuals and generally a good upgrade over the first quest   i added the     optional headband and find it more comfortable   if you share the quest   with anyone you ll really appreciate how easy it is to adjust   the audio isn t quite as loud as i d like  and i m an old geezer  so you might consider some earbuds   experiment with your old iphone earbuds  they work fine if you re new to vr     ignore the bad reviews from the avid gamers and get one anyway   remember the technology is new   seems to me this about like tv in the     s  amazing technological advancement  but not much to watch   even so  sometimes it s amazing how your brain will react to the illusion that you are somewhere other than your living room floor   i really had to work to  step off  a ledge in machu pichu or in an adventure game   some of the vr    videos you ll find on youtube give an incredible sense of immersion  sometimes a little creepy but a taste of what movies will become in a few decades   or months as for the privacy issues people mention  well  privacy is probably just an illusion in our modern world  anyway   but as soon as you get online you can go to settings and turn off a few things   don t let it stop you from buying this   the taste of what s to come in video is worth it alone  and traveling during the lockdown  i like the wander app  is a great break from just staying home     while you just stay home      
99,5.0,                       wow wow wow  i am so impressed with this  i had an oculus go for a while  and although the go was great  this is absolutely amazing out of the box i charged it and logged in very easily with my oculus app via facebook  fortunately i also ordered a third party elite strap from amazon ahead of time  i tried the strap that came with the quest   and it was awful  no big surprise  and i was ready for that  i don t mind having to get a better strap because it s probably keeping the price of the unit down a bit by shipping it with a cheap one the controllers are comfortable and pretty easy to use  it does get a bit confusing at first but you quickly get used to it i m not going to bore you with stating what everyone else is saying  but i can say it s an amazing unit and i will be spending many hours using it      
100,5.0,                       bought the oculus quest   after playing it over a friends house and it was amazing the first day i bought it  a friend of mine was over the night it arrived and after playing it for   minutes he bought one himself a week later another one of my friends came by  played it and purchased right after they got off the game  since i purchased it i played it every day except two hella tiring  in a good way  i love it so far i love the fact that it allows you to draw your boundary on the floor so you can play in just about any size room the downside  the battery life is about   hours  other than that it s a hell of a lot of funi ve purchased   apps so far   super hot  a mission impossible training game   racket  nx  a     degree racquetball experience   fitxr  a fitness app  i ve done boxing so far   i ve played beat saber  demo  and sports scramble  all amazingly fun apps workouts     
101,1.0,                       i love the product  even though facebook owns oculus  the fact you have to link your fb and oculus accounts together  and you have to use your phone  is horrible  i have a buddy who wanted to play the same game on his rift while i use the quest    he had to actually make a facebook account  download the app to his phone  the connect his new facebook account to his oculus account  and now logs into oculus with his facebook account that is a horrible business model for a gaming device  how in the hell do you expect the general public to play a gaming system that you have to jump through hoops just to play perfect gaming system  horrible pr and marketing      
102,5.0,                       i ll start with the con since it s the big turn off for a lot of people  it requires connection to a facebook account that is in good standing  that sucks  i hope that changes  but i don t see facebook letting go of that anytime soon otherwise  this thing is amazing  i got my first one back in november  and this is my first vr experience of my own ever   i got beat saber  superhot  eleven  and in death unchained  and all those games are a lot of fun  the tracking is really very good  turns out that beat saber is quite a fun game and with oculus move now  i can track some loose fitness goals in games  that s cool too  battery life is very good for the way i like to play        minutes at a time  so i can do a couple of sessions over a couple of days before i have to charge again  i think it s about a two hour battery life total  maybe a bit more  the controllers are comfortable and seem to be well made  the headset isn t too heavy and the three eye separation settings seem to cover the ranges well enough   i m a    my wife is a     overall  this setup is pretty incredible value if you don t mind the facebook requirement  definitely recommend if you know someone interested in stepping into vr  the price is perfectly well justified for it being wireless and  quite frankly  just a smooth  fun experience      
103,5.0,                       i got this for my daughter for christmas but i set it up with my fb account  i was not on facebook previously  i do have   different email accounts  two are primary depending on where i use them  the others are backups like came free from my isp  so i signed up to facebook with one of my other accounts  then connected it to my daughter s ipad  not a phone  pairing it with a mobile device gives you the ability to view what the person playing the game is seeing  you can also browse games and make purchases in the app it s a ton of fun and quickly became popular among the family  now i ordered a second one but direct from oculus since no one has them in stock and i m not willing to pay twice as much money to a third party here  we can wait a month      
104,5.0,                       i tried a couple of headsets a while back  and was consistently underwhelmed  yes the sense of height and all that was incredible  and of course i saw the potential  but for a reasonably decent experience you had to be tethered to a pc  and it was always a bit of a wrestling match   not ready for prime time  was always my assessment that s over  over  this device is next level beyond belief  after being wowed by the home menus and so forth  i checked out a bunch of the freebie immersive animations  videos  etc  very cool  a big step forward  but i again thought   is this it   if it is this device will be gathering dust in a couple of months  so  i said let me check out a premium pay for option  i played  the room  as my first game purchase  i had actually played one the room games on my ipad and enjoyed it  so eh why not for two hours i did nothing but say  oh my god   my wife got so sick of hearing me that she said let me see     i put the headset on her  told her a couple of basic things  and she was off and running  same reaction  oh my god   oh   my   god    i am on the holodeck  i am actually on the holodeck   the immersive totality exceeded my expectations in every way  sure  you re dealing with a big thing strapped to your head  and after a while you do find yourself adjusting it a lot  you eventually learn it s not supposed to sit on your nose  it s supposed to sit on your cheek bones  which not only makes it more comfortable  it makes the view clearer   i m hoping the premium head strap thing cleans that up aside from that  i could go on and on  even the sound quality kicks ass   some criticize it for not having earbuds  i think that might be a good thing   the isolation would be so complete you d be completely unaware of your surroundings  which could be dangerous   and that was only with one game  some demos  and some casual exploring of the overall capability  there are apps that let you share your computer screen and work in a virtual space that other people can join and collaborate in  it is astonishing and i m going to try that out today  i m a coder techie guy by trade  folks  unless you are some kind of vr prima donna  i absolutely assure you that quality vr for the masses has arrived  the device is an astonishing  next level triumph  i ve been into video games for    years  even dabbled in development  and envisioned this experience  thinking maybe one day before i die i might see a piece of it if this is where it s at now  then fully immersive holodecks are really just a handful of engineering challenges now  in twenty years i have little doubt you ll be able to put some device in the middle of your room  turn it on  and get this experience next  objects that you can place in your playfield that you can physically interact with  simple cubes and spheres that look like rocks  animals  anything  the controllers already do it  in  the room   if you set the controllers on the ground and step away  you see a pair of leather gloves lying on the floor  your hands   you just walk over and pick them up again  on and on i could go  astonishing  well done oculus      
105,3.0,                       the first thing you ll notice is the new controllers are fat and awkward to hold  it doesn t hold like a gun  even though there is a trigger   and it doesn t hold like a stick  it s also big and round  forcing you to always grip it in an awkward way the default head strap setup is definitely a major downgrade from before  the nylon just clips my ears and always rubs against it  it s also much harder in this new design to quickly adjust the tightness pros    new processor  though you won t notice any difference if using oculus link or with current games     higher resolution  this is more of a minor upgrade since it s not a monumental leap in resolution     despite the an attempt to cut costs  it s a good value for what it does in terms of vr cons   no oled  black scenes are a very very bright gray    fat awkward controllers that will definitely reduce your competitiveness in beat saber   facebook login is required  even if you had an oculus account  and you lose your paid purchase if your account is banned    really bad battery life   only   ipd adjustment levelsoverall this is a good entry level vr headset that s about     of the way of something more expensive like the valve index  but facebook is definitely trying to target cheap and accessible rather than premium experience      
106,1.0,                       can t say much about the headset  i tried to update the software  as instructed  and that was enough to break the headset  here s to hoping their support will be able to solve the issue or else i ll just get a refund from amazon edit  oculus couldn t figure out the issue but thankfully amazon refunded me without issue      
107,3.0,                       i regretted buying this as soon as i got it it was super exciting  new  and just baffling for a first experience in vr  although it was my first experience i had done a lot of research before making a decision to go through with buying it  my specific reasons for returning it are not generalized and are more specific to my situation and person  i am prone to tension headaches in the head and the pressure that the headset applies to my face and the weight  i ll be it very light weight  it applies to my next muscles just calls for a headache  trying multiple different methods of adjusting the headset didn t help either  i was still struggling to enjoy my experience while playing  i played a variety of games from vrchat to echovr to pavlov  all very fun in their own sense but in my case i was unable to fully enjoy them for more than an hour before i couldn t tolerate the strain on my head  i am almost sure that most other people won t have as much of an issue with it as i did since i am prone to tension headaches  the strap is also quite uncomfortable and displeasing to wear for long periods of time  i definitely recommend  if you really want this vr  that you get the     strap by oculus or their other battery strap  that can also double as a counter weight on the back of your head to release some of the strain on your neck by all means i don t think vr is terrible or anything like that  it s a great experience  but unfortunately i seem to be unable to fully enjoy it without feeling some type of discomfort  my nose kept getting tickled by the nose cut out on the headset as well  only a small gripe but it was obnoxious  i kept having to readjust and my cheeks  jaw  and facial muscles felt stiff and ached during and after my vr sessions  i really wished i could ve had nicer things to say about this vr headset but i simply didn t enjoy my experience with it i think i d like to leave off on a positive note here  this vr headset is an insane value for your money       for an entry level vr headset that can double as a dedicated vr headset with high resolution specs  who could complain about that  i wouldn t  but i did  and that s why you ve read this far     by all means pick one of these headsets up and give it a try  amazon s super chill about returns on these and i had zero problems doing so  so why not  give it a shot and see if you like it      
108,1.0,                       an out of box experience from    years ago   horrible manual process to type information   to create a facebook account to even use the device  you have to jump through a ton of hoops   to use steam vr games  the games on the oculus store are a joke  you need to either run a cable or do remote desktop vr   do not buy this garbage      
109,3.0,                       nearly everything about this new iteration of the quest is a massive improvement  from the beefy processor to the economic price tag   however  a major issue i have is just how slim they made the headpiece   be very wary if you have glasses because the headset facepiece is always getting caught around my glasses  something that never happened with my rift s   it has made an otherwise glowing device slightly dull by comparison   disappointing  to say the least   you can have a great tech device but if its a pain the ass to put on and take off and is uncomfortable  is it really all that great      
110,5.0,                       the fifth star is for price let s compare to quest original q  wins screen blacknesspupillary distance adjustmentcross buy with some go appscomes with a decent strapq  wins everything else higher resolutionscreen door effect almost gonebetter processor can do better graphics more comfortable controllersmore accurate controllersmore memorylighteri could probably go on the real trade offs are the strap and the screen let s face it  oculus never understood comfort   this is the most comfortable one yet   wireless and reasonably light   you can get a better strap   people got better straps for their q s too the screen trades blackness but gains resolution and the screen door grid from q  is gone   ok it s  barely  there but the other issues that are in both headsets are far worse i don t count the ipd adjustment as a big deal but maybe i m lucky with my head size   honestly i was never satisfied with the q  and was always fiddling with itoculus quest   is an excellent device  especially for the price it s not perfect in any way and there will certainly be better in a few years but it s fun      
111,2.0,                       while boasting better visuals  for what i can see  it s too much of a downgrade in comfort for me to score any higher  the facial interface is the biggest problem asides from the poor ipd slider  the less foam  more hard plastic pales in comparison to the quest   s as i can fit my glasses in fine and adjust it perfectly on my face  however unless a new facial interface just like the quest   is produced it causes my face pain and makes it difficult to enjoy the experience and due to max ipd being    which i could use on my quest   quite comfortably with the facial interface being very accomadating i cannot see but a little in one of my eyes before blurriness occurs while only one eye can see just about right i really was more hopeful about this but i honestly if i still can return it i would and buy another quest one as the screen door effect can be dealt with  this discomfort on my face can not and i can not help having to have glasses and a large head      
112,2.0,                       very good visual fidelity and all wireless is convenient  otherwise worse in almost every way from my first gen wired rift headset the three ipd adjustments was a poor choice to cheap out on  it gives a poor experience to many because you can t dial it in just right  the tracking sucks in non ideal conditions  it regularly misses hits in beatsaber that are really close to your body  it also does not work in the dark which i had no problems with on my first gen and a virtual movie theater the internet and facebook requirements are awful and set the landscape for a scary future  i think the hardware in here is really impressive  but there are too many negatives that caused me to get rid of this headset      
113,3.0,                       i was so excited for this product  having played with a friend s quest   also  many of my friends play supernatural and i thought it would be a fun way to work out during the pandemic   i was so disappointed to finally put the headset on and discover that everything but the text directly in front of me was blurry  no matter which ipd setting  how i positioned it on my face  with or without glasses spacer  i don t wear glasses   etc   i want to love it  but i can t justify keeping such an expensive product for such a sub par visual experience update   i have been able to improve the blurriness of the product significantly but at additional expense  first  i ordered the elite headstrap  which helped keep the oculus from moving on my face   i also purchased a wide facial interface       in additional costs  and i have a product that isn t perfect  but has helped me workout  play games  and stay sane during stressful covid         
114,5.0,                       while i m sad facebook bought this company and forces you to link an account in order to use the hardware  the hardware itself is just amazing i bought this as a gift after experiencing the headset for myself  and the recipient is loving it  not only can you use the headset standalone  plug it into your computer with any usb c cable for use with games on steam or other platforms  but there are even ways to wirelessly link the headset to your computer i would like a worthy competitor to enter the space so i could protest the forced facebook inclusion by supporting the other guy  but they would have some large shoes to fill if they want to compete  can t help but give it     stars because i was floored by how good this vr experience is prior to this i had configured some experiences on a samsung galaxy   gear vr  the htc vive  htc vive pro  the original oculus quest  and i personally own the oculus rift cv   this headset gave me the best experience compared to any of those  hands down  i only say that it beats the vive pro due to the pain of setting up the entire room for using it  which i had to do repeatedly   abandoning base stations was a move in the right direction for personal vr experiences  and the value you get for the price with these is just incredible if i had to complain  i feel like the shape of the head strap does put a little bit more weight on the bridge of your nose than it should  that s part of the draw of upgrading to the  elite strap   which i have not personally tested      
115,5.0,                       pros  this is a big advancement from the previous quest  the display is amazing and the tracking is just a tad better than the previous quest  the price is great for what you get  battery life is decent but the controller battery life is best of any  everything functions well and the side loading is just as easy as ever  cons  the head strap that s the biggest thing  the head strap will rub and start to hurt especially around the ear  also if you have long or thick hair it likes to grab and pull a bit  the elite strap easily replaces this but then that s another expense but we ll worth it  the other con is the face pad  i have sensitive skin and the face pad made a red ring around my face after the first hour and i had a massive breakout that stayed for about a week  to prevent this i took an extra leather face pad from my quest   and ripped the foam off the quest   and used a soft flexible stretchy glue to adhere the leather pad directly on the bracket for the quest       
116,1.0,                       oh man  i wish i could get that         back   poor quality images   bulky   poor content   it s a doorstop      
117,5.0,                       i have a lot of experience in gaming but pretty much new to vr   i ve been waiting for the tech to advance before  i decided to get on board   for       i didn t think i would be losing to much to give this unit a try   first impressions  after using it for a few days     i am impressed   i tend to suffer from motion sickness easily  so i was a little worried  but so far no issues with that   i m still exploring the content out there and checking out some games  but what i ve seen so far it s been great   i can see a great potential in the future of vr   the gaming and educational possibilities are endless   as for this unit  it is very easy to use  especially for someone like me with no vr experience   the battery doesn t last too long  so i already ordered the extended battery w  headstrap   that s the other issue  starts to wear on the head a little after prolonged use   i m hoping the updated headstrap will help with that   lots of fun so far  i look forward to the future of this      
118,4.0,                       i bought this as an upgrade for my oculus go  system wise  it is an upgrade  however software wise it is  so far  lacking in the software department  because they decided not to allow access to previous oculus libraries  i knew this going in and convinced myself the fact that i would be able to steam link my oculus to my pc would make up for it    still waiting on a cable  i ve re bought a few games off the oculus store and they are enjoyable with the new control scheme  but still there is not really any reason to rush in and buy a system until there are more apps and games available      
119,5.0,                       this item is fantastic  whether   or      it allows you to transform yourself into a place where you could imagine anything possible  we downloaded rollercoasters to ride   granddaughter has walked on the moon  beat saber has us doing exercise and dancing  you can interact with your friends and family who are in other homes  it helps you connect the fear of flying as there are classes  i have sailed the caribbean  we have been to the north pole and walk the plank    this is simply the most wonderful new invention and fun family treasure   a definitely must buy for      and beyond     
120,3.0,                       there are probably many reviewers here have given valuable comments and opinions already  and i don t need to repeat all of them   i owned the first gen of oculus quest  and just bought a new quest    i just want to briefly share my quick feedbacks and comparisons here pros   better video resolutions and quality  headset is lighter than previous quest  the graphic and performance feels smoother due to faster cpucons   facebook account required to activate  this is a big deal to me  and my friends were all criticize it    fb will collect and share your data to  rd parties   let s assume your fb account got suspended or banned due to whatever reasons  your quest  will turn into a brick   i managed to find a way to bypass facebook account by installing an older version of the oculus app on android phone   check out youtube how to   quest  came with only a short  ft usb c cable   this is ridiculous as it s not helpful when the battery runs low while i m still in the game   my previous quest came with   ft usb c cable   what s oculus thinking      
121,1.0,                       great product  terrible business model  if your facebook account is banned  so is your oculus  shame on facebook  returning it      
122,4.0,                       got the quest   today  so far impressions are pretty good  really nice build quality and visual performance also purchased the elite head strap but it will be arriving   days later as well as the logitech earbuds things to note    the fabric strap was actually pretty comfortable  no issues with my ears getting in the way like i ve heard some reviewers complaining about  had to tighten top strap quite a bit due to slack  i am an asian        and    lbs for best reference so maybe my head isn t that big  ipd was  nd setting as well    the stock face plate is foam padded  i can see this wearing out fast  also getting sweaty and was certainly hot even after  hr of use  might get an aftermarket one    could definitely see out the nose hole  might be because my face is smaller  not sure  don t notice it much when in an app however    the unit after  hr got hot to the touch on the exterior  kind of hot like in cell phone left in car in the summer  but not in direct sunlight  not sure if this is normal    sound is actually not bad from the speakers  others can hear you though especially since you need it at max level to really enjoy it at a tolerable level  so highly recommend headphones of some kind    overall pretty satisfied  just hope this will last with no issues  battery does barely last  hrs like everyone says it does    just a side note  bought an anti fatigue mat to use while standing  think it greatly helps when playing for traction and comfort hope this helps people      
123,4.0,                       my kids love it  s  t  i love it too  it is something new  dats for sure  only thing i didn t like about it  is da short charging cord and dats dat i read a review on it n supposedly da cord was longer den da older oculus  so dat old cord must ve been really short  dats a takeaway  also  wish there could have been more research on it and long term effects it could cause on a young development of a kids mind  so dats y i have to mitigate my kids schedules and make sure they do not use it longer den   mins per use    times a day  and f u have kids u kno how difficult and responsible dat becomes        
124,5.0,                       this product is amazing  i no longer have to leave my house to go on adventures  there s no wasting time driving to and from places  no fees per entrance  it s just strap in an go  the lens needs some getting used to  and finding that optical sweet spot at first can be a little tricky  but once it s found it s just smooth sailing  the future of vr technology thanks to this innovative company is looking great there s currently some controversy with the required facebook account though  personally i think the worry about the privacy is a little over hyped  but i also understand the concern  if i put myself in facebook s shoes  i d actually do the same thing to prevent users from sharing a game en masse like netflix being shared  which is a problem for streaming services in general  i mean  after all  facebook has already established preventative measures for fake accounts and vr is still in it s infancy  we wouldn t want the vr industry to be killed because developers can t make money now right      
125,1.0,                       i never get headaches  these were extreme pains on both sides of my brain which is no surprise considering how much data is wirelessly being sent directly adjacent to my head    i ordered an emf  hood   silver lined  basically a tin foil hat  today in hopes that it helps  never had a problem with emf  also was never a big fan of the whole smart phone thing so apparently i m sensitive to these things now  other than that i love it  i m impressed  but i m giving it one star because it s owned by a cia controlled communist chinese puppet  mark zuckerburg and he requires you to have a facebook account  i used a  jailbreak  loophole and signed up as an oculus  developer  and have full access to everything  i would have used my fb account but my fb account was permanantely banned   years ago because i had a facebook group with         people and it was pro trump  so that s where we re at now    looking forward to seeing fb being brought down eventually      
126,5.0,                       excellent product cons heavy    can get very hot on your face  blurry even with the eye adjustments  glasses extender does not work  a friend of mine tried it out and it didn t allow enough clearance   high price point  some games can cause motion sickness pros literally everything else  extremely easy set up  great interface  wireless  decent picture quality  great speakers  sleek design  lightweight hand controllers with excellent design  easy to adjust strap  link cable  not included  allows you to have the same experiences through steam as the rift model  and with the help of a really long hdmi the whole family can feel as if they are mining with you  when wearing the vr you are no longer in a living room  it is extremely immersive and addictive  i have high hopes for the future generations of this vr line      
127,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          if you re debating on whether or not to get this or a switch or something  get this  you won t be disappointed  i have a very nice gaming pc and have a very nice high refresh monitor  so some would say i enjoy the finer things in life  this my friend is the next step in gaming or even just immersion into what we have come to in our generation now  completely blown away  i got the lower   gb version expecting to rely more on my pc but boy was i wrong  it s more powerful then i could have imagined and if you don t have a powerful pc like me and want the vr experience alone with a lot of perks that other headsets don t havego ahead and get it  very very happy happy with what i received  even after watching numerous videos i could never have been ready for what this shows you technology has come to ps  hilarious when you show other  older people  literally the home menus and are completely blown away like you were  tears      
128,1.0,                       this unit is not what they advertise it to be  too many corners cut makes for a tough vr experience    it is too heavy to workout with  my wife is small and this unit created terrible neck strain even with a battery pack strapped to the back for balance  it dug into my nose and cheek bones rather hard no matter how we adjusted it    the lenses are blurry and cannot be properly adjusted  sliding them closer or father apart helps only a little  i have binoculars from      with adjustable lenses  just saying    media resolution is lousy  games are nowhere near detailed enough and videos are so blurry they ll make your eyes water  and yes  i installed the bracket for wearing glasses but saw only marginal improvement  the media is low resolution    limited library of available content  what is available is juvenile in the extreme    chromecasting ultra is really needed to get any sort of decent video casting from the headset to a television    some apps don t allow chromecasting  you won t know until you buy them because the store s description of the app won t tell you    if the unit doesn t feel the face pressure it expects  it turns off and corrupts your game   repeatedly  if you look down at your feet  you decrease face pressure because gravity pulls the unit toward the ground  it s like wearing a diving mask to keep that pressure strong enough    changing who is wearing the device requires completely exiting a game first or it will shut off and corrupt the game  there is no  pause  feature to prevent such a thing from happening    most games won t let you lie down and play  if you re disabled  forget it  that s not a flaw with the unit     if you ve never been in vr before  it s really amazing for about    minutes until your eyes start to burn  water  and blur or a headache starts  i was able to build up my tolerance to about    minutes with    minute breaks  not really immersive for a hardcore gamer like me     i have boxed the unit back up in its original packaging and printed the rma label  makes me sad  i really tried to like it      
129,1.0,                       i never get on facebook   i don t like facebook   i got my vr goggles  surprise   i need a facebook account   and now trying to setup a facebook account and all of a sudden it s telling me for security  i have to send in some id  photo or other item for them to review before i can log in to face book which is required to use my vr i just purchased for over           i m a person who firmly believe that the more information you place on the web the more chances you are of being a target of fraud and mischief   facebook need to make this a chose and not have people forced to login to facebook and provide them personal items   if this is how they contact business for consumer products  they need to be broken up into separate companies   i should not need to provide such items to them when i m not interested in social media     period        
130,1.0,                       i was an original rift kickstarter backer  i ve used all but one generation of the headset since then  developed enterprise content for oculus products and been an evangelist for vr and oculus as a company  the quest   is an impressive  fantastic device   when it is working  that last part is important i had the misfortune of having issues crop up with my headset several months into use  i am unsure if these are due to a software update  i suspect that they are not  my experience with oculus support has been so terrible that i would warn anyone considering purchasing their products to consider my support experience as part of their purchase decision first i searched several forums including reddit and oculus  forums before trying to contact oculus support  they have a support page  but it has very little information available  instead you have to engage with their support bot through a chat window you can request to speak to a human being through the bot  i spoke to several  all at the same support tier  in spite of clearly stating my issue and the headset i was using at various points i was given answers for a rift headset  different product   oculus link pc issues  not related to my problem  i clearly stated i wasn t using link and was using native apps   the unhelpful  confused responses i received from representatives ranged from repeat suggestions on things i had said were not related  like oculus link  to blatant falsehoods not helping matters is the fact that the oculus chat will disconnect you from a representative on mobile if the chat window loses focus  even for a second  after over an hour of trying to get help and     support reps giving unhelpful suggestions i asked to be elevated to a higher support tier instead of elevating directly to another support tier in the chat window  oculus support instead e mails you and you have to reply to the email to theoretically get help  this e mail is a form e mail asking you to restate your problem  if you respond you will get an identical form e mail in response  sometimes two  i have received no less than    of these e mails over a period of   days  after four days of no human responses i received two somewhat conflicting human responses  both form like in content and both telling me that support would help answer questions at some point in the future  maybe   days  maybe    when i emailed to let them know that their own stated time limit had expired i got the standard  automated form e mail as response there is no phone number to call for oculus support  this is the experience  if you have a very basic problem  e g  the headset won t turn on  they may be able to help you in a timely manner personally i do not have time to deal with the wall of garbage that oculus offers up as a support experience  their customers  time and patience appears to have zero value to them  this is a fundamentally disrespectful way to interact with customers and oculus facebook should not be rewarded for it with sales      
131,5.0,                       one of my best entertainment gadget i ever bought   i almost give up this gadget because it gave me  dizziness  but after changing the  strap to adjustable oculus elite strap          my wife and me enjoyed this gadget so much  we used it mainly for watching traveling vr since we are getting old and semi retired  i cannot express how incredible this gadget is  a lot of free vr in youtube      and      and even watching movie in amazon prime and netflix   the theater environment experience  now i can enjoy thousands of activities that i will never be able to enjoy before  free sky falling  under ocean  northen aurora lights  seeing penguin in antartica  machu pichu  jerusalem  bethelhem  london  paris   and more  i can even record the scenes and take pictures in the  wander  apps  don t  buy the national geographic apps  it is not worth it   only   places to explore   you rather enjoy the free traveling vr tv in youtube and oculus tv   it also has browser to let you browse the internet just like your computer   i don t mind that it needs facebook account  just open a new one and set all privacies  thank you oculus and our lord  god jesus christ  you had my our lives worth it to live      
132,1.0,                       took me a few hours to set it up since i had to create several facebook accounts  it doesn t even let me play the games in my library  it is heavier and less comfortable than the rift s  will return immediately  not what expected      
133,1.0,                       don t buy this   wait or look at another vendor s offerings oculus pms and gms should have listened to those engineers and focus group customers that said that this was designed poorly  waited to release it and gone back to the drawing board  or cad program    the battery doesn t belong on the user s face   it should have been put on the back of the head because the weight of the headset is all on the forehead and cheekbones   i tried a few solutions to this  including wearing a bump cap underneath with a string lifting the weight from the side arms  getting an upgraded  aftermarket solid strap  face pads etc   nothing relieved the weight without causing the headset to move around while i was playing not all of us have a beautifully bulb shaped skull  so you can t rely solely on the strap to cradle your head i have a rift also   i can play for hours in the unit   i can only stand the quest for about    minutes      
134,4.0,                       there s a lot of things about the oculus that i can rave on about  i ll start with the pros  when you start it up  after initial set up  you create a barrier or guardian  for while you re on vr  the psvr doesn t have this  so you will bump into things during usage  there s a lot of great apps with the oculus that are a lot of fun  i hope more will be added soon  everything that was wrong with the oculus quest    was fixed with the    there s this great option where you can share your experience on a mobile device  my kids like watching me do beat saber on multiplayer it s quite user friendly  even for me who isn t the most tech savvy now the cons  the head strap doesn t fit well  and getting the elite head gear costs extra  battery life is only about    hours you have to pair the oculus with your facebook account  i don t really like this  because if something happens to your facebook account  you get locked out of your oculus  and it becomes a worthless piece of junk aside from those things  the oculus quest   is affordable and has a lot of options for games and other apps to explore and immerse yourself in to get the full vr experience update  after using the oculus for about a month now  all the glitches people have been talking about are now starting to occur the glitchy defect right controller the tracking can t really keep up when i play beat saber on some of the faster maps  i thought by upping it from   hz to   hz  the problem would be resolved i still dealt with glitches from the right controller  the saber would just float away  or stop working i d recommend a more robust system if you re a serious gamer  or looking to go into expert mode on beat saber  the oculus quest   is good for casual play      
135,1.0,                       same complaint as everybody else  i didn t want to create a facebook account but what the hell  so i merged it with my oculus account and i m banned immediately  i have had this thing since the day of release and have not been able to use it  have received no response from oculus on what to do  i ve bought every piece of oculus hardware but this is it for me      
136,5.0,                       thrilled with my oculus     i highly recommend it   the graphics are great   fun experience   you only need what s in the box   nothing else   no computer  just the headset and two hand controllers   you can bring it anywhere and set it up for hours of fun with friends   you can also cast to a tv so people can see what the player is seeing love the shooter games   beat saber is really good exercise   i m always sweaty and breathing heavy when i m done i got the less expensive one  i m not a gamer so the   gb is perfect for me   it does get a little uncomfortable on my head after playing for a long time  the oculus   came with a different strap that holds the headset in place more comfortably   clearly they changed is so they could make the oculus   less expensive   an upgraded strap similar to the one on the original is available but it is      which is steep for a couple of pieces of plastic also  i ordered and returned the oculus   case that is made by oculus   you can see my review on that        cheaply made  and didn t provide good protection   i m still looking for a good  economical case option i highly recommend this to anyone who wants to get a vr headset   it does not disappoint  plus you don t need anything except what comes in the box   that s the best part   you can also watch immersive vr videos and movies   or just watch movies on it and feel like you re in a theatre looking at a giant screen      
137,5.0,                       motion tracking   amazingcontrollers   durable  i accidentally dropped mine multiple times onto concrete headset   small  comfortable  and durable with around   hours of battery life  your eyes don t need anymore than that and you can also charge it while playing if you have the right extension cords you can adjust the eyesight to fit people with glasses and it worked for everyone in my house there are a variety of games and a test game so you know what you re doing  i bough superhot  job simulator  and walking dead  saints and sinnersi highly recommend buying superhot and job simulator first  as they are simple games and good introductions  my family loved playing job simulator as well the games are super cool  i love walking dead vr  its just too much fun  if you want you can connect this to a pc  as long as it can handle good games  and then play some games that aren t on the oculus quest   yet and are on steam just so you know  you need a facebook account to sign up  you do not need a phone to play  just to set it up  if you re worried about privacy  or getting banned and losing all your games  then create a fake account like me  i created just some random account and stored my stuff on there  no privacy problems           
138,2.0,                       i can t seem to find a good ipd setting  unsure if it s related or not  but the lens have concentric rings in them  not saying that s the problem  the problem is that i can always see light halos reflecting off of some of those rings within my screen field of view  therefore  there s a halo effect during every second of playtime  which becomes exceptionally distracting to the point of me quitting whatever it is i m doing because i can t stand it any longer  not even sure that i won t just send this back for a refund at this point  i certainly don t recommend it to anyone who s on the fence      
139,3.0,                       i wanted a vr headset for the longest time but could never justify buying one if i had to be strapped to the computer  this thing is amazing  i can play my pc games in vr now but i can also go to the living room and play all the standalone oculus games with no cords attached  i didn t get the last quest because i didn t think i would like the resolution on it  the screen looks amazing on here  one major problem though is the battery life  two hours is fine for myself but when playing with other people it really sucks  i would love to get the elite strap with the extra battery on it but that is kind of hard to get at the moment since they are sold out everywhere  one other problem is that the headset does not stay charged or chrages while you are using it  this is a major problem since this will ultimately effect the battery life of the system and from what everyone is saying on the internet  will cause damage over time  hopefully there is an update for this issue in the future  i mostly use it as a standalone right now because i m scared that if i connect it to my pc to play those games in vr that while it is connected and charging that it will damage the headset  if these issues could be fixed in the future then this will most definitely be a   star review but for now the headset isn t really performing as expected      
140,5.0,                       i don t play video games  i m    and i have highschool seniors  i decided to buy a couple of these to see how they were its vr  we have playstations all over the house and i tried to get the new   with no luck like most of the rest of the population  damn bots  anyways  i m so glad i did these games are so realistic its crazy  i will more than likely buy   or   more so the whole family can have their own  if youre wondering if its worth the money it absolutely is  not the same as other vr systems way better than playstation vr    gamesyou gotta buy are walking dead saints and sinners and population one  theres other good ones but those are absolutely the best to me  but i do like games with guns in them  go buy the occulus or beg your parents to  its worth the chores and getting a on your report card  for those whose parents require that silly stuff      
141,5.0,                       i love this  this is my first vr i m happy with the price i m happy with the experience  i m currently sharing it with my son who s about to be    so i guess i m about to buy another one because i don t want to share with him it s awesome  and the games don t really cross that much they re comparable with in price to any game that i would buy him on a playstation it s great i recommend it to all my friends  usually after they try it they buy it  by the way i m    a mother and a grandmother and this is an awesome device i do not regret buying it and you re never too over to play      
142,5.0,                       i got this after wanting  and trying  several of the original vr headsets  i have always been interested in vr but the price to performance was never good enough to justify buying my own  this was until i tried my buddies quest    i then decided it was time  i ordered the quest       gb model and was not disappointed  of course the facebook thing is absolutely awful and i hate it  but i have an account that i m almost never on and i figured having one footprint in the social world wouldn t kill me  and  honestly  i ve had no issues with it to date  now i ll list some pros and cons after my first week of use pros  its a lot more comfortable than people make it out to be battery life isn t awful considering i don t use it for more than a few hours at a time  rebuff reality battery pack on the way  the display is pretty clear but my ipd is about    so that s a bummer its very light so my neck doesn t get too worn out with extended use i love the guardian system and passthrough feature controllers track really well considering the lack of lighthouse modules the user interface is really easy to use its also built like a tank  already dropped it    cons  the regular headstrap is okay definitely not as bad as people say though the controller wrist straps will not keep you from throwing them the hand tracking feature is a bit spotty and unreliable the white shell of the headset and controllers will pick up every little scuff and scratch if you hit something the foam interface will soak up sweat like nothing else so sharing with friends can be quite gross the included interface also seems to pop out quite easily after pulling it out the first time so be aware of thatconclusion i can not be happier with my purchase and the slight flaws are more than reasonable given the price  it seems you are really just paying for better hardware rather than a hefty shell  if you don t mind selling your soul to facebook  it s a great place to start       
143,4.0,                       the oculus quest   is easily a   star device hands down   i removed   star due to the facebook link  i recently commented on an agriculture facebook page that i thought an genetically altered apple was  ugly  and i was banned from facebook for    hours claiming i violated their community standards for verbal abuse  so be aware this before purchasing   because of the ban i couldn t use the quest   for    hours as i stated in the title of my review the quest   is utterly amazing  wow was the only word i have to describe my initial reaction when i first used the headset  it s great entertainment  providing you with a futuristic altered reality beyond the imagination  if you ve been to universal studios  disney or any of the orlando theme parks and went on spider man  back to the future  etc then this is for you  it tricks the mind into believing you re actually there experiencing whatever game you have to purchase  besides games youtube has a a huge virtual reality section i never new existed the devise itself is easy to setup in   minutes  youtube has several tutorials that will assist with the many features that oculus offers yes i highly recommend the oculus quest   for all age groups because it has so much to offer from physical fitness  games for all ages  youtube  netflix  the internet  television  and so much more      
144,5.0,                       i ve owned and tested    different vr headsets for my youtube channel and this is the second highest resolution i ve used  after the hp reverb pro    that list is  hp reverb pro  oculus dk   cv   rift s  go  quest    quest    htc vive  vive pro  cosmos  lenovo explorer  samsung odyssey  odyssey   pimax  k  pimax  k   osvr and psvr   so yeah  just a few short version   if you want a standing  roomscale headset for that and pc vr this is the headset you want  if you play seated vr and don t care about roomscale you want the hp reverb pro pros very clear image quality  nearly zero sde  screen door effect fantastic pricegreat game selection  with the proper usb cable play any steam vr game cons headstrap is pretty bad as you need to keep it very tight or it will  sag  on your face  so you really want the elite strap which i ll review soon facebook will be required by the end of      to even use it  but isn t quite yet faceplate material is rather scratchy and uncomfortable     
145,5.0,                       so far i m loving my new quest    it s smaller and lighter than my old quest and i ordered with the elite strap which is amazing btw in terms of comfort compared to the og quest it s soooo much better by leaps and bounds trust me you don t need to buy the elite strap with battery pack unless you want to charge it for extra playing time but if it s just for comfort the regular     elite strap is amazing no more vr face  i can play with comfort for a long time without getting those ugly marks on my face also i was thinking i would need a vr cover but the stock one is perfect  also it turns on much faster and everything loads much easier it s definitely worth it and i already had a fb account so that s never been an issue for me i got nothing to hide  also with the elite strap you can loosen up the black strap on top so it doesn t even touch your hair which is awesome if you got styled hair or what not no more squashed up vr hair lol     
146,4.0,                       i don t write a lot of reviews  but felt like i could write something that would help someone like me decide whether this is right for them and their family or not   i have two boys     and      we bought it for christmas   this was our first vr purchase and i have some friends that have other pc based systems  but that seemed too complicated for my kids to really enjoy the good it s easy to setup and pretty much gets going right out of the box   couple of free things are included to show off the capabilities   first  the graphics are decent   i ve not tried anything that requires amazing graphics  but their decent   not like a high end pc  but it feels very immersive   the hand and head tracking is amazingly spot on   it s easy to get immersed in what you re playing and you really do feel like you re in another world the battery life is fine   the first day it stayed low because we didn t want to stop and charge it   would ve been nice if the battery was full when we got it  but that s a minor annoyance   since then we ve not been in a situation where the battery died  it s outlasted us   maybe because we only play it for       minutes at a time at most  then just plug it back it the not so good the games are pretty weak   no major titles are available   the games are generally cheaper at          but i ve not been impressed by most of them   they all feel like  extended demos    the notable exception being beat saber   that s fun  but has weak multiplayer and not much of a solo campaign  so just depends on how much you like listening to the same     songs  up to about    if you buy all the extra packs  but then you re in  for about      total to the game  we ve downloaded other popular games   they have all felt really short   like     hours of playtime for       meh   vader immortal looks really cool  but it s boring  and     of the game is just watching cut scenes or slowly walking somewhere   the dojo practice is really fun  but no multiplayer and no real campaign  just killing droids and stormtroopers super hot is also fun  but same thing       hours of game play and it s       space pilot trainer is similar  shoot a bunch of things in single player we really struggled with the facebook integration thing as our kids aren t on social media   eventually we decided to skirt the rules and just attach it to my wife s facebook account  she s the only one that has one    that worked pretty easily   this brings up something kind of annoying   oculus seems totally designed to work with one person  not a family   it doesn t support different profiles or different saved games like any other game system i ve ever seen   so if someone beats a level and the other person comes in to play  they start where the other left off summary so here we are    weeks after christmas and it s pretty much just sitting in the corner now   it was definitely fun for a week or so  but the lack of compelling games is really the problem   games feel like they are written to exploit one new thing that makes them cool   super hot has it where time only moves when you do   space pirates has a nifty shield you can hide behind so we spend      on the oculus and another      or so on games   that s a lot for a week of entertainment personally  i think vr is neat  but i think that s about it   it s neat  but i don t necessarily want to be stuck standing in the middle of my room for a couple hours while i play a game   and there s only so many things you can do with hand head gestures that are compelling in a game i m glad we bought it to play around with and we had fun for the first week or two  but at this point feel like it was too expensive for what we got out of it   and i m really hesitant to spend any more money on the games because they re not worth the money just to play for a few hours   ultimately that s the killer   i find we want to play in vr  but don t want to play any of the games we have  and nobody  including my kids  wants to spend their money on any more of the games that are available so i would recommend to everyone out there to wait until major game companies start to release titles on vr   that s probably the time to jump in and spend the money      
147,2.0,                       tied hard to facebook  over priced  unless you just must have or got money to burn      
148,1.0,                       this is a fantastic product but facebook forcing me to participate in their social network to use a vr product makes a   star product a   star experience      
149,1.0,                       can t speak to anything else but thought someone else might like to know that before they buy it      
150,5.0,                       this is honestly a amazing headset  sure its not the fanciest in some areas but its amazing price and unparalleled ability to play games not only wirelessly and without a pc is amazing some people might be turned off by the requirement of facebook but  even though i am not a fan of facebooks previous conduct related to data privacy  the fact of the matter is that if you use amazon  mastercard  or google  that s not going to do anything  companies sell data to each other all the time  and if your strategy was just not using facebook it isn t going to work anyways      
151,2.0,                       as per amazon s request i shall focus on my experience with this product only and ignore any shipping issues packaging    the product s packaging is pleasing to the eye and opens up fairly easily   yet curiously the debris under the shrink wrap detracted from the unboxing experience of the product inside the box   the device itself seemed to be carefully placed along with the controllers and a small box containing power adapter and the instructions   very nice except for scratches on the plastic that are very visible   also in the interior of the hmd cleaning  i feel that due to the very likely possibility of this being a used product   i need to clean it to avoid contracting any possible eye or dermal infection yet i could not find clear instructions about how to remove the foam spunge part of the visor and i would probably have to purchase a cover to that effect which would cost me more money use   for now i am not able to put it on an use it because as i ve said   i need to clean it first  will update later overall   so far its a disappointing product which also a appears to be a possible disease vector   box could use better sealing and tamper proofing   and its a pity because i ve seen users online which seem to really enjoy this product  maybe they got lucky with better quality control      
152,4.0,                       i have the oculus quest   oculus quest    both are great but for the facebook requirementalso can not be used if the user of the unit is under    as this is the minimum age requirement for the terms of service creating an account with false info is a violation of facebook terms of service  this includes accounts registered on the behalf of someone under    if the mandatory  linked facebook account gets suspended the device become non functional   if  the account is deleted you also forever loose any and all games do you have purchased      
153,1.0,                       i tested a friend s oculus rift and thought it was the best thing ever  the image quality was very clear and was amazed by the overall performance i looked on amazon and noticed the newest version of oculus was being released and decided to make the big purchase of oculus quest   it has been a great disappointment  the text comes in crystal clear  but everything else is blurry  i become slightly dizzy and have to stop after    minutes i ve read many trouble shooting blogs regarding this common problem and nothing works  i am learning more from various online reviews that this is a persistent problem with this specific model i would recommend buying a different model that has a proven track record  now i have a very expensive paper weight      
154,4.0,                       i started with a psvr and transitioned to a launch rift s   at the time  i passed on the quest just because i wanted the best vr experience   i played around with it yesterday and i think this quest   is pretty amazing although i think they might have gone just a little too far with the compromises for starters  the screen looks crisp and sharp and it s pretty amazing that they fit all this tech in such a small device   i played beat sabre and it was honestly just as good as on my pc rift s  but actually better considering there are no more wires   other games like  until you fall  were so much better to play without a wire as is  superhot   robo recall and saints and sinners even if the graphics are downgraded   it s worth the trade off i was prepared to hate the audio but it s serviceable for what it is   your best experience is to throw on a good set of headphones  but working out to beat sabre is more than adequate with the speakers   i was presently surprisednow on to the slight issues and suggestions i guess  i d say that if you have a pc and can tolerate wires  the rift s is right now the best value for the money  playing wireless does make a huge difference  but at the same time properly managed wires with a pulley system and cord extensions work so well you will rarely notice them outside of specific games where you start to have slight issues is that the headset is affordable  but with all the extras you ll need to buy  again  it may be a better value to buy a rift s and wait for the next version of the quest  the headstrap is very weak so you will need to purchase the elite strap   that adds another    bucks  it s worth the money but the headset still doesn t feel as comfortably as the rift s   if you do want to connect to a computer  the official oculus link is a whooping    dollars which seems flat out absurd to me   if you have glasses  even with the spacer in the quest    your glasses are dangerously close to the lens and you might scratch you glasses and lenses which would be a huge huge cost   so you will probably need to buy lens inserts  the rift s is absolutely perfect for glasses  there s plenty of room between lenses but this doesn t seem to be the case on the quest  for the quest  be sure to buy the lens protector rings that clip onto the lens and protect you from expensive scratches   carrying cases and battery packs are also going to be extra costs   the subtraction of the ipd slider also seems like a critical setback and they removed the nice cloth lining which would have been nice to keep on i get what they were trying to do   they worked hard to get the cost down to an incredible place but i almost wish there could have been a pro model that was a little higher end so i m not saying the headset isn t amazing and excellent  i m just saying if you have even a moderately decent pc and a play space you may want to get a little more life out of the rift since it s been discontinued and is on its way out   use that for a couple years and go for the next quest model if you don t have a pc or you want a stand alone device i can t stress enough how awesome this thing is   it really impressed me  i just think they might have went a bit too far with the compromises     
155,5.0,                       i ve owned the original vive and this is a huge upgrade  the tracking  resolution  size  weight  and quality are all amazing for the price  being fully wireless and portable makes this such a huge advancement over pc tethered headsets  it also has an excellent microphone which is great for games like vrchat  if it s financially possible for you i do highly recommend the elite strap  with battery   and the link cable  the battery drains quickly  around   hours play  and the link cable will allows you more performance when it s needed      
156,5.0,                       i m over    and for the most part hate gaming as i think it s a huge waste of time and causing our youth to lose any sense of creativity among many other things  when my fianc  came home and said she had a played it at a friends home and it was incredibly fun and a good workout i decided to buy one for her  she s got to play once lol  omg it s such a blast and i m so sore   days later from the workout i got  i purchased beat saber and a boxing game  what a true workout as i boxed like i was in a real ring with an opponent and i whipped him good too  lol  my dad was a boxer so i was raised with a few good combinations and know how to shuffle my feet  then i took a tour to dubai and went t clubbing in tokyo  they mix a drink and set it in front of you and it s so realistic   d  you wanna pick the drink up  it has a calorie counter and i set my goal at     just for starters  playing beat saber and ind of dancing to the music as i played hans solo i burned     calories in matter of minutes  trust me your never to old to enjoy something this cool  you can even surf the web on it  it s like having a big     screen floating in front of you  buy it    you won t regret it  i also advise getting some face coverings because you ll sweat so much  if you want too and play the games   too much fun for sure  there s a learning curve if your not a gamer and i learn a little more each time i use it  haven t really found a manual but i m more of a jump in and swim kind of guy anyway so i m doing fine learning it  my only regret is facebook owns it and i have a lot of disdain for zuckerberg and most of the tech titans that are pushing their influence on this wonderful country      
157,1.0,                       facebook oculus should be ashamed   if it was possible to give a zero start rating  i would   bought this for my son s birthday and it stopped working on christmas day   the headset is stuck in a boot loop and will not connect via bluetooth nor connect with usb to computer for manual reset   factor reset by holding buttons on the headset will not work either   after emailing with oculus facebook customer service and getting repeated responses from multiple agents  we ve decided to return this back through amazon   this is also a pretty widespread and known issue  it seems like the run around we were getting was due to the fact  we had   days left with amazon before it could not be returned      
158,5.0,                       i purchased the oculus quest   to replace my aging htc vive that i purchased several years ago  overall  the quest   is a decent upgrade  i immediately noticed the superior visual clarity of the q  over the original vive  the best thing is the easy setup  the vive had a lot of cables to connect and or plug such as hdmi  usb  lots of power plugs due to base stations and what not  and etc  it was always a nuisance  but with the quest   there is none of that  just the headset and two controllers  a huge improvement  plus  it can be connected to pc for pcvr games  i wirelessly connected my quest   to my pc and was able to stream my old steam vr games from the pc to the quest   and play  without any cables connected  no problem  yes  no cables at all  it was great  the best way to experience room scale for sure is by being untethered  and on top of that  the self contained quest games on the oculus store are not bad either  you can play anywhere      
159,1.0,                       head set would never get past the update screen  tech support was useless  tried everything  was paired to phone and connected to wifi and my facebook account  dont understand why i it needs two different internet sources at same time to run  finally concluded that since i use vpn the ip for the phone and my wifi were different and thus that was the reason for not working  what bs is that  so beware if you have to use a vpn  had to return the headset      
160,1.0,                       this is basically a cell phone mounted on a cheap     buck headset without any cell phone function  the controller has no grip  the headset is too narrow  if you have a medium large sized head and wear glasses  chances are you will constantly feel deep pain on two sides of you head  the rigid plastic on the two sides of the headset will press hard on the two arms of your glasses  the headset puts a ton of pressure on our cheek bone cause it is front loaded  you need to spend a ton of money to buy head strap  face pad  controller grip     the battery charge extremely slowly  charging time is the same as playing time  you need to spend money either in buying a longer usb wire or an expensive power bank  there is no way you can expand your ram  you can use sidequest to add memory to it but you cannot store games in the external memory cause your quest   will not recognize the game on your external memory  my quest   had one very bad lens that is blurry with something like a piece of white cloud in it  even without this defect  the sweet spots of the two lens are extremely narrow  if you move your eyes without moving your head  things will become off focus very quickly  sound quality is not comparable to other headsets  so  you need to buy some more expensive headstraps with better ear phones  by paying       you end up paying over      extra on upgrades and replacement  the only strength of this device is that it is wireless  but if you don t use wire connection  you can t really play vr games on a high end pc without lags  say using virtual desktop   that means you need to spend some more money to buy a longer cable  or the results may not be satisfactory for some games  if you buy this for your kids  it is still ok cause most games available are old or childish vr games with very simplistic and or reduced graphics quality  if you want to play some serious aaa vr games  like vr sim racing  you simply cannot because of the serious lack of ram and the lack of a functional graphics cpu  this device is for first time vr players  just don t do any upgrades or replacement  wait for the vr gaming market to improve in a year or two  then buy something with much higher quality at only a little higher cost      
161,5.0,                       vr background  i ve owned two generations of the samsung gear vr  also running oculus  as well as used the htc vive in the past i have to say  this is the first vr product that i ve used that makes me think the technology has reached maturity  everything about this is iteratively better than previous vr devices i ve used and the areas that show the most improvement are the pain points of previous devices screen  the screen is great  the resolution and pixel layout have almost entirely removed the screen door effect that was distractingly apparent on the gear vr and htc vive  the   hz refresh rate  turned on in the  experimental  features  menu is truly a game changer  i was able to play for several hours straight  trust me  you won t want to take this device off  without any eye fatigue or dizziness  the only thing lacking is the true black levels of oled panels  but the slight grey ness of the lcd is a small trade off for all of the benefits controllers  also incredibly well implemented  they are extremely light weight  but don t feel cheap  tracking is phenomenal and i like the trigger  joystick  and button placement  they are intuitive and comfortable to use for hours play space  wow  the way you trace out your room scale play space is so well conceived and implemented  the  guardian box  unobtrusively fades in when you get close until you are touching it in which it turns into a visual barrier  once through it  the cameras turn on and you are able to see your surroundings  so make it a bit tighter so you don t end up walking into a wall or couch the two things that really made me feel it was time to buy a  real  vr devices are the ability to tether to a computer for full featured vr gaming  and the price  don t get me wrong  this headset is completely capable of doing almost anything you could want in its standalone form  but the ability to tether really gives you some peace of mind that as the device ages  or a game comes out that requires a pc to run  cough  star wars  squadrons  cough  you have the option to delegate the heavy lifting to a dedicated computer  with a      price tag  if you ve been wanting to enter in the the vr space  now is the time      
162,5.0,                       ok  if you have read online reviews of the q   then you may well know this headset does have some issues that said  i am planning to buy one for my hubby and my daughter if you compare to the q   then this one has better graphics  faster processor and is lighter if you have never owned an oculus headset or are new to vr  then this is a damn good introduction to it you will need a facebook account to login to it  but there s your only real downside if you re new to vr  go slow  games like real vr fishing  nature trek and gun club vr are good starters  if you start to feel ill  take a break from vr for an hour or   and try again that said  the q   quest    is the fastest and best looking headset currently on the market  it is a stand alone unit and can work as a pcvr as well  using a usb c or link cable   there are also work around that allow you to run it wirelessly from ur computer as well for      for    gb  it s a steal of a deal      
163,4.0,                       ok had both quest   now this  i will point out the noticable improvements and downgradespros  more comfortable than the quest   for sure  even with the stock strap the reduced weight and new design is a big upgrade less strain on your face and neck  still kinna front heavy tho so many will prefer a different strap but i like that you can lay down comfortably with the included strap which isnt the case with other straps   resolution and colors are improved and almost no sde now  more powerful and everything is much smoother  and things load way faster  controllers are better  more comfortable in hand  better vibration feedback  and longer battery life  audio is a little better than last quest but still has room for improvement  headphones still way bettercons   biggest con by far i immediately noticed  horrible god rays glare around white text  soooo distracting whenever reading text and this is a downgrade from the quest   which wasnt this bad   ipd  not an issue for me as  i fit in smallest setting but if you are in the biggest setting  be warned  u will see vertical bars on the side and you will loose fov  like looking through a box  not sure i would buy if i had that ipd  included charging cable kinna sux as is short so cant use it as link cable like quest   cablethats it those are for me the noticeable improvements  and downgrades from original quest  for the price i think it is worth it and yes you sacrifice a few things but imo the sacrifices are worth it for the improvements      
164,3.0,                       i was excited to purchase a quest   after owning an original quest   overall performance and resolution is expectedly better than the original   lighter weight is nice  although a counterweight is needed so it s not so heavy on my face unfortunately the facial interface is a lot more narrow than the original quest   i have a larger head  and the original quest fit my face perfectly   the quest   facial interface digs into my cheek bones and gives me a headache pretty quickly oculus does sell a fit  pack for     that won t ship until late november   i m very disappointed that i have to wait nearly two months and have my wallet gouged for a piece of foam plastic before i can use my quest        
165,3.0,                       vr is immersive  surreal  and there is nothing like it  however  over a year from the original quest the content is just meh  sure  you can install vr desktop and get access to aaa titles on steam if you have a gaming pc and a capable wifi router  facebook is actively making this harder to do and is trying to restrict access to content outside of oculus but currently can still be side loaded  the quest by itself is only as good as the games and content you can play on it  sure  you can buy the link cable for    dollars but reports indicate that performance is not up to par and vr desktop is still the preferred method of playing steam games for most people  the gaming community is in a uproar over being forced to be bound by facebooks terms of service which are generally not consumer friendly not to mention who knows what they are doing with your data in vr the device itself is a step up from the previous quest  the  screen door effect  is non existent compared to the original quest  in a way the device is more comfortable due to the lighter weight but i found the included strap to not be so comfortable and reports on the internet indicate that it is consistently breaking or cracking  so it s a trade off and doesn t really improve the fit over all  of course  you can buy a different head strap from oculus for    dollars  thanks to the upgraded processor the quest   did feel a bit snappier and games did seem to run better but it was hard to discern any actual graphical improvements in the game for me  it s difficult to want to spend more than    minutes in vr  playing star wars squadrons via virtual desktop was actually awesome but my body can t handle chasing tie fighters doing barrel rolls and loops in vr   does vr desktop work with playing steam games  i can say wholeheartedly yes  is it easy to use  not really  the oculus controllers may or may not work effectively and your experience may vary depending on your router  network  and pc the quest   has a lot going for it  i love vr  it s going to be the future of gaming but it is not mainstream yet  facebooks reputation and business decisions corrupt a rather beautiful niche for gaming      
166,5.0,                       this is my  rd vr set   i have psvr and rift   i don t use those anymore   the requirement of sensors really discourage my use   since sensor setup means i am fix to use the device at a particular place   with quest    now i can use vr anywhere   the resolution is also much better than what i have   i have an      theater  but now i rather watch movie with quest    the screen is much bigger   just like going to a grand theater   some apps can play  d with incredible clarity the price is right at        however  to be more comfortable  you need the elite strap  sweat proof cover  and extended batteries   that s easily another      to      more     g is enough for casual user  but if you are going to download from stream  sidequest  and  d movies  than you need the    g version      
167,1.0,                       my quest   is suffering from the buzzing sound coming from an internal cooling fan  im now waiting on a second unit as a replacement  that being said  i love my quest two  it does everything relatively well and a great entry level headset  the build quality at first glance was great  only issue being a buzz that completely eliminates the immersion of an experience especially through the quieter scenes  im hoping my second unit s  the charm and functions as it should  another huge negative is forcing a facebook account  be warned  if you don t have a fb that you are constantly using or you plan to create an illegitimate account  they could possibly ban you  ive been able to look past the juggernaut that is facebook data collection and still really enjoy my device  that being said the question of what is happening behind the scenes with whatever data fb decides to collect  is very uncomfortable  i personally have given facebook up and had no plans to return  the fact that i cannot use an oculus account without  linking it to a fb is beyond frustrating  for that reason alone i have rated one star and plan on moving out of the oculus environment as soon as a competitor picks up the gauntlet  ohh and my eye glass also has those sharp cut edges that look like broken glass others have mentioned as well      
168,1.0,                       gave this product ample time to get used to ive been trying to use it moderately since it was released and i still feel like im falling off everest and getting pulled by   sharks underwater while the heat rises from my feet to my stomach and i am nothing now but tom hanks stranded on an island of holy seasick  mind you ive lived in the mountains for over    years in southern europe  and im an avid swimmer and diver so please tell me how it is possible to go only one round with adonis creed and i can only seem to climb a ledge in walking dead  crazy how thiusands of people are playing this and i cant  wasted     dollars on games  was so excited    if someone has pro help or tips for me ill give it a shot for a bit but probably will return     
169,2.0,                       anytime i am required to do something other then i want to do is considered a restriction pros   not much to say  it arrived on time and it s not as heavy as i expected it to be cons   doesn t work very well up front facebook rant   this is another way for the pedifile behavior of facebook to spy on your kids and listen in on  incidental conversations  so they can sell our privacy to the highest bidder   rant complete the video is unstable if you move to fast in the environment you see black borders  if you move to fast in a game it doesn t register the movement and makes your character do unexpected twitching movements   yes it comical and kind of sad for the price i paid for the games i expected more the ai is garbage  unless you like looking at an environment from behind a pop up that you can t minimize   the download handler will erase and restart the download when it s interrupted by anything  including the sleep mode which you can t turn off  the games are not aaa quality yet no color options  i don t know what big tech obsession with white products is  but its the last color i would want   i guess color dye cost too much money   cough   golden parachute   cough the so called guardian can t be disabled  without jail breaking  this is inconvenient because the sensors are understandably limited they sell this thing at a console price but it needs more work before i would consider it worth it no one should be forced to log into the internet to play a console  an option for it is fine      
170,5.0,                       bought this for my    year old son  i tried it on and instantly was in another reality   i have never experienced anything like it  it will be fun to see what other games are like  where you interact with non existent creatures   i d love to see a glove made with sensors rather than manipulating your virtual hands with buttons      
171,4.0,                       the experience is amazing  its truly a full vr experience for       for       you get a headset which is powered by a processor that is practically a high end smartphone equivalently powered phones can cost over         it has a high res display for each eye  and lenses  and   tracking cameras  and fantastic two controllers  a few years ago something like this could cost            and it wouldn t be standalone would require a pc  at this point i have shown it to several family members and the number of  wow  s its gotten is exciting that said  this has some issues that range from who cares  to major depending on who you ask the bad lenses issue i didn t have  cant comment on it  from the sounds of it its happening less  and hopefully will go away entirely the facebook issue i don t mind much since i don t use facebook the issue that bothers me is the lack of account switching features  this could be the vr headset of the living room  since you cant swap between accounts  and many games dont have multiple saves it seems to mostly be for one person  this could be the sole family vr headset  there would be practically no competitors to it  its such a shame too      
172,1.0,                       i have an oculus  bought one for my niece and she can t use because she is under     can t add her to my account because facebook is canceling accounts for having more than one oculus  also  facebook can  on a whim  cancel your facebook account and and purchased games for good  gone   forever  am returning thisunit until facebook gets their act together      
173,2.0,                       i bought this headset because the specs looked good  the display i was told was amazing  and it was now possible to connect it to your pc to use it as a rift headset for pc gaming i was sold on the concepts  but so far i m not sold on the actual product facebook requirements are not taken into account here  otherwise the score would be lower my first impression was that the screen looks good  very little screen door effect  and everything was bright and vibrant   first time wearing the headset it required an update  but that is to be expected with technology anymore   pairing and setup were a breeze  absolutely no issues there   setting up guardian boundaries was also very intuitive as i continued to use the headset  my frustrations began to shine i plugged the headset into my pc with a certified oculus link cable  and it worked   technically it worked   the headset itself is capable of    hz  but when in rift it lowers that down to rates that make me almost feel nauseous but not quite   the view when in rift games on pc are absolutely horrible  colors are washed out  textures are blurry  text is impossible to read in most instances  and in almost every aspect it feels like a downgrade from the original rift system  which shouldn t be the case with this headset considering they are no longer producing rift systems   this is clearly facebook trying to use a band aid to patch up a severed limb  it will not do the trick another down is the controller tracking  i cannot put my hands down to my sides like i naturally do  otherwise the virtual hands go flying off or get stuck in limbo   the external trackers on my original rift system are so much better  and this feels like a complete downgrade to the tracking system   when i hold my hand in position with the quest headset  my hand twitches and moves around even though my physical controller is not moving  this was never an issue with my original rift system with external trackers additionally  the headset weight is insanely front heavy and requires a different strap if you plan to use it more than ten to fifteen minutes at a time  which i normally do with my original rift conclusion   this is not a replacement for rift  this is a downgrade from rift   if you don t pc game you may find enjoyment in this headset  but if you do play pc vr  you need to find a different system as oculus is no longer oculus   overall  i cannot recommend this headset  at least while still at full price       
174,1.0,                       bought one as a christmas present for my  over     child  it requires a facebook account to use  so on christmas went to create an account for them so they could use it  immediately upon completing the sign up wizard  the account was  disabled  for  violating community standards   which is clearly impossible since they are just creating an account  the only recourse is to provide some personal information  such as a photo and a mobile verification  which in and of itself is pretty invasive and problematic since it s for a    year old  and then wait for a team of people to review the account manually and hopefully  maybe  unlock it at some point  tried creating one for myself as well with my e mail just to get them rolling  same result so at this point we ve paid for a      product that can t be used  until some future point potentially when some person might allow us to use the product  if this was for myself i would immediately return it  but my child has had their heart set on it so we ll wait  can t give this product few enough stars though  it s literally unusable except as a table decoration      
175,1.0,                       unfortunately  the amazon page isn t smart enough to realize that   stars is a selected star rating after taking forty minutes to even begin trying to set up   the device was uncomfortably small   as a big guy with glasses and a big head this was designed for children even though the minimum age was    the connection usb cable doesn t work   it constantly loses connection no matter what you do   for five minutes  the most reliable game i could play on it was  you re connected to a pc   connection lost    followed by  it s too dark in your brightly lit room to track    great games setting it up uses     of the battery power even while it s connected to charge whatever idiot thought that this piece of cell phone based garbage would ever replace a pcvr system should not only be fired  they should be removed from any position to ever make decisions affecting anyone  including themselves  as they obviously can t be trusted to think more than one step ahead some major issues   all of the buttons are exactly where you need to hold the visor to move it   power off   if you re not one of the incredibly trendy  fit  small framed people they show using it  you won t be able to   it s not designed for the masses  it s designed for trendy hipsters  who wouldn t want it   if you ve ever used a pc based vr system you will find this an incredible let down here s hoping the government splits up farcebook so they have to let someone with a clue work on the oculus i picked up both the rift s and the quest     i ll keep the rift s as it works and will be returning this pos tonight   sorry  amazon tl dr   don t waste your time   get a pcvr system   it will be a much  much better experience      
176,3.0,                       this vr set is cool and great  but the main issue is how blurry everything is even if after all the best possible adjustments ive tried  im near sighted which means glasses needed for long distance  but just in case i also tried wearing them and that didnt help  i tried the   limited options for eyes  the largest one seemed somewhat more comfy but still  no  i tried everything  even changing texture resolutions but that didnt help either  i get massive headaches from this  and it struggles to play vrchat which was the main reason i got it  its really cool but facebook messed up on the most important aspect which is the eyes  for that i may have to return this product even tho a vr set was something ive wanted for a long time      
177,1.0,                       it s still primitive imo  but we re going in the right direction  i think this is one of the best products for vr but it s still not good enough  it s still a gimmick  i m returning mine soon and now for the facebook part    seriously this is one of the biggest things i hate about this product  you have to tie it to your facebook account  requirement     you have to tie it to your phone  requirement      you have to enable gps on your phone     i was like  this is too much  i want some privacy jesus  it s not enough that this thing has a camera and a mic on it that feeds into facebook  they have to know everything about you    and now for the apps interface     i had so many problems trying to install the sync app on my pc  on the headset itself the guardian was so annoying  it would ask me to set up my  space  everytime i turned the headset on  if i ignored this i would keep seeing these red lines everywhere  also i hate that facebook made this thing so limited where you can only play games that facebook selected  you can follow a guide where they  not facebook  give you    steps to be able to sideload a game  it s a very hacky way  omg what a turn off that was thank god for hassle free returns  thanks amazon      
178,5.0,                       honestly i love this system  i ve had it for a couple days now and it works like a dream  i would say that it is indeed a great system to introduce you to vr and has a wide array of impressive pros to relatively few cons  yes you do need to have a facebook account but honestly there is no such thing as online privacy so you d probably be best to stop thinking anything you do isn t being tracked or recorded somewhere  the tracking for the headset and handset is superb  probably the best i ve ever seen for a non sensor box vr  i d say you could only really notice it if you have a sensor box vr system  other than that it s pretty spot on  won t track in dark areas which isn t that big an issue but still you should be aware  i do wish there was a more granular eye spacing set up as the   do indeed cover most people but sometimes just the very edge is blurry and it gets to wear on your eyes after a bit  some of the apps i wish had an easier way to position yourself but that s not the headset s fault it s more the fault of the app  batteries in the handsets last a super long time  i can t complain much about the headset battery life either because  honestly  it s pretty good for the clarity and speed it s playing the games at  you get about a couple hours per charge but you can plug it in to a wall socket and play indefinitely with a long enough usb c cable  though  i would caution about extended play sessions if you don t have the exact right focal setup because it can start to hurt your eyes    hours is about the max i ve been able to stand myself  honestly i  who own every game system since the nes  consider this to be one of the most fun and best system purchases i ve made since the n    i love the multiple environments and the general flexibility of this machine  being able to play steam games super nice with an attached cable  and having other games that load right onto the headset  i love it  i honestly recommend  if you don t have a vr setup and are looking for one that works great but isn t super expensive or confusing  just get this one  if they come up with any really stupid requirements or gotcha s then i ll update this review but so far i m loving this headset and so is the rest of my family      
179,1.0,                       if  like me  you were considering the quest   as an upgrade to the oculus go  it is not   it is a step down from everything that headset does well  the quest   does not natively support dlna streaming  so if you re used to watching content from your own home server pc  you can t   there are third party apps available to do this  but at the cost of reduced video quality  poorer frame rate  ergonomically it s a huge step down also   it s heavy  and impossible to keep attached to your face unless you tighten the straps so tight that it s painful   the headset is also narrower  so if you wear glasses  they don t really fit into the eye area  even with the included glasses adapter installed long story short  if intend to use this for media streaming  it fails on all counts   this will not be the vr headset for you also  you probably know this already  but it requires a facebook account to use the headset  which should have been a deal breaker in itself   as in  you literally cannot use the headset in anyway without a facebook logon      
180,5.0,                       i was concerned about the privacy issues associated with facebook prior to buying this headset  i took a look at the eula and what i d have to do to activate the headset and i ve been decently satisfied with it  while you do need a facebook account  it is only used to login to your oculus upon first activation  you don t have to use facebook  ever  and it never asks you to login again there s also options to keep your username  activity  and friends private  they have you configure this right at the start as well   no having to go into settings and search for it after  they don t record your data and everything on the oculus side can be set to private as for the headset itself  it s a little uncomfortable with the default strap  i d highly recommend getting either the elite strap or a counterweight to offset the heaviness of the hmd  the overall experience itself is excellent  the image is clear and the tracking is excellent  the headset is sturdy and well made  and it looks like a lot of thought went into the consumer experience unless you are vehemently anti social media i would definitely recommend a buy here  other high quality alternatives are the valve index  which is not as simple as the quest so take note   the first time you experience high quality vr  it s really a game changer in the literal sense of the word      
181,3.0,                       we received our oculus quest   on january           it is february   th       now and i am already extremely frustrated with the thing   it was great when we first got it   no problems at all   i was a little peeved that the headset s battery only lasted for about an hour  but with the quality of the graphics this thing has  i can t say that i m surprised   the problem can be easily solved by just buying an extra battery pack and rigging it to the back of the head strap   by the way  the head strap that comes with it seemed fine at first  but i started getting headaches after playing it for more than    minutes  so i suggest you just get one of the hard plastic ones  if not the oculus brand head strap  that actually has an extra battery pack  ok  so why do i want to throw the damn thing into the street and let my neighbor s girlfriends drive over it back and forth while practicing parallel parking on a nearly empty street  this is actually a hilariously common thing for them   you ask   it s because that awesome good time playing the oculus turned into pure unadulterated frustration while playing the oculus in less than   month     my favorite game is beat saber   i noticed that i actually get my heart rate high enough to count towards exercise minutes  according to my apple iwatch  and i am a person who loathes cardio   so  in order to get some exercise in and actually enjoy it  i paid for the extra songs  because i  nor any other    year old person i know enjoys dubstep  music   and just play beat saber for         minutes   i mean i used to do that   now i m lucky to get    minutes into playing it on the hard and expert levels  or any level for that matter  before one of the hand controllers loses tracking and goes floating off above my head  in the game   and then i lose and can t play anything else because i can t get it back on track unless i turn the whole thing off when it first started happening  about   weeks after we got it   i noticed that it would lose tracking every    minutes  but it would only lose tracking for a few seconds and come right back every time   not really a big deal  but about   weeks into playing it  it started happening every    minutes and i wouldn t be able to get it back on track without restarting the headset  i changed the batteries and made sure they were actually     volt aa batteries and yes they were new   i also tried playing the oculus at different locations with different lighting  and areas with different ranges of contrast between the objects in the room  higher contrast objects helps the oculus tracking apparently   but the tracking problem seems to be getting worse by the day if you try to research the issue online  you will find that this seems to be a common problem for people   however  all of the articles on the issue that i have found were from over a year ago and for the original oculus  not the oculus     i also noticed that it seems that nobody has ever updated their posts about if the issue was ever fixed and how it was fixed   with the way mine is working  i d say that they obviously haven t figured out the problem   there s a lot of things to try and see if it makes the problem better  but i ve tried all of it and nothing has helped     right now  i feel like i blew over       oculus  better headset  silicone covers for controllers and headset  protective case  and several games we ve purchased  on a worthless paperweight  and that really chaps my cheeks because  in case you haven t heard  the only thing i am rich in is dirty laundry i feel that i m being pretty generous giving the thing   stars  but those are only for the amazing graphics and experience you get during the    minutes it s actually working properly      
182,1.0,                       i was extremely impressed with this thing to the point that i said fine  ive never used facebook but im setting up an account so i can enjoy this thing  did the log in stuff from the headset  got in and checked out some content until the battery got low  put on the charger and went to log in to the facebook account from my pc to do the link cable stuff  use the log in and password i just created    minutes ago  we locked your account due to suspucious activity  please upload your drivers license picture to facebook  this is going back in the box  thats unacceptable and im extremely disappointed because this is awesome technology  im not uploading my id  its just not happening  the only suspicious activity took place was on facebooks end      
183,5.0,                       last christmas i bought one of the oculus products for the grands  and we had to return them because their computer systems weren t compatible with the vr device  i actually forget at this point what the problem was exactly  but they had to go back the quest   doesn t have a compatibility problem with anything  one issue  one grand had gotten as far as setting up the app and account in his phone in the system we returned  we both  and i m pretty techno for an old lady  had such a difficult time getting his former account to register the new quest    that he just started from scratch with a different email and different fb account  it was a project that shouldn t have been necessary the other grand was starting from scratch and his quest   was up and running in minutes while the boys have used vr headsets on a few occasions  i had not and i am blown away by it  enough that i actually want a system for myself  video games  sure  i guess  probably not so much for me  but i could live on the david attenborough nature videos  wearing the headset  you are there  you re in it  pretty much all that s missing are the scents as with other video setups  the grands can play against or with each other from different locations and different internet connections  they can also play against strangers and hear strangers and converse with strangers  but the ability to converse with strangers can be shut off for safety  and i highly recommend it  with that cut off  the grands are still able to converse with each other  however  i highly recommend that there is plenty of free entertainment available  from videos to games  there are many games to buy  as well  they aren t cheap by the time you add a few on for some games there is more activity involved using vr than using a standard video game system  if you re in the mountain climbing app  you have to physically move around or you won t be  climbing   so that s more exercise than a kid would get sitting on the couch playing a video game  not the same as climbing a tree  but our grands also climb trees so it doesn t worry me that they aren t  outside  because they are outside all the time bringing me to  unlike standard video game systems that are connected to power and can allow a kid to sit for endless hours playing video games  the vr headsets run on battery power and the battery doesn t last endlessly  it s like a built in time limit  it takes about an hour for the device to recharge to full power  so that s an hour the kids can come to the table  have dinner  grunt a few nays or assents to others by way of  conversation  and then get back to their games  or be distracted so they forget the games and do something else  don t scoff  i ve seen it happen i m sure some kids will attach a battery pack to extend playing time  but my grands aren t anyway  virtual reality headsets are fun and interesting  and open up the possibility of who knows what cool applications suitable to anyone in the family  i love it      
184,3.0,                       lets start by saying i m actually very surprised with this vr  i am a psvr player from the word go  so i decided what the hect lets give the wireless a real shot  i not at all disappointed lets start with set up  its very well explained in the beginning of set up what needs to be done  takes about    to    to fully set up  you will be asked to download the oculus app on your phone and connect a valid wifi source for the setting up process  once both are completed it will ask you to connect to facebook and add a payment source for future purchases   then you will set your boundaries to allow it to read floor to ceiling  then ask you to draw a line around your space so the device will only allow you to travel or move within the drawn area  if you step outside that zone the headset will switch to live view showing you your room in live view  great thing there clarity and sound are fantastic for this  not as good as a wired headset  but not a huge noticlbe differents  tracking and devie speed is superb  except for some of the games seem to need a lot larger of a boundry or you end up getting alot of grid lines showing while your playing because your to close to leaving that boundry  its a huge destraction and pain in the but to get just right dont not be a bad ass on facebook  if your account is locked or gets blocked by facebook  you now have a personal paper weight  untill they decide to unlock your account  basically it locks your headset device too so you cant use it at all untill said comment above i personally think the games are over priced compared to the same games and prices on a psvr system  also if you wear glasses  it does come with a bumper to keep the lens from touching and scratching  but it does cause a bit of light in at the buttoms of the headset  doesnt affect the immesrion as bad but its noticable in all if you thinkk its right for you give it a shot  i dont think its worth the price tag when you have things like psvr avaible for the same price and better quality     
185,3.0,                       one thing nobody complains about is how damn bright the display is  i feel like its trying the burn out my eyes  want to lower the brightness  got to put the device in dev mode to do that and i believe that is out of reach for a lot of people  it kind of reminds of my cellphone on full brightness at night  its a bit much this device is a great value  thanks the the new cable connection you can now use it like any other wired headset  oculus s    other than those it still has the same complaints as everybody else  controllers too smooth and head band could be better also a warning  if you want hi quality fidelity that you see people playing on youtube this device won t really do that  the ability to render out polygons is really low  this problem can be solved by keeping it connected and playing through your computer      
186,4.0,                       this was my first vr headset so this was a unique experience for me  the headset itself works great and is easily worth the     dollars asking price  although i have a few quibbles here and there   setup took around   hours  there was some difficulty with controllers and the headset died before i could use it   the controller firmware needed to be updated  maybe the help page could explain that   actually made me want to return it   the strap is annoying  the headset keeps sliding down my face   the screen gets blurry if you look at the edges while the headset is not on your face properly   it would be nice if things on the store were cheaper  maybe allow third party stores to sell keys   selection in the store is quite limited  maybe open it up some more  although it is nice to not see shovelware around that being said i would still buy this headset again      
187,4.0,                       first  i have to start off with saying i would rate   stars but i don t like that it s a required facebook log in device  other reviewers complained about this but facebook stated that under info section as well as on the box that you must have an account  i have watched and read many reviews about it prior to release date so i was well aware  if this is a deal breaker for you  then this is not the device for you the product itself is great and the elite strap is a must have to help with weight distribution and comfort  i m new to vr so this is a good way to start  i debated on the rift but with quest you can play both oculus games and pc games with a link cable  provided you have a computer that s vr compatible   the   gb version is good enough storage but if spending      extra isn t a big deal  it s worth the upgrade to    gb and never have to worry about storage  this is a great alternative to just sitting and playing video games  this get you up and moving      
188,1.0,                       in order to buy games for these you must set up an account with their store and agree to have them keep your credit card info or paypal account information on file  there is no way to securely purchase without giving them total access to your account information  there is no guest checkout   so if i buy a game my child then has carte blanche for future purchases      
189,2.0,                       crashes all the time  i have forced into emailing oculus support  they dont do phones  for   weeks and they still havent sorted my account issues the lack of support  buggy start  and ridiculous accpunt requirements are going to give you headaches  like alot  if oculus reps want to reach out and fix this though  ill be willing to edit     
190,5.0,                       as a    year old man with a family who has been a gamer most of his life  coming from atari      to ps   this is a total game changer  games won t have the visual quality of powerful modern consoles but the mechanics  and smoothness of movement plus the sound effects on each ear  plus the immersive experience makes this  console  my best purchase in the last years i don t feel like i m outside a fun game anymore  i m inside the game playing it and the attention to detail is awesome  the exercise and physical activity factor is huge here  just think  you re playing videogames and you re exercising  what else      
191,1.0,                       left handed controller grip button does not work  i ve put a support ticket in to oculus for it  have heard nothing  they charge     for a replacement  ffs  i will update once this issue is addressed     
192,5.0,                       so  the headset is nearly perfect but lacks in   main aspects     library is lacking and expensive  lots of great games but not nearly enough  many are sadly short and lack replayability  they also can cost a pretty penny for only a couple hours of entertainment  however  modding is where this shines  playing old games like doom or half life in vr is amazing     oculus link  i m sure facebook engineers have already decided that either the link is enough  they need to invest in wireless pc to headset  or that they need to add mini dp or hdmi  my hope is they go with mini dp because usb is lacking when it comes to transmitting high resolution video at high frame rates currently  the compression and issues with certain games makes it a weaker headset compared to a dedicated pcvr one but then again  that s not where this is supposed to shine  just wish they had mini dp and it could run exactly like a rift s  beyond that  it s fantastic  excited to see the next iterations and changes with better processors and tech  oh  and the ipd is lacking      
193,2.0,                       i was really pleased with video quality  i love the games that i normally play with my child however    very disappointed in the lack of parental controls  there is no way to keep children out of adult content  there are free apps pre loaded that are adult content  i went into a chatroom that said you had to be    there was nothing asking me to verify my age  i didn t even have to lie  withing   seconds of being in the lobby of the chat room i heard rated x conversations  so very disappointing  adult content should not be preloaded or free to download without some sort of age verification      
194,5.0,                       i have been using the oculus quest   for the last   weeks during our quarantine     year old son tested positive for covid  but thankfully was asymptomatic   we were losing our minds and felt like we had watched every movie and played every video and board game we could  to save our sanity i bought the quest   thinking that the price was low enough that if we didn t like  not a big loss  however  i ve got to say that the technology is fantastic  easy to use and the games are a lot of fun  it really feels like you are transported to another world for a brief time  which has been very welcome during this challenging year  unlike other video games  i find the vr games to be more  experiences   it can be very stimulating  so i make sure our kids just play the games for no more than    minutes at a time  on the other hand  some the experiences can be very relaxing  playing vr walkabout minigolf for a few holes really helps me to settle down at the end of the day  other outstanding games have included  moss  the room  beat saber  vader immortal  and tetris effect if you are thinking about buying one  especially if you are stuck at home due to covid restrictions  just do it  you won t regret it  truly unique experiences that you can have from the comfort of your own home  i hate facebook  and never use my account for social purposes  however  using a facebook account solely for vr has not lead to any intrusions into my digital life      
195,1.0,                       my    yr old son saved up his own money to buy this headset  but when it arrived he said he could not activate it without my help   so as i was trying to help him i learned that this company was purchased by facebook awhile back and now they are forcing you to link it through a facebook account and a smartphone with bluetooth to be able to use it     well guess what   then it tells you  we will share the information we gather about you and your use of facebook and oculus    we will share   we will spy on you   i am outraged    talk about a bait and switch   the younger generation doesn t do facebook they think it is lame  so mark zuckerberg must have concocted this ridiculous strong armed way to force them to get facebook accounts   which would be bad enough  but then you  cannot even opt out of them spying on you   and spying on your smart phone   this is so machiavellian that i will not only return this stupid oculus but i am also going to cancel my own facebook account  and i am paying the difference out of my pocket for my son to have a htc vive or valve index   he should not be punished after working so hard to save up to buy this  but there is no way i am playing into these facebook information spy games disguised as a vr headset      
196,5.0,                       so  i ve had my quest   for a week and here are my thoughts on it    awesome vr headset  i ve had some minor exposure to others  playstation and others   but this my first dive in  and i have to say it is great  the graphics  sound  and feedback from the controllers are amazing    ability to play  beat saber   tbh   beat saber   a game where you slice and dice cubes to various songs  was one of the big reasons that i bought a quest    i am proud to say that the experience is truly amazing  i get a good cardio workout while playing this amazing game    immersion  the immersion factor is a    out of     i have done virtual exploration of mars  riding along with folks in  squirrel suits   explored reefs  and other fantastic adventures with the quest    whilst playing  vader immortal   in the opening scenes  the scene reminiscent from  star wars  a new hope  was just jaw dropping gorgeous  it is all amazing   giving me the  i am there  experience one would expect from a virtual reality experience with that said  there are some things to bear in mind    facebook  let s get the elephant out of the room  facebook did buy oculus and the eula states that you need to use a facebook account since the oculus accounts  by themselves  are going away at the end of       thus  you will need to use your facebook for everything oculus  if you aren t comfortable with that  don t buy the quest    it s that simple  since having a facebook is a requirement    phone app  the quest   set up did require me to use my phone to complete part of the registration by downloading the oculus quest   app  after completing set up  i have not had to use the oculus app on my phone since then    pay to play  just like with any other gaming system  you will need to buy apps  games fitness programs etc    a lot of the educational content is free  but entertainment tends to come with a price tag  some are free with a monthly subscription  whilst others are pay once and then are done  just know what you are getting into  and realize that the oculus store is the only source of the content  afaik   so there isn t an option of doing price comparisons between different stores    accessorizing  you will definitely need more than just the base unit if you want to get the most out of your quest    i have purchased the extra battery improved headband combo which definitely increased the vr session time  the oculus branded case is also nice  if you are into intense gaming fitness  or are planning to do so   you should get a silicone or other cover for the edges of the face  since you will generally sweat and that will make the absorbent sponge material on the quest   rather gross  with a cover  you can wipe away the sweat and still not gross out anyone else wanting to play  you may want to invest in headphones if you are going to be in areas where you don t want to disturb others  also  unless you  cast   nobody will be able to see what you are doing in the vr world  so that may be something to consider for a purchase  all in all  if you don t mind the fb requirement and the fact that you will need to spend a lot more than just the initial layout for the unit itself  then you will really enjoy the experiences that the quest   has to offer      
197,5.0,                       this system is one of the best vr headsets on the market  and at the best price the controllers track very well  and the controller batteries last a ridiculously long time as a standalone headset  it is a pretty great system  though the library of games is a little limited and the battery of the headset only lasts   to   hours as a pcvr headset  it has some of the best clarity  resolution  available  comparable to units that cost double it s price or more  the link cable setup is easy  and works well  the option to play wireless with virtual desktop though is what really stands out you will probably be wanting to upgrade the headstrap  headphones and get a powerbank to make the battery last longer  but even with those purchases  this headset is a good value product you do need a facebook account to use this  a facebook account requires that you are at least    years of age  so that is something to consider if you are buying this for anyone younger than     or who you don t want to allow on facebook i also have a rift s and have owned playstation vr in the past  this is honestly a better product than either of them were  my rift s is in a box in the closet now  and i sold the playstation   pro and psvr systems i had  because they were collecting dust      
198,4.0,                       i am fairly new to the vr world and this thing is mind blowing and extremely fun to use  i swear it s almost worth every penny  the only real issues for it is that the headband is not comfortable and even when well adjust  it still fails to hold the quest on your head properly  in order to see things clearly the headset has to be positioned just right and the head band does not allow that perfect position  it always is tilting because of the weight of the quest  causing me to have to adjust the headset all the time to keep everything clear  another issue  which doesn t bother me but will bother others is that it only has   eye width adjustments  so if your eyes aren t adjusting with either of the three adjustments  everything s going to be blurry always no matter how much you adjust the head straps or the eye width adjusters  after an hour of using  the headset feels too tightly pressed to my face  but it is still extremely fun to use  very responsive and is definitely a good vr headset for the price  i recommend this product  oh and don t forget  you do have to have a facebook account to use      
199,5.0,                       it s not even here yet but i can tell it s gonna be amazing     
200,5.0,                       bricking risk  do not buy this oculus guest   if you care about the bricking risk associated with the facebook banning pandemic  i never had a facebook account and was required to sign up for one to use the quest     got blocked at sign up  fully compliant account details but ai decided to ban me upfront for violation of community guidelines     however that is possible    now the guest   is a paperweight with no way to use it  there s also no one that can or want to fix the issue  not even oculus   just google oculus facebook banning issue for reference of just how bad this is updatei managed to reach out to oculus and get someone from support to try and assist  after few mails back and forth the support people came back and said that they have spoken to facebook about issue and someone from facebook would contact me  the same day i received a mail from facebook to say that i m not banned anymore and that i can continue to use it as before i know others weren t so lucky  but for the moment it would seem that oculus did resolve the issue for me at least  kidos to them for helping out when it seemed that the matter was lost      
201,1.0,                       none of the ipd settings worked for me and if you wear glasses they might not work well either without having to shell out more money for the oculus quest   fit pack     
202,1.0,                       i ve shunned facebook from the beginning  so i m one of few nowadays who lacks an account  thinking i could still use an oculus account  support ending end of       of course   by which point i ll probably have moved on to the next headset   i got this headset   however  regardless of facebook s claims  when trying to set it up  it informs you that  quest   requires a facebook account to log in     apparently their promise on oculus account support only applies to their previous headsets  not the quest   oh well  right  it s not like i m going to use it for anything besides oculus  just give them my name and phone number  not  that  big a deal  right  i don t like social media enough to get sucked into it anyway  i don t  or rather  didn t  have an ideological grievance with facebook  i just don t care for it myself i go through the motions of making a facebook account  as soon as the account gets made  it s immediately disabled   literally  the first page served to my new account is that its been disabled  i m not making an account through a proxy  a vpn  through a browser with a spoofed user agent  a clever fake name like ben dover or anything slick like that  just a normal guy making an account from a normal browser apparently  if your account is disabled  the device it s linked to is effectively bricked as well  that s not even a factor in my case  because i didn t even have a chance to link the device to the account before getting disabled  but it certainly doesn t bode well for the idea of having your facebook account play the role of gatekeeper to your device   who owns it  you or them i m going to give it about a day and jump through some ridiculous hoops to get my new account un disabled  i can only imagine that if i make a new new account with a fake name and e mail  it ll probably be disabled eventually as well it s utterly unbelievable  i can understand requiring an account   many platforms need one to use them  including every video game console   but to be banned immediately for simply making the account  did they think this through all the way  do they realize some people haven t had or wanted a facebook account until they got this headset i m going to give it about a day to see if my disabled account appeal goes through  which is honestly more than it deserves   only because the hardware its self is exciting  even if the account is  re  instated  i m going to throw the quest back in its box and return it  because this simply unbelievable even for a walled garden product      
203,1.0,                       i have had an oculus quest for   years and loved it  i purchased over    apps  i pre ordered the quest   with high hopes  i never got my apps on the quest    thanks to facebook and their useless technical support  i created a tech support ticket and after almost   weeks of them asking me the same questions over and over with zero resolution  i returned the quest    i will be using another platform moving forward  the only good thing about this purchase was how quickly amazon credited my account back  i do not recommend facebook oculus quest until they figure out how to support their long standing customers      
204,1.0,                       honestly it s not really that great  i expected a lot from this and it did not live up to the hype at all  the graphics aren t nearly as good as what people hyped them up to be  there aren t even a lot of apps to go with this thing yet      not sure if developers will be creating more but i was seriously underwhelmed     not even with the gaming but with just the options to explore  there were several apps i went on that took you to different countries and the image quality was poor at best  blurry sometimes and slightly hi quality at others  the only thing i really love is the attention and detail they put into safety  which makes sense because i imagine they don t want to be held liable for anything   but coming from someone who loves gaming and hi def  beautiful things this was just extremely underwhelming  not really worth the money imo and it s not even that comfortable  easy for the vision to get blurry no matter how much you adjust it  all the games cost money as well which isn t a deal breaker but is annoying and just thought you all should know  overall very okay but not worth the price point and kind of disappointing boring  it s very easy to tell that this is still a product in the works      
205,4.0,                       overall i think this an incredible product  it s a whole new experience and i would recommend it for anyone  the only problem is i can t play it for more than an hour without getting a headache  the battery life is great on both the headset and controllers  headset has charger and controllers take batteries   also the lenses get blurry pretty quickly  i m finding that i m constantly wiping the lenses with a soft towel  those are the major cons that i thought i should let people know  but the headache thing might just be me i don t know  but hey give it a try if you re interested      
206,5.0,                       awesome all in one system and the graphics i think personally are better on the quest   than psvr and original quest works well linked to my cpu to play steam vr games as well as mirror my cpu into the goggles too  after upgrading the display on the one site  the graphics are a bit sharper and refresh rate makes a difference  look up online how to do it   i just wish the battery life was a lot longer than   hours and recommend the external battery to strap to it if you do not have a long usb c to usb charger or oculus link cable to keep it plugged in  but you should not be using them for longer than a hour at a time as an adult anyway  the only thing i wish they would do is add more space shooters to its game line up but thanks to steam vr and other oculus apps that mirror your cpu to the goggles  it keeps me going recommend getting the oculus grips and covers along with the elite strap for the goggles itslef for comfort and protection because it is not cheap to replace the remotes if you break them whacking the wall or the ceiling when you start getting excited side note its      more for almost triple the memory and black color  but i have not ran into a memory issue with the    apps and games i have downloaded onto it with the      model  except when i use the dj app and download mp  music onto it for the turntables worth the money and find myself playing it twice as much as i do my new xbox series x console do to being able to take it on trips and watch movies in bed while not interrupting my gf when she is sleeping lol      
207,4.0,                       this thing is great not just for the price but all around  if you connect it to the pc u get quality like the valve index and if you play it as standalone you get a great looking  dof true vr experience  comparing this to the quest one i would say it s better visually in every way but blacks  when playing epic rollercoaster on the quest   in the haunted house it looked like a ashy house of horror but on the quest   it looked great and clean the dark parts looked like it should  this headset is totally worth it and i have been in vr for a few years i had the first htc vive when it came out i had the first gear vr   not  dof vr  i have a pimax  k xr i have psvr and both quest   and   so i have a good understanding of vr      
208,5.0,                       i have purchased almost every oculus product  i had the dk   dk   cv  and quest   now i have the quest   and this new headset is amazing  the visual clarity is just what i wanted  you can watch movies in vr on the vr movie theater and its just great  also you tube vr videos never looked better the only disappointment i have is the facebook integration   such a pain   i still have my quest   and now i need to make a second facebook account just to use it or ill get banned if i used my current facebook account  and since it will be a facebook account just for the headset facebook will probably ban it anyway  i dont think ill be buying any more facebook vr products after this unless they stop banning headsets  i think facebook made a mistake with that integration and will be their downfall unless they easy up on it  over all its a great headset but if you have more that   quest you might run into some issues ill be looking forward for the next quest   challenger      
209,5.0,                       ok  i had the quest that i purchased a week prior to this announced product and was a bit upset  i searched everywhere for the quest and had to by it off of the  black  market per se  only paid    over retail though with that  this is an improvement in many things  the screen does look better  the original quest  gave me a headache to watch shows or youtube  netflix  this one  you can watch everything  the headache was part of multiple things  but the main thing is   old quest you can see pixels  the screen was   blah at best to me the controllers feel great  my only gripe is that that the head strap should not have come on this at all  this should have been built with the elite strap and with the information that i am allowing facebook to gather on me with this  they most definitely can afford that virtual desktop  with a few extra apps installed on your computer such as virtual desktop streamer  sidequest  and then your steam vr or other is so freaking great        hz playing squadrons looks much better than the cable right now  my only issue thus far is attaching an xbox controller on this  the app says i am good  but it just never actually connects  once i figure this out  i can play squadrons in my living room and that would be most austacious other gripe is that the face part does not block out all light   like  at all  this should be unacceptable  seriously  everything that facebook oculus has as an extra  minus the battery pack strap  should be what comes on this in stock form  i am loving how all the companies are going this route of taking things away  apple  iphone  and then charging extra for crap that should have come with it  its not saving the environment and all it is doing is padding profits  again  with the information that i had to allow facebook to utilize for using this device  they can afford it anyhow  final  would purchase again  would suggest this for everyone  buy virtual desktop for    bucks  do the hour or two of work to get it working on your computer laptop and have fun both with native oculus and wireless connectivity    cable attached does not give you   hz       
210,1.0,                       its a facebook not oculus product you have to have it signed into facebook to use it     
211,5.0,                       first of all for all the morons that think you re interesting enough for facebook to collect your info and it  atters at all  go live off of the grid and quit being hypocritical  you re vegans wearing leather shoes trying to stop pollution while driving a beat up vw that wouldn t pass an emission test  the quest   is frigging awesome    i have been buying vr headsets since the beginning  the graphics still have a long way to go  alyx from steam is the best yet  the headset can t quite keep up with what valve has created  it s borderline real  but it gets laggy at times  i put a tower fan to cool my play area which has helped a lot  a spring loaded retractable cord for the pc connection would be ideal though  i pinned mine to the ceiling and have it dangle in the middle of my play area but still gets in the way  this is an evolutionary step and not the finished product people  name one thing that is perfect  quit being such winey little bitchs  trolls just need a hug and a beat down  if you re looking for an out of body experience   quest        
212,1.0,                       i have had   different units at this point and each one has had some sort of hardware issue  the first one the handsets just decided to not register anything anymore and amazon graciously replaced that one  i received my replacement last week and this one has the sound cut off randomly only to be fixed by resetting the headset  this would be fine if it were occasional but this occurs at least   times in a   hour period so it is very frequent  amazon  sadly  couldn t replace this one due to the item now being out of stock but did offer a small refund which was kind of them but this is disappointingthe issue of requiring facebook isn t the hugest issue since you can just use an account you don t use very much  but the ui is not very user friendly  it can be hard to find where your most recent purchases are and the device doesn t seem to like you making purchases in the device itself but on the app  which feels entirely useless  the app doesn t really do anything and i frequently forget it even exists  at this point  i don t feel like this system is really worth the money and i would advise spending the money on a different vr system      
213,1.0,                       i didn t think it was a big deal to require facebook to use this  but i didn t think they d prevent accounts that are banned from even using it   my account happens to be in good standing  but there are many  many reports of others getting their accounts banned due to looking like a fake account to the algorithm   rather than having fun with this  i fear every minute i ll get banned too      
214,3.0,                       better graphics  better controllers with better battery life  lighter headset than the original quest   all good   but the lens ipd system is a disaster ipd is the measure of inter pupillary distance basically how wide set your eyes are   some people have narrow ipds in the   mm range  others are    or even      and most people fall in the low  to mid   s   with binocular vision  everyone has a range  when you look at something up close  you cross your eyes a bit  narrowing the ipd  and when you gaze into the distance your ipd widens   this is important for vr headsets because each lens should sit right at the center of each eye   most quality headsets are adjustable for this reason the original quest had lenses on a physical slider assembly that adjusted continuously from   mm to at least   mm  and each lens had its own dedicated display that moved along with it   the field of view was the same regardless of ipd the quest   only has three fixed lens positions   mm    mm and   mm and a single display that sits statically in front of both lenses   when you adjust the ipd  the display digitally moves the placement of the two images on the screen to  match  the lens positions   obviously this is cheaper to manufacture  and there are fewer parts to fail  but for those not lucky enough to be within a millimeter or two of those ipds  it is a serious downgrade my ipd is     mm  not freakishly wide but a bit wider than average   the best i can do with the quest   is the   mm setting  which makes it hard to get a clear picture in both eyes  introduces some distortion and chromatic aberrations  from off center fresnel lenses   and requires me to cross my eyes a bit during play uncomfortable and headache inducing also annoying is that the single display panel is optimized for   mm   if you go narrower  the single screen panel digitally moves the two images closer together  narrowing the field of view and losing some of inside peripheral detail   if you go wider  the panel moves the two images outward  narrowing the fov on the outside   and in the   mm setting  part of the bezel pops into view  giving the sensation of looking through a helmet or a tube i still have my original quest   the other day i was setting it up for my girlfriend   i put on the quest  pushed the slider to the maximum ipd  and what a difference   the graphics aren t quite as good as the quest    but the comfort and clarity were so much better   there are plenty of phone apps that measure your ipd   if you re in the      mm range  you should be okay  if you re in the      mm or      mm range  even better  and if you re a lucky one in the       mm  you should have a near perfect fit   but for the rest of us  facebook oculus did a serious disservice and limited their customer base if the quest   had the continuous ipd slider and dual displays like the original quest  i would have given it   stars      
215,2.0,                       i ordered this product for my birthday but when i set it up i was a little disappointed  the game store was super limited  most games will run you         not to mention the micro transactions  if you do find a game worth your time make sure you order a new head strap and face cover   the stock strap does not disperse the weight evenly and will leave you with a sore neck  the last issue is the face cover  its made of cheap foam  if you have pets or don t dust your house often this thing is magnet for hair and other particles  you will feel it scratching your eyes  ive now had to order a new head strap and a new face cover  i really only use the movie app big screen now but the battery life will only last about one movie  you ll need at least a    ft or    ft usb c cord if you want longer play time  overall its been kind of sad seeing how this will probably be outdated in a year       
216,1.0,                       i am so unhappy with my oculus customer support experience   i am unable to merge my facebook and existing oculus accounts since sun             it is now friday            i bought a      piece of hardware of which is      dependent upon me being able to use it by linking it to facebook  even though i already have an oculus account    for some reason  my account is failing in the merge process and the only way contact oculus support is via email   you can t even contact oculus support via facebook     unfortunately for me  oculus support only seems to check their email once per day  and then when they do  they ask me a single question  which i promptly answer   then it takes them     hours for them to review and ask me another single question  to which i promptly answer   rinse and repeat   why doesn t oculus support ask me the whole barrage of questions that they need to get me online as quickly as possible   i am so upset about this equipment and being unable to use it   horrible customer service   i am ready to send this unit back to oculus and go with another brand      
217,5.0,                       i ve only ever dipped my toe into the world of vr via my iphone and a goggle attachment  ads for the new oculus kept coming up on facebook and once i saw that there were highly rated fitness games and the low cost  i thought i d give it a try  well  the first night i tried it  i played until the battery ran out  the next day i started racking up all the installs on games and add ons  plus  with a     attachment to my spin bike  i can add that into the mix  for me  this is a crazy crazy life changer  it s light so there s no pulling on your head and although i wear reading glasses  i don t seem to need them  now i m trying to convince my friends to get one so we can hang out in vr and stay covid safe      
218,5.0,                       i have tried many vr headsets  i started using headsets since google cardboard and cellphone based headsets like samsung galaxy vr  which wasn t too bad   i tried the first oculus series as well as many newer pc based vr headsets including windows virtual reality based headsets  samsung oddessy plus and       when oculus   was ready to launch  i had it on the very same day  thx to amazon   the oculus quest   is the best virtual reality headset by far based on the value and it s capabilities  it s not perfect and this industry still has a long way to go but it s way more practical than anything else i have ever tried  this is a headset which gives you options for using it on the go and completely wireless or by connecting it to a powerful pc  you can have one of the most powerful vr headset anyone could dream about  all with a reasonable cost that most people can simply afford  thx to facebook   the headset is very comfortable and light  it s very well designed and has the biggest virtual reality platform  oculus  behind it  you can simply open and use any game and app which is made on steam as well  by using the oculus wire   i would definitely recommend this headset to anyone  have fun and enjoy the technology and endless possibilities      
219,5.0,                       i cannot stress enough how much i love my quest    the visuals are jaw dropping  and the controls are smooth and responsive  being completely wireless and untethered is simply amazing  and now you can wirelessly run pcvr games  so the link cable isn t necessary  as long as you have really good wifi and internet   the quest   makes high end quality vr affordable and accessible and i cannot recommend it enough one of the greatest things about the quest   is that you don t need a television  xbox  playstation  or even a computer to play it   unless you want to play pc games on it  of course lol   it is a completely standalone system with just the headset and the two controllers  and with it s incredible hand tracking  you don t even need the controllers    ok  you do need the controllers  because  unfortunately  the remote less hand tracking is unique to the quest and there aren t many games that support it yet  it s still a fun little gimmick to play with  though there are two cons to the system  however  in my experience  one is that the default headset strap makes it very front heavy  which can get uncomfortable after extended periods of use the second is that the battery only lasts about     hours at a time before needing recharged both of these issues can be resolved with the replacement pro strap accessory that has the added battery pack in the back tl dr  very good for very cheap     
220,5.0,                       i can t begin to describe how much i ve enjoyed this   the games are fun  i really only purchased it for beat saber  but the immersive  d experience with oculus tv and  d movies has benn amazing   i have an older oculus and i absolutely loved going around the world with google earth   i only hope google earth comes to oculus quest soon then this would be perfect   i watched some guy traveling up everest  not the movie  it was a documentary of sorts  and that experience alone was worth the      because now i don t need to spend money training and going there for myself   seriously   this technology is so cool   you ll need to finagle the eye pieces a bit to get it to look right  but even the sound is super impressive   you can use headphones earbuds or listen right from the unit without   it sounds fantastic   i only got the   gb version which is fine for what i do since i don t plan on playing any huge hardcore games and so far i ve only used like  gb   if you have an extra      lying around   buy this        
221,2.0,                       i had the original oculus quest and loved it but the only issue was that it was uncomfortable and heavy   which is why i was so excited to see the quest   come out  i loved everything about it and up until now i felt it was a   star product and i never really cared about how you needed a facebook account to use your      headset until i realized something  i was about to buy another game on top of the job simulator i already had when i felt worried because i didn t want to spend money and risk losing it if facebook deleted my account  i shouldn t feel this way  now i don t think i will ever fully enjoy the quest   because of that fear of losing all my games  all my money  and all my progress  this had the potential to become something greater   and i m pretty disappointed because the technology was there but so was a way to force people into facebooks ecosystem  edit  i have now changed the review to   stars after the lense was scratched while i used the glasses spacer  i am pretty upset about this so i think you should know in advance to figure out some other way to use your quest without glasses unless you are really careful and want to take the risk  i gave the headset to my dad and put it on his head carefully while he wore his glasses but after he took it off there was an enormous scratch in the center so yeah be careful and i recommend those prescription lense inserts      
222,4.0,summary at the bottom for those who don t want to read the whole review   i was originally looking into getting a vr setup to use occasionally but mainly to give my mother an outlet to do some of the things that she loved doing back before her health started to deteriorate and made her housebound  she was never one who would want the new technology  she still has a flip phone   but the quest made it easy to teach someone with basically zero computer skills how to operate the headset with ease  i used the casting option and put it on my pc so she could watch me and ask questions as we went through everything  after about    minutes of going through a few things  i gave her the headset and she was off playing mini golf and a few other things while enjoying every second of it   i know the whole facebook gathering user data argument is valid and i understand both sides but for my own reasons  this was the best bang for the buck headset that ticked all of the boxes i was looking for  my biggest complaint with fb is them banning accounts with no recourse for the buyer   having something portable and could play pcvr games was a big attention getter for me and i haven t been disappointed in the graphics  compatibility  ease of use  or really had any complaint other than fb now owning oculus and taking away what would have been the go to vr company for years to come   even the included head strap is fairly comfortable  i put on the headset  move either side strap until it clears my ear  and then tighten the straps on both sides equally to try and balance the pressure  it s worked well so far and even after long sessions  i still don t notice any discomfort and if i do  it doesn t last long after the headset is off  i m even more excited for when the games start taking advantage of the higher refresh rate of the display and texture density  it s already convincing in many aspects but the future of vr is looking great   overall verdict   if facebook is a deal breaker for you then get a different headset but if you can get past that  you will absolutely love this gaming experience that will only get better as updates rollout and new developers enter the space  by enabling developer mode  you can use the oculus developer app to get even more power for your wireless experience       also  i ve heard that the elite straps are breaking so if you purchase this headset  wait for a  rd party vendor strap to come out and use the included strap that comes with the headset until then  maybe they will fix the problem but i wouldn t buy the elite strap anyways       pros   amazing display  rivals some       headsets  headphone jack  add in some amazing headphones and feel teleported into an amazing game  movie  or jam out to some awesome music  want more battery life  don t settle for the elite strap s one size battery and just get a  rd party power bank that can expand your playtime even more and doubles as a travel charger for any of your other electronics for sooo much cheaper   hand tracking is improved over the original quest from what others have told me this is my first real vr headset and it worked great for me other than when the cameras only could see part of hands   i ve been playing it daily for a few hours myself and my mother  to see how the controller batteries would handle it and they are still on   dots so i think they ve also improved on power draw since that was a complaint of the original quest owners  the tracking of the controllers didn t seem to suffer either as i haven t had a problem with that even in games like beat saber   the box it comes in is sturdy enough to be used as a decent case until you decide to get a more permanent one and will keep the dust from getting on your lenses   cons   facebook wanting to track everything about everyone and the fact that they can brick your headset at any point without warning and potentially not reverse that decision even if they make a mistake is terrible and there should be a way for customers to hold fb accountable for that  i have to tip my hat to fb purely from a generating user activity standpoint  people were leaving fb left and right  myself included  so they decided to buy up all the companies people were now using   limited amount of accessories and the ones that are available are priced too high  oculus link cable is a joke at     when i can get a high quality usb     gen   for under     which is plenty for crystal clear pcvr gaming  if your pc doesn t have usb     gen    you can still buy an adapter and cable for less than the official cable  official link cable is type c which unless you have a newer motherboard  you probably won t have the port for it and have to buy another expensive adapter   the white color is a dirt magnet so if you want to keep it looking pristine for more than a month  looking into a cover for the headset would be a good idea 
223,2.0,                       the headset itself is very very awesome  the headset is lightweight and easy to carry if you get the case  feels lighter and smaller when compared to oculus quest    the controllers are very good and accurate  although i did have some accuracy problems when using in darker rooms   although it s better in specs compared to oculus quest   but it feels cheaper because it is  the lower price tag reflects in it s build and feel  overall the picture quality and the smooth   hz makes it awesome and better than the first but requiring facebook is a no go in my opinion facebook can and will disable your account and that will render the headset useless  the headset has awesome features but facebook ruined it by having a mandatory facebook account requirement  read a lot of horror stories on internet where people who don t use facebook and made a new account  got their accounts suspended  i do have an old account but i don t use facebook much so i didn t have this problem but buyer beware not recommended just because of facebook requirement  if that is lifted i d recommend it      
224,5.0,                       i ll give my review of the quest    st   then some background info if interested quest    i purchased the    gb model   also opted for the elite head strap with built in battery   carrying case combo deal   which i highly recommend you get as well  the elite head strap is dramatically better in every way than the standard  the integrated battery doubles your play time   you don t notice any weight difference   the official oculus quest   carrying case is well made   it all fits inside perfectly  quest   headset is very noticeably smaller   lighter than the quest and or rift s  the integrated speakers sound great   are also a notable improvement  the resolution is so crisp   clear  everything runs considerably faster too quest   with oculus link works perfectly   honestly better than my rift s does in case you are not aware  fb has stated that go  quest   are no longer being sold  rift s will be discontinued next year as well  going forward there will only be   headset  with different storage options  background info my  st headset was the oculus go  which i thought was awesome  the one thing i didn t like was you still needed a rift to play pc games  so when the quest   rift s came out  i jumped all over the rift s  the pc games were mind blowing  but i missed the portability of the go  then fb comes out with oculus link which allows the quest to also play pc games  essentially making it a rift s on demand   i was so mad  because this left rift s owner s like myself feeling cheated  now fb is discontinuing the rift line all together   going forward will only have   headset  oculus link eliminated the need for a pc specific headset      
225,1.0,                       i can play games and stuff just fine within the system itself  the thing i m looking to do is play games through steam vr which i have done before using the oculus quest    the only thing giving me issues is installing the oculus setup onto my computer    i have spent   hours trying to install it but it says to restart my pc and failed to install every single time  this is an issue that many other people are having and none of the solutions seem to work  i am very upset with this and am angry on how difficult it is to resolve it with no success      
226,3.0,                       i can t believe i m writing this  i was so excited for the improved chipset  resolution  and memory  but the move to an lcd screen has removed any dark black color  for example  one of my favorite apps is skybox vr  which lets you watch movies in a virtual movie theater  this looked great on the original quest  but on quest   the theater doesn t look dark  but rather appears as though it s filled with fog  this also makes it difficult to make out the details of the environment the lack of springs on the strap mounts  as well as the narrower width of the headset  are two other drawbacks  i wear glasses  and they claim it supports frames up to    mm wide  but mine are     and always get stuck in the headset as i m removing it because they re snug against the inside of it maybe once we get some games which make use of the better processor things will seem different  but as for now  these are some major issues      
227,3.0,                       so let me explain what i do likeit s very comfortable to wear and to put on us very easy  i do like the handles make sure to place the wristlets in your wrist if not you may be buying a tv now what i don t likewhen this was advertised it was marketed with fitness and more  free games and some paid ones  however what is free is demo versions only  fitness is only for people that are physically fit already  no beginners and nothing for free  it s        and up  you really have to know some abc s on the basics of virtual if not it will frustrate the mess out of you  thank god i have teenagers in the house  it s very important to pay attention to the instructions and read them  i wanted to experience it and later noticed i had it in for more than an hour  i started having some eye discomfort as the first few days they advise    minutes or less my main reason for returning it is because the free items are demo only and there is no beginners fitness and the        monthly is to advance for me  so i returned it     
228,4.0,update               oculus rift cv   s  quest  and now  quest   owner here  each iteration has been an improvement from the previous one  some step ups were more obvious than others  and depending on how you value your dollar  the upgrades might not always measure up to your expectations  however  at this price point there shouldn t be much of anything standing in your way of buying it    especially if you are new to vr or have an older model and are merely looking for the best visual experience in a wireless setup  the quest   reigns supreme in this category   pros     resolution   amazing clarity  upping the pixel density once again has just made it that much easier for me to suspend my disbelief  this time  though  the jump is grand  at      x      per eye  this is by far the best reason of snagging up an oculus quest    the color is vivid and lines are crisp  when we re talking vr  lcd offers a cleaner image over oled  who d a thunk  right  you have to remember  the lenses are magnifying the screen  so how the individual pixels are arranged do make a difference  and the lcd layout is more compact than an oled  yes  you do loose a little contrast having  brighter blacks  from the required backlighting on the lcd  but he trade off means not having to deal with those pesky god rays or that screen door effect     refresh rate   very smooth  even at the default   hz  in the beta settings there s a   hz option    potentially putting this wireless version back up to where we d expect to see only the tethered units     tracking   right on par with the quest   and very close to the rift s  there s no beating constellation tracking like we had on the cv   but they ve come a long way to make inside out tracking work amazingly well  the accelerometers in the hand controllers pick up where the cameras  fov leaves off   giving us a perceived tracking on the far outside and behind the head  because we are relying on algorithms essentially  guessing  where the controllers are in these extreme regions  you may notice a twitch or two while pulled back with your bow or aiming a tightly shouldered sub machine gun  i should also touch on hand tracking  pun very much so intended  lol   here  you can ditch the controllers and use your hands to manipulate your environment  there aren t a lot of supported titles yet  but that will likely change over time  naturally  you loose the accelerometer aided tracking you get with the controllers  but the cameras do track the hands and each finger individually    so long as you re able to keep them within the cam s fov     guardian   this feature received a nice upgrade as well  the pass though feature kicks in to present the outside world to the viewer when one steps outside a user defined boundary  this time  however  the b w video feed is aligned more accurately than before and it is far less grainy  setup of the boundary is very simple and if the room changes  ie  furniture moves or heaps of dirty laundry find their way inside the boundary  the device displays the new obstacles as soon as you put the headset on and ya verify guardian boundary     controllers   they have a more robust and girthy feel    much like the ones that were included with the earlier cv  and developer models  i never had any issues with my battery covers being loose like others reportedly had on previous models  but  there s no question these covers aren t going anywhere for those of you with concerns  it s funny how people get used to something being one way and hate change    because when the s and quest came out  everyone hated how small and flimsy the new controllers felt  here  they go back to the original size and ya got a whole new group upset at how large these feel  haha     comfort   significantly lighter than its predecessors  the head strap isn t as easy to adjust as the others  but the elastic straps are thick and seem to keep the headset in place well enough  the padding that rests against your face is soft and cushioning  but i can t really say it s as rugged as the quest    time will tell how it will hold up     purchases   oculus home purchases crossover seamlessly from quest   to quest       link cable   plugging into one s high end gaming pc opens this thing up to surpassing the rift s in clarity and allows the same sharing of content     audio   we can use our own headphones  the    mm headphone jack gives us the option to enhance what s being output through its standard amplifier  so get yourself a nice pair of sony  bose  or sanheisers    really any of  em are better than the factory option and will slide easily over the elastic straps   cons     audio   it suffices  but it s no secret that there s plenty of room for improvement here  i believe i m picking up a slightly better bass response  but there s a definite tin can shrillness snuck somewhere in the mid to high end frequencies  it s very off putting  not sure if this is title based  hardware  or speaker placement  the rift s and quest   suffered through this early on too  so i would not be surprised if we see a firmware upgrade soon     ipd   glad to see the inter pupillary distance settings are still mechanical  but sadly  they limit the user to only three variations          and   mm   this is probably ample enough for most users  but there may be those who fall between the cracks and may notice regions of the screen that aren t as refined  ipd is where the rift s completely fell short  software adjustment moved the displayed image  not the lenses   so quest   is still way better than that  i absolutely loved the way quest   handled this adjustment  having its gradual slider on the outside   but the additional linkage would equate to a higher cost  my ipd is   mm  so i fall between the    and    notches  my brain eyes seem to adjust to the variance just fine and i have yet to get a headache from it  it is a good idea to speak with your optometrist  they may provide you with your exact ipd number  know that most will tell you that   a millimeter or two won t cause any harm  if you are taking your own ipd measurements  then the margin of error will likely fluctuate that much anyway  and  if you are just trying what  feels right  then you can throw precision completely out the window  the latter is what most people were doing anyway  so the three settings encompass most everyone right from the get go  if you re getting headaches  this could be the cause  but there are other factors to consider  could be the refresh rate  the fov  spacing between eyes and lens  peripheral vision  or even how hard your brain is working to focus on distant objects that really aren t distant  if you get headaches watching  d movies  then vr headsets will probably give you headaches too     glasses wearers   the included spacer helps  but depending on your frames and lenses  there s still a chance for rubbing  the contact will scratch both the oculus lenses and my coated polycarbonate rx lenses  seeking  rd party solutions in this area is a priority for me  update  i found these silicone spacer things that snap on to the oculus lenses and work great  no scratches now     color   i m an adult that takes care of their equipment  but even so i sweat during physically intense gameplay  it s true that no matter the color  sweat saturated fabric and foam portions of the headset will get nasty and require periodic cleaning and disinfecting  but i imagine the light stuff is eventually gonna  start to discolor    clean or not  if you have filthy children teens  or simply don t practice good hygiene yourself  the light grey might not be a good friend to you     facebook   yeah  ya gotta  link a facebook account to the headset  to be fair  it does say so in the description    ya ll read that before making your purchase  right  if any of us still think anonymity exists anywhere within the digital landscape of the internet  then i think we d do well re read the user agreements on all our connected devices  lol  yeah  it ain t great  and i m by no means a fan of this move  but what are our alternatives  update  as of late  i m hearing that if fb renders your social media account invalid  it essentially bricks all our oculus headsets  that is pretty messed up if there s no other workaround  i d be upset too  i mean  if i purchased the hardware and all the games    to be denied it s use due to some outside influences  should equate to a refund of monies spent at the very least  personally  i have had no issues  hopefully tech support hears the cry of the people and they fix this quickly  at least we re free from paid subscriptions with this thing    for now anyway     purchases   as mentioned earlier  oculus home purchases crossover seamlessly from quest   to quest    now  when moving from rift s to the quest  whether or not that requires the end user to purchase the title a second time  is left up to the producer  what is frustrating is having all purchases linked to one single account  of the three headsets we have in the household  each needs linked to a separate fb account if we wish to play with against one another in multiplayer modes  thus  forcing us to purchase the same title three times in order to make  in home multiplayer  happen  update  this now appears to be title related as one game i own   walkabout mini golf  let s me play against one another simultaneously on all three my headsets    this is legit    i can see my daughter and her friend on the same putting green i m playing on and we can all run around the map while waiting our turn   the moot     cooling fan   when playing processor heavy titles  the cooling fan will kick on and there s no disguising it  yup  that is a fan i hear  but whatever  good airflow in an enclosed system makes a sound    albeit  it is not loud by any stretch of the word  again  it s merely a small trade off for having more processing power strapped to your face     the mic  everyone seems to be able to hear me just fine when i talk  granted  it s no r de or sennheiser  but i didn t expect it to be  it accepts all the sound waves i spew at it just fine  the only time i hear something weird is when someone doesn t have their mic headphone levels set correctly    giving us that robotic reverb  annoying feedback  or just cuts out  but that is the case with any headset  you weren t planning on using it for voice over work or laying down vocal tracks on your next single  right  any of you who can tell a major difference in mics    idk what to say  if we re completely honest  none of these headsets have  amazing audio  hardware  so    take it as you will and let s get back to focusing on the meat and potatoes     direct sunlight can burn the screen and or harm the cameras  is that any real surprise though    the lenses are just magnifying glasses   think of how those ants felt when ya burnt them under the summer sun  for shame  again  go to the oculus site and read up on the product you purchased for details  but the gist of it is   using it outside at noon is a bad idea      doesn t function in complete darkness or very well in extremely dim light  theses aren t ir cameras  they re optical cameras and require light for the sensors to detect  well  light  so i turn a light on and i m good to go  the quest   now indicates when it s too dark with a popup letting you know  tracking gets finicky in oversaturated rooms  or those with too many windows and or mirrors  some lighting emits a specific frequency  as with some crappy fluorescent and lower end led lighting  if the pulses happen to phase up to your devices  you may notice some  glitching      battery life   it is as described  because of the increased performance  it doesn t last as long as the quest    external battery options are available  or  you can always get a long usb c cord and plug it in while you play  no  it ain t cordless at that point  but it gets me by if i m not ready to be done   a little prelude  at the end of the review   my first experience with an actual vr headset was in the    s in the vfx   with a resolution of somewhere around      per eye      colors at a time  awful tracking movement latency  and a frame rate that had us calling it the  tunnel vision migraine machine   any of today s headsets are like a dream come true in comparison  these early devices were a novel concept but limited to a handful of playable games like descent  quake  and some flight simulator whose title escapes me  ok  sure    until you d succumb to the headache or crashed dos  whichever came first  lol   so  although we may be able to pick these current products apart to find their flaws  i m still thrilled to be able to use any of these devices  they are exponentially more capable and affordable than their pre      predecessors    heck  even our lowest end cell phone vr rigs have more processing power than the pcs we were tethered to back then  depending on one s level of entitlement  expectation  and or brand loyalty  you can draw your own conclusions  i ve given you mine 
229,5.0,                       so  i used to be a fairly avid gamer  but i haven t played much of anything in well over a decade  the common excuses of life  family  career  etc  certainly all apply  but tbh  the real culprit has just been lack of interest  as in  great  here comes another mmorpg  or shoot  em up war   zombie fps that s incrementally better than the last dozen that preceded it and will require another       video card upgrade     hrs to figure out how to play  and exacerbate the rss endemic of anyone who s spent their career in it      yawn   and then someone let me use their oculus quest   last weekend   after which i immediately purchased one   i haven t been awed by anything gaming related in  well    the last time was probably the first  dfx voodoo   card    years ago  i dunno  i tried the original rift  ish years ago  and while it was novel  it just didn t grab me  maybe it was the lower resolution  or i tried the wrong titles  but the immersion wasn t there  this thing on the other hand    wow  msfs      in vr is amazing      
230,1.0,                       let me start by saying i really like this headset from a hardware perspective  i upgraded from an original htc vive to a rift s last year  which i replaced with this headset this year  the screen looks great with basically zero screen door effect  there are still some god rays in certain lighting conditions but it is never so bad as to distract from the experience  the controller batteries last forever compared to pervious controllers i ve used  kudos to them on this the reason i am making my review so low is the closed ecosystem  when you buy a smartphone  you pay a large sum up front for a device  but there is a nearly infinite number of free apps to keep you distracted or productive for hours at no extra cost  unless you buy in app purchases  there are also higher quality apps that have a price tag on them  but these are optional by default  the oculus quest has enough free content to keep you engaged for maybe an hour  and most of the apps are literally five minute demos of full games  if you want to buy all the best games  it s gonna be hundreds more dollars out of your pocket this is because oculus very closely vets what games can be in it s store  in order to assure quality or some nonsense answer like that  lots of good developers have had their games excluded for basically no reason  as a software developer myself  i can t imagine how much it would hurt if i spent months developing a game just to have it rejected from the store  i guess there is nothing inherently wrong with oculus managing the store how it wants  but there have been lots of shadier practices as well  for example  they push back against apps like bigscreen in favor of their own  infinite office  product  which you can t even get yet by the way   and they push back against certain fitness tracking apps in favor of their own app  i won t go as far as to accuse them of plagiarism but they are facebooking it real hard with the anticompetitive attitude  and i bet zuck is proud of them because of this zuckery  devs find other ways to distribute their apps  there is a service called sidequest that allows you to sideload games onto your quest    and without it this device is kind of pointless  all the oculus store rejects gather there  and  many of the great games on sidequest are completely free  but the process of installing sidequest may be a bit difficult for non technical folks  involving weird steps like creating a developer account there is also steam vr  to play all your favorite games you bought already  but really  if the device has     gigs of storage now  why can t i just install steamvr onto the headset itself and play directly from there  why must i pay    dollars for a link cable to play the vr games i already own  including ones from oculus store   yep  that s a thing too  luckily it isn t all bad  you can pay    dollars for a bootleg link cable that will fail after a week  i can t even stress enough how few good games are available without sideloading or using oculus link  even on the back of the box  the games they advertise are beatsaber  which has been around since i got my vive almost four years ago  the climb  which has been around even longer  the next star wars game they made  again nothing really new  some eye candy with a star wars theme  and three other games that are actually new  even the box itself hilariously demonstrates the lack of good games because half of them are newer versions of games that already existed  pretty sure the rift s box had more games on it but i d have to dig it out of the closet to confirm additionally i ve heard other developers say that there is no reason for this device not to run android apps natively  on a flat screen in  d space of course   since it is basically an android device  i m not sure whether this is actually feasible  i m sure oculus would say it isn t  but it would drastically increase the amount of stuff you can do with your device one last rant  the passthrough mode where you can see your surroundings is great  except there is no way to permanently turn it on  by default it turns on when you leave your play space  and you can set it as your menu environment to have it always on as long as you be a good boy and stay in your play area  but as you begin to get further away from your play area  it darkens the screen until it completely turns off and finally tells you to turn around as you flail like an idiot in pitch dark or take the headset off  i want to be able to go grab a water bottle in the next room without taking it off  and yet there is no way to do this without making and enormous play space that takes up your whole house floor  i just can t understand why  especially with an untethered headset  why they don t trust us to go five feet from the play area  with the improved quality cameras  there is a zero percent chance of me running into anything  at least as long as they are turned on  so why then is it a feature to turn them off while you are walkibg around  facebook literally treats you like cattle  stay in your enclosure  oh  and if you turn off the guardian completely  the passthrough is just always complete darkness  thanks for that  this frustrates me more than anything else and that makes me sad  this headset makes me sad  i don t like being sad  so i don t like this headset but i will continue to use it because it s pretty and mark really needs those  d scans of my living room that are tied to my identity because you must use a facebook account to log in oh yeah have you heard about th     
231,1.0,                       must read    you cannot play multiplayer on the oculus if you have two oculus under one facebook account  they want you to purchase the game separately to play  to take more money from the user  once an account is linked to the oculus  guess what it s like marriages  it s linked forever  if you have two oculus under the same account you cannot play multiplayer    to play multiplayer the both people must on their own oculus    facebook is taking your data and selling it  we have to stop them     
232,2.0,                       i upgraded from a rift s and an original quest  and while the performance seems better overall  the controllers redesign is a fail for me i m a woman but i don t have particularly small hands  the increased thickness of the controllers make my grip feel less secure  because i m basically only gripping with my pinky  i have to press the controller handle against my palm because my pinky and ring fingers won t wrap around the controller  it also often makes me accidentally press the grip button i hope i can get used to it  and just because of the controllers  the quest   is a huge disappointment  the controller fit is so incredibly important  and they ruined it because they probably didn t really think about medium and small hands  i can t even imagine how it would be for a kid  they wouldn t be able to hold it at all      
233,5.0,                       i have also been into vr  at the moment i use a playstation vr and now i have the quest    this this wasnted even on my radar but i say that  fb made a  nd version and it was more than     better but also cheaper  after picking it up and playing with it for a few days i have been hooked  i can say without a doubt i am in the quest   at least     hrs a day i have spent hours making new friends and hanging out with people on oculus in vr poker  real fishing  big screen beta and multiplayer games hardware is sturdy  visuals are perfect and has zero screen door effect  it s also a lcd display so the blacks aren t the best but because of the lcd it s near  k display and can give you   hz for smooth gameplay  colors are great and looks very accurate to me the inside out tracking and guardian system is      accurate and just works then on top of that you can connect a high speed or the official oculus link cable to your going pc to get even better visuals and better gaming  experience to be on the level of high end vr gamer s and play steam and oculus desktop vr games the controllers are comfortable and so accurate it s scary  you also get hand tracking which works well  the controller battery is amazing  using it for over a week it s still at      i don t what kind of wizardry they have going on but it s great consthe sound quality isn t the best so get some headphones if you want better direction audio  battery life could be better so if you plan on being standalone get the headstrap with battery kit from fb all the controversy with the fb account to be honest is silly because you have to put some email and information on everything you use today so i don t care last thing il say is that all the things fb when cheap on like speakers and headstrap  not adding link cable and hardcase is so that they can add better hardware for a much smoother gaming and social experience      
234,5.0,                       there is very little i can say here that hasn t already been said  except i love this vr headset     i ve owned several vr headsets before  and this is the best one on the market  and fortunately it s very reasonably priced too   if you haven t yet discovered vr  buy this immediately   it s perfect  not only for hardcore virtual reality enthusiasts or gamers  but also the beginner   it s very intuitive to operate  to learn and understand   no pc needed   no wires   no external cameras you have to mount all over the walls   just take it out of the box and start having fun   you can play amazingly immersive games  watch  d movies  or  d     degree or     degree videos  adult content  family friendly content  amazing creativity and artistic apps  educational experiences  relaxation and meditation experiences  attend concerts  go to virtual movies with other people and interact socially with others in many ways   you can use the controllers  or in many cases use your hands  it tracks the position of your hands wonderfully    you can even connect it wirelessly to your computer and have a virtual keyboard in vr that matches your own keyboard  and type on it   amazing   the list of what you can do with the oculus quest   is huge  and growing fast   don t be left out of all the fun   buy this now      
235,1.0,                       mandatory facebook login is a total dealbreaker  if you care about online privacy  give this one a pass      
236,2.0,                       ive had alot of fun with this thing  it was my first vr headset  soon as i tried it out i noticed it was kinda blurry no matter how i adjusted the headset  but i was so amazed by vr that i let it slide and bought a few games  then i downloaded sidequest and tried to up the graphics settings  didnt make much of a difference  i downloaded the oculus software on my pc and tried plugging it in with a brand new anker cable and it says that it couldnt be upped passed the default   hz and that my computer only had usb     ports  my computer itself says that the ports are      i looked on reddit and even people with the exspensive link cord were having the same problem    i tried playing boneworks and the headset seems like it can barely handle it  when i turn my head theres black screen tearing pretty often even on some games off of the oculus store and on my computer screen the game looks crystal clear but on the oculus its pretty darn blurry  almost to the point that it hurts my eyes  same thing with anyland i can barely even read anything but on the computer screen it looks great  earlier the remotes randomly disconnected while i was trying to play and the screen wouldnt turn when id turn my head  i couldnt get them to reconnect until i hard rebooted it  then the same thing happened again  so yeah this thing sketches me out big time  i looked on reddit and theres a ton of other people talking about how horrible the graphics are on it   i would return it and get somthing else but i have spent like      on games and accessories for it    its to late to get refunds on the games sadly   so im not really sure what i should do at this point      
237,2.0,                       i bought this device as an upgrade for my oculus rift s  in its default state  the only improvements i got from the rift s was the finger tracking within the menu system and a better display  the straps that come with the quest   remind me of a baseball cap on sale that feels okay to wear initially but becomes more uncomfortable and constricting the longer you wear it  after upgrading to the battery less elite strap  thankfully this problem was for the most part alleviated as far as the battery  on average i get     hours of playtime  coming from a pcvr headset i expected to be stifled in this department but if this is your only headset expect your headset to die and find other things to occupy your time while it charges the display is crisp  the upgrade in graphics was one of the single most influential pros that led to my decision to upgrade  unfortunately  being that it is a standalone device  the display does get very warm and can grow to be hard to ignore as your face sweats from the heat of the device already sitting that close to your face as far as build quality  the headset is composed of a hardy  durable plastic which some have expressed concerned about  but passes for a light to moderate user who is not careless with their things  i have not seen a drop test of this product but feel good about it dropping from head level without any cosmetic of functional failures one of the biggest concerns about this headset is the lack of ipd adjustment  i do not recommend this product if your eyes are not close to the average persons in terms of pupil to pupil distance  the headset contains a   position slider and since the original rift headset  has been a major oculus drawback for people who may not coincide with one of the three preset distance settings at the end of the day the oculus quest   is a very affordable vr headset and should open the door for a lot of people to experience an at home virtual reality experience  but for me it makes a great decoration on my wall as it watches me enjoy vr through the vessel of my oculus rift s      
238,1.0,                       i tried creating a facebook account with my legal information and for no reason they decided to disable my account  my quest   is now useless for me now and in the future thanks to facebook s restrictions  do not trust this company and do not buy this product      
239,4.0,                       it s the quest  and anyone reading this review should already know what it is and what it does  needless to say the item came well packaged  everything works great  and i have no complaints  i got the    gb because i like tons of movies so will update this if and when anything changes   i still have the original rift        so all of my steam games work fine utilizing virtual desktop but many of the older rift games  oculus  are unplayable on this so expect this if your upgrading from the rift  cross platform should be the norm on every piece of hardware      
240,4.0,                       my son saved up his christmas money and bought this for himself  i ve used it and it s fun and easy enough for an    year old to set up and use with only minimal help  the image is clear and the immersive experience is realistic and engaging the first drawback is that it doesn t come with any games  for this price  it should come with at least one  instead  you must pay around      per game  second  the requirement of a facebook account in order to use it is disappointing  i prefer that my son not be on facebook for numerous reasons  but there is no way around it  finally  the battery life for the controllers is poor  we ve gone through so many aa batteries in a very short amount of time overall  it s great technology  very fun  and i d recommend it with the former caveats      
241,2.0,                       i was super excited for this product  i loved vr  but don t have a gaming computer  and it missed out on getting a quest when it was easily available  so when i saw there was a cheaper quest too i immediately jumped on it and pre ordered  but yeah  this did not live up to even the lowest of my expectations  it is super cheap  but it feels super cheap  the price is an illusion  because you definitely can t rely on the standard head strap and we ll need to spend     to upgrade to the elite strap  and then with my glasses  this means i ll need a fit kit  although the fit kid apparently just has less padding which is barely adequate as it is  the three pd settings are tricky as well  i fall in between two and three  and as a result i m noticing intense eye strain that i did not have on either the quest one or rift  i was so excited  i waited an eternity for this to come out  now i m just sad and disappointed      
242,1.0,                       can t give it to a kid   can t share the device with others   why   because it s tied to your personal facebook account these would be great in schools and other settings  but the facebook account requirement means it s no go      
243,1.0,                       experienced vr user here  have   other headsets  follow instructions  comes up to a blank screen  on but nothing displayed   hunted on oculus forums  reddit  etc  nothing useful   tried pairing with ipad and android  no change   many factory resets  can even  cast  to another device   cast a blank screen   support ticket says   days to respond    brand new device not working  two days to learn i will need to return it nothing about the device provides feedback  occasional bweep bwoop or bweep bweep   controllers vibrate from what i ve seen online  when it works out of the box  it is pretty straight forward   not my experience      
244,5.0,                       i have tried the first oculus quest vr at a friends house and ever since then i wanted this   i put it off for awhile and glad i did because now i have this and its another world   i love it  i m getting more exercise and i love the art and crafting games and i cant wait to shoot zombies  i also love the exploring games where i can travel the world while still being in my living room  i hesitated though for a week or so because i did not like that it would be attached to facebook but i got over it   i love it   its so much fun    i cant wait to try more games      
245,5.0,                       just a quick look at the specs and the price are enough to know that this is an incredible deal  but nothing prepares you for the experience itself  i upgraded to the quest   from the vive pro  which cost me more than   times as much as the quest    and the former wipes the floor with the latter  what very minimal screen door effect there is is so slight that it is quickly ignored by the brain   something impossible with lower resolution or oled screens  so immersion is on another level to previous generations of headset  this immersion will be further enhanced by apps supporting the controller free hand tracking mode  which literally brings your hands into vr  the forthcoming infinite office s ability to similarly bring a physical keyboard into vr will hopefully be extended to support keyboards other than the logitech k    demonstrated so far      
246,5.0,                       amazing device  blew my mind with its graphics  this happens to be my intro to vr  i would recommend for anyone  i get motion sickness from games where you actually have to move around without moving around so watch out for that  games on oculus are much more affordable than your standard console games while being more fun in my opinion  i highly recommend job simulator as a first game  my   only gripes are the speakers and hand tracking  the console tracks controllers like a charm  both sitting and standing  but hand tracking only fully works while standing and even then is prone to many bugs if you move too fast  en masse  i highly  highly  recommend this device to anyone with even a sliver of interest in trying vr      
247,1.0,                       got this a week ago  waiting for facebook to contact me to get my account verified  sent facebook my drivers licence  utility bills  ect and nothing  i have not even opened the box  oculus was great in their contact  i have   older oculus vr s so i had a account with them  i have no choice but to wait  oculus can not help  if this does not get resolved soon  i will send it back and kiss oculus devices goodbuy forever       for a toy i can t use  imagine getting a new iphone    and apple required you to get a apple messenger account to use  you apply and they thank you and say they will get back  and nothing  no reply  no way to contact to see if there is a problem  also  what if you have a problem in the future  no way to contact      
248,1.0,                       was great the first day i had it  on day two the fan became extremely loud  i thought maybe the headset was just getting too warm so i gave it plenty of time to cool down but the noise was still there as soon as i turned it back on  noise continued to get worse until it was very obvious at anything but max volume and also got worse whenever you turned your head  do a quick search online and you ll see that several users are having this issue      
249,1.0,                       i cannot complete setup of the unit because it is asking for a facebook account  i have an oculus account but do not have a facebook account  upon signing up for a new facebook account they want a copy of my id  no thank you  after researching this it seems all your activity on your oculus is shared by default and you have to specifically turn it off  furthermore  if your facebook account is deactivated for your own privacy or safety reasons  like domestic violence  you will lose all your oculus purchases  this is just insane  will be sending this back  sorry amazon  this isn t your fault but i m not keeping a device which i cannot use without letting facebook  d map the inside of my house      
250,5.0,                       this just arrived  we love it   we ve had experience with the earlier version of ocular quest  and this one is just as good  but also better in some ways  the hand grips are comfortable  and the goggles have a good range of vision in all directions  i personally like the white color better than the original black color  but i know that doesn t relate to performance the oculist quest   performs well  responds rapidly  and gives a great vr experience  it s fairly easy to use  and comes with a few games to get you started  with    gbs  it offers more than the earlier quest models i purchased this as a gift for my son  and after just one day  we are both enjoying it  i may get another for myself      
251,5.0,                       it really is better than the first oculus quest  it does have better performance and better pixle rate  it also is smaller      
252,5.0,                       the oculus quest   is truly next gen  i have been a life long gamer for the past    years  beginning with atari  i have upgraded to the newest consoles whenever a new one was released  i did this up to the ps   then kind of lost interest in games as i began to get bored of the graphics updates and not much else with the way      went  i no longer had my normal stress   exercise outlets  i heard good things about the quest     decided to get one a week after launch  as soon as i put it on  my mind was blown  i instantly transported to a different universe when i did the first steps tutorial  the experience was amazing  the controllers felt comfortable   intuitive  the headset took a little adjustment to get comfortable  but wasn t horrible  i definitely suggest upgrading to the elite strap or other  rd party add on  like i did  to made the headset more comfortable   less  front heavy  the games are all reasonably priced with plenty of free games   experiences  there are routine sales in the oculus store  so keep an eye on your wishlist games   pick them up when they are on sale  most games are between     and      one of my favorite games is walkabout mini golf and is only     at full price but offers an amazing mini golf experience with high replayability i find that i ll get about   hours of battery life out of the headset  but have extended that to about   hours with the use of a power bank i ve read a lot of people complaining about the facebook login requirement  but this is greatly exaggerated  these are the same people who don t realize their phones are already spying on them with or without facebook  i ve been in the technology industry for    years   realize that all my data is already being mined by many companies    it s the price of using technology there is a bit of an adjustment period to vr known as  getting your legs  which is similar to getting your sea legs  i found this was about a week or   before my brain understood the vr world was not real life  i do stick to mostly comfortable games where the movement is by teleport action since i ve had real life motion sickness in the past  fortunately  there are a lot of comfortable games available to people who are prone to moron sickness  for example  arizona sunshine offers teleport movement   i experienced zero motion sickness  my friends   family who tried the quest   were blown away  my mother  in her    s  thinks it s amazing  my friends bought a quest     we now hang out in vr  it really feels like we are hanging out in person  which is really fun if you are on the fence based on some of the negative reviews  i highly recommend the purchase  i haven t had this much fun with a new  console  since opening my super nintendo xmas morning   popping in street fighter   back in the    s      
253,5.0,                       i had previous exposure to virtual reality  vr  with the oculus go at a local library and was impressed with the illusion of  d immersion  i was never particularly interested in gaming consoles like xbox  playstation  or wii during our current sheltering in place  the facility where i was regularly playing ping pong table tennis closed  coincidentally i was hearing about the release of oculus quest   in october and that there was a program called eleven for playing vr ping pong  this was the motivating factor behind my decision to purchase the quest    eleven is engaging enough that i can work up a film of sweat while playing and  in the absence of the real thing  i m really enjoying it  note  eleven requires a minimum of      x      feet of clear space to play if you re thinking of jumping into the vr experience  quest   provides a solid introduction  setup is very easy using the oculus mobile app  unlike the oculus rift which needs to be tethered to a computer  after setting it up  the quest   is completely stand alone in addition to programs that are available for purchase  quest   provides access to a lot of free content including programs that are handy for getting used to the vr environment  and vr videos that use  d immersion technology  many of the videos fall short of the resolution provided by hd or  k tv but again  the illusion of immersion more than makes up for that after a few rousing games of ping pong in eleven  i ll sit down to cool off and let myself be amazed by the other vr experiences that quest   offers  it s pretty fabulous      
254,5.0,                       this is just the perfect headset   price wise  quality wise  convenience wise a standalone portable headset  which you don t need a pc or a smartphone to use  with only       high enough resolution so that no sde  good sound and mic to really enjoy  so easy to set up  what else you need moreover  if you have a powerful pc  you can play all the games in steamvr   the quest store alone has a lot of games apps enough to satisfy your appetite  and you have sidequest  which has literally   x more games apps compared to quest store watching youtube  flat  using quest   is really enjoying  watching  dof movie  where you can walk inside the movie  is mind blowing  playing games using  dof where you can walk around  pick up stuffs using both of your hands  are crazy immersive  all of this with only       go grab one now      
255,5.0,                       i upgraded from quest   and there are many things that are different  the most irritating part for me is that the controlles are not as comfortable as quest    i play a lot of beat saber at expect  levels so i immediately noticed that the controlles are not as accurate as the first generations  i missed a few notes that i usually don t miss  additionally  controlles are too bulky for my hands and the home button is usually where i rest my thumb so i frequently touch the wrong buttons  it definitely will take me some time to get used to it  hope future software updates can help increase the tracking accuracy other than that  the graphics are definitely better  images are sharper and there are fixed ipd positions so never have to worry about the annoying ipd sign pop up during beat saber again      
256,1.0,                       the device itself is awesome   the titles and things you can do are pretty good   i think it obviously needs more content   the navigation is awesome   the  lobby  where you browse titles is really cool my biggest gripe is this facebook integration   i don t like that at all  why should i need a facebook account to use this device   why should this device have anything to do with my existing facebook account   i created a  burner  facebook account but didn t realize for the phone app that it will basically more or less force you to use your existing facebook app login it s partly privacy because fb is terrible about privacy  but it s also just the weirdness of connecting some device like this with a facebook account   i disabled all interactivity between my fb account and the oculus but i don t trust that fb isn t collecting data through the oculus   which is just weird      
257,5.0,                       i bought this for my almost   yo son   since the pandemic he hasn t been able to participate in any sports   he was getting depressed and was very lonely   i was hesitant to introduce yet another screen but this has been a life saver figuratively and possibly literally   the set up was easy  he plays for hours each day with people and i monitor the chats  you never know if there s crazy people out there    he s physically active  visiting places all over the world  and playing all kinds of sports virtually   the games can be pricey as well but i just assign extra chores so he can earn more money and buy the games   totally worth the investment      
258,2.0,                       trying to cast using the worthless     cable is useless  tried to cast to a laptop  phone or tablet did not work   streaming over facebook also did not work at least the kids don t mind the setbacks now my immediate feeling is that it promises a lot just to piss you off   horrible user interface  nothing is easy and if your laptop or pc does happen to carry a usb c it doesn t mean it will work i hope you have far better luck  my money would have been better invested in the ps  or xbox      
259,1.0,                       clear when you look only strait but if you dont move your head and look around everything gets blurry as soon as your eyes leave the center and gets worse and worse farther your eyes go from the very center huge flaw in that design  super disappointment    head strap is hard to adjust and face cushion absorbs all your set making it gross when sharing with your sweety friend cus you cant whip it off in a second like cushions in the gym seats  has to air dry for an hour or two  ugh    get it together oculus     
260,5.0,                       the oculus quest   is the real deal  it has clear visuals  a snappy interface  excellent stationary and roomscale tracking  and ergonomic controllers new games  apps  and experiences get added to the oculus store every week  so you ll never run out of things to do  also  if you have a high end pc  you can even play pc vr games like half life alyx  skyrim vr  and fallout   vr by picking up the link cable or wirelessly  using the virtual desktop app  the only negative i can see with this headset is the requirement to have a facebook account in order to use it  but that wasn t a big deal for me  the battery life also isn t spectacular  so i d recommend picking up the elite headstrap with battery pack if you plan on playing for more than   hours at a time overall  this is an amazing vr headset for the price  if you re on the fence about picking this up  just buy it  you won t be disappointed      
261,5.0,                       my family and i love it  listen  all these negituve reviews about having to have a favebook account are true  but ao what  i ve had a facebook account for almost a decade and havent had it banned once  selling my info  so what  i search for a product and then products i m interested in show up in my feed  great as for the headseat  it s so much fun to feel like your wielding a lightsaber with darth vader towering over you  for an old socom ps    player plus a gun nut like me to play onward is an amazing experience  the rest of the games the family loves pros the strap it comes with works for everyone in my family  not buying an upgraded headstrap for   bucks the headset is lightweight and you wont really notice it when you are playing cons you want to get a longer cable then what comes with the device  not the     one that is made for it  i found a   ft one on amazon for      ugreen usb c to usb c   i also use a     one it takes over an hour to charge and only has a  hr play time  we use a little backpack with a portible charger to prolong the playtime if you do not mind the facebook situation  buy one and be amazed by your vr experience     
262,5.0,                       i have owned the rift  rift s  and the original quest  this quest   is by far the best out of them all  i have the       computers to run the  higher end  headsets and i sold all of them after playing this headset  i am very picky when it comes to my vr experience and i just am beside myself   this is the wireless headset that we have been waiting for  if you love vr but don t have the time to setup sensors or hate running wires everywhere  buy buy buy   the graphics and stability are much better than any oculus headset out  the multiplayer games are phenomenal  the only possible thing i can say is that the rift s is very comfortable  the quest   is comfortable and doesn t pose an issue  however it is not quite as plush as the rift s  nonetheless do not buy the rift s    this thing blows it out of the water in almost every category      
263,5.0,                       this is almost a perfect product  but i had a steam issue right out of the box  i contacted oculus and they said i should buy anti fogging spray to stop the fogging   so to get around the design problem be prepared to shell out for  anti fog spray or wipes  i eventually got a silicone protector with a nose guard and i no longer have the problem  it would have been nice to have that from the start  like the psvr headset i ordered a suitable oculus link usb c cable for     and got the oculus link working  the biggest challenge was the amd gpu drivers  the latest drivers prevented the oculus link working  i thought it was a problem with the cable   but no   it was the drivers all along  spent hours on this issue     so if you have this issue   roll back the amd gpu drivers  search the web for full solution  this is a great product though and so glad i ordered it  it gave me headaches at first   but i got used to it now  it is like having two products   the wireless quest mode and the rift mode   which works with a host of pc applications i am so happy with the performance in hl alex and other steam games   the quest   games are also great and i am a big fan of the wireless experience  i also love the way i can buy the rift version of a game and also get the quest version  or the other way around   google vr is mind blowing  some of the fitness apps really get me sweating the strap is ok  there are videos on how to get this right  i am sure the elite strap is great   but good luck finding it in stock  i also don t feel like paying another       with the drawbacks i would give     stars   but there is nothing else like it on the market and there is so much you can do with this thing   so i will give it a full   stars  would love for all my family to get one so we can all meet up in the cloud and chat        
264,1.0,                       i guess i should have realized that being controlled by facebook means i have to register and then allow access to my phone s info to facebook  i quit facebook a while ago  and i have no wish to go back and even less to give them access to any information on my phone  i was looking forward to the product and am sending it back tomorrow      
265,1.0,                       bought this for my        yr kids and it forces me to open a facebook account  facebook is for    and older so it s an egg chicken situation the app is needed more than you think  so if you sign in with fb account in the kid s ipad they ll have access to your facebook account in each crappy game or app they have on their phone my kid downloaded fb and had immediate access to the account stay away from it if you value your kid s privacy and you want them to stay away from social networks     
266,1.0,                       i was willing to accept the fact that i needed a facebook account to use this  wasn t thrilled that facebook could brick your device at any point if they decided your profile violated tos in any way  what made me return the oculus is the fact that you can t use multiple fb accounts on one headset without completely wiping it before signing into a different account  oculus facebook would like every person in the household to have their own headset  apparently there are  plans  to develop a multiple sign on feature that was announced in august but there are no updates on that progression  i think it s ridiculous that a social media site can dictate what i can do with a product i pay for  but i m not playing that game      
267,2.0,                       if you dont have a doctorate in computer science  prepare for this to take   hours and at least   migraine for every adult present  in facebook s infinite wisdom  it doesnt take into account that you may have more than   child and that you just might buy each of them their own headset  from the headache of trying to create them a facebook account to not being able to log into oculus from anywhere but facebook  this was a nightmare of epic proportions  there is no reason for you to have to have   accounts for   device and you cannot switch between these accounts from your moblie device  i had to completely delete facebook from my phone to ever get them logged in  its unnecessarily complicated and given the choice to do it again  i would have gladly spent the      for   non zuckerberg vr headset and made them share it  if you value your sanity  either pass or only buy        
268,2.0,                            for a vr headset doesn t seem bad  right  well  that would have been the price if the stock head strap that comes with this thing was of decent quality  but it s not  the head strap is made of a really grating elastic band that s pretty obnoxious to get sitting on your head correctly  it digs into your ears  causing physical pain  this leads to why the headset isn t actually      the  elite strap   yes  you need to spend another     to get a better head strap from the same company  which may or may not be why the stock head strap is awful   ok  now we are at       not including tax  well  if you want to play games on your pc through steam  you are going to need to drop another         on a usb c to usb c or a cable  facebook and the oculus team didn t even bother updating oculus link for their new product either  meaning the visual quality of pcvr games looks terrible through link but decent enough in input latency adding programs like virtual desktop or alvr  anyways  that brings the headset up to           at this point  you are probably thinking   well  that s still not too bad   on the contrary  the face foam  the foam where the front of your face sits on to play these games  is of terrible quality and has the texture and firmness of a dish sponge  imagine moving and jumping around for a few hours with a dish sponge scraping your forehead the entire time  welp  that s another         to swap out another uncomfortable component  bringing you up to almost           i really wanted to like this product  but its sole purpose is to play games on the device with the games you download from the oculus quest shop  it s great for that  but i cannot recommend this to anyone looking for a good pcvr setup  get yourself a rift s for that  or if you have money to drop  check out the hp reverb g   which is pretty similar to the valve index for     the price and has valve and microsoft working on it      
269,4.0,                       who doesnt like vr  fun and immersive  stuff for kids and adults  teens particularly love things like beat saber with song packs and first person shooters  adults will love the travelogs and rpgs  want to feel weightless in space or look down while rock climbing  how about a little putt putt  or ride and shoot on a roller coaster  fishing for real fish in south korea or fantasy fish in gorgeous computer ponds environments   the sound is amazing and directional  try out the vr myst or the room  no end to the entertainment  the free travel apps are so cool because how would you ever get to siberia or borneo or   two things i dont care for and therefore cant give five stars is that you must have a facebook account linked to it  warning  if you dont have a real acct then facebook will turn it into a brick paperweight  only adjudication may get it back for you  second  the clarity is usually slightly fuzzy  you must look past this and after a while you dont notice it as much as when first purchased  this has to do with the lenses  you cannot use it in the dark but house lights are fine summing it up  this is a family friendly unit that will have you spending your extra change on games and apps  lots of free stuff for those on a budget  including home base rooms  too fun  there is so much more that i havent mentioned but you can find out yourself      
270,5.0,                       i love the quest     i ve always wanted to get into vr  but it was always too complicated and expensive   finally the quest   made it simple and relatively inexpensive   no cables or sensors   it s all in the headset   and it just works  i have been playing it for a month now for at least a couple of hours a day  and everything has been great  the experiences you can have are like nothing else   it can feel so real and immersive   i love letting other people try and getting to see their reactions   it s awesome   i would definitely recommend it to anyone there are only a couple of negatives i ve run into   one  there a not a ton of games available   there are plenty to keep you busy for a quite a while and there are new ones coming out   but there is not a lot of variety   and i wish bigger games would make vr versions   still worth it though   two  the battery life is not incredibly long   it usually lasts a little over   hours  but sometimes i want to play longer   this can be remedied by getting the elite strap with battery or a third party battery like i did   three  the price of accessories   i couldn t bring myself to pay for the elite strap with battery  even though i wanted it   i did end up buying the elite strap by itself  because the strap that comes with it can get uncomfortable   unfortunately it broke within a week and it took   weeks to get a replacement   that s ridiculous for something that costs as much as it does   it is more comfortable though all in all i still think it is an amazing product and well worth the price      
271,3.0,                       i love this thing   d sound  top res on the market  but gosh its uncomfortable  in app purchasing is insane  and the lenses need some work  the face cover needs waaaay more padding and the head strap needs a complete makeover because its hurts really bad after an hour or so   i hate that their accessories cost as much as the oculus itself and aren t default design upon purchase of the oculus  it makes no sense    little things like that degrade consumer confidence the lenses have a halo affect when not in game and i can t seem to fix even with the pd functions but in game  it seems to disappear which i guess is ok  accessories are extremely limited atm and game selection is very small though it is able to connect to a pc and expand your library but i think if oculus tried hard enough  they could integrate steamvr via cloud servers  idk why they don t imbed xbox apps into the oculus either  if microsoft and oculus worked together and integrated their cloud servers  they would easily overtake playstation when it comes to vr  also  why only white editions     kinda seems like oculus is being very cheap        
272,2.0,                       great clear screen and resolution  would be nice if the ipd was wide enough for me to see it without all the blur  a little disappointed they didn t think it important enough to allow the headset to fit those of us who have already invested in the first quest and thousands of dollars worth of games  seems like both the easiest feat in engineering and the most important  i m sure it ll fit most people alright  also glasses fogged up immediately  very small on my head and i m not a big guy  back it goes      
273,1.0,                         it s blurry  and other people online say the same thing   they also say the first version wasn t like this other than that  i would keep it since i learned i could play rift games with a link cable on my pc  but i can t get passed it being so blurry      
274,2.0,                       i m very disappointed with my quest   because it doesn t adequately accommodate glasses   the hole in your headset where your face goes is noticeably smaller than on the original quest and the face hole on the original quest was already smaller than most other headsets out there   even if i wear a small pair of glasses  the glasses get crushed on the sides and get stuck in the headset when i remove the headset   after the glasses get stuck when taking off the headset they can fall into the vr lenses  which poses a scratch risk  mine hasn t gotten scratched yet    the headset does have a spacer for glasses that moves the vr lenses a bit farther away from the user s face to accommodate the extra space needed for glasses between the vr lenses and the user s eyes  but this does not address the problem caused by the small opening   either facebook oculus didn t adequately test for glasses wearers or they made the business decision to not serve glasses wearers well   if i was the only one using the headset in my family  i might buy a special set of prescription lenses that attach to the headset   however  my headset is used by others in my family  so that is not a realistic option   unfortunately  contacts don t work well for me  so that is not an option either   i m not yet sure what i m going to do  but i ll probably end up returning the headset and buying the older model  a psvr  which works great with glasses  or going without vr other than the glasses issue  i like the headset except for the requirement to use a facebook account   the true cost of the headset is the dollars you pay plus the personal data you share  not just the dollars you pay      
275,5.0,                       i ve owned the psvr on playstation since it came out   loved it  although  a few things that i have to  mention to help my comparison to the oq       hated the cords constantly getting tangled   not only that but if you didn t take care of the cords once your done playing  over time they start to crimp and i was worried that at some point the internal wires would snap making the headset useless     the     degree view   anytime i turned my head to far left or right  the tracking would go nuts   same with motion controllers  they would jump out of view and you d have to shake it to get it to re track     the headset in my honest opinion sucked   it was to tight   i tried everything and eventually unhooked the rubber band straps on both sides   this allow it to sit on my head without squeezing the blood from my brain   this very fact was the main reason i got motion sickness   once i relieved that pressure  i no longer got sick while playing     screendoor   wasn t bad but noticeable now    the oculus quest   blown away   no cables to mess with  resolution is clear and sharp  headset on my head doesn t squeeze the life out of my brain  no screendoor effect     the headset   honestly  i was actually nervous to put it on   i was afraid i d put this thing on and i d get sick like the psvr   nope   i was shocked   the headset fit on my head perfect  no pressure points cutting blood from my brain    i played for   hours straight and didn t get sick   my face felt like the blood had drained due to the pressure on my cheekbones but overall  awesome     i ve never played vr with high resolution   i m used to the psvr and screendoor   fuzzy words  fov sometimes sucked   the quest      wow   i just wasn t ready for high resolution and everything so clear  easy to read  no screen door   what a huge difference   i can see why people fork out  k on higher end vr units   worth it   which is why the quest   is a shocking piece of tech for the price   can t beat it         degrees   being so used to     degrees   it was awesome when i drew my perimeter around the living room and could walk in any direction without cables tripping me up   sounds funny but it was liberating to stand  sit  crawl  jump and walk anywhere   again  blown away and wish i would have jumped to wireless sooner so many other things that blew my mind and in my opinion it blows the psvr away   yes  psvr does have some great exclusives but the quest   has steam and all the games from fb with virtual desktop   it s just awesome   no other words for it   my son owns psvr and put it on last night as well     it ruined it for him   he instantly wants to get rid of his psvr and switch to quest     just an awesome piece of tech for the price   no regrets      
276,1.0,                       quirky at best  wow factor will go away after maybe a week  big brother  facebook  wants to control your world  your privacy  your choices by requiring an account  and it has to be your real verified account  in order to play with this uncomfortable  heavy  sweaty thing      
277,1.0,                       the hardware is ok  and the technology has come along way  but facebook has ruined the experience  facebook now requires association with a single facebook account per device  forget sharing the device amongst family members and to make matters worse  once a facebook account is associated with a device  it is fused for the life of the device  even a factory reset does not break the association  facebook has done everything to assure use of their social platform and drive a device per person story over the experience of their customers i don t mind the availability of a social aspect of the oculus  but facebook is forcing it  i should not have to take additional steps to avoid social interaction if i simply want to use the device to play a game or enjoy an experience   also  why would i want facebook tracking my every move on a game device      
278,5.0,                       my family has been interested in vr for a while and i m lucky enough to be able to demo the different hardware that s come out at work   it s all been really cool but not yet ready to invest in purchasing a unit for my home and family until now   quest      gb exceeding my expectations so far   had it for about a month and have mostly played drunknbarfight and beat saber so far  love the games and you end up working up a sweat which is a nice bonus  i was not expecting to be able to get some limited exercise while playing the games but you really do   the games load quickly  it has a great tutorial to learn  and it s cool connecting with your friends to play a game together   it does a great job of creating a safe virtual space to play in   fit is comfortable but you have to fidget with some things when you swap the headset with another person   battery lasts over   hours of full play  hasn t run out on us yet   i m super impressed with the hand held controllers  the haptic feedback is impressive and they work really well a few suggestions   it was hard to get the games to cast to my tv   i m on a mesh network and i think that was part of the issue  figured it out but it took a few hours of research and trail and error   it s hard to find your  games  on the home screen  they are a few clicks away sometimes   oculus seems more focused on showing you what to buy than letting you jump right in   they shouldn t require a facebook account to use oculus   it s convenient because you can easily reach friends to play with and i would do it even if it was optional but it s the wrong kind of thinking by facebook  this is why they will eventually broken up as a  monopoly    i don t care because i m on facebook but it was a really short sighted decision by the people who made this amazing hardware  if you ve been waiting to get vr this is the model to buy      
279,5.0,                       i am not considered a  gamer   sure  i love a good mario bros or tetris  i ve played the lego wii games with my kiddo  i love the interactive platforms  i got a wii when it came out and the kinect on xbox when it came out  i was pleased but not obsessed with these  i thought this purchase would be a fun toy to treat myself with during this crappy year  i am obsessed  first  there was so much interactive and interesting free content to explore that it was a couple weeks before i even bought my first game  watching content such as amazon prime  netflix  and youtube is incredible  it feels like you are in a theater  which you have all to yourself  and it s easy to get lost in it and lose track of time  watching game of thrones  which was never released in theaters  is amazing  there is some free vr content including youtube    and amazon has a few vr options which are just amazing  you can explore the bottom of the sea and the peaks of the mountains  ride rollercoasters without waiting in line  and more  incredible  i purchased my first game  jurassic world  and i am just floored  while flying in an airplane  you can walk up to the window and look out at what you are flying over  you can literally peak your head around corners before entering rooms to look for raptors  getting attacked by a raptor is a little heart stopping  lol i cannot recommend this more   i am more than pleased with my purchase       
280,1.0,                       beware      if somebody at facebook doesn t  like your this product will be useless facebook is being sued by the german government because of this      
281,5.0,                       i ve never used vr before but wanted to give it a shot at this low entry cost wow i couldn t be happier with my purchase  i absolutely love the fitness and media aspects of this device  i m not even that much of a gamer  but the immersive experience vr provides has actually made me want to do more if you re on the fence  jump over and you won t be disappointed      
282,5.0,                       i haven t been this excited about a product in awhile  it s incredible   i got it for my kids but bought myself one when i saw what it can do  i never play video games  i ve been to the movie theater once since       and watch one tv series a year  so i m not really into this stuff usually  but after seeing vr i m hooked  i love being able to travel to art museums  see historical sites  watch documentaries with  imax feeling  travel through space  i had no idea what could be done with vr or why facebook paid a fortune for oculus until now  i could see this replacing other forms of home entertainment why watch a tv  or use a game console  or even surf the web on your phone  when the vr experience is so much better      
283,5.0,                       i wanted to get this last year   but decided that the price point was too high for something that i wasn t too sure about   at the      price point  this year i decided it was worth the gamble   every member of my family was absolutely blown away   this is extremely realistic   i m amazed that we can have access to this level of technology for      biggest limitation criticism is the battery   takes about   hours to fully charge   a fully charged battery lasts about   hours   for kids that don t habitually limit themselves to appropriate  finite periods of screen time  these   hour limits are actually a blessing in disguise   but it is frustrating when you want to use it only to realize that someone just drained the battery and now you have to wait other criticism is that it doesn t utilize any sort of  account  system   unless the individual games have their own  individual save files  it does not really accommodate  say  having multiple people do their own campaign in beat saber   also  i m ok with having to tie this into my facebook account   you can disable all of the connections that would make typically make this annoying   i just don t like the fact that when my wife and kids starting using it  they basically have access to my facebook account when they do   however  since they re only playing games  it doesn t really end up being that big of a deal      
284,1.0,                        advanced all in one virtual reality headset    haha  lies right off the bat requiring you to pair your phone  and its associated data  to this device  so that it captures virtually everything you do to a facebook account even if you have a burner fb account and phone ready for this  they ll still be able to associate your real facebook account  as well as those of your roommates  and or family  via the wi fi network you log in with      
285,1.0,                       facebook collects information about your room  your physical size  and much much more when you use this headset  if they do not like your behavior in vr  they can ban you from your facebook account  if they don t like your facebook behavior  they can block your oculus account and turn your device into a brick      
286,3.0,                       first of all everyone knows it a definitely should come with elite strap the one that comes with will make your head hurt within first    minutes very uncomfortable also needs anti fog for lenses if it s cold they fog up so much you cant see anything battery life is to short     hours to charge for   hours of use the experience is outstanding works really well and using aa batteries for controllers instead of just have rechargeable lithium batteries built in be prepared to spend another      minimum for this on accessories that should have already came with it     
287,1.0,                       buyers regret  yeah sure the technology is impressive but the fact that a facebook account is required is absolutely ridiculous  i don t care that it s owned by facebook this is a gaming system targeted towards kids and teenagers and i m sorry but minimum age      for a social media account is absurd  we will likely be returning this garbage      
288,4.0,                       the short of it is pros    lighter  smoother framerate  much better resolution  controllers feel better than i expected cons   overall much cheaper feeling  horrible and i mean horrible black levels    yuck  its like a medium grey for black  ipd adjustment is horrible  lack of software options like  no double tap to show real world  no adustment to controller vib intensity hopefully these will be added as updates   the stock head mounting leaves headset often sitting too low unless u pull those bands really tight gets uncomfortable quick   the stock facial interface much narrower making most glasses feel crammed   its almost like fb intentionally made unit cheap     so u would dump tons on their accessories   rather than just making it quality to begin with  overall      its a mixed bag  better performance with less quality and polish
