0,5.0,                       i purchased this for my middle school daughter who is now not interested in anything that looks  too babyish   this fits the bill according to her   it looks good and feels sturdy   i think it is a tad smaller than i would have wanted   my daughter s school is not using books right now because of virtual learning   so the backpack has not been tested with anything too heavy  it safely fits her chrome book inside and binder and notebooks  i believe once we add books it will be a tight fit for chrome book and several text books  price was good      
1,5.0,                       there is quite a bit of room  i carry around water  snacks  laptop  scrapbooks  paints  colored pencils  books  etc  it has been holding up great with how heavy and full i keep it  i am loving it      
2,5.0,                       when i first became a professor i insisted on using a whimsical unicorn backpack   however  as that bag deterioriated over a few years  i thought i might want to replace it with something a bit more  adult    i did not want to carry some kind of briefcase or satchel   this bag holds my papers  laptop  lecture notes  etc   it seems well made and it looks mature  but not old   i have not had any major problems with this bag and like it      
3,1.0,                       giving this a one star for two important reasons   misleading and false advertising   claims its waterproof and large  its neither   the pictures intentionally show it to appear almost twice as large as it is   the waterproof claim is false and reviews back it up  so why after years is the false description still allowed   anything for a profit   how are reviewers overlooking the most important features   that said  for a small non waterproof backpack  its fine   now i have to spend more on larger waterproof backpack and give this to one of the kids      
4,5.0,                       i love love love this back pack  i ve only just opened it and haven t used it yet but it s much nicer then expected  i got the blue one and it s a very pretty blue  it s a little bent up because of how it was packaged but i imagine that will wear out of it  it was packaged very well      
5,1.0,                       i bought this for my wife to use at disney world  the backpack was never full or carrying anything heavy  yet the zipper ripped out after   days of use   sadly we were on our trip when the return window closed   but based on the quality i would not recommend the product      
6,4.0,                       i liked the charger port  that came in handy  the backpack is built well and rather substantial but i also was able to cram my laptop  charger  a    binder  four small books and a bunch of miscellaneous supplies with no issues  the straps are comfortable and the backpack stays pretty well balanced when loaded up  towards the end  the zipper started separating on the main bag but i was also cramming it pretty full and once i fixed it i haven t had any issues      
7,3.0,                       i will start off by saying this in an excellent  quality bag  i live in hawaii and needed a bag to carry my laptop and essentials around and to protect it all from the constant rain  it fits my laptop perfectly  the zippers are quality  and has a good amount of pockets the cons        this bag is not waterproof at all  at the time of me writing this review  the title of the product says  soldierknife durable waterproof anti theft laptop backpack travel backpacks bookbag with usb charging port for women   men school college students backpack fits      inch laptop black   again  this bag is not waterproof  at all  i went to the beach one afternoon and packed my towel and a change of clothes  it had rained a little while i was there and went to the beach showers to change into my dry clothes and leave  my clothes were soaked  the zippers were completely zipped and i had my lock on it  luckily  i did not have my laptop in my bag  i did have my couch drops and breath mints in there and now the inside is sticky and ruined  i came back to this page to make sure i wasn t mistaken of it being waterproof only to find out the fine print says water resistant  it is in fact not water proof    the usb does not provide a good flow of power  i had my phone plugged up and it charged about    in    minutes  not a huge bummer  but will not be using it  better to just get a long cable and charge directly from your power brick with it in your bag overall  i like the bag  great great bag for      but  i am upset about it not being waterproof like the title of the product states      
8,3.0,                       so  in the description it states that it charges your phone  the charger has to have a port  so what s the use of just plugging in another charger in to the other charger  just to use that charger for the port  iit s not water resistant and it s not easy to get things in the backpack without getting out of your seat  it is a strong backpack  but if i went back in time  i wouldn t do this purchase      
9,3.0,                       it s close to being really good  mine arrived with a stitching issue on one of the mesh pockets  the elastic separated from the mesh the first time i tried to use it  it s entirely possible this was a fluke i m fussy so this bag might be awesome for you  i travel for work so the details matter  i liked the charging aspect but there s no pocket for the charging block to slip into  that s an obvious miss  the pocket in the middle compartment needs to be deeper and have a zipper or button so keep it closed  otherwise it just sort of flops around agape   a couple more smallish compartments to keep stuff separated would be welcome from my perspective  professionals that travel need to keep their stuff sorted and easily at hand since you re fishing stuff out on airplanes  ubers  conference rooms  etc i found the carry on strap a little small  i had a hard time removing the backpack from the handle of my carry on when i was going through the airport  i feel like the handle on my carry on is pretty typical but your results may vary i liked the compression straps  bags like this tend to be floppy and unstructured so the straps help to keep the bag compact and the load closet to your body which is where you want it for comfort  ten years of scouts taught me that it s not a bad backpack  i think with a couple of mods by the maker it could be outstanding   i wound up replacing with a swiss gear bag i found by accident at target  it looks just about perfect honestly  time will tell      
10,2.0,                       the bag looks great  i really like the color and the style  but there are few things about this bag that i do not like    the smaller pocket ripped inside at the top  i have had the bag for   months should last much longer   the portable charger socket is nice  but the cord on the inside dangles inside of the laptop pouch and there is not specific place to put your portable charger  the ad for the bag said there was a pocket  but i can t seem to find one that leads to the cord    space there isn t enough divided space to hold all of your cords and gadgets  i feel like they should add one more pocket sadly after   months  i replaced this bag with a swiss bag      
11,5.0,                       waterproof  comes with a lock  can hold a lot of stuff even though it doesn t look it  if i had to have one complaint about it  it s that sadly they don t come in a smaller laptop version  i have a    inch surface and i wish the strap for laptop pouch was adjustable  but i got it for travel  and it s a really good laptop backpack  could also use a pouch for the portable charger you can attach  but these are more nitpick things than anything else  i got it in blue and highly recommend it      
12,5.0,                       i am a massage therapist  and carry a variety of items with me to appointments  there s a good assortment of pockets and compartments  which makes it easy to find a place for everything i need to bring with me  compartments  which makes it from essential oils  to lotion bottles  to a set of sheets and clorox wipes  there s a compartment pocket that seems to be perfectly sized for each of my items  zippers seem to be durable  and the entirety seems to be at least water resistant  i have not had it out in more than a medium rain  zippers seem to be durable  and the entirety seems to be at least water resistant  i have not had it out in more than a medium rain overall  great buy      
13,3.0,                       i was pretty excited by this bag  i was disappointed in how terrible the usb port passthrough workedlooking at my ampere app  i normally get     ma off my power bank  but with using the passthrough same cables its   ma which is terrible  if they just made a slit in the bag for a cable itd be way betterthe bag is decent though  lightweight and simple  im sure its waterproof because i get that camp tent smell from the inside but great if you dont expect the usb to work well     
14,4.0,                       conclusion  this bag is actually great for the price  and quite durable  this bag does what it says  gives you a decent and solid bag for the price  want a luxury item  go spend big bucks on it  this bag is ideal for college students on a budget who travel from classroom to classroom with a couple of notebooks and a laptop ipad the dark horse feature the front pocket is very spatious and convenient  it can fit all my basic cleaning supplies for when i need to brush my teeth and or shower on the go  again  i work at a hospital as an intern and part time at a call center   it fits  brush  paste  a thermometer cuz u never know  my deodorant and there is still room for a small mouthwash bottle and some mini soap or shampooo tubes  cream tubes you may use  my fave feature the good    nice sleek design  and nice color  very slim and portable  it ain t too flashy either    the charging port is very convenient if you re into that    the lock is a very nice feature    its quite roomy on the main central pocket  quite deep the good ish    the material is durable enough  it s not a victorinox bag  usually thicc  but this one is sturdy enough    i would have liked it to be a little bigger but for daily light travel  to work and the hospital in my case   it does the trick  it will resist heavier packages from time to time  but i wouldn t push my luck too far    its not exactly comfortable on the back  it has a rough feel to it  again  for the price  is not like you could ask for a top tier ergonomic design      
15,5.0,                       i bought this backpack for my daughter  she is a homeschooler        covid  and i still work part time  so she gets hauled around to our family sitters and has to bring all her school books  a laptop  headphones  chargers  and sometimes overnight gear too  it all fits  beautifully  and even though it s heavy  she feels that it s not nearly as heavy as in the bags we were using before   and the backpack distributes the weight better more comfortably  we went from   bags  school books supplies  laptop tote  and overnight bag  to    it looks just like the picture  and she loves it      
16,1.0,                       this is trash save your money and buy a bag from walmart honestly     
17,5.0,                       it has plenty of storage  is comfortable  and  just works in any situation  i use this pack nearly everyday  i use it for my every day back and forth to class  i m not sure i d suggest it for a day pack when traveling  it is pretty big  as a day pack  i prefer something more compact  if you need something with a lot of pockets  organization  and storage  this is the backpack for you      
18,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i got the idea from a coworker and i wanted to get a better one  mine  this one  has a charging hook up capability   boo yah i carry an extra charger with me everywhere and i m not really going anywhere because of the covid virus  so  it goes to work and back anyone looking for a traveling backpack this one is wonderful       
19,5.0,                       carried all over rome   didn t get stolen so i guess that part is true good storage for about everything  the usb cable is sorta worthless  we replaced it with an auxiliary phone charger traveled well  zippers and compartments all held up well  straps were comfortable and easily adjusted  has enough bulk that keeps other travelers from crushing it on the airplane      
20,5.0,                       this was a replacement backpack for the one that wore out after     years  i needed it for an overnight trip and was pleased to find that it held a change of clothes  toiletries  notebook  and various odds and ends with plenty of room to spare  it s not fancy but it is durable  rests comfortably on the shoulders  and has just the right number of pockets and side pouches  i am not sure how long it would hold up under heavier loads but it for light use it s perfect      
21,5.0,                       the backpack is somewhat compact as i liked  i personally prefer this color pattern with strap on the side  make the style looks more toward multi purpose daily backpack more then the regular laptop backpack  this totally fit my personal day to day travel need  material feels pretty solid  hopefully will last  good number of pockets inside have with my favor usb port link outside for external battery recharge  best in my budget      
22,2.0,                       so i love the book back but when i received mine  the smallest zipper was is broken  it does not zip up and no matter what i try i cannot fix it it s a struggle because i store small things in there  smallest pocket  small things lol duh  so it s frustrating but at the same time it s a solid bookbag i would have returned it but i needed it asap to carry my work laptop and paperwork  so i m kind of stuck with it  and i can t really afford to buy a new one right now they have similar ones on amazon for around the same price  i d personally choose a different one and pay the small difference  if there is one      
23,5.0,                       we bought this backpack for my daughter who will be a sophomore this year  the students at her school carry everything with them from class to class  so it was essential for us to choose something sturdy that would fit several books and school supplies and be as comfortable as it could be to carry around  we were happy to see the bag is pretty well padded throughout and has extra points of comfort for her back  the handle and straps seem nice and hefty  as well  while she hasn t gone back to school yet  she did use this bag as a carry on for a recent trip and stuffed it full of books  games  snacks   things of that nature  she appreciated the lock and charging capability as she had a portable battery with her and it enabled her to keep that inside and have easy access to her phone  she said it was comfortable to carry around and overall  she seems quite pleased with it      
24,5.0,                       i needed a new backpack for an upcoming trip since my other one was falling apart  i had seen one similar to this as far as the style goes  but it was  x the price  i liked the style and it was on sale at the time so for under     so why not  it kept my laptop secure with it s own pocket in the main compartment with a wide velcro fastened strap and my mouse  power supply as well as a change of cloths  a book  light jacket   a couple magazines   there was still more room  i got caught in a north texas downpour and everything stayed dry  i also liked the strap for holding it on my suitcase  it was very easy to wheel around without it falling off  it has a second compartment for items that are flatter and pockets for pens  notepad etc  the front has a zipper i put some cables in  but it should hold a small note book  it seems sturdy so far  i didn t try the included usb cable since i didn t bring a battery  i would have liked to have it go to the center middle compartment with the pockets  the back was padded and comfortable  but the shoulder straps could have a little more padding      
25,5.0,                       bought this bag for my daughter who is a senior in high school  for whatever reason  she carries most of her textbooks every day and has broken quite a few bags over the years  this bag however  is made quite well and is holding up nicely against her overstuffing habits  it also looks nice as it has stayed clean even though it sits on the floor often maybe we ll buy another one for her college debut  i m happy with this purchase and would suggest it for others      
26,5.0,                       i freakin love this bag  i bought it for work  i am a delivery driver and i get to work and am often in a different van so i have to carry everything with me everyday  it has two drink holders  which hold my    oz hydro  along with a small pocket in the front where i can keep my small crap  fingernail clippers  hand sanitizers  floss   a second compartment i can keep my  just in case  stuff  pepto  aspirin  note pads  extra pens  as well as a place to hook my keys  this part is great because i m always putting my personal car keys in there and don t want to lose them in the bottom of my bag later  the big part has a laptop section which i don t necessarily need  but it gives me another divider for personal things i need on a regular basis  i can keep my electronics and chargers in that pocket  and i keep a cup holder adapter as well as a ton of other things in the main compartment and still have enough room to put my lunch box on top and still zip it closed  i carry a hoodie with me and am able to clip it between two clips on the outside of the bag    and the straps are actually comfortable  it has a built in cord to charge electronics which is cool even tho i don t ever need to use it      
27,5.0,                       very sturdy  really attractive  good storage organization  and great price  the charging port works like this   you need to attach your own portable battery to the usb cable built into the inside of the bag  then you attach your own charging cable to the usb port on the outside of the bag  it may be my perception that charging was slower than normal with this setup  but it s a trim  neat way to manage it   i got a silver charging cable so it s even tidier looking  my favorite thing  a lot of these brands you don t find in target or macy s bags on amazon have names and logos that look very odd to typical target or macy s shoppers  this one looks classy  is spelled right  and has a mildly threatening militant feel like i really enjoy      
28,4.0,                       because the instructions for how to set the lock are terrible  i ll put better ones here    set dials to      the defualt unlock code  make sure that unlocks it  just to be safe    push in and hold the button on the bottom  where the diagram is pointing to with        while still holding the button  turn the dials to desired lock combination   release the button   turn the dials to some random combination  and then turn them to your set lock combination  it should only unlock when turned to the lock combination you set i still have to test the bag itself  but i figured people would like to know how to set the lock if they couldn t figure it out for themselves      
29,4.0,                       i love all the pockets  the usb charger works  so far  the lock it comes with is garbage  so don t buy it for that reason  the biggest reason i bought it was the waterproof feature  it is not waterproof or water resistant at all  a quick sprinkle and the glasses wipe in the small front pocket was dampened  so disappointed  otherwise it s a great backpack      
30,5.0,                       kinda smaller than i expected but not too small  water resistant but not waterproof  has strap for laptop  charging cable  charging port and pocket for phone   i also keep my keys in there   so far  it s a great backpack  i feel very safe with it  it also comes with a passcode lock so you can protect your stuff  i m just not sure where how to put it on yet  overall  it s good  i ll update review if i notice any flaws        stars      
31,3.0,                       i loved this backpack when i first got it in july  it s somewhat comfy for commuting  i don t use the charging cord feature like i thought i would  but it s nice to have  i initially got it to keep my paperwork dry but it s not water proof  it s barely water resistant  the front part near the front zipper has already ripped and it s only been   months  this bag is cute but not meant for heavy duty work  i use mine for traveling and work and thought it could hang  it hasn t      
32,5.0,                       super nice back pack  the material is thick  well made  and it comes padded  it s pretty roomy  it can hold your basic stuff  the quality is amazing  and the look of the bag is all around pleasant  worth every penny spent      
33,1.0,                       the zippers are cheap   no less than a week using this bag  i have broken zippers  what s the lock used for if the zippers break the reason i bought the bag was because it looks good      
34,5.0,                       durable and a nice size as well  wanted a simple bag for carry stuff to office  didn t need huge capacity and waned a few special pockets  not a swiss army watch back pack  which seem to be the options out there  either too simple or too complicated a big  this one was small enough to be convenient  but have a few special features that made organizing my stuff perfect      
35,5.0,                       this backpack is very nice  i bought it for my middle school kid  and he packs his   in laptop along with som binders and still has space to spare  the outside bottle net holds his coleman vacuum bottle very well  he also used it for a weekend trip and it covered all he needed to bring  the color and design makes it a great elegant match for his navy blue school blazer  all this at a fraction of other backpacks price in the market      
36,1.0,                       my daughter started college in the fall and has been using this for   and     months  the strap broke this week and she has been carrying her backpack instead of having it strapped on her back  i wouldn t have even minded honestly if it had lasted one year that would have been fair for    bucks or whatever but to only last two and a half months is ridiculous      
37,1.0,                       the whole point of this back pack was to be waterproof  i ride a motorcycle and got caught by rain and my laptop in my saddlebags  my laptop for school did not get damaged but i wasn t going to make the same mistake again  so i decided to buy a waterproof bag  well i got my bad a little dirty and decided to hose it off with a mist  just like rain  and my clothes in it got completely soaked  laptop was thankfully out of the bag at the time  description is wrong   not even misleading  just wrong  deserves   star      
38,5.0,                           for a really comfy a backpack  i use this to schlep around my microsoft surface tablet along with other stuff for work   toddler stuff like baby wipes  snacks  extra clothes  hand wipes    you get the idea  it holds everything with room to spare  the padded area for tablet is nice and has a velcro band to make sure everything stays put  deep pocket holds everything you need  charging cord comes in really handy  option to lock it if you d like  this is definitely a steal for how nice this is      
39,4.0,                       it s a bog standard backpack  it has all the space you should need for all your everyday things  i had to take off a star because the internal usb cable that you re meant to use for charging your phone is very low quality  no matter what configuration i tried  my phone would only slow charge when using it  it does a proper fast charge when connected directly to my power bank  so if you re looking for a backpack with a proper charging cable  definitely look elsewhere  it s hardly even an added bonus because of how slow it is  lol      
40,5.0,                       i wanted a backpack to travel with so i could stuff everything into one place   this backpack exceeds my every expectation and i have very high expectations for stuff i pay good money for   the pack is very comfortable   holds everything i could possible want to smoosh into a pack   i even tried putting my dog inside to go for a hike and she even likes it    she doesn t like anything but her food and naps    it s a great grey color and i look forward to using it each time i bring it out   thank you for a great product and exceeding my expectations      
41,5.0,                       i love this bag  i bought it to replace a backpack of mine that the zippers were no longer working correctly  i had purchased another bag and had to return it because it was too small i purchased the small bag in this backpack and it is bigger than my original backpack  lots of room to store items and is well made and very very sturdy      
42,5.0,                       nice little backpack it was between either this or a jansport over at office max and i decided to get this i like it because of the charging port that makes it convenient to charge your phone and now i can plug in my battery pack that i got from amazon as well i probably buy this bag again i like the combination lock that keeps people out although i wish it had more than one combo lock it s still a good bag for traveling and i will definitely get much use out of this for my electronics and everything else as an on the go storage bag to keep my stuff safe and a little bit of shopping on the side i even like the holsters in the side for mugs will work great when i get my coffee travel mugs a great travel bag for a man on the go     
43,3.0,                       i m going on a business trip next week and i purchased this backpack so that i could carry everything i need as i go from office to office  i wanted something that was functional and looked professional  the backpack has a sleek look  it is definitely not a kid s backpack  the laptop pocket is deep enough for my laptop and my ipad pro  it has lots of room for other items and depending on what i put in the backpack  a sweater may fit as well  the two side pockets are big enough and high enough to securely hold my water bottle or travel mug  the usb cord may be helpful  but there is no dedicated pocket for the charger  i would have expected one to secure the charger  as it looks  the charger either needs to sit in the pocket for the laptop or in the larger area in front of it  i m unsure if the cord will stay attached if the charger is allowed to move around in the backpack so here is the frustrating part  the  small anti theft pocket in the lower back   it is not in the lower back  it is on the front of the backpack and faces away from the wearer  the description makes it sound like it is on the part of the backpack against the wearer s back and  therefore  unreachable by others  it is not  also  i don t know how it is anti theft  it doesn t lock and unless you squish tabs together  you can t use the lock to secure it i m going to pack it up today and use it this week to see if i can find some solutions here   the price is low enough that i may be able to overlook the issues      
44,5.0,                       great pack for students  our family has been jansport customers for    years  they were the only backpacks that made it through an entire school year with our boys  until now  got one for     on a flash sale and am now going back to buy   more at regular price  the material really holds up to abuse after   months it still looks brand new and has been tossed on the floor at least once daily  best part is i m no longer having to waterproof their packs  charging from the backpack is convenient and comes in handy when they can t be by a charging outlet at school  the padded compartment is perfect for keeping their school laptops safe      
45,5.0,                       i use this backpack for work daily sometimes i stuff it with too much stuff inside but the straps really make it feel comfortable  i would recommend it its comfortable and was plenty of space for your personal stuff      
46,4.0,                       it is definitely not as big as i thought it was going to be  it kind of is a decent size but i expected something bigger and something that would be able to hold more but overall the design itself is very well made but we ll see in the next few months how long it lasts  the size of the backpack is the only reason why it didn t get a five stars for me      
47,4.0,                       bought this because it was relatively cheap  its main compartment can hold     books tightly   as it isn t that wide  the case for laptops is padded and elevated off the bottom so no smacking the bottom of the laptop  it does have a usb inside outside connection  but its high in the bag so any item you connect will be hanging or resting on books  so its hard to see a use for it  it comes with a cheapy lock and a key holder that snaps in the smaller compartment that looks stronge enough  to hold     keys tops   all in all its a functional backpack that protects my laptop well  which is teally all i wanted
