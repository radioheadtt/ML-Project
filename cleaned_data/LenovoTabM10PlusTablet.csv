0,1.0,                       painfully slow     not only is it slow like      dial up  everything i touch sticks  i touch the browser  it sticks  i touch an app  it sticks  email  it sticks   i regret buying this  waste of money  its a paperweight now     
1,4.0,                       i m gonna compare this  g ram version with the ipad      its not a fair fight but because the ipad was on sale  its     more than this lenovo m   plus  and i got both on the same day don t use chrome browser on this tablet  it makes it very laggy especially if u are streaming hd videos i use microsoft edge and disable ad in the options and it loads way faster the ipad was blowing this thing away when loading sites now it s same speed n some sites it even load faster lenovo   smaller bezel   very easy to hold  lighter than the ipad small battery  lasted about   hours web browsing on half screen brightness over all it runs pretty smooth but multi tasking can make the table abit laggy screen is clear but not as bright  ipad  same big bazels as       feels big and heavy holding it bigger battery  got little over    hours screen time web browsing with half brightness the os is very smooth and handle multi tasking very well screen is pretty much the same  both are very clear but the ipad is brighter over all this is a good tablet  it s an entry level tablet so don t expect too much know what u need it for before u buy im happy with it     
2,5.0,                       this is my fourth lenovo tablet no i didn t buy a fourth one because the others broke i bought this one because it is the newest version of the lenovo tablets and it does not disappoint  my first   lenovo tablets were over   years old and they were dated but they still work fine but i sold them  they had the older android or there so they could not update anymore  i had this tablet now for about   days and i have been using it every day it is beautiful very easy to work with very thin in very expandable with a sd card  i am adding a     gigabyte sd card to it so i can add more music to it  plenty of room for all of your apps your netflix hulu plus hbo max whatever you want to put on here you can add to it you like playing video games go for it you can download tons of games to it as well  this is a very easy tablet to carry around it is very thin so i would say get a carrying case for it throw it in your backpack and you are good to go      
3,5.0,                       i have always loved lenovo ibm  this tablet even being the to gigabyte model of ram works      i watch youtube with it hulu netflix no problem whatsoever  i can t say much for gaining but i can say for watching or streaming videos or movies it is perfect  feels very premium at a low price      
4,4.0,                       good product but need to attach speakers by bluetooth      
5,4.0,                       only had it a few days    so far so good  sound quality could be a bit better     
6,1.0,                       bought it thinking sound quality would be better than the other tablet i have and it turned out  it was worse than my phone   shocked by that   i had intended to use it in the office for streaming tv  and music   have a hard wired audio setup to go thru the headphone jack and the audio was horrible   then the thing locked up on me and i had to power cycle it to get it back   locked up again and then was returned      
7,1.0,                       i found this warning in a label in the product box  which is not available in amazon product description     this product can expose you to chemicals including lead  which is known to the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm     this serious statement must have ben presented in the amazon product description page      
8,4.0,                       used the tablet last weekend for my drone as my pixel   phone would not pair with the drone  this didn t either at first but did eventually  the bigger screen is a plus for that purpose and if it gets dropped this is much cheaper than the phone  noticed no notification last week but this week it did a system update so now          the tablet is on android     syrup   jawbreaker    my defunct tablet is an old toshiba thrive and has a charging base that i wish this did as well  there are pins that are likely there for that reason  the screen looks very good and the system is smooth and responsive  at least it was with v   i did pay for and get the plus model according to the box but the little drawer will not release with the supplied tool  i read that the wlan model will not accept an sd card so if this thing has its mouth glued shut i will get it open and find out whisky tango foxtrot  have to ding it a star for charging base not being available  it wasn t cheap for the thrive  and for the sd card slot not opening  i seem to remember seeing somewhere that mine is the wlan model but the box definitely says otherwise and so did the price  it is setup to be my dog s tablet so anyone can use it and read her muttmail   i hope she doesn t use it to order a truckload of bones  all in all i recommend this tablet and sarah  the dog  gave it a pass after her customary smell test  hasn t tried to bury it in the yard nor has she shaken it like a screaming redheaded  bucktoothed baby and rip it apart like she did my friend s maga hat update         tried the ds card tray release tool again but no matter the effort and prying it was futile  with the tool shoved all the way in it was time to get the knife out  it put up a good fight but even though it was as stubborn as the dunce woman living in my house my determination eventually won out and the jaw gave way  put in anoew ds card  the tablet formatted it and all is well  only had a    gb class    on hand but will up it to     when the need arises      
9,2.0,                       i bought for the advertised high quality volume not so      
10,2.0,                       tablet isnt that bad for light browsing or youtube  i regrettably bought the  gb version which made playing clash royale unbearably painful watching the screen freezing constantly durig game play  i would recommend you pay more for the upgraded ram if you re looking to multi task with this tablet      
11,2.0,                       i had higher hopes for this tablet  i purchased   of them for my kids thinking that the octo core processor would be good for them to play roblox but the tablet is super slow  it lags when the kids are playing and if they have a video playing  the tablet gets really slow  disappointed in the lack of performance that it advertised but not have      
12,5.0,                       great value  great battery life  seriously  and very bright  i am surprised at what you get for the same money you would spend on a no name tablet      
13,5.0,                       battery last a long time     
14,1.0,                       i have bought it for two weeks and i am sure it is a junk i bought it just to learn the language never downloading movies or games but it was slow stuck and the touch screen was insensitive i still use my iphone to study i just want it to rest for a while it is getting old suggest not to buy this tablet       
15,5.0,                       great tablet for the price   pairs well with a bluetooth keyboard   very good battery life      
16,2.0,                       i went with this tablet due to lower cost and good reviews and only needed it for small task  however as soon as i set it up it would make a weird scrambling noise thru the speaker  almost seemed like it did it when something was downloading in the background or if i opened an app  the noise wouldn t interrupt while listening to music  very annoying  the volume button on the side was a pain  the home graphic displayed on main screen was cut off at bottom of font  and it was very laggy even tho i didn t have much installed  called tech support and he told me it was normal for it to make that noise and couldn t fix it   since it was new and already dysfunctional  figured it probably wouldn t last  i returned it and purchased a samsung galaxy for a bit more    but loving it much better  on a positive  it did have good screen quality and very vibrant      
17,4.0,                       so i decided to upgrade to a bigger tablet i m very pleased   i m going use it mainly for reading       
18,1.0,                       horrible  not guidance on how operate all searches lead to nothing that works   leveno website does not have a customer service contact your stuck with the useless tablet because they do not care to have any help with their product      
19,1.0,                       tablet was great initially   great sound and picture   fist issue i had was the micro sd slot   it wouldn t open normally  once i finally got it open and inserted a card which fits tightly   ill never get it to open again   biggest issue is the sound stopping   ear buds work fine but no audio from on board speakers   i will try to return product      
20,3.0,                       the one i received had display issues   the one i received had a dull screen in it s background white values   far from  paper white  which for me was caused contrast and text reading difficulties  shame  because colors  pics  and vids are brilliant as i don t notice the grey against a strong color ok f display  i was not able to adjust any of the multiple settings to overcome the text issues  further  bolding text and brightening in settings caused slightly bizzare effects and rapidly used battery much more than expected  although i can t qualify the latter battery issue with a bench test value otherwise  i was impressed by the pad and its build and qualities for this price point   ultimately  i had to return it    wondering if i got a sub optimal display or they are all shipped this way   for about fifty dollars more i got the competitor s      tab which was an improvement over the lenovo      
21,5.0,                       i love the the display very clear and sound is very clear and all together looks and sounds great    but the battery  doesnt last long at all  it last about maybe   or   hours and then have to charge it      but speed is very good and i would recommended to my friends       
22,5.0,                       excellent tablet in terms of performance  size  weight and really fast charging  review is after months of use  much faster than an earlier asus and a recent model lenovo   in tablet  did use android task mgr to kill periodically running tasks for even more performance        
23,5.0,                       bought this for use with my schwinn indoor cycle   fast and great resolution for cycling tours      
24,5.0,                       this thing is awesome  well worth the money  i d say it s slightly faster than my ipad  i got the   core   gb ram  and   gb storage version of the m   fhd plus   the screen is amazing  there s no lag  and i ve done some be pretty heavy workloads on it just to test it out  large spreadsheets in excel  large powerpoints  no problem  i love the widescreen format for watching movies  and the audio with flac files is excellent  highly recommend this  i would definitely but this again  i was going to buy one of the fires  but the specs on this we re better and you get the full play app store without having to sideload it  and even when you sideload the play store on a fire  some apps just aren t available or compatible       
25,5.0,                       this is my  rd lenovo     tablet  i replace them every   yrs or so when the battery life gets too short and the os is outdated   wow  this is a huge upgrade from my last one  the screen is gorgeous  same res as last one but looks better  nice color  the tablet is slightly smaller than the last but the screen is actually bigger  a downside is that without a cover  it s very slippery  another issue is battery life  not horrible but the battery should be bigger   over all though  it s a great tablet and blows away the amazon fire garbage      
26,5.0,                       i ve had this tablet for about a month and really like it  the screen is excellent  and the sound is good  very pleased      
27,5.0,                       love all the lenovo products i ve purchased and this tablet is no exception  using it as we speak to write this review  just a joy so far      
28,5.0,                       i was very skeptical about purchasing a tablet on line without trying iy out first  but did a little research and opted in to buy the lenovo tablet    and it is more than i expected from a tablet  quality and efficiency is well worth the price       
29,1.0,                       not work cellular     
30,5.0,                       i tried several tablets from amazon    sent them all back but this one    i upgraded to the    gb storage model and im glad i did    all my apps work and it is very fast    downside is i had to wait a week for it     
31,5.0,                       i bought two of these tablets  the picture quality is crisp and clear  it has a     p display but you can only watch netflix in standard definition  it has to do with netflix not lenovo  this tablet has double tap to wake the screen like my lg phone  it also has a feature where if you pick up your tablet up it wakes up the screen  my case did wake the screen and turn the screen off when i closed or open the case but it doesn t anymore  it has a octa core processor and  gb of ram  it can hold a micro sd card up to    gb  it s running off android    pie   there is a charging light that s red when charging and turns green when done charging  you can customize the home buttons and also the keyboard  you can have a different color keyboard or have a picture in it  you can also customize the height of the keyboard  did i mention that this tablet has dolby atmos  it has two speakers and you can set the surround sound to movies  music etc  which it optimizes the sound depending on movies  music or whatever you re doing on your tablet  it makes it sound better  this is the best tablet i ever had so far      
32,3.0,                       really like value and appearance of the tablet but it is very slow downloading data   websites load slowly and apps have a slight delay  looking into ways to speed the unit up   the screen picture is very high quality and the sound is decent but not great   more for leisure use but if you re looking for a unit to support any aspect of your business you should pass on this one      
33,1.0,                       bought this tablet in oct  haven t had a chance to use it much til recently  battery will not hold a charge     very disappointing  would not recommend      
34,5.0,                       the product information about this item is incorrect  it does not allow you to add a sim card to it  plus i just received it today and when i registered it  it says that it s already out of warranty  it does have a very nice screen  too soon to fully rate battery life      
35,5.0,                       once i finally got the right one it was amazing but it took   tablets to get the right memory size and model  i would honestly recommend getting it straight from the lenovo website      
36,1.0,                       extremely laggy  hangs all the time  the ui crashes and crashes and crashes  truly frustrated with this purchase  i hate this tablet  with a passion update  this tablet is awful  touch screen is slow to respond it gets stuck processing and needs a hard reboot all the time  battery went to     after   movie i hate this tablet   each time i turn this on i am reminded why this is infuriating  do not buy this tablet        the touch screen will greatly upset you update  so  it s been a few months since i ve used this tablet  garbage  straight up garbage  complete waste of money  slow to respond hangs on simple tasks  i ve rebooted once in ten minutes because it seized up      
37,4.0,                       likes   crisp pix and vid  sound is good even without adding an external speakerdislikes   some of my streaming apps don t seem to be compatible  i ve already reported to the app developers but disney   hbomax  peacock and crackle work oddly  you can watch previews or ads no problem  but let me try to play my movie tv show  suddenly the screen goes black and i just get audio other popular streaming apps i use work fine  netflix  hulu  prime video etc  and i had no issue with these same apps playing content on the previous tablet  rca   the app updates aren t fixing the problem so maybe lenovo and the developers need to work together on the issue      
38,3.0,                       narrow side margins make it difficult to hold and difficult to type  you will have to take care that you aren t touching any part of the screen inadvertently when you are trying to type or navigate  i find myself constantly zooming and rotating because a finger has made contact with the screen      
39,1.0,                       i bought this tablet brand new  to avoid problems  during the first few days of using it  it started to freeze while i was  internet browsing  i have not downloaded anything so it is not a matter of memory and it is also not a matter of the internet connection since my cell phone and computer work just fine  sometimes it just restarts itself while i am watching a video on youtube  also  the touch screen works on and off  overall it was a waste of my money  if i didn t need it for my online work now  i would just return it  definitely i do not recommend this product at all  it s performance under normal conditions if pretty deficient      
40,5.0,                       i love the tablet  the durability of this product is amazing      
41,1.0,                       well i should have listened to the bad reviews  so slow that it was hard to enter my pattern to unlock it because it would time out before it would display it   when the screen would rotate it would stop half way and sit there for     seconds displaying half the screen   there was a     second or longer lag after touching the screen   once i got the browser open  i never could browse with it   i could barely get an app to open  i am shocked that lenovo has released such an awful tablet   i ve used off brand tablets that are faster than this      
42,1.0,                       screen is okay  not the best  battery life is good   but this tablet reacts very very slow when your trying open an app  playing a game its very laggy       
43,2.0,                       hardware is great but android is so stripped down it s frankly hard to use   you have to get apps for almost everything   oh yes  it comes with some google apps and a few other things  but not much   and then you have to sort thru the apps from the play store that have ads in them or have privacy concerns  or are ways to rip off your credit card   even most of the file browsers have ads in them   i mean you would think that you would get a simple file browser in peace   yes  there is a google file browser preinstalled  but it s got its own privacy issue in that it came from google which is mining most of what we do with ai for some time   i just want a simple notebook that gives us our privacy back  and i don t feel like it s harvesting me in some way at every turn of the screw   next time i m going to go looking for a true open source linux machine  that runs something like ubuntu      
44,5.0,                    muy buena calidad de product   cumple con mis expectativas y es facil de usas usando el setup        
45,1.0,                       streaming video does not work  screen goes black  can not use with sling  youtube  hulu  amazon video  which is the sole reason i purchased this      
46,5.0,                       i love my new tablet  i have a levono laptop so i figured the tablet would be just as good and i was right  the security to log in is getting used to  but that s okay  the screen is bright and with nice colors and the specs are what i was looking for  but     there is one issue  the tablet does not offer a slot for a micro sd card  other than that no other complaints      
47,5.0,                       i m happy with this tablet  this is my second tablet after returning amazon fire tablet because it doesn t support most of my financial apps  this lenovo with android system works with all my apps  also the screen is wider than other tablets i saw  the price is also affordable  good deal      
48,3.0,                       the battery life on this device is very disappointing   new out of the box freshly charged  the battery charge didn t last a day  i routinely plug my charger in twice a day  i do not recommend this tablet      
49,5.0,                       love it  very easy to navigate  and amazing build quality  screen is awesome for the price too  just wish that it had android     but it s still great  would recommend for light work  such as internet browsing  streaming video and some video games  also awesome for drawing      
50,4.0,                       battery life could be better   this tablet works great and has a nice display   but the battery life is not so great   i would say maybe     hours tops if you are streaming games like roblox    which my kid loves    we just use the battery drain as a chance to take a break and go outside   but if you re looking to use this tablet all day you better bring your charger      
51,5.0,                       product is fast  screen is clear  touchscreen is responsive  very pleased  wish i had purchased for myself instead of my daughter      
52,5.0,                       love lenovo brand products  long lasting brand and excited to own a tablet for forever  enjoying watching movies on this beautiful screen      
53,1.0,                       i may be too late with this warning    please don t update your operating system this tablet was wonderful and the best bang for your buck when using it while the os was   then an update happened and all hell broke loose  many of my apps won t work  not even the most simple apps like alarm clock video playing apps no longer functional worst of all is the battery  my tablet will be fully charged  the case cover is closed  upon opening my tablet to use it  i discover it s completely dead  i m constantly charging it apparently lenovo is working on fixing the problem  they posted this on their website on             no fix as yet      
54,1.0,                       wow i loved my previous lenovo tablet and why when i need to upgrade i chose lenovo  what a mistake  this machine take     seconds to display a web page  did all the checks and then searched online and most folks have an issue with speed  stay away   clearly lenovo is aware of this but just keep putting item out there  why     amazon customer for     years      
55,5.0,                       the tablet runs smooth  takes good quality pictures  i m able to explore the internet with no issue  i m able to watch movies and youtube videos with no issues as well  it s a great tablet for the price i paid for i included two picture  the picture with the two tablet is so you could compare it in size  the tablet that s on top is the lenovo and the other one is a samsung galaxy tab a          
56,5.0,                       good tablet for this old papa      
57,1.0,                       this tablet is trash  not sure if we got a returned refurbished or what but tried to get a tablet for kid that would have some parental controls and its been nothing but trouble  lenovo support is non existent  theres a weird notification noise and it vibrates with each keystroke  all in all  it just sucks      
58,3.0,                       the first day was just awful with this  nothing about it was smooth  i decided to hold on to it for a couple more days and see if it would improve after all the updates were complete  it is slightly better  but only just  its worth the money  but be prepared for a lot of lag and jank      
59,4.0,                       nice tablet for the money  i just received this so i haven t checked out everything  so far it looks good i had a little bit trouble connecting to the internet was probably becausei was too far from my modem  this is my second tablet so i don t have a whole lot to compare it to and i have no plans right now to buy a          tablet  but it seems much nicer then my   kindle which tend to have too much bloatware and uses up too much battery life  i thought this mostly to replace my it which seems to be probably on its last legs after  yrs   ty amazon   the    inch screen i bought the           fhd version which fits my needs  so i can t really say a samsung is better etc    had a little trouble getting the time on the clock just right  fixed it finally  has a nice feel a little slippery on the back but will see if transfers to my old case      
60,4.0,                       so this tablet has all the things that you would expect an android tablet to do one good thing is it doesn t have a lot of extra add ons that certain other brand put on their tablet the sound is very good but i noticed two things one is that it occasionally freezes even after i put a ram helper on it and the other is that the screen sensitivity is a little high if you re fingers are  anywhere close to the edge of the tablet it might suddenly click on something for the money i would definitely get it it has an interesting size it s more rectangular than some of the other tablets     
61,5.0,                       works great  i purchased this tablet for my auntie who is visually impaired so she can search web  shop online and read her bible through a app she likes  was able to adjust the font size to make it larger  once you do that it distorts the clock on the main screen  i tried different sizes to make that go away but the size she needed would be ruled out  small price to pay for a functional device  not enough to mark product down for one small glitch      
62,5.0,                       i primarily use my tablets for reading music and i purchased this to replace an asus tf   t i d been using for the past   years and was becoming unresponsively slow  i ve been using two of these  one for backup  for a couple months now and i m very happy with them  the screen goes all the way to the edge  so even though the       screen is larger than the       screen on my old asus  it s actually a smaller tablet as there s no wasted border space  the screen is very bright and everything works great with the mobilesheets app and my airturn pedal  battery life is pretty good  too  after a two hour rehearsal  i ve usually used only about     of the battery the only complaint that i have  which would be true for most tablets i looked at  is that the charging port is on the bottom  which doesn t work for having the tablet on a music stand while also charging it  fortunately  i can rotate the screen      and lock it there  but then my tablet case opens backwards and sometimes it forgets the orientation when waking it from sleep so everything is upside down overall  this is a very gig worthy music tablet      
63,5.0,                       this tablet exceeds my expectations   i love the easy use of the tablet along with the clear  easy to read pages   it s exactly what i was looking for   excellent tablet for multiple uses      
64,5.0,                       easy to use right out of the box  synced with my phone to load my favs  binge watched prime for four hours still     battery life      
65,5.0,                       so far my five year old loves it      
66,5.0,                       this is being used in an office to monitor security cameras throughout the day  i was surprised by the quality  considering the low price point  the screen quality is better than expected  speakers aren t the best but have decent volume  touch screen is responsive  and it even has a sim card slot for cellular connectivity  very happy to see that it charges with usb c  which is slowly becoming the new standard  overall i would highly recommend this as a budget tablet      
67,4.0,                       i bought the wrong size  it s too big and heavy   hard to hold      
68,5.0,                       got this for my mother who loves it  easy enough for her to learn on her own  thin and compact  lenovo has come to be a name i trust  i absolutely love this tablet  the battery life is great  it may not be overly complicated  i don t know how to judge such things  the screen is large and the graphics look fine  its been a breeze  i don t know of how she lived without it  good buy      
69,1.0,                       when i purchase a product that is supposed to be new  i expect it to be new  was suspicious when the box looked like it had been opened  fired it up and it was clearly a return  some poor sap in pennsylvania had returned it and either they  amazon  lenovo had not bothered to wipe the data clean   could access all her google photos which included copies of checks  etc if i wanted a used product  i would expect to pay the price of a used product and deal with it as is  this is unacceptable but not entirely unsurprising      
70,5.0,                       it took a minute to setup  but once i did its been easy to use   got for child to play pokemon go  and a few other games   works off wifi and hotslots perfectly      
71,5.0,                       i love it  runs very fast  battery lasts long  beautiful  resolution      
72,2.0,                       struggles to run any sort of app that needs a decent amount of processing power  i e games and surprisingly enough  file management  effectively closes all other apps when they re not active  this means that if you tab out of your browser app  tabbing back into it will require you to log back into to websites  re fill forms  etc  extremely annoying and unnecessary usb link with a computer is unresponsive at best  duplicates files at worst  using it with a windows    desktop  and tablet will always either hide it s internal storage  never show up  randomly disconnect itself after moving files around  trying to mount an internal sd card makes these problems even more frequent  somehow absolutely awful  derivative  android settings menu  this looks and feels like an android os  but everything is just not where you expect it to be  and some settings  just don t work   i e automatic brightness will decide when it will work  and when it ll just keep the brightness at full blast  actual time be dammed  heinous permissions issues with common apps  twilight screen dimmer only seems to work half the time as the system constantly denies permission to dim and color shift the screen  winrar is permanently blocked from having storage access  and can never delete files  only create and extract them  app store installation will constantly complain about  running out of space  when updating apps  requiring full re installs poor audio quality and static when using the  mm headphone jack  constant crackling and distortion if the base volume is set too low  or if the tablet is under performance stress it s an      dollar tablet  i guess  you get what you pay for      
73,5.0,                       when covid struck  i did a lot more work from home and it was a hassle to print things  however  i still needed to look at a lot of documents  i had another tablet bit it was a   inch tablet and it was hard to read documents  i decided to get a    inch tablet  i was thinking about an amazon fire tablet which is a beautiful device too  i had previously had lenovos and i wanted to try this one because it is android which allows for a few apps i need that you can t get with kindle  i ordered this tablet with the case that is recommended  it came fairly quickly although they seems to be popular and a bit hard to get sometimes so far i love this tablet  i will start by saying it is not super fast  so if you are looking for a high powered device  this may not be the best choice  i have found it to be lightweight  solid and very usable  it was super easy to set up and it works well  i can easily read documents  it s easy to carry around too so i just take it with me when i do go into work  i have also discovered that it works really nice for streaming video  my new cable is set up to stream tv  i have been just using the tablet to stream things  it gives a great picture and seems to be pretty glitch free if you are looking for a basic tablet that is big enough to read documents and you are just a basic user  it s hard to go wrong with this tablet  it is affordable  it is high quality  it appears to be reliable      
74,1.0,                       charging port wobbly already had only a month volume is  very  poor while connected to bluetooth not worth it     
75,5.0,                       this seems to be a really good tablet  just received it as a birthday gift for my husband and set it up  the screen quality is amazing  the speaker is super loud  which is a plus  the touch screen is amazing  as well  its sensitive  but not overly sensitive  don t know about the battery life as yet  which is why we got the tablet  i would definitely recommend this tablet as of now      
76,5.0,                       nice     
77,1.0,                       i got a lap top  which is what i wanted thank you for bearing with me      
78,5.0,                       excelent     
79,5.0,                       no complaints  this tab does everything i need it too plus more  i am loving the battery life and screen quality  perfect and best tab i own  a               
80,5.0,                    compre esta tablet para mi ni a  quedo fascinada  tiene    a os y la utiliza perfectamente para sus clases online  busquedas  videos  fotos  etc  el tama o es perfecto  la nitidez  todo  estamos tan felices que ordenamos otras para nuestros otros ni os  muy bien lenovo        
81,5.0,                       i purchased this item because it had great reviews   it s nicer than my samsung and easier to use   picture quality  sound and weight great  the price      for tablet  case  and keyboard including the tax  what more can you ask for        
82,4.0,                       daughter loves her christmas gift i have the laptop very nice product     
83,2.0,                       thw tablet worked not even one month and it already has a problem with the screen     
84,5.0,                       quick  snappy and cheap  great screen and good battery  it s not too of the line but at this price there are no complaints  you will be satisfied  buy as a gift for the non tech savvy  student or someone just indeed of another screen for whatever reason  it will not disappoint at this price     
85,5.0,                       i have an ipad and wanted another less expensive tablet  this tablet works very well  a bit laggy  and has a very good screen but the interface  with often no back button on web pages  and a home button that s a sliver on the edge is a drag  i m used to ios not android and it s just more quirky to use  the tablet is very nice  but for me  less intuitive compared to ios  i find myself frustrated with the interface  that s an android thang  not a lenovo tablet hardware issue  for the price  it s a good tablet      
86,5.0,                       several years ago  i bought a similar lenovo tablet for my son  i wrote this comment before     this configurations of cpu  screen and battery  with this price  the lenovo will kill samsun and apple together   unfortunately  samsun and apple were not killed  and my son broke his tablet  i bought this newer version of tablet  it is perfect and cheaper than before  my son love it  i would write the same comment as before      
87,5.0,                       awesome tablet plays all games and apps     
88,3.0,                       i purchased the tablet to play games on   the colors on the screen are disappointing   they are not vibrant but a dull color   the touch response is the most disappointing   i have to tap a box several times before it responds which take the joy out of playing the game   for serious use i would recommend you pay more and get a better product      
89,3.0,                       this tablet is a very nice tablet for the price   the main issue i had with it is that lenovo seemingly does not have widevine l  certification   there seems to be some controversy whether it is lenovo or netflix  but the long and short of it is that you will be watching at least those two services in    p   i didn t even know this was a thing when i bought the tablet as i watch youtube primarily and it looks beautiful   i m very disappointed that in      there is even this issue   i understand it s to combat piracy but still      if you don t plan on watching those types of streaming services  this is a great tablet      
90,4.0,                       spent some time setting this device up today  it seems snappy and quick  the screen is sharp and responsive to touch  we are mounting this with velcro tape to update an older treadmill for streaming entertainment  while installing apps  the battery life went down rather fast compared to our phones  of course  i had screen on the brightest setting  so ymmv  as i m leaving it powered all the time on the treadmill  the battery life won t be an issue  i did look at the vankyo models and found the lenovo to have more ram  storage  and higher resolution  i also like the lenovo brand  though everything is made in china  i wish lenovo would make a     or larger tablet at this price point        is nice  but peloton has shown that there is a market for large panels attached to fitness equipment      
91,5.0,                    tama o de la pantalla  calidad de imagen  r pida  entrega r pida         
92,1.0,                       i have fire hd           already but it cannot output to hdmi   when this device come out and q a said there is hdmi output capacity  i decided to buy it   but testing result failed finally   cpu performance is little bit faster than fire hd            and  gb ram   however it is also much expensive than it      
93,1.0,                       after one week of flawless use  screen randomly started going into screen lock mode every few minutes      
94,4.0,                       this is a very nice tablet for the money  i am a diehard apple products fan but i needed an inexpensive tablet just for using for meetings on zoom and this lenovo tab m   plus   gigs ram    gigs storage seems to fit the bill  it has a nice size screen and great picture quality  it s fast and responsive not overly sensitive  the only setback is the fact that you cannot expand the storage capacity at all  the description of the tablet is a bit misleading suggesting that you can expand capacity  for what i use this tablet for  i think it s a very good tablet for the price and i would recommend it to others but just beware of the misleading information about being able to expand the storage      
95,5.0,                       amazing quality the material of the tablet is amazing  the quality of the display is perfect  audio quality amazing  battery life better than my old samsung tablet overall um very happy with my new tablet     
96,5.0,                       love lenovo tablet     this is the second one i have bought      
97,5.0,                       good space and ram     
98,1.0,                       the screen won t display most video apps since it is not fully certified to protect content  called lenovo and they blamed google or tried to charge      for software support  can play standard def netflix  can t play vudu  can t play hulu  can t play disney   can t play cbs all access  can play most content on facebook but will dial it down to sd  i watched a video i shot on my phone that looked great in every other device after posting to facebook  but on this device it stretches the video to hd after downgrading to standard definition  the result is garbage video  lenovo  paying for your content protection certs will make you product tolerable for budget consumers      
99,5.0,                       i used to havea lenovo and i wanted another because the kids mode is great so i ordered this one which is slightly bigger than my old one and i am obsessed  love it      
100,3.0,                       when i  bought this tablet  i expected performance on the order of other tablets on the market  or phones  running android   i am disappointed to say that this device is extremely laggy   for example  i stream a lot of content over the youtube app   minimizing maximizing the video seems to take   or   seconds for the system to process swipes to do so  something that is instantaneous on my phone  which has considerably less processing power than this tablet    i get the impression that this device is very new to the market and i am hoping that there will be some type of update to address these issues  because  aside from the lag inherent to using some key apps  this is a great tablet      
101,5.0,                       work as expected is a good product      
102,1.0,                    hola  compre hace menos de un mes una tablet de estas y a los tres d as de uso  le salieron rayas de colores a la pantalla que cubren mas de la mitad de la misma pantalla tengo iniciado el proceso de devoluci n  pero ahora como la compre fuera de los estados unidos tengo que pagar el envi   osea hasta que no me veo afectado con esta compra tengo perder tambi n mi dinero para el envi  a usa         
103,2.0,                       very confusing set up  worked   days with no luck      
104,5.0,                       really good value for the money     
105,4.0,                       poor user information even on line  battery life not that great      
106,2.0,                       i bought the lenovo m   tablet  i love the tablet it is awesome  the charger however is a different story they send me a charger and plug  that doesn t work  so i have a tablet that o cannot charge  there is no way to get in touch with the seller  so i can t even ask for a new charger         
107,4.0,                       the m   plus with   gb memory from lenovo is a reasonably priced tablet for browsing and e mail  it has a vivid display and medium battery life  it s not a good choice for apps or for gaming  we got one the second week in january        when amazon sold them for about      and did not offer models with more storage  a week later we saw the amazon price was about       and the models with more storage were available   a procase cover is worthwhile option to reduce wear and damage  amazon described the battery rating as about   amp hours  but lenovo specs clearly say about   amp hours  in any event  we get about   hours of web browsing      
108,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i was looking forward to keeping this  but  does not even deserve   star  lenovo makes defective products   ships them nice packaging  but the defective touchscreen makes the whole product useless i have also uploaded a short    seconds video for proof  as soon as i turned it on for first time use  the tablet was immediately defective  could not get past the setup start screen  for over       you would think the device should work  the only thing to do is to return this defective product   however  lenovo has wasted my time trying to fix this piece of junk through amazon technical department     then finally had to return it  but i thank amazon for their return policy      
109,5.0,                       i have bought some crappy tablets in the past  this isn t one them  like it so much  i bought more for my family      
110,1.0,                       loved my lenovo tablet reader until i opened  kids mode  thinking i would teach my granddaughter her colors  kid s mode took complete control of my tablet  cannot close  cannot use any other feature defaults to kids mode  granddaughter thinks it s great  i am an    yr old avid reader and haven t been able to access it for three days  lenovo support is like my tablet unresponsive do not sell another tablet with kids mode on it or warn people  it cannot be deleted  changed or turned off  it is totally useless now that granddaughter has gone home      
111,1.0,                       i know the tablet is only  gb of ram and it s not the best but when you only have   app open and making sure everything not running on the background it still lags a lot  and even freezes a lot  it s not worth the      this feels like a     tablet      
112,1.0,                       is my return due to manuf defects being sent by foot courier or pony express  that would be faster  i am disappointed that i don t get after over two weeks have a credit to buy another one  lenovo or ibm are great tablets but i want a working one in my hand soon  very soon  cust  service is disappointing      
113,5.0,                       i don t know too much about tablets since this is my first one but this little thing is pretty awesome so far as i can tell  totally worth it for the price      
114,5.0,                       i bought this for my    year old mother  because of the large screen and user friendly   she ioves it      
115,5.0,                       love this tablet   great price compared to many similar tablets and is not loaded down with apps right from the beginning   bright clear screen and good speaker quality   thanks      
116,2.0,                       from in the description   card description   integrated   one might believe there was an sd card drive integrated  since it has what looks like a card slot  but doesn t open   but no  it doesn t open  in the user guide in very small print under sd card usage it states that wifi models don t have cards  i was shocked  how lame is that  everything was worded so as to mislead      
117,5.0,                       extremely pleased with this affordable      tabled  i ve had several tablets in this class and this is by far the best one  it has a zippy processor and the display is vivid and crisp  if i had one critique it would be the screen brightness  at       it s noticably dimmer than my previous samsung e  but i never run tablets on      brightness so i could really care less  outstanding tablet made even better by the price point      
118,5.0,                       this tablet is simply awesome   i purchased this lenovo tablet to replace the onn tablet that i got from walmart earlier this year and i ve been using it every since   i actually did my review on this tablet   needless to say  i put my onn tablet back in its original packaging   this lenovo tablet is fast enough to easily handle my games and streaming media   battery life is great   this tablet s battery will easily last for hours  even with my streaming internet games   touch screen is very responsive and accurate with or without a stylus   picture quality is great too   the value and peace of mind that you receive from purchasing this tablet is  priceless      
119,4.0,                       i was expecting to be faster   this one is for my daughter which uses abc mouse and few apps apart from that it is sufficient battery life is quite good and screen is responsive and bright      
120,5.0,                       for its price this tablet can t be beat  perfect for light everyday use      
121,4.0,                       huge screen  not as fast as i expected tho  acceptable for the price      
122,4.0,                       the tablet has been great  it is quick  the touch screen seems good  and the battery life is pretty nice pros    the screen is good   it seems pretty snappy  apps open and run well   the sound is fine  it isn t amazing but it s better than a lot of tablets i ve used   the camera is pretty good  the front facing does a good job with video calls and i did take a couple pictures with the rear facing one and they were fine  not on par with my phone but that is expectedcons    no hd content in netflix  this seems to be a software limitation that they could get fixed but haven t and from reading their support forums it doesn t seem likely it will be fixed anytime soonthe tablet is capable of full hd but not with netflix  youtube is fine so it isn t a hardware limitation but rather a software one   i ve done a bit of research on this and it honestly seems like an issue between lenovo and netflix so there is some hope of it eventually getting fixed but given the response from lenovo on their forums  essentially none  it may be a while      
123,1.0,                       i bought two lenovo tablets they were supposed to be brand new and they were both refurbished  the screen would go black and i would have to start it all over again  i then had to go and send them back after i reprogrammed  to get all of my info off  i  have been buying from amazon for yr and i am very disappointed in this   virginia joseph     
124,5.0,                       this is the perfect dvice for around the house if you want to rid your phone of annoying apps like email and other social link items  it s fast and easy to use  the battery life is avrage it lasts long enough however i found it takes a long te to chage when it needs it  its light and portable and easy to take with you throughout the day  the outer shell is nice and stayed cool throughout use  although it collects fingerprints easily  finding a keybord that attaches to the port on the device has been unsuccessful however there are plenty of  rd party cases and bluetooth boards that work      
125,1.0,                    compre la tablet en amazon no se me cayo  simplemente un dia aparecieron unas lineas verticales en casi toda la pantalla  la tablet la tengo desde septiembre  mala compra         
126,4.0,                       there is a mistake in the tech specs   it says sd cards up to       not true   that only applies to a different version   order the one with the internal memory you need                 there is a spot on the case where the sd slot would be  but it is not functional   otherwise the tablet is great  not lightweight but ok and screen is bright   occasionally using for armchair  wifi  browsing  but mainly using it for a drone control display  it s a little bit heavy and overkill on size  but i like it for that purpose      gb version   not for storing a lot of content  pictures  movies since it has no sd card      
127,5.0,                       it s slightly laggy like many other reviews have noted  it s a great tablet and much better than my old kindle fire  the screen quality is great  i think it s beat if you use it just for documents  reading and watching netflix  no heavy usage     
128,5.0,                       unreliable     
129,1.0,                       this tablet is defective  i bought this on august    for my son  he got home from his dad s house on august   th  when i tried to turn the tablet on it would not turn on  so i charged it  no matter how long i charge it it will not turn on  this is a brand new tablet  so i googled it  and it turns out this is a problem that many lenovo tablets have  if you let them die or run out of battery they won t turn back on  you ll have open it up and do some taking apart to get it to turn back on which is a lot of work i did not sign up for  i paid      something for this tablet  i shouldn t have to take it apart to get it to work  i m returning this  thank god it s only been   days so amazon let s me return it  but the problem is amazon is saying my refund will be     so i may have to dispute this with my bank  this is terrible      
130,5.0,                       battery  does not  last long     
131,5.0,                       this is my third lenovohas everything you need for day to day usegreat for watching movies          
132,2.0,                       if you plan on using the onboard speakers this is not the tablet for you   sounds like a tin can even after playing with settings   i returned it within    minutes of opening it   my fire    had better speakers   hoping the samsung tab i am going to replace this with will have better speakers      
133,1.0,                       after a month it s a paperweight   stock on startup screen  neverending tablet is starting  bootloader it s locked and factory reset it s locked  it s trash     
134,4.0,                       if anyone downloads a streaming channel  hulu  disney  peacock etc  and you get audio and no video  the simple fix is make sure your screen brightness is on standard  there is a glitch in the android version      
135,5.0,                       bought this for my husband who liked mine   works great for our need   this was recommended by consumer magazine      
136,5.0,                       i m now calling it the budget ipad or budget samsung tablet  it s fast processor and  gb of ram    gb storage memory  truly give it a fluid experience  many tablets are solid but have  gb ram which just doesn t cut it for multitasking  the screen quality is surprisingly sharp and hq even impressing me for a      beast i actually bought it as a gift for my father  i noticed him and my mom spent a lot of time sharing a        ipad   years ago   it s fast still  but my dad is truly impressed and glad i got him this bday gift  he s familiar with android  his phones samsung s    and thinks it s very comparable in speed  he now prefers it to the ipad  that s impressive       preferred to a thousand dollar ipad now obviously ipad or samsung is a tad better  faster  clearer  but the difference to me  and my dad  don t think the       difference in a good samsung tablet or ipad just isn t worth it  it of the cheaper but solid tablets this beasts the vankyo matrix and is number   highly recommended for those wanting a tablet with speed and function in fhd display with  gb ram and lenovo a great brand it is the beast of all budget tablets  solid battery life too         
137,3.0,                       do not allow tablet to upgrade to android    lenovo has pushed out the system upgrade over the past few weeks and it breaks parts of the os  widgets stop working  notices don t show up  screen does not power off when case closed  this update is still is de facto beta and will stop functions from working after two weeks of use i can say with certainty that this is a nice little tablet  running android nine means that it has a very clean and non crapware installation the colors are sharp and bright and the ship seems rather peppy  there s no discernible lag in loading or switching applications on the downside it is possible for a tablet to be too thin and sensitive  the finish is also extremely smooth  this combination of factors makes the tablet both difficult to hold and difficult to hold onto  to solve this issue i went with the oranxin case for lenovo m   plus   silicone soft skin tpu shockproof lightweight protective cover for lenovo m   plus tb x   f x      inch tablet  and my only complaint about it is that i wish it fit slightly tighter the other issue that stands out is that despite the tablet having a      x      resolution the netflix app only allows you to look at standard mode  also if you trying to stream a     p movie from your home media server you are going to want to pre transcode the file for smooth playback  i don t know if the issue is with the hardware or with the network connection all in all this tablet gets five stars      
138,4.0,                       pros  very crispy display and resolution material is beyond this price point premium packaging great for light browsing expandable storage nice screen size very adaptable pricecons  not great for games  lags a lot for simple games like roblox  webpages and videos take long to load  approximately   seconds  slow even with  gb ram and octacore volume levels are quite low mediocre sound quality low battery lifein the end  this tablet is great for movie watching with external speakers  it works well for productivity purposes  using this for reading will work very nice with almost no bezels  web browsing could get bothersome with the slow loading times  gaming however is almost impossible with the lag even though this brags octacore and  gb ram  overall  this is an amazing tablet for the price  almost a steal but has its downsides      
139,3.0,                       this is my  th lenovo tablet     over the years and i have been fairly happy with them up until now   the tablet is fine and all but the battery is the worst  my son plays games and watches youtube all the time on this and we get about   hours of battery life which is terrible   my last lenovo     got a good eight hours under heavy use   if i could return it i would   the battery is way too small for a tablet      
140,3.0,                       i wasn t expecting miracles for what i paid  but i was expecting it to be at least as good as my   year old phone it looks really nice  but it is really slow  it s mostly fast  but it freezes up for half a second on a regular basis  usually when i touch the screen the battery life is embarrassing  i pretty much have to leave it plugged in when i m nit using it  and i m only using it as an ebook reader now it also came with a scratch on the screen  under the protective packaging  so it left the factory that way  i m using it as an ebook reader  because it s not really useable for much else      
141,5.0,                       i like my new tablet  it s much easier to see things than on my phone  i was able to setup most of the apps on the new tablet that i have on my phone the one app that the tablet doesn t support is  signal  which i use for work and personally to talk text other than that i would recommend this tablet      
142,4.0,                       this is a great and inexpensive tablet  the overall quality is so much better than tablets at this price and much more expensive  the only reason i can t give it a   star is because the battery life sucks  i m not a gamer or watch a lot of videos all day long  if you are this is not the tablet for you  pay fifty to a hundred dollars more and get a samsung     
143,5.0,                       i have bought two so far  the  gb ram   gb storage is the best in my opinion in terms of price and performance  my first purchase was  the one with  gb ram   gb storage  unfortunately it fell off my hand and the screen cracked but it still works fine  it also gave me the excuse to buy another one  i was so curious to see the difference and compare these two      
144,5.0,                       excellent tablet for the price  not the fastest but good for light gaming and streaming video s      
145,1.0,                       update  after   system updates to for android    this tablet is almost useless  no apps will run in the background so no notifications  startup is now long waiting for omcap to load  once it does the widget s and notifications stop working  i will never buy another lenovo protuct after this experience i love this thing  coming from a tab  this is huge  screen  storage and ram  games play well not perfect  wifi is strong  movies look great    negatives  the speakers are not loud enough to use as a wake up alarm i can t see it being able to wake even a light sleeper   and the auto brightness just kinda freaks out  go super bright for no reason in a dark room or stay super dark outside in sunlight      
146,5.0,                       great tablet   beautiful screen  good battery life  fast and not much bloatware      
147,5.0,                       been using this tablet for about a week now  battery lasts me all day unless  i am playing multiple games  runs just about everything i throw at it  except more demanding titles such as rs  runescape  runs old school runescape just fine  besides gaming  browing the web  looking at apps  and watching movies this tablet can do it all  i am very happy with this purchase  very slim and sleek and easy to handle even though it s      inches    if you are looking for a great budget friendly tablet to do work or light medium gaming this is the one for you      
148,4.0,                       good value  the screen is superb  right up there with the best  the speakers  though  are pretty poor  stereo separation is great  but otherwise they don t even sound as good as the single speaker on my motorola smart phone  z    a far cry from a surface pro  and leagues behind ipad speakers  they re loud enough  but generally unpleasant to listen to  which is a bit of a bummer because part of the use i was planning for this was watching movies around the house performance is adequate  in daily use  it s perfectly snappy  battery life is fair  but not exceptional  build quality and materials surprised me  it feels higher end than its price would suggest  if you re buying this for a kid  though  you should still find a robust case  i d recommend that for any tablet  lastly  ergonomics are reasonable but not excellent  it s very thin and  without a case  slippery  an ipad feels considerably more ergonomic manageable  probably due to a friendlier aspect ratio overall  it s a very nice tablet for the price and i recommend it  it s also worth mentioning that lenovo and motorola traditionally give you a very clean android experience with minimal bloat  unlike samsung   ugh   don t underestimate how great that is      
149,5.0,                       quality tablet  fast processor  easy to use  good value for the money      
150,4.0,                       my pixel   xl is noticeably faster  especially when it comes to switching between apps and chrome performance for example  destiny item manager  one of the reasons i grabbed this  is almost too slow   still usable  but just for basic use  it ll do great hbomax app does not seem to work on this tablet yet  audio works but video is blacked out    everything else seems fine  hulu  netflix  amazon prime  in portrait mode my medium small hands can mostly type with thumbs  but its uncomfortable to hold for long periods so really  think about what you will use a tablet for   this basically does what i was hoping for      
151,5.0,                       this  is what you re looking for  absolutely no negative comments  after     days of daily use  reliable  consistent  fast  crisp display  and the list goes on  don t second guess    click  buy  now      
152,2.0,                       at first i was impressed with the tablet   than realized after set up and usage  it s slow  drops out and the face recognition  works     the time    ordered    but was shipped   of them  doubled billed  there s no phone   to call for help at the factory   i m sending each one back to amazon and ordering a   apple air   like i was going to do in the first place   i ve owned a apple once  they will spoil a previous owner   there  nd to none       
153,5.0,                       very well made and works as good as any ipad i have used  i use it with a fold out key board with a mouse pad on it  i do reports on it and have had no issues at all  it s great to surf the net with or play basic games  i have no idea if it will work for you gamers  that s not my thing  the camera and video was impressive also  you can t beat the price      
154,1.0,                       it started making a humming noise while charging  had to do the    second fire up several times   worked for a short time  now it won t start up at all   well  i had a nice month with it      
155,5.0,                       i bought this tablet just to do some mobile responsive software testing but i have found myself using it on a regular basis   never really thought i would enjoy a tablet but this has been a great purchase and value      
156,5.0,                       gift for brother in law and he really loves it  helps him keep up with the world wherever he is      
157,5.0,                       easy to use   love the size of the screen   great quality for the money      
158,5.0,                       so far i like this tablet  it does things my older tablet can no longer do      
159,5.0,                       better than an ipad any day  we love this tablet      
160,5.0,                       i use this for vrv  crunchyroll  youtube  games  and books  i paired this with a    gb sd card and have about    books on here at the moment  amazon is on this to just have as an extra terminal  for some reason  this likes to freeze up on occasion during my games  aside from that  no complaints  will update after a year of use      
161,4.0,                       i found this tablet to be really really good compared the other cheaper ones   my only issue in fact is the same issue i seem to have with the other cheaper ones my sd card does not register upon start up and only comes online after i unlock      
162,1.0,                       one day use and it is showing lines  how is this meeting the quality standards of lenovo      
163,3.0,                       good for a budget purchase  but laggy performance had me return it      
164,2.0,                    sinceramente por el hardware que tiene  esperaba mas de esta tableta  es extremadamente lenta y la vida util de la bateria da risa  lo unico a destacar es el sonido         
165,4.0,                       the product is good in general  however  i came to a fail where i have a bluetooth speaker and i can t be in a conference call with it  as soon as i turn off the bluetooth connection the call return to normal        
166,4.0,                       the fire hd    is fast  but is burdened with the amazon ecosystem  this tablet is close to pure android which is what i wanted  it does not feel quite as fast or smooth as the fire hd     but it s fine for reading comics  news  email  etc gaming on this is worse than my lenovo tab   and nexus         so i wouldn t buy it for that      
167,5.0,                       awesome tablet for the price  i use it to watch videos and shows while on my treadmill      
168,5.0,                       it s well made with a good  solid feel  i use it for streaming to the chromecast and light reading  it s so nice not to have the added software bloat like some other tablets and phones  i ve went from charging every other day with the different tablet to charging once a week  love this tablet      
169,5.0,                       didn t know what to expect when i bought this  got this for my   year old  he loves it  it s durable and easy to use      
170,1.0,                       lenovo dangling the label full hd when it s only capable of streaming sd contents only  should have bought fire hd    for half the price with better performance and fhd streaming rights  i wouldn t recommend this tablet until the widevine l  streaming rights is fixed  disappointed with this tablet that i m about to pay amazon     restocking fee just to get rid of it      
171,5.0,                       great tablet  fast processing and love the lightweight  apps load very fast     
172,2.0,                       where do i begin smh  great if you are not a tech person  new to tablets  have very limited app use or need  i can t even play plants vs zombies   i m already not a fan of lenovo because of the poor job they ve done with motorola phones and a       gb   tb lenovo laptop i had that took a legit   mins just to boot up after only   months of use but this    this is an embarrassment to any company that wants a foothold in the software industry       so done with lenovo  apple   samsung huuuuuuuhhhhhhh  i guess you win      
173,5.0,                       startup to main screen is quick   display is great   i was worried about the screen size but very happy with the choice   replaced my nexus   which was noticeably slow   so glad i chose this tablet      
174,5.0,                       wi fi tablet     nice screen  fast processor  one heck of a tablet for           
175,5.0,                       great performance for the price     
176,4.0,                       i should have listened to the other reviewers  this is the worst tablet i have ever owned  the screen jerks  the touch is non responsive  and it freezes  giving this one to the kiddos and getting another for myself      
177,5.0,                    a mi hija le encant  demasiado y puede realizar sus clases y tareas perfectamente  altamente recomendable         
178,5.0,                       only thing bad is battery life awesome outside of that     
179,5.0,                       all my games run at    fps and swapping between apps is very snappy  camera is decent  but it has neither a flash nor light  very thin sturdy frame  and accessories are relatively easy to find for this model      
180,5.0,                    estoy totalmente satisfecho con el producto  es liviana  delgada  las im genes son n tidas  el sonido aceptable  me gust  que pueda agregarse una memoria externa que funcione como memoria interna         
181,1.0,                       this tablet so slow  it take too long to pop up the website  is wast of time  recommend  i regret bought it     
182,3.0,                       invalid info on the description   there isn t a qualcomm in this thing   i found in a few video apps it was very jittery and not smooth      
183,1.0,                       working ok while it worked  i am now into month   of trying to get lenovo to replace obviously faulty product  will update review if they come through        
184,3.0,                       was doing well until the screen cracked and we couldn t find a replacement       never again        
185,4.0,                       i purchased the  gb version for           it was frustratingly clunky and slow   i returned it and spent the extra     for the  gb version   what a difference   runs as smooth as silk   great product for the money   incredibly easy to set up using my android phone to automatically copy apps and settings      
186,4.0,                         meg ram    gb storage  perhaps will get android      at this price it s great   i use it mostly for reading  web browsing  and as a terminal for moodeaudio   this is a tablet  which means it is not a general purpose computing device   using a tablet for  productivity  or  content creation  is like trying to be a cabinet maker using only a hammer and chisel   this is good at what it s really designed to do   if you have a good wifi signal you can stream video or play it from a network source easily   the     p display is decent  not as good as its predecessor s  k display but considering the current price of android  k displays it s a very good compromise   sadly  it looks like most vendors aren t making good android tablets any more   the asus tablet i replaced  broke the screen  cost more  had a  k display  aptx bluetooth  and cost half again as much as this one   this has twice the ram and twice the storage if you want a relatively inexpensive tablet with a decent display  bluetooth    no aptx   a more than minimal amount of ram  this is definitely one to consider   its aspect ratio makes it narrower than some tablets with the same diagonal measurement   it s easier for me to pick up with one hand   its predecessor was just at the edge of possibility   all in all i m pleased   i got more than i wanted for what i spent   an ipad would be better  but not   times better by a long stretch      
187,2.0,                       we have had this tablet for about     months and it has had multiple problems  i highly recommend the producers of this device figure out the problems whenever we go to the app store it quits working and whenever we get it to work we can download a game but still when we successfully download the app we choose it will automatically kick us out of the device and shuts off      
188,5.0,                       like how big it is  colors are good      
189,2.0,                       very disappointing   especially after the super performance from my lenovo laptop the screen display is sometimes erratic   usually  when i swipe to wake the unit  the password keypad appears in two phases  the  sleep  feature works in   min on some applications and not at all on others   but again  not consistently with any of them the performance overall is very inconsistent   if this is what it is  buy a different tablet      
190,5.0,                       good seller  good product  fast shipping  good price  thanks     
191,5.0,                       i enjoy this tablet  works great as a reader playing video or working  i did purchase a keyboard but the on screen is fine as well  great value and powerful for the money      
192,5.0,                       i have had a windows    tablet and i like android as i have an android phone  i used to buy laptops a long time ago from the company now known as lenovo but was once ibm  the computers never broke on you  now back to the tablet  the screen is far better than any tablet i have seen  and i am a computer tech  second the speed is good  third the battery last for about   days full charge depending on use  now i don t play games so i don t know how long that would last on a charge  but surfing and emails and playing hd videos it last a long time  i love this tablet  my wife has a galaxy tab   a and it blows her tablet out of the water  from pictures to video to the screen resolution and speed it s not even close  i see now i have to buy her one because she was not happy when she seen that lol  any way one thing that can be done is customizations where you can do more with the tablet  it s simple and not much to change on the tablet  but besides that man this tablet is so smooth and clear my goodness  makes looking at videos better than looking at tv and i have  k video  but the clarity of that screen is amazing and smooth  downloading apps from google was a breeze  i had one issue with one app and that was experian but i just went on the browser and done it that way  i also like that google has microsoft edge new browser that thing takes google chrome and make it look stupid    i never thought i would like another windows browser ever because of chrome but i lied  google better step up because microsoft edge is a beast   with that as my browser it feels like a windows computer but yet it s android  man i am loving this tablet  you can t go wrong people  i haven t found anything to say i hate this for what i use it for  the cameras are good  i haven t taken pictures with them yet but far as how it looks and the video looks when using the camera it s great  i don t use a tablet for those things but far as i can see pictures will be very nice on that tablet that is a bonus  and you can video stream far as zoom and any other camera streaming app  it s clear and works well  if you want a tablet this one is the real deal  as far as tablets i call this the    killer to all tablets out there  benchmarks i don t get into if you looking for that  it ranks pretty decent  but i don t get into that because i don t use that to it s full potential for what i need it for  gamers can use this but i am not a gamer  but playing games work on this tablet and works well and flawless  i have the  gb and   gb model  and for      man that s stealing     well enjoy people if you buy this tablet you will love it      
193,5.0,                       a great mid range table         very pleaded      
194,3.0,                       tablets ok at best but you get what you pay for  it s not bad for watching netflix and hulu  youtube  one major problem is that sometimes in the middle of a movie or show it reboots itself and takes a minute to come back on      
195,3.0,                       nice little laptop for       but for my use it s a bit slow and the touch screen could be a little bit more responsive  it s a bargain for the price  but i think i ll upgrade  lenovo makes very good products      
196,5.0,                       picture quality is amazing  it s fast and very user friendly  my favorite part of this tablet though is the audio options  as someone with total hearing loss in one ear the setting options are great for me  i find myself not having to put the volume all the way up like with other devices  definetly recommend this tablet for anyone who wants a high quality device without the high pricetag      
197,2.0,                       remember how the early tablets were really slow  buggy  and all around crap  is you hated those tablets don t buy this one  i stopped using it after a few weeks because i became so frustrated with apps freezing  the screen rotation getting stuck  and annoyingly slow response  don t waste your money on this      
198,2.0,                       purchased for my senior mother to use  but she didn t so it came back to me   it is so slow   all i use it for is email and internet browsing   cannot believe this cost        been too long to return it since mom hung on to it for a while   if you re looking at this to purchase  i d keep looking      
199,3.0,                       i bought the very least expensive unit available for       it s only purpose is to play the app scrabble go  and for that it succeeds  but make no mistake this is a very low end unit  biggest gripes are the touch screens responsiveness and the general speed of the unit  but for      it s ok        
200,5.0,                       the only reason why it doesn t perform like a high end is in game apps like pokemon go  it can run them   just not as good as your      tablet  i got it to run apps like garmin pilot and it handles them extremely well  couldn t be happier for the money i spent      
201,1.0,                       there is no free customer support even when the product is new  the interface is not standard and somewhat clumsy     
202,1.0,                       nor what i expected     
203,1.0,                       i can t find a way to contact anyone on amazon about this order   the tablet stopped charging and would not turn on within weeks of purchasing it  amazon sent a replacement  then charged me for the replacement  how do we contact someone to get this refunded  i sent back the broken tablet   the replacement tablet is working but this is a big hassle being double charged and not being able to find a contact phone or email to reach anyone      
204,5.0,                       for the price  it s a very good tablet  i bought it as a gift and the person using it likes it very much      
205,5.0,                       battery life may be below what some users expect  but that s because the processor is more than capable of performing multiple tasks and will be able to keep up with future platform updates  speed comes at a price also  if you are going to be using microsoft office  make sure you change the default browser to chrome or samsung from from edge  before launching for the first time  if edge is your default browser  the office activation will hang  i have read several ppl having the same issue  but haven t seen the solution written anywhere      
206,5.0,                       bought this primarily to fly my drone  but has replaced my fire   hd   extremely nice screen resolution  clear  and very thin   very snappy performance and  yay   i have google play store    sorry amazon  your tablets are a great value  and yes  i know there s hacks out there for them  but this thing shines      
207,5.0,                       after blindly searching numerous tablets that would work with my mavic air     dji fly app  and having to return many that wouldn t work i stumbled upon this lenovo tab m   plus        fhd android tablet  octa core processor    gb storage   gb ram i was able to download the dji fly app from the play store and it worked right out of the gate      
208,4.0,                       this is obviously not the best of the best android tablet  i do not like the default lenovo home screen launcher  but it is android  so you can change it  nova all the way for me  but  the build quality of the tablet  and the quality you get for only      is pretty dang incredible  it feels great in your hands  the screen is lovely  and it is just perfect as a light browsing and casual tablet  this week be my backpack companion for years to come  i recommend trying the  productivity  navigation  and getting a different launcher immediately  though      
209,5.0,                    espectacular tableta por una fracci n del costo de una samsung tab s   o de cualquier ipad        
210,5.0,                       not a bad price for a tablet  it best presents for kids  parents and money value  but bad camera quality though      
211,5.0,                       i just received my tablet yesterday and setting it up was a breeze  it came three     days earlier than originally scheduled  i have had a number of tablets and have been with android from the beginning  i own a samsung s  plus and a samsung a    i still have a samsung tab s     from when they first came out   years ago and it is still going  i usually keep my techs for a while and finally decided it was time to get a new tablet  having used android pie on both phones  the tab s had become woefully outdated and it hurt me to retire it  i began looking for a new tablet  as most know  the tab s was a top of the line tablet and very pricey  the new s model can cost around       after exploring my options  i decided that this tablet might suit my purposes for a lot less and i was not disappointed  the screen is beautiful  the os is smooth as silk  and i could not be happier  i have owned several lenovo laptops and they also did not disappoint  i generally use my tab for surfing the internet  youtube  checking my emails  etc  i do not game at all  for the casual user  i would highly recommend this tablet  for the price this is a steal      
212,5.0,                       love it     
213,5.0,                       sprung for the      gig instead of the        probably overkill for my needs  but not too much of a price difference when i was looking at them   nothing comparable in the same price range pros  great screen   fast processor   plenty of memory   sound is pretty good    speakers    starts up in     seconds from being totally off   start up with facial recognition in just a couple of seconds   mutliple apps running at the same time didn t cause any hesitation or lag meh  battery  k mah   lenova  why not put in a  k mah      that said  i ve cycled down to     or so and fully charged about   or   times now   it ll run about    hours down to      but i m just surfing and playing simple games   if you re using for video or playing games that use a lot of processing  you might want to proceed with caution cons  love the idea of narrow bezels  but between that and the slim design and relatively slick back and weight  i had to get a case for it   i don t normally use a case  but i had to for this one  and it made a world of difference      
214,1.0,                       this would be a great tablet but the screen constantly shuts off and locks  in the middle of watching videos  playing games  everything  very frustrating  we exchanged the first one with another and same problem  i would not recommend until they fix this issue  i ve read it s a common problem with this tablet      
215,4.0,                       very impressed with this tablet so far  the battery life is impressive  even when doing something demanding like gaming  although not the most graphically intensive mobile games out there   the screen is sharp and responsive  the speakers are great  and the system comes with minimal bloatware or other such annoyances  only complaint is the processor  as others have mentioned  it is lagging a bit behind in the mobile device market these days  still  perfectly fast enough for the vast majority of tasks and leads me to conclude this is a great buy despite that one weak area      
216,5.0,                       at first i was thinking that it lagged and such but i was way wrong  it updates to android    and i added a high speed micro sd card and this tablet turned into a monster  i am playing call of duty mobile on it along with other games  songs  movies and such and this thing will not crash  you have to buy the sandisk extreme plus microsdxc uhs i card   speeds up to    mbs  and it cranks up your apps although they don t say it  i also fine tuned the settings for color enhancement and various settings  yes  i purchased the lenovo tab m   fhd plus with  gb    gb the screen is crystal clear  browsing is fast      i am stoked because i took a chance and lenovo made me proud once again  don t drop it  buy a case fast lmao  good luck          
217,5.0,                       i love the kids mode on this tablet  very few kid mode apps allow you to simply give access to any app that you want to give access to  i think for the price this is a very good tablet  the battery life is decent  screen is bright and crisp  it runs fairly fast  i only see it lag every once in a while   i am very much hoping that lenovo releases the next android update to version    for this tablet      
218,1.0,                       very disappointed with this tablet  i hope to be able to use this as a bigger phone  but the apps took forever to load and it was impossible to even shop on amazon  it is relatively new  so i should have researched more      
219,5.0,                       work excellent  fast open apps  big screen  narrow bezel  great sound  nice finish  high capacity    gb  octa core chip  metal design    mp rear camera and   mp front camera  microsd to   options  expand existing memory     gb   gb    gb total system  or additional memory to back up     gb  system and   gb for photos  documents  music   nice screen shot      
220,3.0,                       it takes five hours to charge  the screen looks a little smaller thanthe listed       sound is okay yet i had to put it way up      
221,5.0,                    buena resoluci n      p  que compensa la debilidad en la calidad del panel  tiene buen rendimiento en tareas b sicas  buena sensaci n al tacto por su acabado met lico  buena duraci n de bater a  el sonido no es excelente  pero cumple  respecto a las c maras  regular como la gran mayor a de tablets en cuanto a software  excelente  android    con actualizaci n a enero del       con la poco invasiva capa de personalizaci n de lenovo en general  muy buen producto teniendo en cuenta el precio         
222,2.0,                       feels and looks really nice but it s too slow  if you re looking at buying this tablet  i d save your money and try something else  the lag while doing even the simplest tasks on it is unacceptable      
223,5.0,                       you know  this tablet does it all for a modest price   we went digital with the local newspaper   so  i needed something to read the news at the breakfast table   works great   it s fast with unexpected android features  such as duo for conversations with my granddaughters  son  and daughter in law   of course  android apps are all there too      
224,4.0,                       there is a lot of things to like about this tablet  the metal body is great  the stereo speakers are also very good  the battery life is above average and the screen is ips full hd    but one for me  major flaw is lack of hd on netflix     apparently it has something to do with the dmr security thing   my fault for not looking it up before buying   oh well  somehow the shows on netflix still look nice in sd playback but having a full hd screen and being forced to watch in sd is trash  if watching netflix is a major part of your daily use  look for another tablet that can support hd playback  otherwise this is a pretty good tablet      
225,1.0,                       turned on tablet and found about an     of screen has vertical lines very similar to others   could be because of packing  none   too big of box    but having it happen in same spot is curious  only had it on for a few moments      
226,2.0,                       i am returning back   refund because i made   calls to help with set up and still is not set up last girl left me without completing her job laverne c     
227,4.0,                       update  the tablet did upgrade to android    and is actually performing a little better than before in games i ve been looking to replace an aging laptop for some time now  and a tablet seemed like a better fit since i mostly used it for media  i had several requests        gb of storage with micro sd expansion slot      gb of ram      inch screen   headphone jack   usb type c connector   no more than        name brand   android   this tablet fulfills all but the last request  it runs android   out of the box  but from my understanding  it s likely to get an update to android    at some point  i m not sure why such a recent tablet doesn t ship with the latest version of the os  but this is hardly an issue unique to this tablet so what do i think  well  i m mostly impressed  let s start with the good  as i stated in the title  this is a great bang for the buck in terms of specs  you ll see a lot of brand new tablets that are   gb of ram and    gb of storage  granted  they re in the      price range  but those are pretty bottom of the barrel specs  even for a mobile device  even the standard ipad only has   gb of ram and    gb of storage and it costs      the screen is a highlight  the color and brightness are impressive  the resolution is     x      so it s slightly better than     p  videos and games really pop  it s not going to compete with oled  but it s one of the best parts of the tablet in the audio department  it s pretty standard fare  the speakers don t sound fantastic  but they are well placed on either end of the tablet so it sounds more organic  i m pleased to report that there is a headphone jack for those who are so inclined  an increasingly rare feature in phones and tablets  as well as support for bluetooth     as far as performance is concerned  it s good  the   gb of ram means programs can run in the background and not bog the tablet down  which makes it a great device for multimedia  the menus and apps felt responsive  not buttery smooth  but i didn t encounter any performance issues for media apps  it doesn t fare as well in the gaming department  but it ran everything i threw at it  my only gripe is call of duty mobile stuck the graphics on the low setting in terms of build quality  it s quite impressive  the materials feel premium with good haptics  the body is metal and it seems like it would hold up even if dropped now for the the negatives  i found the cameras to be sub par  there s a   mp rear camera and a   mp front camera  the overall image is soft  those are far from impressive in       the video camera is similarly fuzzy as it only supports    p and     p  there s not even a    fps mode  more light does yield better results  just keep your expectations in check while i am glad the tablet uses usb c  which should be the universal standard across the board  however  it does not support fast charging  this means you while charge the device while using it  it won t be able to keep pace  while it will gain a charge with the screen off  it s painfully slow  you have to turn the tablet completely off to give it a proper charge i have other smaller gripes such as netflix only running in    p  which  from my understanding  is an issue between lenovo and netflix   the lenovo overlay  which can be mostly negated   and the less than perfect battery life  but these are getting into nitpicks at this point  overall  i am very satisfied with the tablet  there are some cut corners  that is somewhat to be expected at this price point  i would recommend this to anyone looking to buy a mid range tablet at a great price      
228,4.0,                       the screen is a bit small but good to use it for children  battery is not so much  touch screen is good enough  come just in time  thanks you      
229,4.0,                       i was disappointed to see that it doesn t support sim  the cpu ram is awesome  screen is dim in comparison with apple products  storage can be expanded which is awesome feature for the time when you have no network connectivity  no good option available for cover in market for this model  not sure why the company is not trying to make one  the dock shown in the image is not included  it doesn t support android latest version yet  so don t expect dark mode      
230,5.0,                       screen quality  battery life and touch screen are all great  perfect tablet for my use  love that it is an android so easy to use  affordable  happy with this purchase      
231,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i love it  i m going to update this later on  i have only had a few hours so far it s a steal at this price  i was shocked to know that i could use facial recognition to unlock my tablet  amazing     
232,4.0,                       excellent for my personal use  though the   gb one would have been better  faster  this is good but would have liked more speed  maybe cricket isn t good enough      
233,5.0,                       great and good price     
234,1.0,                       this was a fine tablet when i fist got it  but it  like so many cheap android tablets slowly becomes more sluggish and non responsive  i got it for reading comics and watching movie  so i have   or   apps installed  but it s so slow it s basically not usable you really get what you pay for with android tablets save up a little longer and buy something better      
235,2.0,                       i ordered the lenovo tab m   fhd plus         the tablet looks and feels great and i thought i got a really good deal    it s much less expensive than an ipad or other tablets however  this tablet is not good for streaming video  specifically the youtube tv app    the app would load and sound would play  but no video  after some research  i found that this was a common problem with this tablet across different streaming apps  for me  that was a dealbreaker for the record  all of my software was up to date  wi fi signal was good and i tried all of the usual restart  reinstall etc  tactics  i suspect it is a software issue on lenovo s end if you don t plan to stream video  this tablet seems great  however  if you are like most people and want to stream video     look elsewhere or at least check to see if lenovo has fixed the issue      
236,5.0,                       this tablet is exactly what i was looking for  it s speed is perfect for my style of gaming and touch screen works well with almost any stylus  definitely would buy again  recommend it to anybody looking for a tablet  fell in love with it the first time i used it      
237,4.0,                       this is a gorgeous tablet for the price   the aluminum outer casing is high grade and the screen is beautiful   however it is hefty for a    inch tablet   it was hard to hold in my hand without my hand getting tired  im    and have big hands    also the aluminum casing is nice but it is slippery   it will slide all out of your hands   a case would help im sure but would hide the frame and bulk it up   nice tablet overall though      
238,2.0,                       within    days the touchscreen is does not always function properly   it becomes inoperable   you need to shut down the tablet and restart   it may work then      
239,5.0,                       quality seems good     
240,5.0,                       reasonable performance and feels very premium at touch      
241,5.0,                       works great     
242,5.0,                       wow   replaced my   year old quad core lenovo with the new octo core   so much faster   i play alot of online golf and this has really helped   no more lagging  and stuttering on the holes   the screen is incredible  so sharp  wow just cant say enough   this is my  nd lenovo  i chose it because i had   issues with my  st lenovo  and the   gig of ram    the octo core   so much better   its a great gift for you or someone you know      
243,5.0,                       love the screen display  the feel of it is awesome     
244,3.0,                       i ve had good luck with their phones   moto  but this tablet leaves much to be desired  battery life sucks  less than three hours just browsing  plus it s slow      
245,2.0,                       the screen do not show the colors properly  i tried changing the settings but still not showing the real colors  i m returning the product      
246,4.0,                       the lenovo tablets i ve had    over the years  work well  have a small amount of bloat  and have a gps that does not require wifi to work  unfortunately they do not have a compass  this one seems the same the m   fhd plus is no different  if your app requires a compass  like some astronomy apps  then you may want to look elsewhere according to lenovo s site the m    and m   will be updated to android    this year  it already has    pie  one star was removed because of lenovo s service  i bought an m  on lenovo s site a few months ago and am still waiting for reimbursement on a price match  two days after my order their price dropped     so i contacted lenovo to get a price match     day guarantee on their site   after countless e mails and calls i m still waiting on the reimbursement  fwiw   since ordering i saw their m  tablet go through several different promos on their site  e g                    up  down  and up again within days a week of each other last month  october  i bought the m   fhd plus on sale from amazon and received it in record time bottom line   unless you need a compass the m   fhd plus tablet works great  i would not rely on lenovo customer service  maybe their tech support is better stay safe   cheers      
247,5.0,                       yes  my first tablet  i always ignored all tablets  but my wife has bought a few so i have some reference  and this really looks and feels really nice  everything is smooth and fast  would recommend  i may take a look at an ipad at some point  the only downside is no pen support     
248,1.0,                       the touch screen rarely functions  and the installed android   is unreliable in this pos  my old lenovo tablet was far superior  do you want to load files from your computer on the    gb sd card you installed  forget it  do you expect this trash to recognize your otg device and play mp s  sorry not happening  i will be returning this boondoggle tomorrow  avoid this at all costs     
249,5.0,                    le doy   estrellas porque no me ha desepcionado en el uso que le concedi  dado su procesador gr fico no la compren pensando en jugar  sino como una unidad de multimedia por su resoluci n fhd y parlantes certificados adem s de su uso como una viable econ mica de tablet para estudio  funciona muy bien con stylus capacitivos   compre la versi n de   gb y no he tenido ning n problema u relentizacion al manejar la opci n de  pantalla dividida con programas de ofim tica como por ejemplo word navegador  app de escritura a mano zoompor otro lado cabe resaltar el acabado met lico que posee y el ser bastante m nimalista  no comento nada sobre las c maras  quien compra una tablet para tomar fotos    la frontal es hd por lo tanto es suficiente para video llamadas         
250,5.0,                       i waited to buy the   gig version after my techno nerd sons suggested it  i bought it the day it was available  nothing but good things to say  it s fat and fast for a      the screen and colors are vibrant  and i use mine with a basic passive stylus for sketching  concept art  cartooning  building cabinetry design  etc  i love it note  this tablet is not compatible with the lenovo active pen  the active pen works with special screens you won t regret this purchase      
251,3.0,                       the screen quality is good  if not extraordinary  but the responsiveness is all over the place  some of the ui choices are also poor  for example if you hold your tablet at the upper left  you will constantly get the items in the  swipe down  menu showing up  even if you swipe  the swipe up  on the other end  is not responsive enough and doesn t fully close an app  you have to go and swipe it a second time  kindle does not work very well on this tablet  particularly you may end up turning pages when you do not want to  depending on how you hold it make sure to check what google is gathering from you  hint  it s  a lot   unless you go and turn it off all in all  this is not a terrible tablet  given it s price point  but it s not a very good one either  i wish i had spent a bit more and gotten something better      
252,4.0,                       we have been using our lenovo tablet primarily as a duo or zoom portal  this has worked well at a reasonable price      
253,5.0,                       i was quite worried about the reviews  i thought i probably ordered the wrong tablet for my younger brother  but the tablet came in good shape  nothing s gone wrong so far          
254,4.0,                       battery life could be better overall well worth the money   touch screen very responsive  audio not so great but then again i use headphones and colors look vibrant when watching movies  i have the   gig version therefore games run well due to the extra ram      
255,5.0,                       nice tablet     
256,2.0,                       purchased this to replace a lenovo tab i had  something clearly changed with the newer models  screen size is smaller  but not that big of a deal  battery life is the worst i have seen  with just moderate use  i am recharging every other day  my previous tablet would go     days  also  it crashes and locks up on a regular basis  i will keep tapping the screen  nothing will happen  then go to sleep  i then have to wake it up  and it starts working properly  even for the price  it is not worth it      
257,1.0,                         month and it does not work very well  very slow and it is not the internet     
258,2.0,                       so i m about   weeks in and i don t like this tablet  maybe the  gb ram is faster but i frequently can t get wifi to the applications even though it s working in settings  i got it for my daughter  it literally has about   apps on it ixl  abc mouse  ect  and it seems under powered even to run this apps  it s both confusing and frustrating to deal with when it s taking several seconds to load a flash page in an app  wouldn t recommend the  gb  might even want to opt into the  gb     
259,2.0,                       this tablet locks up while playing simple puzzle games  it is also very slow to respond  powering down and rebooting does not help for long  i bought it for the amount of memory it has and specifically for playing puzzle games  such a disappointment as this is my second lenovo tablet and having similar issues      
260,5.0,                    compre esta tablet para mi hermanita menor y oh dios mio que larga es  no se si hice bien al final darsela  siento que no es una tablet para un ni o cada ves que la veo moverse con ella me pone nerviosa por si la deja caer  aunque tiene su cover pero como quiera no deja de ponerme nerviosa  antes de comprar leer bien las descripci n del articulo para que no te pase como a mi         
261,1.0,                       will not play netflix of amazon prime video in hd because it has not been certified at a high enough level for drm  this could change in the future  but as of right now this tablet is   star for what i purchased it for      
262,3.0,                       nice tablet awful battery life  sending it back     
263,4.0,                       i love the tablet but the battery life isn t good  in order to get     hrs so i have to plug it in to use the tablet      
264,5.0,                       the virtual home and back buttons take some getting used to   i ve been a long time android user  so everything is familiar to me  all my account information came over seamlessly and i was able to customize my experience by not copying over stuff that wasn t necessary   surprisingly i find the screen size to be a bit unwieldy when using it as a browser   works great for my main purpose  navigation    but otherwise  i might actually like something a bit smaller      
265,3.0,                       liked     screen  looks very good  android   only  no updates yet  buggy and crashes certain apps   i e  cbs all access  and there is a performance lag  noticeable delay on website loading and refresh      
266,5.0,                    tiene un tama o excelente  pesa relativamente poco en consideraci n a su peso  es muy funcional y r pida         
267,4.0,                       super slow from the start   the case props up  so it s horizontal making the camera on the left   i bought this specifically for zoom and that doesn t work but seriously the time it took for an app to open was slow i returned it      
268,5.0,                       purchased this tablet for my dad  he needed something that he could watch movies with a large screen  this worked great and the price was even better for the    inch screen      
269,5.0,                       perfect fit and easy install      
270,4.0,                       this tab is an upgrade for us  as our old tab was getting slow  this tab is fast  holds battery charge much longer than previous tabs  has a large screen  hd  plenty of light adjustments  vivid color   good sound  it is thin   lightweight  we love it  very few covers available just yet but we did find one that encases the tab rather than snaps in  per usual  it takes time to set up w the built in features  installing our apps   auto log ins  it is the best tab   we ve had many over the years  we have a blue tooth speaker  large tv sound bar   ear buds connected for music  lectures  ebooks  movies  etc  it is great  we use it for work on microsoft products  all the streaming services  email  photography editing  recipes in the kitchen  in the sewing room  on the patio  e reading  research  etc   it is very versatile  we rarely use the laptop anymore  it fits into a purse or tote for errands   travel  it was well packaged   arrived as expected   it was a great value for features      
271,1.0,                       was happy at the start   now slow      useless      
272,4.0,                       i ve had it for several weeks now and it works really well with most games  the screen could be a little faster to respond to the touch  but it s not so much that it bothers me      
273,5.0,                       just got it today  so far i m highly impressed by the screen quality  it s a little heavier than i expected but the build quality is great  don t expect to get a great camera overall i definitely recommend it     
274,5.0,                       sleek design  viewable screen goes edge to edge  decent  processor  this tablet is a far better choice over a amazon fire tablet      
275,4.0,                       good enough for moderate use  face definition is a pain to get working  but when you do get it  it works     of the time a little lag the   mp rear camera is surprisingly good  not a bad deal  i  guess for the price you can not do much better      
276,1.0,                       this tablet lagged and locked up on the very first day   i am going with an   inch samsung  end of story      
277,3.0,                       slow screen refresh makes for halting  jerky scrolling   if i had it to do over i d spend the extra coin to get a faster tablet      
278,3.0,                       a google machine could not get the virtual keyboard to come up  still working on it  using a bluetooth one wants voice input only so far if i can t get it figured out i will be sending it back   can t stand the marketing spam from google services talking around my devices seems to be a nice machine otherwise      
279,1.0,                    es una l stima que amazon venda una tablet que no tenga acceso a wapp en nuestros d as   compr  con gran expectativa esta tablet y fue una decepci n absoluta y cuando escrib  al servicio al cliente de amazon no pudieron darme una soluci n satisfactoria a mi queja  en mi pa s se consigue  tecnolog a m s  actualizada  que la que tiene esta tablet y a precios similares  realmente estoy arrepentido de haber comprado esta tablet que no puedo devolver porque el costo del flete desde mi pa s es muy alto y perder a a n m s de lo que ya perd   doble desilusi n  amazon y lenovo  no recomiendo a ninguna         
280,5.0,                       arrived super fast  great tablet for price   gb ram is good for doing lots of things like browsing and some gaming  well built and looks great     
281,5.0,                       i bought this tablet last december and still cannot use it  it won t  see  my network so i can t finish setup or registration and there is no way to contact lenovo for help with this issue  i have been trying for months  i am posting here in hope that someone knows how to reach lenovo for help with this this was to replace my older lenovo tablet that has been a real workhorse and i love it   i expect this one to be just as wonderful when i can use it      
282,5.0,                       if you need a reader  point of sale system  electronic menu  lite gaming tablet  word processor  media tablet   this is a steal   expandable storage  sharp screen  not super fast but responsive enough to be fun   zero complaints      
283,5.0,                       i got this product as a gift to my sister and she loved it  thank youu     
284,5.0,                       great purchase love quality of the screen     
285,5.0,                       device is fast   it accepts all android software and also works with the garmen fitness watch   it was easy to setup   all i had to do was follow instructions and all my contacts and information was loaded from my amazon fire   also the two speakers are real nice   it will also use bluetooth and you can connect to about any other device you have   so far everything is working very well would recommend this device      
286,4.0,                       i got quite mixed up in the shuffle of so many lenovo kinds  this works quite well  no real issues so far  however  i needed front facing speakers  the straight uptab        w o the plus was the item i actually wanted woops    i m a musician    yes  it does matter      
287,2.0,                       disconnects from wifi  the lenovo recommended fixes did not fix  stops playing videos  and it is just too slow   i reset to factory  and nothing was fixed   i wish i had returned the product on time  now i am stuck with it   not worth the affordable price  it is worth less      
288,1.0,                       in my opinion a piece of trash  can t figure out why but this thing keeps shutting off on its own at very inconvenient times  as in watching videos  taking videos  trying to download order things  when ever it wants to it ll just turn off  the battery lifespan doesn t seem very long either  your choice to buy it but i don t think i d spend the money on this particular item again      
289,5.0,                       great tablet  lot off features  very sharp big      inch screen  thin and light      
290,1.0,                       with standard apps this tab is freezing   not sensitive to touch you will be disappointed     
291,5.0,                       very happy with this purchase updated and easy to use  the price was ok      
292,5.0,                       great value  easy to use  nice speakers even at very low sleeping volume  perfect size for me      
293,5.0,                       love this tablet  lightweight and easy to use  long battery life  would purchase again      
294,5.0,                       very nice all they way round  excellent price for the product      
295,1.0,                       high cost no value worst tablet ever poor performance power purchase is not recommended      
296,5.0,                       this is the second lenovo tablet i have bought for my daughter  this one has a better screen and the processor is sufficiently fast for her games  she is happy      
297,5.0,                       i had my bought with the shitty fire      by the way  don t buy they are trash  but i needed that tablet in my kitchen to watch tv while cooking  cleaning  etc screen is wonderful  it runs on android so it is very fimilar to me  watching a new tv show  it is crystal clear the only downsides  the battery life is not great  i have yet to find a tablet that does have a good battery life  other than the ones costing      bucks the sound is pretty low  but you can hit an enhanced audio i think it s called and it almost doubles the sound for       bucks  well worth it imo      
298,5.0,                       it s a great product  and is built solid    i have the    gb  gb of ram  because i do picture editing and some minimal animation  and it s pretty good for what i need it for  also   i realize  that some of you may be concerned with the charging times  but i ve realized that it doesn t take hours to charge fully  if you completely power it off  and let it charge up that way  it ll be like charging your cellphone  which is much faster to charge      
299,2.0,                       nice looking tablet   touch screen seems slow to respond   for an octo core processor it lags a lot     
300,4.0,                       this lenovo tablet is a fantastic buy  it feels snappy when you are surfing the web  watching videos  or listening to music  the display is pretty good too  no weird edge lighting during dark scenes in videos  the dolby atmos app comes preinstalled which is a nice touch  the aluminum frame means it feels well made  and looks premium  for the price  you can t go wrong      
301,4.0,                       love it  but it s very slow loading      
302,5.0,                       this is a great tablet for the price  it cost a little bit more than the low end samsung tablet i bought  but is all around better  has more ram  which makes it so much faster   and it has a larger screen this asus tablet is comparable to a      samsung tablet or an ipad  i have owned this for a couple months now with zero issues with it      
303,5.0,                    se la compr  para mi mam  y la resoluci n de la pantalla es excelente  f cil de usar        
304,5.0,                       as soon as i opened the box  i was impressed by the quality of this tablet   for the price  i dont think its possible to find a better tablet   clear  bright  crisp screen   solid build quality  usb c charging   bought as a gift for someone and ended up falling in love with it myself      
305,5.0,                       great value in the tablet world  works fast and functions easily  added a bluetooth keyboard for added benefits      
306,1.0,                       i ll let the picture speak for itself  the full hd display is gorgeous when it worked  clearly  the build quality needs some work      
307,5.0,                       i tried two other tablets before coming to get this one  i tried both the e    which i guess is a cheaper  more economical version of this   and the m   hd  this tablet only costs     more than the e   and was the same price as the m    from microcenter  and it s definitely better than both  it s faster  smoother  and has overall a better user experience cause of it i personally use it at my restaurant to automate lights  play music  etc  but it would also work great as a casual use tablet as well  the plus comes with the higher def screen and the octa core processor which makes it better for casual use  bang for buck  this tablet is            
308,1.0,                       this tablet does not come with any kind of start up guide   i bought it for my    year old mother  who put in a password and couldn t remember it   the tablet was locked and we could not get in at all  i spent hours upon hours on the phone with lenovo people trying to do a factory reset   it did not work  after at least   sessions on the phone for more than    min  each session   they told me to take it to a service center   it was in canada   i spent over      on this product  the least lenovo could do is include some type on start up guide  and not have a password as the first thing you put in to get set up      
309,1.0,                       i hate this tablet    i guess lenovo is doing what is next in the technology world but this tablet is awful  specifically when i m in an app there is no back tab anymore  you are supposed to slide back  well that doesn t work  it depends on the app  so instead of going back a single page to where i originated it backs me out to the table of contents  if the app has a built in button on a given page only then does the tablet take you back to where you were originally  the screen looks good  i bought a  glass screen protector  maybe that is what makes the response time a little slow  once while using the device it went to the home screen but supposedly the home screen  because nothing was on the screen  not the time  not the apps  nothing  it was unresponsive and literally dead   i had to restart the tablet  i was supposed to call lenovo but what good was that after the fact  the battery life is fair if you don t use the tablet  meaning if you use it and don t use many apps you might get   hours out of it  the sound is cheap not quality at all clear but no depth  i had the lenovo    inch with the micro or mini hdmi that tablet lasted and was a solid device  this is garbage and i hate that i wasted my money  i thought getting used to it would help me with functionality  but familiarity doesn t make the device smart  i still get backed out of apps back to the table of contents  i hate that i simply can not go back  sad because i really liked lenovo but i will never purchase their products again  i hate all the sliding why doesn t this thing allow you to simply close the app  you end up with a row of apps draining battery because the device doesn t allow you to simply close the app     
310,1.0,                       wish i didn t miss the return window  poor battery life   even when powered down the battery dies   truly wasted nearly     bucks   its a paper weight now      
311,5.0,                    muy buena tablet siendo ususario apple comparo mi ipad  puntaje        con la lenovo  puntaje       las pequenas diferencias son en velocidad de procesadores pero si comparo precios esta de mas decir que recomiendo la lenovopantalla      tactil      os     disponibilidad de apps       no todas las apps de ios estan en android utilidades que mas considerola tablet tiene kids control que solo contabiliza el uso de los ninoses multi usuario y no se bloqueala expansion de memoria es super util        
312,5.0,                       i m love this tablet  i got it for my daughter she loves it to  i was able to download her schoolwork and other apps   no problem  i originally bought an amazon tablet had to return it because it does not download google apps   very disappointing   this tablet works like a dream     i have a laptop  lenovo too and it works  great also      
313,5.0,                       this work great     
314,5.0,                       this thing is fast   very responsive   screen is very crisp and clear      
315,5.0,                    execelente calidad de la imagen  y la bater a dura mucho  y la pantalla tacyes execelente  la recomiendo mucho        
316,4.0,                       overall i am satisfied with the performance of this tablet   clean and simple design   i would not recommend this tablet for those who will use it for games   the specs suggest it would be good for games but i have not had good luck with game apps on it      
317,3.0,                       frustratingly slow  will freeze up while doing basic things such as watching a youtube video or playing games  purchased for my son due to previous tablet being too slow from age and now this one is almost as slow fresh out of the package  still considering possibly returning this but have already bought a case and screen protector  i thought buying a name brand tablet would mean that it came with name brand quality but it seems like they just took a solid case and filled it with random parts lying around the factory      
318,5.0,                       good tablet     
319,4.0,                       love it  my only concern is it linked to my moto z  force  i m going to call lenovo to see if i can factory reset it and will it stand alone without linking to my phone  i understand i could put a sim card in it from my carrier and also use it as a phone  but i don t want to  i will put an sd card in it for more storage  so far it s just like having a larger version of my smartphone  i ll see if linking it to my laptop with windows    would work  i really wanted a tablet just to replace my aging hp laptop  may have to get a new display for the laptop and let my wife have the tablet  just have to play around with the tablet for awhile and see really like the aluminum frame and once i get a surface type display case maybe with the backlit keyboard it might be a better setup  would really love a surface pro but have to be rich to afford it      
320,5.0,                       initial review had it for under a week  but i love it so far  it seems to be solidly constructed  the gaming performance is acceptable  no wifi issues i ordered a thin tpu case for it and that works great so far  battery life is good  but it s still new so i ll keep that updated as well here in a few months      
321,4.0,                       not bad for its price  battery life is not as good as i would like but can still run for several hours on a charge  does all that i need it to do  at first it kept go to sleep while i was using it and i found that the hard case i had bought for it was the cause  the magnets that hold the cover closed caused the unit to goto sleep when folded over the back of the unit  no problems since i figured that out      
322,3.0,                       i had to buy two tablets  one for each of my kids so they can attend to their  online school   i bought this lenovo because it was one of the cheapest options with its technical characteristics  hd and ram  and it is a good known brand  lenovo   along with this tablet i bought a samsung galaxy tab a      with the same technical specs  i bought the samsung because i had a coupon from american express which saved me    dollars on the samsung purchase and i bought the lenovo because i had some thankyou points that i could use on amazon  basically the  only difference  between the samsung and this lenovo  is the brand  i put   stars on the lenovo because it is much slower  it freezes while running google meet and the samsung doesnt do that even do they are practically the same in terms of technical specs  the samsung runs very smooth and the camera quality is much better  pictures look nicer      
323,1.0,                       garbage  won t turn on even after letting it charge and following all the instructions  so i searched online for problems with a black screen and device will not turn it on for this particular model and it seems that there are a lot of users who have complained that even after fully charged and a reset  the device never turns on  well  that is exactly my experience  i purchased this charged it went to turn it on and have never gotten past a fully black screen even after following all of the instructions on the lenovo website for troubleshooting  i m used to devices being able to work like apple products right out of the box  so this is going back to amazon for a refund and i m going back to apple for a device that actually does what it says      
324,3.0,                       it is good but there was something unstable in the firmware or software  reboots on own but rarely in the months i had it  but basicaly missed my window of return  may go directly to lenovo      
325,5.0,                       great tablet  everything is excellent   however  no finger print sensor  otherwise it will be perfect      
326,1.0,                       goes really slow and clunky after a while     
327,5.0,                       this tablet was a gift for my mom because she can manage better a big screen for reading and having fun watching videos  the tablet is really amazing  it exceeds my spectation     the screen is really excellent  fhd      x       she can enjoy her videos in hd and with the dolby atmos speakers  it really delivers some entertainment for her     the battery last long  she uses it most for seen videos in youtube o netflix  and also for reading    price is great if u want a good tablet and u dont have much money  with the mediatek processor and android this tablet runs smoothly and is also powerful for ur daily activity excellent purchase and an excellent give for someone        
328,3.0,                       no good for streaming  netflix and amazon just sd   not even hd   keep un mind resolution ir this tablet is full hd      
329,4.0,                       tablet functions as its supposed to  however it often seems like it has to  stop and think about  what it needs to do  i press a button and the button indicates that its been pressed imediately but then sometimes takes several seconds for anything to happen  i only use it for games so i guess it will be ok  but i am a little disappointed      
330,1.0,                       very displeased with the fact that when trying to register the lenovo tab m   plus        fhd android tablet  with lenovo they say the warranty is already out of date so the only warranty i have is the    days from amazon and that is no sufficient  i bought these because i have always trusted lenovo products but seems from this seller the same does not hold true like an actual lenovo dealer so i would caution you look before buying     
331,4.0,my usage  mostly passive consumption and background use during work   youtube  podcasts  music  some movies for background noise   audible  prime video  some active tasks during downtime   kindle  web browsing  n   and dc emu gaming   what i like   solid and quality metal build    gb memory   gb storage  relatively stock vanilla android experience  not heavily forked   it will receive android     oct        nice screen resolution spec and ips panel  what s okay   dual speakers  not terrible but nothing spectacular  good enough for my needs as a lot of the time i used airpods or over the ear bluetooth headphones  what s expected for the budget price   what could have improved     nitpick  the power button placed above the volume rocker would have been more intuitive for me  i kept putting the device to sleep instead of turning the volume down  i still hesitate for a second to check what i m pressing    battery life  i didn t travel that much this year so it wasn t a deal breaker  but      mah battery is something you ll have to remember about regular charges  i believe the stand by time would also last less than   days if i forgot about the tablet  it would definitely be dead   gpu  the power vr      is from      which is pretty dated in tech terms  it doesn t benchmark well so if gaming is something you re into  you might want to consider another option    nitpick  the option for a persistent  recent  task tray icon instead of a swipe up gesture   on stock android  you can enable this  however  lenovo removed this option   netflix  prime video  and some other steaming apps  won t render full hd resolution because of widevine drm  this might be a huge deal breaker for some people who want to use it for streaming video   overall  i got this in may and was pleased with the      price point and the build  it s a nice little work companion as i don t use a ton of apps  maybe a dozen total  i think if you re not into gaming it will do just fine for you but you might want to consider the samsung a           pros for samsung   battery       mah vs      mah  gpu  adreno            vs powervr ge              significantly higher benchmarks  quad speakers vs  dual speakers   more powerful  slightly warmer and filling   full hd for streaming apps  netflix  prime video  etc   possibly more future support updates xda development  i recently got the a  on sale for         from amazon  reg        if it goes back up  wait for a black friday or holiday deal  for the  gb ram   gb storage   though it does have less ram and storage i think a few things make it a possible better option  i haven t noticed any lag difference with  gb ram for app tasks yet   ve got a regular habit of clearing the app tray unconsciously since the recent app button is there at all times  the   gb will be supplemented with a microsd card  so storage isn t too much of a worry for my needs  additionally i usually don t keep any apps around that i don t use  though the screen size is nearly identical  i don t feel any significant downgrade from the ips to a tft  plus  you will get back full hd resolution on video streaming apps  so a tft      p still beats ips     p or lower in my eyes   where i did notice a difference in performance was gaming  the samsung s adreno     gpu is noticeably faster and smoother than the m   s powervr ge     as to be expected from a near   year difference in age  i noticed this especially in several retro n   emu games  so i m glad i did get to test and compare  more than likely  i ll be selling the m   plus so somebody else can get use out of it as i don t need two tablets   i was never a huge fan of samsung s ui from the touchwiz days as i much prefer a stock android feel  however  their recent  one ui  interface doesn t feel clunky  i am using nova launcher just so i can give it more of a vanilla android feel with the icons and home screen features 
332,2.0,                       tablet is reasonable for the price  its a little slow   the touch isn t that sensitive      
333,5.0,                       glad i bought the  gig ram  i put a    gig sd in and have downloaded a grip of tv shows  this will be great for road trips  i ve tested it already on a trip and am happy so far  now for the true test  and that s a camping trip      
334,5.0,                    buena        
335,3.0,                       great look and feel  if you can i would recommend the option with  gb of ram the  gb option is too slow to do anything really      
336,5.0,                       lenovo is very fast and so far after two days  i like it a lot  i doubt if i will ever need more storage space  i love the fact that it has a metal back  it feels substantial and not flimsy in weight  i would recommend this to all  i love android  if you can t afford an ipad this is next best in my humble opinion      
337,4.0,                       i use the lenovo tab m   plus fhd mostly for browsing  emails and some gaming  i bought it specifically because of the   gb of ram and added a     gb micro sd  and that s where you will run into an issue with the lenovo tab m   plus fhd  microsd card slot tray  i had to return the first one as the tray would not eject  when my second one arrived  thank you amazon  i realized that the key does not cause the tray to eject  as it describes in the instructions  but you have to use the key to pry  very carefully and patiently the sd card slot  tray loose  this is not easy and it is the main reason i returned the first one as i did not figure out what the issue was until the second one arrived  it is not easy to  very carefully  remove the microsd card slot tray  so if you need the added external memory  this will be an issue for you  and the battery life is so so or average with the quality overall being pretty high these two issues cause me to rate the tablet   stars      
338,4.0,                       great for browsing  streaming and watching movies  i don t play games  very sturdy too with metal construction and great screen  but don t expect ipad performance and quality  yes  it s half the price  it s laggy sometimes but not to the point of being annoying  happy with my purchase overall      
339,4.0,                       the only issue i had was the shipping  was supposed to be same day  but order became lost  this resulted in finally getting it   days later  ordering  transferring data  and ease of setup was great      
340,5.0,                       i bought this tablet to stream movies on amazon and netflix and it does so perfectly  battery life can get you through several movies and the picture is great  sound from the speakers is good but i mainly use my earbuds  surfing the web is a little slow even with high speed wifi but that wasnt my reason for purchase  if surfing is your thing i would suggest spending a little more for one with a faster processor      
341,4.0,for the price  this thing is amazing  i m coming from a   year old samsung that was about the same price when new  this lenovo is very fast  and can run several apps at once without serious performance degradation  the  productivity mode  is great  and uses a few of the better concepts of ms windows or mac os  the display actually occupies the entire front of the unit  unlike most mid priced android tablets  which have this huge wasted space in a bezel around the edge   the two major drawbacks are audio and expansion  audio  this tablet sounds  awesome   the problem is that max volume is way too low  even connecting to an external bt speaker  it s barely loud enough to overcome my bathroom exhaust fan and shower water  my phone can do that without a speaker     expansion  i have a usb c dock with ethernet  hdmi output  usb ports  and sd card readers  this tablet refuses to recognize anything except the charging power pass through  my usb c phone recognizes everything on the dock with no problem  in fact  i needed to email dashcam video from the side of the road last week  and would have much rather used the big tablet display to do so  but instead had to use the itty bitty phone display because the phone works with the dock  the tablet does work with windows when plugged into a pc with a usb cable  mass storage mode  for file management  if they can release firmware that supports a dock or usb expansion  for mouse keyboard ethernet sd reader  etc   i ll knock this thing up to   stars and overlook the audio annoyance   one minor drawback   tap to wake  doesn t work after after a few seconds  if the display shuts off  i can double tap it within a few seconds and it wakes back up  any longer than that  and i have to hit the lock button to wake it  settings   been there done that  not a big deal  just a pita when i have it parked on a stand and try to use just one hand   update          battery life is not good  wifi is not stable  battery  i took it off a charger at the office at         hours ago  currently at     with zero usage  took it off the charger  closed the cover  and dropped it in my bag  just looked at battery now out of curiosity   if i forget to charge it and it s at     or less  i can t start a teams call on it   wifi  it will arbitrarily drop bandwidth and then connection entirely  but then reconnect ok  imagine this  you re on a teams call  and suddenly everyone freezes  then they come back and teams asks   bandwidth low  do you want to turn off video   then a few minutes later  the call freezes again  and you pull down status to find wifi disconnected  this isn t so bad when watching a movie or doing work that doesn t need real time connection  but quite disruptive to live collaboration calls  it happens on all wifi networks while other devices on the same networks see no disruption   if i wasn t past the return deadline  i d consider returning it based on these flaws  it would be a lifesaver if i could plug in the usb c dock and use gb ethernet  but i m not hopefull that will ever come  just have to hope now that someone will notice and fix wifi and battery with an update that doesn t kill performance  this thing is still a blowtorch   
342,3.0,                       the screen quality looked like it had bad filter turned on especially while watching various tv shows  the speakers wear very basic and didn t have any surround sound quality to it the tablet seem to be tripping over its own programing slow to load  like a device that is old and worn out  and maybe has to be cleared of all the programing clutter  like a old device the has to be reset to factory  even though its brand new simple settings like wifi buried under layers steps just to change something or reconnect to a device      
343,1.0,                       this is already a cheap  bottom of the line tablet so i wasn t expecting much  however  i was still somehow disappointed the battery life is nowhere near advertised  it ran dry in about   hours of just basic web surfing and such usually  even cheap devices will be fast at the start when not loaded up with apps but not this  insane lag  unresponsive  basic apps like settings will crash  pretty much unusablepiece of junk that not even the kids will enjoy  save for a more expensive tablet     
344,5.0,                       the tablet is working nicely for school work for a seven years old  she learned very fast how to use it  the only thing is sometimes the battery does not change well  after all night charge the battery appears at         
345,1.0,                       i purchased this tablet and really liked it  then  shortly after purchase  it started to buzz uncontrollably and shut down in the middle of what i was doing  after several incidents  i asked for a replacement thinking it was just that tablet   amazon was gracious enough to replace it  the replacement tablet came and within days it had the same problem  i ve never encountered any problems with my older lenovo     tablet that bit the dust after   years  lenovo is quite a good brand so i hope they figure out the problem with this m   and correct it i have ordered a samsung tab a  never any problems with samsung so keeping my fingers crossed     
346,3.0,                       so used to samsung tablets and although this was a decent tablet  it just wasn t for me     
347,5.0,                       very nice  tabletis  fast  all programs downloaded smoothly  i like this tablet  netflix  prime movies good pictures  battery life    hrs      
348,5.0,                       nice tablet   vivid colors and resolution when watching movies   we use this for online shopping  emails  streaming shows  and it functions fine for these applications   not crazy about the swiping to close windows  but the overall quality of this tablet is fine      
349,5.0,                       i am very happy with this purchase  my husband uses it to play clas of clans
