0,5.0,                       i cannot tell you how much i have enjoyed having a cast iron skillet in my life  i am not sure what took me so long  this is such a great and affordable way to get yourself a skillet that could out live you  if properly cared for  i used primal gourmets method of initial seasoning and it has served me quite well  i have made several dishes in this new skillet and i am quite pleased with the new addition to my kitchen      
1,5.0,                       i like buying usa products  you do need to season and it does have odor at first so i just ran the fan while heating it up the first time  i have switched to using cast iron whenever possible with my glass top stove and induction burner  love it  i am replacing my pans one at a time and will be buying more from lodge  i only have one problem and it is with amazon  i buy everything from amazon and they always use ups  i get deliveries after   pmrude drivers no saturday delivery and i don t have a choice on shipping  why does amazon not support the usp  i love using the post office and never have had any delivery problems ever  no i don t work for them  i ask one ups driver why they deliver so late and no saturday delivery like the post office and he smirked and said that s why their broke      
2,5.0,                       i bought this on a whim because of its small size   after i got it i was a bit shock at just how small it was   however   i pushed on   i went ahead and  seasoned it  a couple of times  pre seasoning is just the start of the process   not the end point  then again there is no real end point in seasoning  and decided to fry an egg   the little pan worked great   i don t believe there is any spatula that would work with this but if you like your fried egg sunny side up you are golden   however  i like mine  over easy    that required a flip onto a plate and a slide back into the skillet   this worked great because the seasoning process had made it very non stick  it was a pretty good fried egg   perfect size for an egg mcmuffin   i find that each time i see this lilliputian skillet on my stove  i giggle at how cute it is   i could be used as a spoon rest as well      
3,1.0,                       i followed the directions for washing and oiling this pan  however  it is a mess after just   uses   it looks rusty already despite my oiling it as directed   maybe it is because i put it directly in the oven but i thought you could do that   not happy with this product      
4,1.0,                       purchased from amazon in aug         didn t notice the crack until i added oil to fry some chops in december        skillet had oil on the bottom and on the electric stove   it was smoking and i wound up microwaving the chops   after inspecting the skillet  i found the hair line crack   i have purchased lodge cast iron in the past and they have always been a quality product   this skillet is an obvious exception   would like to resolve issue if possible      
5,5.0,                       it took some time to get it completely seaoned  it says it is but it has to be reseasoned after every use for awhile  i learned not to leave it wet too  it will rust but that can be scoured out  after     months of use  food pretty much doesn t stick  on the other hand  it does not function like a nonstick pan does  you still have to do a little scouring after frying meat in it but it s not hard to clean it does seem to cook food faster and more evenly  i m glad that i bought it because i know that in   months to a year of use  the coating won t be flaking off  i won t have to throw it away and buy a new pan      
6,4.0,                       lodge is amazing  i m starting a collection of cast iron to cook with and the quality blows most other companies away this skillet is big  if you live in an apartment with and older stove chances are this will hang over your large burners by a lot  i find i have to heat this baby slow and low to get it up to a good temp  lots of room and is amazing for one pan dishes  large steaks etc the holder it comes with is not nearly as impressive as the skillet though  the plastic just isn t thick enough to protect your hand from the heat of the handle for more than a moment or two unless you are cooking on low heat  just grab a couple good ol cloth pot holders or you might get burned      
7,1.0,                       i followed the website s instructions and even watched supplementary videos on how to clean this cast iron skillet and how to season it   never once did i use anything to scour or scrub it in order to keep it in great condition     months after the initial use i started to see pieces of the pan in my food  ruining my dinner   i have thrown this pan away  good luck to you all      
8,5.0,                       excellent alternative to all these non stick cook wares   back to the basic like your grandma cooked it   it works   it s healthy   it last and won t get burnt easily like those non stick coating   way to go if you have to fry foods that otherwise could stick to the frying pan and you do not want to use cookwares with non stick coating   we still use stainless steel cookwares for other cooking that does not have the potential of sticking      
9,5.0,                       always wanted to try cast iron skillets so i got the   inch  you can pretty much do everything with it and it will last a lifetime as long as you treat it right  the first couple uses are better if you cook food with higher fat content like meats and such  after a couple uses i started doing eggs and pancakes in it flawlessly  to clean mine  i do the following while the pan is still hot  combine kosher salt with a little oil and scrub hard with a sponge or rag  rinse and dry it  then put a little oil to spread all over  place it over the stove until you see smoking  then remove it  cool down  and you re ready to go for next time  the quality of this pan is amazing and usa made  can t ask for more than that  the flavors of foods really come alive cooking with this and distributes heat evenly      
10,1.0,                       bought in june of last year due to what i had heard regarding durability  used it less than    times and noticed a crack forming near the handle      
11,5.0,                       bought this lodge          skillet in      from amazon    it has been well used and is holding up just fine   it cooks everything from roasted potatoes and carrots to baking bread in the oven   have had no issues with any rusting and rarely have to season it   i do clean it right after each use with hot water    dry it and then coat it with a bit of oil   this pan has now many memories of many family meals   i was hesitant to buy a cast iron skillet as i did not want a pan that everything sticks to and would be hard to clean   i am really glad i took a chance and got this pan    the non stick pans that would stick after the teflon started wearing off no matter how careful you were taking care of them   and required being replaced every year have nothing on cast iron   once your cast iron is well seasoned it is non stick   i paid about        for this skillet and five years     months  later it is in perfect condition and likely will never need replacing    in the same time prior to having cast iron the non stick skillets would have to be replaced yearly    i also bought the lodge cast iron griddle   in fact bought that one first a year before buying this skillet    the cast iron griddle  is the best for cooking pancakes   before that pancakes never cooked right   i also really love that lodge is made in america   i have since purchased many more lodge cast iron pans  for myself and to give as gifts to others  so far all the lodge cast iron purchased  have worked just fine   yes cast iron takes a small bit of care but it really is not hard to maintain    it keeps food hot a long time and i love that about cast iron   going back for second helpings out of cast iron  your food is still hot enough to not need to be reheated    buying the lodge cast iron serving dishes for that very reason   it is not delicate   it is rough and rugged and will last a lifetime   lodge even gives a lifetime warranty on their cast iron    i read some of the reviews that were saying the quality of lodge had gone down   i only know that we just bought two of the    skillets and two of the   quart pans with lids and they seem of the same great quality as this skillet bought years ago  thank you lodge for the wonderful cast iron cookware and thank you amazon       
12,5.0,                       this has become my absolute favorite cast iron pan  it fits perfectly on the middle burner of my gas stove  it s large enough for me to cook enough food for my family in one go instead of needing to do multiple batches  it heats up nicely and is extremely easy to clean      
13,5.0,                       i love my cast iron  i used to be a cookware snob  i have had pretty much every type of high end pan  my latest set was a viking stainless steel set  which are great  i also used non stick pans for some things  but got worried about the potential toxicity of the non stick surface wearing away into the food  so i researched and came up with cast iron  which by chance my grandmother swore by in her cooking days  granted  it takes a while to get the skillet properly  seasoned  and to learn not to clean it with soap after use  but now my pan is very well seasoned after about   months of good use  i have bought more of various sizes and my expensive vikings no longer see use  set the chain link steel scrubbers  i have the    circular one for about     from amazon  this has many other uses in the kitchen as well  i couldn t be happier      
14,3.0,                       i ve had several  cast iron skillets over my lifetime so don t understand why i am having so much trouble with this one   i use a low slow heat and it s supposed to be pre oiled and i add a little more oil yet everything sticks to it   the surface of this skillet seems to have some kind of texture that i do not recall being on cast iron skillets of the past so am wondering if that s why i m having problems      i m sorry i bought it      
15,5.0,                       lodge pretty much leads the way with affordable cast iron pans  we have probably six or seven lodge cast iron pans  pots  pizza stones  crepe pans  etc  they re the most affordable durable brand on the market right now  they re great  we ve converted several family members to cast iron  i feel like they need very little explanation  they re our go to for every cooking need the only thing that we don t use lodge cast iron for is cooking lasagna  lodge  can you please make a lasagna pan  we re outdoorsy  we cook on the oven  stove  bbq  and  when camping  over fire pit  these work in every scenario  i just want to be able to cook lasagna in the cold of wisconsin without having to worry about a glass dish breaking when we take it out of the oven  if you take glass out of an oven or bbq and it s too cold outside  the glass will shatter pretty much immediately  and that s not fun       
16,1.0,                       first pan arrived with large scratches on bottom of pan   was returned and i ordered a replacement   second pan came with actual rusty area on rim of pan   not good on a cast iron pan   will return and not try ordering another   with the defects on both pans  neither should have been sent out   very disappointing      
17,5.0,                       about me   intermediate homestyle cooki switched to iron because of the health problems surrounding some of the other non stick cooking surfaces at first i was going to give this product   stars because there is a learning curve but then i decided that i should rate the product for what it is  an iron skillet   that being said  the product gets   stars because it is a quality iron skillet   i started off with a smaller   in lodge iron skillet and things stuck terribly to it   after watching numerous youtube videos on seasoning an iron skillet  i now have a method that works for me i would definitely recommend seasoning the skillet before you use it the first time   the directions may say it is factory seasoned  but i think not seasoning it before the first use was part of my problem on the small   in skillet   by the way  i now fry eggs on my iron skillet almost everyday with no stick i have tried many different types of oil for seasoning my iron skillets   the oil that has worked best for me is extra virgin coconut oil   i do not know all the science behind the different types of oil or if one is healthier than another  but this has been the only one that has worked well for me   evoo and canola did not work out well   before i used this skillet for the first time  i cleaned and dried the skillet  applied extra virgin coconut oil and followed the oven seasoning convention method after each use  i clean it with water  dry it thoroughly over a stove burner and wipe it down with extra virgin coconut oil  which prevents it from rusting pros   well made  food in an iron skillet just seems to taste better  especially potatoes   once you get use to cooking on it and seasoning it correctly  sticking is not much of an issue   nice size for   or   people cons   learning curve to cooking on iron   a lot of sticking is caused by incorrect cooking temperatures and or turning prematurely   i would like to see a little smoother factory surface   i have noticed that the more i use this skillet  the smoother it gets   once you begin cleaning the skillet  it needs to be dried and oiled right away to prevent rusting   citrus foods like tomatoes  lemons etc  reacts with the iron and changes the flavor for the worse      
18,5.0,                       i am very happy with my new cast iron pan  i have used cast iron throughout my life and i have always had to season my pans for several months before i could fry an egg without it sticking  this pan came pre seasoned and is amazing  i gave it the fried egg test as the first food to cook in it  it cooked them perfectly and nothing stuck to the pan  i m extremely satisfied and highly recommend this pan  i plan to buy another pan soon      
19,5.0,                       love the preseasoned pan   used it to pan fry steaks and it worked like a charm   heat oven to     with the skillet in it   remove the skillet with the oven is up to temp   place the skillet on the stove top over high heat   place a room temp oiled  salted and peppered rib eye of other well marbled steak in the skillet   brown for    seconds to   minute on each side   return the skillet with steak to the oven for   to   minutes  rest for    under aluminum foil tent       
20,4.0,                       the pre seasoning seems to not stick too well  you better oil this thing and stick it in your oven for an hour before using it   but  whatever  this procedure shouldn t scare you if you use cast iron cookware other than that  the only complaint is that the handle is a little shorted than expected  making it harder to lift than it needs to be   standard silicon handles don t fit for the same reason   use a freaking towel  lol     
21,4.0,                       i cannot give a very thorough review because i gave this as a gift to my single son so i am giving an extra star above  it s ok  hoping it cooks a small amount well   it is a lot smaller than i expected   the   inches must be the outside diameter of the top of the pan counting the lips and then some   it looks to me like the bottom cooking surface is about    on this one  large enough to cook an egg  but not a pan of cornbread   i confess that i didn t measure it  but i wonder if i might have been accidently sent a    one   there were not tags   i sure wish i had gotten a larger one   it is nice and heavy and seems smooth   i printed out instructions for seasoning it for him and hope he will enjoy it and learn cast iron   if he likes it i will order him a larger one   my  what i thought was a     inch cast iron skillet looks huge compared to this one      
22,5.0,                       even after seasoning this pan it still had a little sticking  i had to cook some high fat foods on it for a while to really get it to where it needed to be  needless to say it is quite non stick now  heavy heavy pan   obviously  cast iron   i m very pleased with it  probably got it for    or so less dollars than i could have at my local chains  it actually pulls heat very quickly  please don t put them in the dishwasher  mine is regularly just hanging out with a coating of previous great on it  i ll give it a quick wipe down and every now and then take it to the sink and immediately dry it  it has been going strong and doing a great job for about   months now  i am very pleased with my purchase      
23,5.0,                       i first bought the     cast iron and returned to buy the     too  i love these pans  to season the pan  yes  it is pre seasoned  but   if you want the best  just coat the pan with a light coating of cooking oil and put it in the oven at     for    minutes  then  turn the oven off and let the pan cool off  that s it  if you want to get really fancy  repeat this process     times  you ll have to chase a fried egg around the pan  slippery  i have owned the pans for several months and these are the only pans i cook in now  they really hold the heat  and they really are non stick   yes  the pans are heavy  but you ll get used to it  i use these pans on the stove top and in the oven  the best part is when a recipe requires cooking in a pan and then transferring the contents into bakeware      
24,5.0,                       i purchased this for a specific recipe that called for a cast iron pan but now i use it more often than not  i love that it can go from the stovetop into the oven and vice versa   the photo of prosciutto wrapped stuffed chicken breast i made in the lodge pan was a huge hit with the family  steaks are amazing  fajitas  stir fry  etc    i ve never been able to successfully cook an egg in it but everything else turns out wonderfully  i am happy with this purchase      
25,5.0,                       i am so happy i purchased this  i ve been wanting a cast iron skillet for some time and finally made the commitment  this is a great  sturdy and well made product  of my own fault  i was a little thrown back by the huge size of it but hey  it clearly stated it was    inches  which it certainty is  i just failed to picture what    inches would be and that was my bad  but being cast iron  you have to expect it will be thicker and larger than a cheaper    inch skillet  after getting it though  i m glad it was large because i will be able to cook a lot more things than i used to be able to with my girlfriends   or    inch skillet  i was so happy with it  that i went ahead and ordered another  smaller sized lodge cast iron skillet for smaller things  this is my first time having a lodge product but i am very impressed with the quality and i am proud that it is made in the u s a  i am so happy that i didn t purchase the chinese made   pack of skillets  especially after reading in the reviews about the seasoning flaking off and seeming cheap  none of those issues here with this lodge skillet  so  unless something major happens with this skillet in the next few months  which i highly  highly doubt   i ll be a lodge user for life for any cast iron needs  the silicon handle cover was just an added bonus and the combo was cheaper than getting just the     skillet alone      
26,1.0,                       i have   dutch ovens    frying pans of different sizes  a deep sided chicken fryer and a corn bread skillet   all of which are cast iron and       years old they are perfectly seasoned and i use them on a daily basis  i just rinse them while they are still warm  apply a little oil and they are ready for the next use  but not this piece of trash  it is not seasoned  in fact i reseasoned it   times and it still sticks  the surface is so rough everything is going to stick and no amount of seasoning will help  i m trying to figure out what to do with it as using it to cook with is not an option      
27,5.0,                       this good sized refurbished cast iron skillet is perfect for all of my needs  it comes pre seasoned so i didn t have to worry about doing that before i started cooking  the brand  lodge    is a well trusted and respected company  i definitely would purchase another refurbished lodge   skillet through amazon      
28,5.0,                       we have other cast iron cookware from lodge                 but needed something a bit bigger for larger meals and entertaining   this     skillet is perfect   we ve already cooked my wife s famous fried chicken  pork chops  and a couple of ny strips   all came out perfectly this is a very heavy product  so look for any amazon prime deals with the free   day shipping if you can   we also recommend the handle and lip protectors as well   cast iron is wonderful in that it cooks so evenly  and makes flavors pop   just carefully follow the instructions as to cleaning cast iron or you can easily ruin a great product   we use avocado oil after cleaning we also bought the matching lodge tempered glass lid for our skillet   worth the money as well      
29,5.0,                       like everything lodge  this is a great piece of metal   that s not why this is   stars unlike normal skillets  this chef s skillet has noticeably sloped sides  with an angle about halfway between a normal cast iron skillet and a stainless steel pan   this   is   phenomenal   you can actually stir things around when you need to the cleanup is much easier because you have angles that are not    degrees  it is just such a joy to use compared to normal frustration that i have with skillets   breakfast skillet dishes have never been so easy to make      
30,5.0,                       this       is like super  big   it s so large  that it s shocking when you open it  it s awesome  but much larger than your mind thinks it will be  haha  i love it s for cooking a large brisket or a large amount of food for a family gathering  the original seasoning is good  but i decided to coat it with canola oil lightly and and toss it in the oven for one more coat of seasoning  if your thinking about it   go for it and purchase it   but remember my review it s huge     lol   no lie     
31,5.0,                       this lodge skillet is very heavy and will do the cooking job  whatever it might be   i like that the skillet is versatile enough to go from the stove top into the oven   although it came preseasoned  i m going to take the advice of others and reseason it myself   i don t use anything straight out of the box without doing some cleaning   you really don t know where the pan has been  and it s easy enough to clean it and then reseason it   i m looking forward to making skillet cornbread  and who knows what else   for one person the     size seems more than adequate   it should fit a whole main course of whatever i m cooking  with leftovers      
32,5.0,                       i love lodge cast iron skillets  i have this one  several smaller fry pans and their dutch oven  this skillet is quite heavy  so i recommend you consider that before purchasing it  especially if you have a glass top range  dropping this skillet on the glass top or your foot could be disastrous   it s not a problem if your are reasonably careful  i have a glass top  so i use both hands when handling this skillet  if you don t mind dealing with the weight  it s a great skillet  if you are new to cooking with cast iron  i recommend you also buy the lodge brush or a comparable brush to clean the cast iron   if you keep it well seasoned   it s very easy to clean with soapy water and a good brush   the lodge products come pre seasoned  but you ll want to re season them occasionally  lodge includes seasoning instructions with all of their cast iron products  those instructions are also available on the lodge website and i recommend you check out that website if you are going to invest in any lodge products      
33,5.0,                       i love cooking in a cast iron skillet  food comes out amazing and it is really much easier to deal with than my circulon set i would note a few things about this particular skillet    the silicon handle is a nice addition    it is big  i might have gotten the smaller size if i realized it but i think the better way to go is to get this one and a smaller size  the largest size can be a bit to handle  especially if you are going from stove top to oven    the pre season was probably fine  but i went ahead and did my own seasoning  i also use      caron   doucet   cast iron oil   cast iron conditioner        plant based from refined coconut oil  will not go rancid or sticky   helps maintain seasoning on all cast iron cookware                         after each use  i also picked up one of these       lodge scrbrsh scrub brush     inch                        which is helpful for cleaning but not necessary      
34,1.0,                       it was so horrible  did i miss a step prepare the pot  before using  it got so sticky  sticker to everything  it was so difficult to clean   and i got burn touching the handle it was my own fault      
35,5.0,                       i bought this for my son as he wanted a bigger skillet  i purchased this one as it got great reviews and the price was right  he uses it all the time and the size works great for him  especially cooking for a family of four     
36,5.0,                       the number one reason i ordered this brand is because it s made in america  i wanted a pan that was made in america because you never know what metals are used in those imported products  if you hear reports about lead in toys  i could only imagine what you ll find in a solid iron product  which is the reason i can t understand why some of the famous chef products are not made in the usa i was worried about using this on my glass top range because i was afraid that it may crack the top of it but i worried for no reason  this is one of the best pans to use if you have a glass top stove simply because it holds the heat and cooks evenly when i received the pan  i washed it thoroughly using regular dish washing liquid and then dried it  i then cooked some bacon in a separate pan  drained the grease and placed in the refrigerator  once the grease was a lard consistency  i smeared a thin even coat of bacon grease fat all over the pan  i then placed the pan out on the gas grill for an hour at     degrees  some of that baked on bacon grease will flake off but it keeps the pan smooth  whenever i use the pan  i ll either wash in soapy water or i ll fill the pan with water and boil it on the stove  after i clean the pan  i wipe the inside down with vegetable or canola oil to season and keep from rusting this is one of the best pans to use if you re cooking hamburgers or searing steaks      
37,5.0,                       the first thing that i would recommend doing with this cast iron skillet is to remove the pre seasoning and re season this skillet at least   to   times before using  once you have a proper seasoning on this skillet it is unstoppable  i have cooked so many different dishes inside of this cast iron skillet including desserts  if you take care of this skillet  meaning you cook with it  you clean it properly  no dish soap  not even a little   and re season it after every use  it will last you a lifetime and produce some of the best food you have ever eaten      
38,5.0,                       updated          i did some research  followed tips  now this chef s skillet is my favorite thing  kept using it in spite of sticking problems early on   it now has a satin finish  and nothing ever sticks to it  my    yr old son cooks perfect over easy eggs in it and it wipes clean with a paper towel   it has been a good experience teaching him to use  clean  maintain  and most importantly  respect cast iron cookware my advice is to keep using your cast iron skillet  especially if you don t have luck at first because you need to figure it out   the pan isn t the problem  the cast iron knows what it s doing  the user doesn t and that s why it rusts or food sticks heat it slowly  i heat mine over a very very low heat for ten minutes  i actually used to set a timer until i got used to it  rushing it only leads to sticking  after ten minutes  i put in a nickel size amount of oil and gently slide in the eggs  after some time to set up  maybe a full minute   i can nudge them with a spatula and they ll slide around the skillet like they re on ice  eggs are cheap so keep practicing   you ll master it in no time  and it s a very satisfying feeling     you ll never go back to teflon cookware once you see how much better food tastes when it is prepared in cast iron  best of luck      
39,3.0,                       i have used these pans for years  as did my mother before me    i bought this one as it said it was preseasoned but my first cooking of cornbread was a disaster as the whole bottom of the cornbread stuck to the pan   this was my second lodge   the others were other black iron skillets   i have seasoned others in the past and i now have this new one seasoning   i only cook cornbread in this skillet as a majority of us older adults in the south do   i no longer fry foods   i guess if the next cornbread i cook after this seasoning sticks  i will have to return it and order another      
40,4.0,                       first time with a iron pan  i found a little bit dangerous because goes really hot really fast and the handle doesn t offer any protection to avoid any burn  so i bought the londge s silicone sleeve too  but still is hot the handle i think i need use this more frequently to improve my cast iron steel pan skills  but is very easy to use and clean looks very resistant but again you need be careful to avoid any fingers burn     
41,5.0,                       love this little skillet  i got it specifically to make a skillet cookie for my husband  and i have made many since then   they are so good    easy to use  nothing stuck to it  easy to season  i also got the larger size and cook with it all the time   love that it can go from stovetop to oven  they are very heavy and feel like good quality      
42,5.0,                       non stick from the first use  even heat distribution and retention this is my first cast iron pan  so i did some basic research on care and use  there are some blogs that suggest sanding the lodge pan  but that would take off the factory seasoning i cook  wash with water and a stainless steel chain mail scrubber and put back on the stove to dry over med heat for just a min  when it s dry  i rub with a little oil and let it be      
43,5.0,                       my husband likes to cook with cast iron since he was in boyscouts and it s one of those things that gets better with time  the more you cook with it  the more  seasoned  it gets from all the oil deposited onto the pan  it heats very evenly  even on our crappy electric range  and i ve noticed when we cook things on it they tend to be fluffier and evenly cooked  it does take some adjusting if you re used to teflon non stick cookware  and the cleanup is different  we rinse it out with water while it s still hot  giving it a light scrub with a dish scrubby then wipe it out with a damp sponge  when possible  i d avoid soap because it just washes away the seasoning  built up oil   it has a very nice heft to it and doesn t feel cheap   if that makes sense another nice thing is that this is american made so you have some sense of pride in the quality of it  they do sell these at wal mart for about the same price as we purchased it online  so if you want to just go look at them in person you could very easily      
44,2.0,                       attached are   photos a shot of correctly   seasoned  pana close up of its surfacea close up of the lodge pan surfacevery disappointed that what is advertised asa  preseasoned  cast iron pan  was not  i have   other cast iron pans of varying sizes  and anyone who owns a cast iron pan that is truly seasoned knows  that the cooking surface is smooth  sealed  and non porous   that s what makes it a preferred surface to cook on   instead  this pan arrived with a pitted  porous cooking surface  which renders it unsuitable for that which it was purchased   additionally  the silicon hot handle holder is ineffective as a pot holder  when using this pan on the surface of a cooktop  or in an oven or broiler  it simply does not prevent enough of the heat from the handle of the pan from reaching your hand to make it useful      
45,5.0,                       this is the first cast iron pan i ve owned that wasn t once owned by my grandmother and didn t have a smooth cooking surface   i ve seasoned my pans a number of times and expected to do so on this one   it was the rough bottom that concerned me so i was pleasantly surprised at how well the pan performed   i ve used it to cook chicken  pork chops  pancakes  potatoes  and a few other things likely to stick   they don t   the pan performs as well as those grandma owned and i couldn t be happier      
46,5.0,                       pan  seared a whole chicken oven roaster in this skillet yesterday and what a beautiful crust it gave that bird    not with any other pan ever did i get such results  then i transferred it to the oven  unlike before i would have to transfer into another long baking dish    the chicken would never stay intact and i would have more dirty dishes to wash it was soooooooo delicious  we ate from it till we coldn t eat no more i anticipate cooking in this one everyday this skillet is very generous and i did buy the lid for it  that s another story review  what another great peice to have after you season that big ol  lid comes unseasoned   helper handle is a must cause it s impossible to carry this skillet with one handle very heavy alone so with food it weighs a ton    be careful always to cover the handle after the iron gets hot   ouch i gotta say i don t know how the heck i was living without cast iron  it did take me a while to get a hang of the seasoning process because even with those preseasoned peices you still really gotta season it yourself to get that non stick and glossy surface  so after a few episodes of pooling of seasoning and  and trying out different kinds of shortenings and oils and smoke detectors going off  i finally found my own method   i hope you find yours  it s very simple though like i said once you get the hang of it  and the iron just keeps getting better and better and darker and darker  i threw all my non stick out after all of them warped   and the crazy thing about it is that they were top of the line   triple the cost of iron  i bought them from macy s  bloomingdale s    expensive  make a long story short i love this pot and with some tlc you will love it too and perhaps give it to someone you really  really really love after    years or so      
47,5.0,                       i was worried the rough surface would cause sticking  but i have found it to be a non issue  the pre seasoning has some issues though  its not hard to fix  but i don t think anyone should uses these pans as is  if you wipe a clean towel across it you will notice there is a black film  this is not how cast iron cookware should be   what you really need to do is    scrub the pan thoroughly in hot soapy water with a green scrubby or steel wool to wash off any residual oil and black film   wipe the pan dry with a dry towel    heat the pan on your stove top to warm it up and make sure its totally dry    wipe a thin coat of oil all over the pan   any cooking oil is fine    wipe as much of the oil off as you can with a dry paper towel  what you want is an ultra thin coat of oil    bake the pan at         degrees for at least an hour  then let the pan cool inside the oven you should now have a well seasoned pan  if there is any black residue when you wipe it with a clean towel repeat the steps above  but it should be good to go after just one seasoning      
48,5.0,                       i like the handle grip on this pan  it fits nice and snug and it makes the pan easy to use and protects your had from the extreme heat these type of pans generate  the only thing i don t care about the pan is that the surface seems rough  on some older cast iron skillets the surface is smooth  it seems like all the newer cast iron pans are being made with the rougher surface for some reason      
49,5.0,                       i use this pan for everything  i would be werry of putting it in the dish washer though  even though directions says its okay  as with any cast iron pan if it stays to wet it starts to rust immediatelyit s  a bit of a bear to properly break in  i found vegetable oil and long bake times        to be the best  but even after that i am still getting some sticking  even with lots of lube   i really chalk it all up to the learning curve of a cast iron pan   i still love it and don t leave home without it      
50,5.0,                       it s a solid cast iron pan  i advise following the seasoning directions you can find online  use avocado oil and slowly ramp up the temp in stages  i did that  and the first use was with scrambled eggs  they came right out  watch a video online if you re not convinced   there are plenty  if anything gets a little stuck  just throw in some sat and scrub with a paper towel until it comes out  then rinse  dry on the burner for a few minutes  then wipe down with some oil and let it sit until it s cool again a step more than a nonstick pan to clean  but way cheaper  healthier  and it ll perform better a year from now rather than being ready to throw away  like every nonstick pan i ve had  from all clad to calphalon to granite stone to ceramic       
51,2.0,                       i am very disappointed with this pan   i bought the preseasoned because of good reviews   but everything sticks like crazy   even when i use butter or oil   eggs   cornbread   ruined   i didn t know how to distribute the stars on the specifics of heat distribution easy to clean heat resistance because those aren t really the problem   however  if you can t get food out of the pan cleanly  it is not functional      
52,5.0,                       this is my  nd lodge cast iron pan  i also have the      this bigger size is a beast  it s so heavy  in a good way  the handle cover is really nice and helps wield the pan because it truly is a heavy pan  i use this for all kinds of cooking  steaks  veggies  frittata  etc  it cleans so easy with a little water and steel scrubber  then i season it with tallow or olive oil  i have a feeling i ll have this pan for     years  great price for this quality      
53,5.0,                       this has become my go to pan   absolutely love it   i cook eggs on it all the time   secret  as with all cast iron  is to heat pan first on medium  spray or add butter  oil  etc    no need to add a lot  just coat bottom and sides   food will not stick   gets better the more you use it   and the great sloped shape of a chef skillet makes it great for omelets   yes the inside is kinda rough  but doesn t effect the performance   i use a lodge nylon brush to clean with just very hot water  don t use soap   i have several griswold vintage skillets  cooking surface is like glass  and the main advantage they have over lodge is their light weight   but they are expensive if you can find nice ones   this pan is an absolue bargain      
54,4.0,                       love the heaviness of this pan    it cooks meat to perfection  it does best when using med to low heat and a lid  i bring the heat up to get the pan nice and hot  sear my meat  hen turn the heat down with a lid cover  i was lucky i had   lids that fit perfectly  my only problem is cleaning and i know it ll get better with time  i ve had to reseason the pan but that s probably my fault  i m still in the learning curve      
55,5.0,                       i have been longing for a skillet to replace the one mistakenly thrown out by others   this is everything i wanted and the size weight ratio is perfect large enough to make some wonderful food  but light enough that it s not a pain to use   cleaning and oiling are simple  and i love that it arrived pre seasoned   that s a task that is not on my list of favorite things to do      
56,3.0,                       i was a quite disappointed with the quality of this pan  i did not expect much from the factory seasoning  but i still tried it once on eggs  with disastrous results  i was hardly non stick   i stripped the entire seasoning with oven cleaner and used     grit sandpaper to smooth out the cooking surface and inner sides  unfortunately  i discovered a small number of holes in the surface that would have required me to sand off too much of the surface  due to the relatively low price and the amount of effort i had already invested  i did not return it but proceeded instead to season it with flaxseed oil    season cycles oven   i am quite happy with the result but still annoyed by the presence of these imperfections in the surface  as a result  i wouldn t recommend this pan  on a final note  i ve had two larger sized     inches  pan that did not present these issues      
57,4.0,                       yup  it is non stick  before using it i d coated it w  canola oil and baked       for an hour  then left it sit in the cooling oven over night before opening the oven door  yea  it smelled like hot iron so i opened a window   i used it the next day to bake beans  and they did not stick   i repeated the same coat n bake  and leave over night to cool  then the next thing i cooked was  peach cobbler and had no problem with sticking  the pan has a glassy coating after two treatments and two uses and does not have to be treated again  now after rinsing with hot water  no soap  i dry it with a dish towel  rub a dab of oil around it before putting it away  canola oil works better than olive oil for the treating because it can take the higher temp and is thinner i can t go   stars because the pan is heavy   but that s the nature of cast iron   takes two hands to lift i also have an enameled le creuset skillet but i like the straight sides of the lodge better  go figure      
58,3.0,                       i bought this skillet for my mom who exclusively uses cast iron pans  she recently got a new glass top range and wanted to replace her smallest iron pan with one that has a smooth under side  no ridges   this product met that expectation  but has a very rough highly textured cooking surface  we have seasoned it   times now but food still sticks to the pan  we hope that with continued use this problem will resolve but for now we won t be frying any eggs in it      
59,4.0,                       i got these because i wanted to stop using teflon and was concerned about food safety  i didn t use them very much at first because they were very heavy and frankly didn t really know how to season or maintain them  however  after watching some seasoning videos  i feel like i have a new hobby  there is something about creating your own seasoning on these that add a personal touch to the cook ware and make you feel good when you watch stuff come off them with little to no stick  i like making omelettes on these because it cooks the eggs slowly  i tend to leave a mess when i flip omelettes but these cook more of the egg on top with out burning the bottom  i noticed a difference with using these for making pizza crust in the oven  i clean my pan by using a non abrasive sponge  water  wiping them dry  heating them in the stove to make sure they are super dry and oiling them  seems to work to prevent rust and keeping it non stick  a little more work than normal nonstick but some people use theirs often enough that they don t even wash them everyday and just wipe them  sound gross you say  but apparently heating these to     degrees kills all the germs cons  they are heavy  so maneuvering and washing these are kind of a hassle the handle is short and get super hot which can make taking them out of the oven kind of dangerous and difficult for a small wristed person with no upper body strength  i would try carbon steel if you think this will be a big issue  but otherwise i would recommend these for someone who doesn t might the weight and is looking for durable  versatile  non stick cookware for a relatively cheap price who doesn t might heating and oiling these after use      
60,5.0,                       i bought this mainly to use as a spoon tongs rest while i am cooking  i suppose you could use it for cooking small singular items like an egg  if you had a bunch of them you could use them to cook single brownies  or something similar  and serve them warm right in them  the shipping packaging was not good  i was lucky it wasn t broken when i got it  absolutely no padding in the box  it s unfortunate that i see this a lot with cast iron shipping  which is why i don t mail order cast iron often  i included photos of the box and a pic of it on my stove while cooking for size comparison      
61,5.0,                       a plastic lodge scraper and a stainless scrub pad is all you need to keep it clean  never use soap  i just restored my older pans that were in storage for   years  and bit rusty  with the ss scrub pad  and then baked them in the oven per lodge s instructions  except  i used coconut oil instead of olive  they looked pretty much perfect after a quick scrub   again  no soap   but i did the baking thing anyway  some food sticks a bit  but is so easily cleaned off  did is mention to never use soap heating is very even  except with the square pancake pan where the corners don t get hot enough to evenly cook your pancakes  i use the larger fry pan for pancakes now  if you want to save a little gas or electricity  turn the burner off about a minute or   before your food is done  there is so much residual heat in these heavy pans that food will finish cooking unlike  non stick  cookware  you will never need to baby these  and  ladies  given how heavy and indestructible they are  they may prove useful for getting hubby s and teenager s undivided attention      
62,5.0,                       the              diameter top     diameter bottom  skillet has got to be the most adorable  cutest skillet ever  i call it  baby skillet   it is so small  though  this size is appropriate for only an individual meal  i can t see the skillet even being big enough to cook half size slices of bacon  i will buy the    skillet  i already have  and love  several lodge cast iron skillets and dutch ovens  lodge products distribute heat evenly  and are very easy to clean  i saw a reviewer say the lodge skillet she got is hard to clean and  frankly  i have no idea what that person is talking about    sounds like a smear against lodge  which leads the industry in quality       
63,4.0,                       great skillet and i m really happy with it   i give it   stars only due to packaging and shipping   it s loose in a box and could have resulted  in damage   mine arrived fine however other buyers rcvd damaged skillets   i do not blame amazon employees for this   they are working incredibly hard to get items out and meet unrealistic demands placed on them  amazon  yeah jeff  do better   particularly for your employees who have to work within the constraints placed on them      
64,1.0,                       i have two other cast iron skillets that have each lasted for over forty years   this one did not even last for four uses   i buffed out the bottom to make it smoother  then seasoned it in the oven   fried bacon it in twice and and fried some potato slices in the bacon grease immediately after the second time   while pouring out the excess bacon grease i noticed that the the side had cracked about half way down from the rim   the pan had never been subjected to high heat  never been put on a fire empty  never had cold water put on it while it was even warm  let alone hot   it was just defective and i can only be thankful that it was not the cause of a fire on my stove top      
65,5.0,                       i was a little surprised how large this skillet was  but i m very pleased  it came very well seasoned  i rubbed some crisco all over it and put it in the oven  later in the day  i prepared a vegetable medley and cooked it in the oven in this skillet  it turned out great  of course  typical of a lodge product  this is a very sturdy  dense piece of iron  you will likely need to use the added handle to lift and move it  because of its size  the skillet overhangs most burners  still  it does a great job on bacon and i just made some fried rice in it last night  pretty amazing  i recommend this skillet      
66,5.0,                       this skillet has proved itself for making cornbread  it did a great job in the oven  the heat was distributed evenly and the cornbread came out perfect  i give it a true five stars  chefs kiss  make sure you check the size so you know it s a smaller than average skillet  it s just right for me and the oven but doublecheck for yourselves  the silicone handle cover is a nice bonus  i tried it on a few different metal handled pots and it worked  but didn t keep it on the skillet of course      
67,5.0,                       it s a lodge cast iron skillet  can t say much else about it  it ll tear thru the shipping box  so hopefully the transit to your house isn t too far else you might end with an empty box every size has its purpose  i have   or five of these skillets now ranging from      to the    inch skillet i ve only had to replace one of the skillets after my sister dropped it and the handle broke off with a part of the skillet wall      
68,4.0,                       this review is for the     inch cast iron  skillet   since amazon is currently grouping multiple sizes of lodge cast iron skillets in the same review group    the thing is tiny  but then again it says     inch quite clearly   i use mine for melting butter serving melted butter and it does the job well and with a certain refined rustic style that only comes from cast iron cookware   it is a quality item  like most lodge cast iron  and made in the usa like so few things are these days  but it does have limited use potential due to its small size   my only complaint is that the cooking surface is rather rough  downright bumpy even  and would have been better had they sanded and smoothed the surface down a bit before finishing   otherwise i love it      
69,5.0,                       i have a          skillets  a     flat frying pan and a rectangular griddle  all lodge   i also have a     skillet by another mfg  i have had for at least thirty years   it took a few years to become perfectly seasoned but i still prefer my lodge   after just a few weeks they are superbly seasoned   i ordered a    skillet just a few minute ago primarily for making gravies  i m writing this review because i just read some of the negative reviews and found some based on people not knowing how to cook with cast iron and others due to not understanding the nature of cast iron  as far as learning to cook with it goes  it just takes a bit of practice while paying attention to how things cook in cast iron   it is not rocket science so if you patiently stay with it  you will learn to love it   nothing cooks as well  heats as evenly or browns as well  as far as pots go  i prefer the enamel coated cast iron   a la la cruset   the chinese make these at a fraction of the cost and they are fine   the chinese haven t got the steel making thing down but their cast iron seems quite adequate   another complaint involves cracks and breakage   cast iron is a bit fragile compared to other metals so if you receive a cracked one  just replace it  it is just the nature of the beast   personally  i ve never had this problem   sticking   these are not non stick pans in the teflon sense but i find they stick less than other non non stick pans   sometimes  things are going to stick   when that happens  i just put a couple of inches of water in the pan and put it to boil for a few minutes and whatever is stuck releases making clean up a breeze   when i fry eggs  i use non stick spray  after the skillet is hot  and then add some butter before adding the eggs and they slide around just like they would on teflon my other cookware is all clad and though enormously more expensive  i still prefer the cast iron for frying   even though lodge says they are non stick right out of the box or nearly so  i find it improves with use   if you look at reviews of various brands and types of cookware on cooking related sites  you will find cast iron ranks at or very near the top   cast iron cookware gets passed down generations and i ve never heard of any other cookware rating that   except perhaps biscuit pans which somehow gain mystical reputations   cast iron does cook a good biscuit by the way i hope this helps with your decision   it is inexpensive so just give it a go   if you don t like it  you can always use it to hit people or hold a door open   it is a bit heavy      
70,5.0,                       i got this for my wife for christmas   it s really nice quality  we have   others that are nice but not great    love the size a the handle really works well   only minor recommendation is instructions  to seasoning it would be a nice add   but you can find it on google easy enough   it does need seasoning or the food will stick   great value           
71,5.0,                       there are different choices but lodge is the overall my top pick and worth the price  the pans are made in the usa so you know there isn t any filler toxic metals which you may find in other brands not made in the usa  plus this is a hefty pan  other cheaper brands tend to use less materials which do not hold heat as well  i use chain mail cast iron scrubber and do not use soap to ensure the seasoning doesn t get stripped  if i were to have any criticism  the       skillet is very heavy and your grandma may need assistance if she wanted to pick it up      
72,2.0,                       my mom had cast iron so i got this pan  cooking eggs is a joke  i t say s pre seasoned but the egg stuck bad so i washed and dried it then using an olive oil saturated paper towel  coat the entire interior surface liberally  preheat oven to     degrees f  bake the skillet  upside down on the upper rack for   hour and next morning tried again and food sticks to it this pan is no better than one from the    cent store      
73,5.0,                       looked through a ton of reviews regarding this pan and decided to bite  very glad i did   works better than expected   i used it with my webber go anywhere portable charcoal grill and it works like a charm   as you can see in the picture  i had no issues with sticking   the pan is already pre seasoned  but before using for the first time  i washed it with water  no soap   and oiled it with grapeseed oil and a paper towel   i let it sit for    minutes at     degrees in my oven   i took it camping this past week and had absolutely no issues with sticking with bacon  eggs  or bread  it s  pretty solid construction and i expect this pan will last a long time      
74,5.0,                       i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this cast iron frying pan for this price   i cleaned with cast iron cleaner and dried thoroughly   then i seasoned it three times  letting it cool down completely each time   the first cornbread i made slid right out beautifully  no problem  the pan already has a dark patina from the seasoning and that will continue to improve as time goes on   i bought this pan primarily for baking cornbread because you can t beat cast iron for that   lodge pans are high quality and they are known to outlast their owners and get passed down from generation to generation      
75,5.0,                       bought this as a test of cast iron pans  was really amazed at how hot this pan gets and how it retains the heat  brought this on my first camping trip and was perfect for over camp fire or on a propane stove  i love cooking bacon and steak on this pan compared to my other nonstick pans  when camping i used a crumbled up piece of aluminum foil to use to scrub this with salt  this pan is so hot that it just burns everything to crisp and then just scrubs off easily  what was annoying that i was not used to is the fact that i had to make sure to heat the pan after cleaning every time to make sure all the water evaporated to prevent from rusting  after doing this often  it s a good habit to clean the pan after cooking instead of letting it sit anyways  most times at home  i don t even rinse the pan  i just scrub the food scraps off and leave it to use the next day      
76,5.0,                       caught this on a sale nd bought it to replace an very old     that had years of crud stuck on the outside  for people who understand the properties of cast iron  this pan performs totally up to standards out performing it s lighter non stick brother  i love it  but my wife doesn t like the heft   it cooks perfect friend eggs with no sticking at all      
77,5.0,                       i never used a cast iron pan before but i had a couple of recipes i wanted to try that required one  taking the pan out of the box i wondered if i had made a mistake because it is so different from other types of pans i m used to  even though the pan is well seasoned at the factory i followed the directions for seasoning myself and then promptly used it  wow  it s great  i not only used it to make the baby dutch pancakes and cornbread i got it for but now i m using for many other things too  if you eat meat there is no better way to cook a steak than to sear it in this pan and finish the cooking in a preheated oven  cleaning it is easy as the seasoning really makes it a non stick pan  the handle actually works well with the pan even though it looks too short      
78,5.0,                       i already had a smaller lodge cast iron skillet that i ve been using for years and i love it  so i decided that it s time to replace a    inch regular pan that we had with a cast iron one but i also wanted to get one that s a little bigger  so i went with the       inch lodge skillet  i ve been using it for over a week now and i absolutely love it  we have a family of   and the size is perfect for us  i think that a    inch one would actually be a bit too big   and of course it s so easy to clean  just like the other skillet that i have  all it takes is to season it with a little oil after each use and it s good to go      
79,5.0,                       this is a great pan  i use it to cook rice and also pasta for spaghetti  i ve used it to cook almost anything and the best part is just let it sit in a little bit of water and after a few minutes you could scrub it out with no issues  don t worry about it rusting they don t rust just rinse and scrub in the rest is gone  after    years of trying to find quality non stick pans i realize cast iron is the way to cook anything and everything with ease and not worry about ingesting toxic chemicals      
80,5.0,                       lodge is the best at cast iron  hands down  if you ve used cast iron  you know all the advantages  if not  you ll be in for a treat if you follow the instructions  i have one cast iron pan that is probably around    years  best guess  love using it and plan to pass them one  this slightly smaller one will be put to a second use when camping  that way  we will always have at least one in the house for use      
81,5.0,                       pro  it is inexpensive and will last if you take care of it  great work horse of a skillet and will last you a lifetime like your grandparents marriage con  the first    times you use this you will need to give it tlc  if you are someone that wants things quick and fast  this is not it  go buy yourself a non stick skillet and call that a day  this is a full on commuter relationship  you ve been warned tips    just because it comes preseason doesn t make it non stick  you ll need to season it over and over  look up a youtube video and learn    never leave it sitting in water  that s how it rusts    don t use harsh chemicals or abrasives or scrubs  i wipe it down with a paper towel  remember you re trying to build the season not wash and scrub it away    again  it s a commitment  if you re gonna cry that it s not seasoned on the first go  return and buy a nonstick you lazy prick      
82,1.0,                       as the title states  this skillet began to rust before we even put it away in our cabinet  i have never used it  i washed it in hot water and dawn detergent and when it dried the rust was even worse  the description of the product included information that it was  pre seasoned   it looked ok when i removed it from the box it was shipped in  so i didn t keep the return info    days later  the rust began  i will never purchase anything from this company again      
83,1.0,                       i don t why so many people give five stars  but if i can give zero star i will   i buy it almost one month  every time is a bad experience  the pot handle is not insulated and it is very very heavy  it also very hand to clean  every time i cook  the food stick on the pan  the worst thing is it leaves a lot yellow stains if you forget to make it dry     
84,5.0,                       this is my first cast iron pan  i was always scared of using cast iron because i grew up on consumer grade pans with non stick coatings and lightweight metals  those lesser quality pans always seem to degrade quickly however  the non stick coating wears off  the pans buckle and warp  and i end up throwing them away and buying another  rinse and repeat ad nauseum the lodge pan is solid  and heavy  i did my due diligence and read up on how to use and care for a iron pan  and to be honest  it is no worse than taking care of any other pan  it cleans up super easily  and after a few uses  it has proven to be just about as non stick as any of my non stick pans  but cooks better  more evenly  browns nicely  and cleanup is a breeze  i clean it like any other pan  with some mild dish soap and a plastic scrub  dry it  then apply a very light coat of oil before storing it  that s it  no magic  it just works  and it is such a joy to cook on  if you ve been shying away from getting a good cast iron pan  i wholeheartedly recommend this one as a good starter  this will cover most of your daily cooking needs      
85,4.0,                       i ve ordered two of these     lodge cast iron skillets from amazon over the years   the first one i bought years ago for me to use and  more recently  another one for my son s first apartment after college for the price  i don t think you can beat cast iron skillets from lodge   if you google  best cast iron cookware   you ll generally find lodge listed at the top or at least as one of the favorites by different consumer research sites and publications such as cooks illustrated even when compared to cast iron at many times the price the only cast iron cookware that i find to be of better quality than these are those manufactured many decades earlier   i have a couple of smaller griswold cast iron skillets made around           and there s a definite difference   good quality vintage cast iron cookware is generally thinner walled and slightly lighter in weight   many of the older pieces also have a raised bottom ridge  or smoke ring   however  the biggest difference imo is the smooth  polished surface on the vintage pieces   modern day manufacturing of cast iron skillets  like these by lodge  tends to leave a slightly pebbled surface   unfortunately  it s getting harder and harder to find smooth finish vintage cast iron cookware that s in good condition   and  when you do  it s usually quite expensive an ultra hot cast iron skillet is my very favorite for searing thick tenderloin steaks and salmon   i put the skillet  minus silicone holder  into a      oven for about    minutes to heat it   then i apply a dry rub seasoning to both sides of room temp steak filets or to top side of salmon fillets   remove hot skillet from oven  extremely hot  so be careful   place on high flame or burner  and immediately place steaks or salmon onto skillet surface to sear to the degree of browning and crispness desired  usually just takes     minutes    flip to other side to sear and then place back into still hot oven to finish cooking   amount of time in oven will depend on thickness of steak and or fish and degree of  done ness    salmon and other meaty fish don t take long and  since we eat our steaks rare or med rare  it usually doesn t take more than several minutes in the hot oven to finish while the pre seasoning on these skillets  lodge uses soy based vegetable oil  is a nice way to start out without having to do that time consuming step before using  you ll find that the surface of your skillet just keeps getting better and better   for many things  i find them to be every bit as non stick as a teflon coating for cleaning  i use a scraper if i need to remove anything stuck on  but rarely does that happen   i never use detergent on mine   instead i use hot water and a scrubbie to clean   always be sure to thoroughly dry cast iron pieces so that no rust develops   and never ever put them in the dishwasher the silicone handle cover is a nice addition for use on top of the stove   while it can handle some oven temperatures  i remove it before placing in a      oven since that s higher than the recommended temp for the silicone      
86,5.0,                       first off  as far as the negative reviews due to the skillet rusting  you need to oil the pan  cast iron skillets need to be properly cared for  and when they are they will last you decades  don t let them sit in water  don t put them in the dishwasher  and make sure to properly season them after each use  google how to care for them if you need more information  it sounds like a fuss but i think they re easier to care for than my other pans now that i got that out of the way  i love this skillet  it s good quality and  if you know how to use a skillet  you can cook some amazing dishes with it      
87,5.0,                       i love this cast iron skillet  i have used it many times since buying  and it has been amazing and made such a difference in my cooking  i have recently started switching what kind of chicken i buy to be able to have it cooked with crispy skin in the skillet  note to self though  do not cook anything with honey or any sort of sugar in the skillet  as the first recipe i cooked in it i burned the crap out of the pan  and thanks to some careful doctoring by a friend s father  was able to fix it      
88,5.0,                       i ve had a few lodge cast iron items from dutch ovens to grill pans but for some reason i never had a good skillet  so i bought this one   a few days later i found the same one at home goods for   bucks less  argh  i had never bought a pre seasoned item before though  so i was pleasantly surprised that the factory seasoning was decent  it wasn t years of seasoning right out of the box but it got you started  i made some skillet potatoes in it the first weekend i had it  they did stick a bit more than i expected but not horrible  i made a few other dishes and then decided to season it myself to see if it made a huge difference  it did  i seasoned it as i usually do with my cast iron and this thing it s awesome  so all in all  you can use it out of the box but you ll be happier if you season it yourself      
89,5.0,                       i use it on a glass cooktop  i don t like glass cooktops and wondered if it would work  but it does  the pan is primed already but i primed it some more with oil in a warm oven  don t use soap or only a teeny amount of soap  it becomes more and more seasoned with use  it was so inexpensive  our burgers and steak come out with nice sear   recommend      
90,1.0,                       this product said that it s fully cast iron but it is not   i used it one time and the entire side of it split in half like it was made out of clay or something    not sure but if i could give it   stars i would   very disappointed      
91,1.0,                       i used this skillet the same day i received it and the meat i was cooking on it burned badly  the smoke filled the entire house and it was such weird smell that even my dogs went downstairs to hide  i put the skillet aside in my new sink so it can cool down and cleaned all the mess  after several hours i wanted to clean the skillet and when i lifted it  i noticed how badly the bottom of my sink was rusted  the skillet was rusted too  and so hard to clean  my sink even now is not perfectly clean again  even though i used a scrub  brushes  and different cleaning supplies to make it look all nice and shiny again  i threw away the skillet because it was all orange and the burnt food wouldn t come off anyway  i m really disappointed      
92,5.0,                       i was hesitant to buy a cast iron skillet as i have never owned one before  but after two nonstick skillets died back to back  i figured i would try something new  i am so ecstatic with this skillet that i m going to have to tell everyone that they should have one   seriously though  it sears a steak perfectly  we ve made delicious eggs both fried and scrambled  and it makes a beautiful  melty grilled cheese  i m so excited to try cooking different things with this because the flavor is so great and it heats so evenly  i was nervous about what clean up would entail but after doing some quick research its no big deal  very happy with this purchase  i look forward to cooking many different meals with this      
93,5.0,                       my wife originally bought a  value  cast iron pan  she season and seasoned it  after months of complaining  someone finally mentioned that chinese made cast iron pans are not of the the same quality as american made pans  we bought this pan and with one attempt at seasoning  she was able to cook eggs without them sticking to the pan  she was delighted  in the long run  it would have been less expensive to buy a quality american made product that works than to buy a  low cost  product that doesn t      
94,1.0,                       i was so excited to get this pan since my mother had cast iron pans for ages  they used to be my grandmother s and then my mother used them   that whole  cast iron pans last forever  story  i m one of   kids and we put our pans through a lot  mine cracked the  rd time i used it  i didn t think that was even a possibility  i contacted lodge through their website  but haven t heard back yet  which is disappointing  i still used it to cook corn tortillas the other day  since there was no liquid that would leak out  but i m sure the huge crack down the middle it impacting the heating  so   not a big fan of lodge at this point  but if their customer service pulls through  i ll give them another chance  otherwise  i ll order another brand to replace my pan      
95,5.0,                       i went years without buying a cast iron pan because i was scared they were too complicated and difficult to use and clean  i was so wrong  i don t cook very often  but when i do  i reach for this pan  this pan actually heats up properly and evenly and cooks my food super fast  i actually can t stand using cheaper pans from target now  i didn t season the pan when i received it so i feel like the first few times i used it  there was quite a bit of sticking and burning of food  however  after using it over a dozen times now  there is very little sticking  i think i finally built a natural seasoning cleaning this pan is also super easy  i bought a cast iron scrubber and only use that after i m done cooking  i wipe it down with a cloth  oil it with olive oil  and stick it back in the cabinet  looks beautiful and ready for use every single time i wish i would ve purchased one sooner      
96,4.0,                       i have a couple of the pre seasoned lodge pans  the pre seasoning really makes a difference  with a couple of years use i expect the pans surface to approach the smoothness of a decades old skillet of mine  from the decent level of smoothness after a few months use this particular skillet is heavy  almost more than what i can manage with one hand  which is why the  nd handle is there and   star is missing  my girlfriend finds it too heavy  but it s great for cooking up the mound of vegetables   onions  carrots  spinach  brussels sprouts  squash  etc  that i like to have with breakfast i ve gotten rid of almost all my non stick and aluminum pans because i m concerned about their long term health effects  but who can t use a little iron in their diet      
97,4.0,                       i have owned one of these pans for   years  it takes a little getting used to the differences in care between non stick and cast iron  in the end you will never need another pan  it requires extra heating cooling time  a little extra oil  a little extra elbow grease  and bigger muscles to move it around  it will last your entire life with a some extra care  but you never have to worry about the harmful chemical surface flecking off and leeching into your food  plus the more you use it the better it gets  you can t hurt it with a metal utensil  and the heat stays in it for searing and simmering i got my son the    pan a few years ago  and the only thing he does not like about it is the smaller size  so i got him the     skillet and he loves it  one of my friends saw and also bought one in a time when cheap  short lived non stick pans are plentiful  and high quality stainless steel requires a loan  lodge cast iron skillets are a great alternative  i trust them to be made from reliable iron  and they are only a few dollars more than imported versions that i feel may not have trustworthy materials   why do they all smell like diesel fuel       
98,1.0,                       it came in broken  the handle had clearly just snapped off  it only came with one brown piece of paper as protection so it s amazing only the handle broke  so  i went to exchange it and they were out of this size for the price i bought it  of course  so i used the customer service chat  obviously didn t work because there was no option for my situation  and then had the option to receive a call from an amazon rep so i selected that  i waited for over    minutes to only hear that their systems were down  and it wouldn t be possible to look into this  extremely unhelpful and unprofessional  how can you not just give me a clear answer of how this situation should be handled and what they re going to do about it      
99,5.0,                       i actually bought this as a protest after trying out a set of ceramic pans  i needed a    inch every day nonstick pan and was tired of teflon type pans  although it came seasoned already  i let it sit out and stuck it in my oven with oil a couple of times a day for several days  whenever i was loading or unloading the dishwasher or general cleaning  after all that seasoning along with using it for my go to pan  it now performs as well as any non stick pan i have owned  eggs slide right out as well as they do in my    inch calphalon and the size is better for me   only con is the weight and the need o dry on a burner and re oil after use  big plus is  it s a lodge  it will out live me      
100,5.0,                       cast is not maintenance free  you must clean and season cast  key word iron    rust    be advised  the handles do get hot  heat transfers on cast  oil the iron   and above all do not drop these anchors on the floor or your foot   they are kitchen tanks      
101,5.0,                       this is an amazing cast iron skillet for the price  especially due to it s size  thickness  and added features  drip pours and front handle  that it boasts   heats up quickly  i would ve gotten a top but for the price this was the best deal   just get a splatter screen if you plan to use a lot of olive oil etc that can be messy   i love the convenience of skillets   you can go stovetop to oven just like that   genious   i also love that everyones skillet has different flavors  as in since i never soap wash mine it has all of my recipe s flavors to help give what i m cooking a little personal kick      
102,4.0,                       good cheap cast iron pot for the house  i mainly use this to cook steaks  it cooks steaks way better than my nonstick pots  i like it how the meat get chrispy as it stick to the hot iron  the only thing i don t like is that it get rusty parts on the pot  they probably didn t preseason it well enough i will have to season it again to have enough oil deep inside so it won t get rusty  i don t clean acid foods or using soap to clean it just plain water and whip off with bounty  the handle get really hot every time so be careful not to burn yourself      
103,1.0,                       after going through tons of reviews  pictures  questions  etc  i finally decided to give this  and   other sizes a shot   this pan is not well seasoned at all  i guess that s what happens when for a cheap product  this is not my first cast iron pan  so i m quite familiar with how they work  upon first use of this specific one  all the food stuck to it  one of the others was also cracked when it arrived and the smell was terrible  save your money and invest in better pans  unless you like planting pan roulette      
104,5.0,                       i don t understand the  heat resistance  since this is a cast iron product and the heat is distributed all over the skillet  this is what makes is so great   evenly distributed heat   cooks like a champ  cleans up very well  just make sure that you keep it seasoned   this is the only part i do not like  but this is very minor compared to how it cooks  i will be purchasing the smaller one  too   i pray i have the same results      
105,5.0,                       i love this pan so much it s not even funny  since most of what i cook already is meat  it s already been given a lot of love mom and i cooked pork chops side by side   mine were cooked faster  didn t stick like hers did  and were browner  she also used cast iron  an old hand me down  but we haven t been loving it as much as we should  so i think this will encourage us to keep all the cast iron up to snuff      
106,2.0,                       rusted after  st use  didn t even heat it up  we used it for dry treats as a cute appetizer dish  wiped it clean with damp sponge  it was never submerged in water  and then patted dry with a paper towel  the next day there was rust marks all over it  as seen in the picture  not practical at all for use  would not recommend to buy  returned for refund      
107,5.0,                       i own a smaller cast iron skillet         and needed something bigger  the        skillet came today  not happy that an     lbs cast iron skillet was placed in a square box without packing materials to hold it in place somewhat anyway  you can see in one pic the handle broke open the box and was sticking out  it is a little scratched  but i think it will be fine  when i opened the box i was very surprised at how huge        is for a skillet   and to think i was looking at the     skillet to buy  thank you to the few reviewers that stated this is a big skillet and it really is bigger than you are thinking  i ve cooked in cast iron most if my life and i love the ease of clean up  being able to cook on the stove and move it to the oven but must of all  the even cooking it provides since cast iron heats so perfectly even  i will admit  it is heavy and as i get older  it is tougher for me to move carry with one hand  but i make sure i buy the products that have a helper handle and all is well  lodge products usually have the helper handle so i look for them first when i m in the market      
108,5.0,                       love it so far  first time owning and using a cast iron anything  i scrub it with a stainless steel scrubber  i don t submerge it and soak it in water like everything else  and then i add a little oil after drying it off with a towel and the stove top  easy to clean because i can scrub as hard as i want  but since i don t know how to maximize the flavor of a seasoned pan  since i scrub it after each cooking session  no flavor differences that i ve seen      
109,5.0,                       i really love this cast iron    inch skillet from lodge   i debated for a long time whether or not purchase one  for me  a purchase like this is about an investment  and i want my investment to last a long time   i also really like the fact that this is made in the usa   american made products are just not easy to find anymore   but really  the proof in the quality of this cast iron  was obvious when i made sweet potato corn bread and baked it in the oven in this skillet   it came out so nice and brown and moist   i m enclosing pictures  so you can see the nice way it cooked the corn bread on both the top and bottom of the bread   sorry  the pan in the first picture is a bit oily looking    i had cooked in the pan and then washed and oiled it   if you like this review  please click the helpful button under the review   it helps me to know if my reviews help people      
110,5.0,                       i love this item as i grew up with my mom using cast iron skillets   have always wanted one but were too expensive so when i saw it on sale on amazon i couldn t believe my eyes and it was made in america   so hard to find anything made in america so that made it doubly better for me to buy it      
111,3.0,                       product is good but it had lot of rust  heat doesn t get evenly distributed resulting in over heating of pan  handle gets too hard tried having lodge hand holder but it gets worn out way too quickly  this pan requires lot of maintenance otherwise it gets rusted very quickl  be careful on first use lot of black powder on the surface of pan  wash  dry  season couple of times before use     
112,2.0,                       check the bottom of the pan carefully  i ve returned two  both had bad pits caused during casting      
113,1.0,                       so i used this for a while and loved it  i cared for it according to the instructions and hoped to have it for years to come  as promised the other day i was using it on the stove  medium heat  and then transferred it to the oven        after about five minutes  i started smelling something weird and then saw some light smoke inside the oven  i figured it must be the skillet  so i removed it and sure enough   the bottom of the skillet was starting to melt on the rack inside my oven  i didn t even know that was possible  it dripped liquid cast iron onto the bottom floor of my oven  where it hardened  my oven now smells like chemicals every time i use it  so yeah  don t know if i just received a dud  or what  but it s too late for me to get a refund or replacement  so i guess i ll never know      
114,5.0,                       love my ironware  nothing better  once you get used to cooking and maintaining the seasoning  you will never want to use anything else  i have ironware that s over     yr old  that s all i use  from stove to oven to my bbq smoker   even my campfires  if you are new to using quality ironware  get on youtube and search for the videos lodge has and watch some of the users videos  it takes a lil knowledge and patience  never use degreaser based detergents or wash in dishwasher   this will remove all seasoning and cause corrosion rust   read the yellow care card that comes with every lodge piece  it has vital instructions on it  also  visit lodge s website for cooking videos   recipes      
115,5.0,                       i bought the       inch pan on           and it s       today  i ve never owned cast iron before  wasn t too sure it it was worth all the trouble people made it sound like  but i love very crispy breakfast potatoes  and i ve destroyed non stick and ceramic pans because of it  and everything just sticks to stainless steel horribly  so i tried this and i m glad i did  the best trick i can tell you is  start with low heat  and stay there  just accept it s going to take a while to cook  i have a gas stove and medium is too high to cook with this thing  food always gets burnt  but medium low is perfect  and don t wash it  i use it at least once a week and all i ever do is pour a little more oil in after the food is done  leave it over the hot burner  wipe out the oil and food bits into the trash when it s cool  wipe with more oil if there s still food bits left  and store it in the oven so it doesn t get dusty  that s it  it s been great  the only time i use water and soap on it is if it gets gross and sticky  you ll know when  and don t scrub it that much  make sure it s completely dry with paper towels  reheat it with oil  cool and wipe again with oil  and store it with more dry paper towels  oh and i bought a bunch of stuff with this that i thought i needed to take care of it  cast iron plastic scrappers  chain mail scrubber  silicone gloves  you don t need any of it  the chain mail was kind of cool but i ve used it maybe   times  and two regular cloth pot holders are enough to touch the handle      
116,5.0,                       my t fal was taking a turn for the worst and since i love my lodge cast iron grill pan  i decided to go cast iron for every day stuff  i am pretty convinced that other than stuff that requires boiling  i m replacing my chefmate and t fal with cast iron as those items are falling apart  i hate having to need a screwdriver with my cooking utensils to screw the handles tight  so far all lodge products i ve purchased have been great  i love the silicone handles for moving the pans around because they are heavy  but now that they are fully seasoned  they are awesome      
117,5.0,                       very impressed relived over the quality  especially because i purchased it used  the pan itself is of exactly the same build quality as the one seen in the pictures and all the other lodge cast irons vids pics posted on the internet now  i bought mine  used like new   and i ll be honest  part of me was worried  even though i know people go and buy or inherent used antique cast iron pans all the time  it s hard not to worry when you can t really see just how  used like new  the item your buying is  especially when it s an item that can easily rust if mistreated mishandled i m glad to share that my specific pan had little to no scratches and it seemed as though it hadn t been seasoned or cooked on by it s previous owner i m hoping this means it was returned because of the previous owner was either comparing different cast irons brands in person or because of some other misunderstanding when it came to pan size quantity material etc either way  so hype  and so very very pleased      
118,5.0,                       i m a    year foodie home chef who has just discovered cast iron and i m hooked   i know i know what took    years if you re a foodie   i honestly thought these were hundreds of dollars so i just stuck to my all clad stuff  i know all clad is expensive which is exactly why i didn t think i could afford both   the food tastes so much better and you know there aren t chemicals entering the food   i ve had some things stick even though i ve only hand washed in hot water   no soap and put a thin coat of oil on after   i m still in the learning stages though so i blame me and not the lodge   i liked this so much i bough the          i noticed a lot of recipes call for the smaller size pan   having both sizes is all you need in my opinion   now i cook    percent on these when it comes to sauteing or frying      
119,2.0,                       just sitting on our counter before ever having used it the bottom rusted and got all over the counter   there may have been a splash of water but this does not happen with our other cast iron pans   in a matter of a couple days the rust has spread across the entire bottom   the suggested solution is steel wool and cover in oil to create a protective barrier  but since this was  pre seasoned  this should not have happened at all      
120,5.0,                       this skillet is perfect  for so many types of cooking and baking  sorry i waited so long to get it  when i recently was gifted a nice cookbook for cast iron skillets  i pulled my old no name skillet out of the back corner of my cabinets  it worked ok  but heated very unevenly  i then noticed that it wobbled around on my stove  the bottom was not perfectly flat  this lodge skillet is perfectly flat on the bottom  heats evenly  and holds a lot of food  get a cast iron cookbook  start cooking your way through it  and you just might throw away your teflon coated non stick pans      
121,5.0,                       it s pre seasoned so it worked well right out of the box and has only gotten better over time  i use it mostly for frying things  eggs and small side dishes  i don t know how it performs if you try to use it in the oven to bake cornbread or whatever  but i m sure it s fine for that if its properly oiled  the   inch size is not very large  a bit wider than the burner on my stove  but it can fry     eggs at the same time comfortably  i had imagined it being slightly bigger  but that s my fault for not getting out the tape measure  due to the smaller size weight  ease of control   it would also make a great makeshift cudgel should i be attacked by intruders in my own kitchen      
122,5.0,                       learn to turn the heat down  it holds heat beautifully and cooks great  stove top to brown meat and finish it off in the oven  i own the lodge enamel grill  this size skillet and a larger one  once you get a good season on your pans and learn to cook at lower temperatures you can cook just about anything  the only thing i tend not to cook in these are things with high acid  like tomato based  lemon based foods  they are hard on your seasoning  fry fish  scramble eggs  you have to use butter  grease of some sort  meat  let it brown  also when frying potatoes  well on one side before turning  people move stuff around the pan too quick and things stick  also if you don t have a good seasoning  these can last     years if taken care of properly  once you learn all the things you can make with cast iron   check out this cook book    https   www amazon com southern cast iron cookbook comforting dp            ref sr     sspa keywords cast iron cook book qid            sr     spons psc    you will always want to have one      
123,5.0,                       tried to be fancy and spent money on so called teflon skillets  well  after few months of use the teflon slipped away along with my investment  so  back to basics  enter the lodge preseasoned skillet  its a pleasure to use  a little challenging to clean  rectified by purchasing a lodge scraper  and it likes to have a coat of oil after cleaning i don t think this will need to be replaced in my lifetime  i fry  sizzle  bake  all on the same pan superb workmanship and quality      
124,5.0,                       i was surprised at how heavy this was  i got the    skillet  think about how heavy you think an    iron skillet might be  now double that  however  i have no doubts whatsoever that this will last forever and take all sorts of beatings and metal scrapings no problem   could use it as a self defense weapon  if you really wanted to     since i go hardcore  i ll probably still take it with me in my bug out bag lol     is the perfect size for that  by the way       would be too small  could barely fit like an egg in that one  and     is like small stovetop size  the    will fit in most people s bags      
125,4.0,                       but it has proven quite challenging to clean  and the time it takes to build up a nice layer of seasoning which can make it non stick is taking months and months of consistent use and painstaking cleaning  this is standard for most skillets  but especially here because of the so so job lodge did at providing a pre season  i recommend skillet cooking to everyone  but keep in mind it takes a tremendous amount of effort to maintain  tremendous compared to other types of pans   cook trays  it makes superb steaks though  if you don t have an open flame grill  skillets are the way to go  meats  veggies  cakes  cookies  anything under the sun will taste exquisitely non metallic with a good  well seasoned skillet      
126,5.0,                       i like that the pan came seasoned  however  i did end up seasoning the pan in the oven to add a few more layers   it took me some time to figure out the correct temperature and preheating time for the pan when cooking different foods  the cooking surface gets better with more usage  i can now cook eggs and pancakes without them sticking to the pan  my favorite food to cook using this pan is steak  the steak develops a delicious crust while remaining tender and juicy on the inside  burgers and pizza also taste delicious when cooked in this pan  most of the time i only need to wipe out the pan with a paper towel in order to clean it  for times when that is not enough  i rub the inside of the pan with coarse salt to remove any food residue  on rare occasions  i will use a drop of mild dish soap with a soft sponge  i then rinse the pan with water and dry it with a dish cloth or paper towel  after that  i heat the pan on the stove for a couple of minutes and rub it with a very thin layer of oil  once the pan starts smoking  i turn off the heat and let it cool down  i have not had any issues with the pan rusting by following the aforementioned steps      
127,1.0,                       i was very excited to get my first cast iron skillet   i immediately made a egg frittata   the egg stuck to the entire surface   what have i done wrong   i had the impression the pre seasoned would equate to a non stick surface   do i still need to add some oil to the pan to prevent sticking   i cleaned it using a pan scraper   then i coated the pan with a fine covering of vegetable oil and let it burn off on the stove   what else should i be doing or not doing i rated the over all rating low cuz it forced me to in order to ask a question   i am not ready to rate the product until i am confident i know what i am doing      
128,5.0,                       i know there s a gazillion reviews already  but having used lodge cast iron cookware a gazillion times  i can t resist weighing in  if you re newly getting into cast iron  read a bunch of the negative reviews first     and discover people who are truly  often innocently  clueless about the preparation  care and usage of timeless cast iron cookware i have a bunch of lodge skillets  a griddle  two dutch ovens and a pot with a self basting lid which happens to also fit one of my skillets as well as my new chef s skillet  i really wanted a skillet with rounded sides  mostly for an egg and omelette pan  at      the lcs  is a steal  considering i can neither find nor afford vintage griswold like all lodge  it comes pre seasoned  which simply means it has a coating of oil that prevents oxidation  this seasoning is not what makes it non stick  how you cook with it does  out of the box  i enjoyed the cathartic ritual of baking four more coats of oil onto the seasoning which turned it a lovely  shiny black  then  i pressed it into service as a non stick wonder some people complain about the  pebbly  texture of the pan  some even testifying that this is the reason food sticks     wrong  proper temperature and proper amounts of fats are the keys to cooking non stick  the  pebbly  texture means nothing  besides  with continued use  the  pebbly  texture will turn into a smooth as silk surface  all my lodge has been used enough to reach this point  except  of course  this brand new piece  there are a lot of great videos on youtube that can teach you how to cook with and care for your cast iron  but i can sum it up in a jiffy  always preheat your cast iron over medium   low heat first  until it lightly smokes  lower the heat slightly  add butter  oil or other fats that are room temperature or cold  coat the bottom and sides  add your food and watch it slide around  when finished  rinse with hot water  if you have fond in the pan  scrape with a nylon scraper and rinse away  dry the cast iron on the stove top burner and then wipe down with a very light coating of oil  you re ready for the next use   this coating will lightly smoke when it reaches proper temperature  indicating when to add your cooking fats  other than the initial wash down out of the box  i personally do not use soap on my cast iron  some people do  avoid cooking with acidic foods and liquids like tomatoes or vinegars or you ll surely be re seasoning your pan before you know it  good luck  and good cooking  and remember the chef s maxim   hot pan  cold fat       
129,5.0,                       saw this type of skillet used in a cooking video   the  person used it to make small crepes to use in making manicotti instead of the purchased tubes that fall apart and are hard to stuff properly i like crepes and will be making dessert crepes  i tried crepes smeared with chocolate for a dessert at a restaurant and they are good  also you can put them in some sweetened orange juice with added orange liquer for a crepe suzette i am done with the non stick pots and pans  don t like them   cast iron is the original non stick  i don t like the larger skillets because they are too heavy  if you are thinking about getting rid of  your non sticks go with cast  iron or the new tri ply skillet  i bought a martha stewart and i love it   you can use a metal spatula and scrape the bottoms      
130,4.0,                       cast iron skillets are a joy  the price of this one was a pleasant surprise   better ones have a polished cooking surface but cost way more   excellent for occasional use  and more nonstick than t val  silverstone  teflon or supposedly ceramic coated skillets   like all cast iron skillets  it is much heavier than common ones and a bit unwieldy   the very young or very old may find it too weighty   not quite as good as my mothers inherited ones but better than ordinary skillets and less costly by far than moms   that brand is still made  more than a century later  but is not cheap      
131,5.0,                       i already love this skillet  only had it a week the pebbly finish isn t quite as nice as vintage pieces but it doesn t actually hurt anything  i was able to cook eggs and pan cakes no problem on this skillet  the pre seasoning from lodge worked really well for me i was initially concerned about getting a quick start and getting the skillet up to temperature and cooking quickly in the morning because it s so heavy  but this actually seems to get up to working temp faster than my aluminum pans  i also found that i needed to lower my normal cooking temperatures  this thing conducts heat really well i have averaged a skillet a year with teflon and ceramic coated aluminum and they just plain don t last even if i spend three times the amount i spent on this skillet no matter how careful i clean them  everyone says cast iron lasts darn near forever and i really look forward to not having to throw this one away this is heavy  heavy enough so that it s a little strain moving it around complicating the matter is the handle they provide in this combo isn t the right size for the skillet  it s quite a bit longer than the handle which results in a weird limp overhang  it works but it could be much better      
132,5.0,                       i love my new cast iron  i ve seasoned it   times prior to using it  i didn t want anything to stick in the bottom  after i seasoned it  works great  food tastes so so much better  more flavor  you don t have to season it as much as i did  i just wanted it to have several layers prior to using it  clean when cast iron when it s still warm with water or water and salt  then towel dry then heat on stove or in oven to finish drying it then add oil to skillet after each use  then you will have it for life just like in the old days  i m so glad i found this brand of cast iron      
133,5.0,                       love my new pan  i use it for making omelets and frying meat mostly  easy to use right out of the package  the factory seasoning was enough to cook an omelet with no sticking  i cook in butter and just wipe it out with a slightly moist sponge when done   ready for the next meal  the only complaint is the weight   these pans are heavy  and when you re done cooking and you have a super heavy hunk of burning iron to move to the sink clean  it s not fun  also  avoid buying the lodge silicon handle heat protector   it s too big and only protects you from the heat for a few seconds  enough to move it to another burner  but not enough to move it to the sink and clean it while still holding it       
134,5.0,                       i own a                     and a     lodge cast iron skillet  for years i ve used the        and then bought the    and      i love cooking in quantity for leftovers and for big parties  so i decided to pick up the      i love the size of the cooking area of the     but it is massive and takes forever to heat up  i tried numerous times to heat up slowly on low med low and then after a good amount of time i would turn up the heat and start cooking  i noticed that the center of the pan would be smoking hot while the edges would be significantly cooler and it would instead steam my food vs  searing it  my burner is not wide enough to cover the bottom of the pan and that resulted in me returning the pan  i think the best way to preheat the     is in the oven but there is no way i would do that every time i wanted to use this pan so i decided to return it  for the longest time i was deciding what to replace it with  either the     vs  the         i considered my burner size and i knew the     would work but i also wanted the biggest sized pan without the issues i was having with my      i think the        you gain an inch of cooking area and the sides are      higher when compared to the      so if these things are important to you than the        would be the one for you  the edges on the        still run slightly cooler than the center but it is not significant enough for it to affect how i cook  but overall  comparing price and the differences of the        over the      i would say the     would be the pan to get for most users  so would i return the        and trade for the      i would say no b c the little bit of extra cooking room and slightly higher sides are important to me  i hope this review helps those that are still deciding what size of pan they should get      
135,5.0,                       it s my first cast iron pan so i didn t know how to care for it fully  but i figured it out  it cannot be left to air dry or it will rust  it has to be dried of with towels  and i also spread a bit of olive oil on the surface of the pan after i dry it off to help prevent rusting  it s heavy and awkward but it cooks pretty well  especially meat  needs a bit of time to heat up completely  but i use it a lot to fry up chicken or turkey bacon  i wish i knew what i was getting into before i bought it  but now that i know how to take care of it  i m starting to appreciate it so much more than the non stick skillet i have      
136,1.0,                       some of the photos promoting the       inch mini cast iron skillet are very deceiving and do not reflect the size of this skillet  it is super tiny and not what i expected based on the photos   to give you a perspective  it only holds     cup of water and does not look like it would be large enough to even cook one egg      
137,5.0,                       i wanted a replacement for a    non stick pan that no longer non stick   i have several other pieces of lodge cast iron cookware so i decided that this would be a good replacement   the lodge skillet is pre seasoned and preforms well from the start   i cook    grams of egg whites in this pan every morning   when i first began using the cast iron pan the eggs would stick around the edge of the pan but after using for several weeks there is much less egg stuck in the pan when i cook my eggs i add vegetable oil and preheat the pan over medium heat   i then add the eggs and begin to stir the eggs the entire amount is cooked in less than    seconds and then remove from the pan what i do is after cooking the eggs allow the pan to cool and any stuck on egg will release from the pan   after the pan has cooled wash with water and use a plastic dish scrubber to clean the inside   dry the pan and lightly coat the inside with vegetable oil i have used this skillet daily for about   months and the seasoning has greatly improved      
138,5.0,                       i was unsure of the size i needed and after ordering the   inch i thought i should have ordered the        inch  nope  this one is perfect for me  it makes six large slices of cornbread two inches thick  i received the order quickly and today i had the opportunity to try out the pan  i made four different cornbread recipes  the pan s seasoning is perfect  all recipes released without any sticking  i just wiped the pan with a hot  wet paper towel between recipes  my favorite recipe so far is alton brown s creamed corn cornbread recipe       the sweet cornbread recipe found on hillbilly housewife is a great alternative to the  jiffy  mix  i like this pan   highly recommend it edit            here s a cheesy  jalapeno cornbread i just made up preheat pan with two tbsp vegetable oil to      in one bowl mix   eggs    tbsp veggie oil      cup h o    cup buttermilk or milk  in  nd bowl mix   cups white cornmeal    tsp baking powder    tsp salt    tbsp sugar  pour dry into wet and stir well  mince     jalapeno   toss into mix  shred   cup cheddar mild medium  or sharp   toss into batter  stir these in the mix  pour into hot pan   bake       minutes until top is golden brown      
139,5.0,                       this skillet is huge and awesome   i was concerned that it wouldn t work well on my electric stove top because the diameter is much larger than that of the largest elements  it actually worked pretty well although the heat was not evenly distributed across the surface  the meat browned much faster on the sides nearer the center of the skillet but that was expected and just meant turning the meat to get it browned evenly  not a big deal  i was happy to be able to fit all of the pieces in the skillet at the same time      
140,5.0,                       when i realized that i had purchased this   years ago  i figured it deserved a review  this skillet has been used almost daily in those   years  has weathered being moved between   states  and is still as good as the day i bought it some notes    do take the time to look into proper care for cast iron  mine is well seasoned at this point  so it really only requires minimal cleaning    don t soak things or leave it wet  it ll rust    if you have a stuck on mess  should happen less and less over the years   use a little soap  but make sure you take the time to re season it a bit afterward  i like to rub it down with a little oil and heat it up on my range    i ve put this through my oven s self cleaning cycle twice  followed up by a nice re seasoning   it literally returned the skillet to brand new this is a great skillet  and i now own it in a few sizes  take care of it  and you ll have it for years      
141,4.0,                       we are trying to get away from the teflon pans currently in use  this skillet is very well made  we use it on a flat top stove and it stays put   unlike teflon pans  it does take a bit longer to heat up  but when it is heated the heat is very evenly distributed  clean up is not as easy as a teflon pan  but so far it is easier than i anticipated  after cleaning the skillet we rub it down with some coconut oil of olive oil and store it covered with wax paper we like it enough to buy a smaller diameter skillet too  the only draw back is that this skillet is quite heavy to handle  a worthy trade off though      
142,5.0,                       i really needed this and the price was great  this pan is very well made and perfect for small stuff or camping as it s light and has quick heat distribution  seriously  who needs a massive pan for the small stuff a really cool thing is that it fits easily on any outdoor grill   cook your your eggs right alongside your breakfast meats if you want to for camping or just going out to the river for a quick fry this won t weigh you down      
143,4.0,                       as other reviewers have noted with lodge cast iron skillets this had a bit rougher texture than i might have liked out of the chute  that said i did a light cleaning and seasoning before use and found no real complaints aside from perhaps not cleaning up as well afterwards as i would have liked  but not enough to cause any real problems as a test i took the skillet out to the shed and did some work with a file for some high peaks  followed by course sanding and steel wool on half the bottom surface  i followed this with a seasoning on the stove top  while it is easy to see that the half i worked over is smoother to the touch  it is yet to be seen how much difference it will make in the long run  but at least i can make the comparison      
144,5.0,                       why did i abandon my old cast irons for stainless steel  and no stick pots and pans  this lodge cast iron skillet out preforms everything else i ve owned over the years  and they were high quality brands  expensive too   concerns for the no stick wearing off and contaminating our food motivated us to try the good old fashion cast iron  glad we did  better heat distribution  cooks foods evenly  a small amount of cooking oil keeps most things from sticking  the downside to cast iron cooking is having to season it with oil after washing  also  be sure to use a pot holder or heat gloves  the handle gets awfully hot the lodge brand seems to be better made than others we have looked at  finish is smoother  lodge manufacturing company is  the only major manufacturer of cast iron cookware in the united states  the other cookware suppliers use pots and pans made in asia or europe  they tend to be courser in finish      
145,5.0,                       very large  heavy  and well made skillet  i ve used this twice since i got it  once to make scrambled eggs and then i made a lasagne in it   it s fantastic  the lasagne was done fifteen minutes sooner than i expected  so if you re using this for baking  make sure you check your oven well before the timer goes off  it s a great skillet and i can t wait to make a deep dish pizza in it update  i made a deep dish pizza  it turned out great  i ve also made hamburgers and they were awesome with just a little salt and pepper for seasoning  this skilled releases very well  is easy to clean and never sticks      
146,4.0,                       this pan is incredibly well crafted   my jaw hit the floor to see cast iron so inexpensively made in america  however  when i got it       the first thing we noticed was a rougher than normal texture on the cooking surface  on the whole pan  actually  thankfully  we have a dremel and will get to work on smoothing it down  i have zero issue with this though because of how inexpensive it was and it s made in america  i ll sand it down  idc  but just so everyone is aware  you do not have to smooth it down  this is a personal preference  and if you do  make sure to season the whole deal all over again  which i planned on doing anyway the handle is so short  however  this is actually works to my advantage because i have smaller than normal hands  so it fits me like a glove but in reverse  plus it has the other handle on the opposite side that i just love the weight of it is heavier than normal  as far as i know  which  admittedly  isn t far at all  in fact  it s right around the corner there past  idk rd  and  sure thing boss blvd overall  i have to give this pan     stars  because of that finish  i must  personal preference or not  i shouldn t have to alter any product to make it desirable  should i  idk  maybe i m being too nitpicky about it  regardless  i m going to stick with   stars  if not for the finish  minus one for making me say nitpicky      
147,5.0,                       newbie to cast iron  take my review as such      i wanted a non stick pan that was not teflon  and not one i d have to replace every few months  the organic or greenie pans    i care about the chemicals in non stick  and am willing to not have perfect omelets or whatever to avoid them   in comes the great reviews on cast iron   for     it was worth a try   so far  i am loving this pan    i m on a low fat diet so i m not greasing it up as much as i could and even so  it is semi nonstick   i can make egg scrambles  cook chicken and veggies  everything  without worry of a hard caked on mess once i m done   clean up is also easy  an abrasive sponge right after cooking with water  dry  then add a spray of oil and leave it for next use   for the price this is well worth it  and i like that i won t have to throw it out like the  organic  non chemical pans i have previously been purchasing   good buy      
148,5.0,                       i use cast iron at work and finally got this one for home  i did my own additional seasoning in the oven prior to using it  it seems to be great quality and so far cooking nice and even as expected  good price for the quality  just remember  you have to know how to use one  you may have to learn as you go and after a little use you will be an expert  if your food doesn t turn out the way you desire the first few times  you likely just doing it wrong give it some time  do some reading  and learn  this is a great pan      
149,5.0,                       believe them when they say this is big   it is gigantic  i wanted a us made cast iron skillet to use in steak preparation that moved from the stove top searing to the final broiling and this one is excellent  it is very well made by lodge and will last forever  i wanted a big one to accommodate all the steaks at once and this certainly does  even with the second handle  this pan is a challenge to move around and you should be very careful if using it on a glass top stove   pick the pan up to move it   do not slide it   or you may damage your range  it is very heavy and i may have been just as happy with a smaller pan  but it is here now and i certainly won t be in need of buying another for many years to come      
150,2.0,                       although it claims to come pre seasoned  it s pretty clear that it isn t enough to keep your food from sticking horribly to the bottom of the pan  i followed a guide online about how to properly season a pan  and i haven t had any issues since  i recommend everyone do that prior to using it  it feels to be pretty standard cast iron  and hopefully lasts a long time  but i was very unimpressed with how rough it was and the lack of proper seasoning      
151,2.0,                       very rarely do i ever have to write a poor review  but unfortunately this is one  i made an enchilada skillet on the stove and then put into the oven  and now it s rusted and unable to be fully cleaned  i scrubbed and scrubbed multiple times  ran through the dishwasher  all the things    but it s just not clean and black anymore  i ll keep it for now because i don t use skillets often and it functionally did it s job  just kind of a mess looking now  not sure if i recommend    sorry      
152,5.0,                       i love this thing  i m a recent convert to cast iron cooking  as everyone said if you don t over clean it and just cook crap off it before you use it they work well and non stick  i m really impressed with how much better the food tastes  shocked really  all my cooking is now cast iron  somebody needs to make a cast iron foreman style grill  i ll buy that in a second anyway  weighs a ton like it should  cooks great  the rubber pad thing is helpful but collects grease inside so wash that out a lot  don t wash the pan a lot though  just heat and spatula scraping and it is more non stick than the non stick pans they sell      
153,3.0,                       kinda disappointed as when i got the skillet i was so happy to try it out  it cooks great and is well made  it has started to rust about a month ago               on the bottom and have had to re season twice since i got it in feb        i do not use water to wash it  i use kosher salt  i would love to buy the     skillet but it is   times as much  for    more  worried about it rusting also  my     needs to be seasoned again               i ve had cast iron skillets in the past and never had any rust  in fact i have one now that is over    years old and has never had rust on it  tried putting pictures up but don t know if they stayed  i can not recommend this product unless they can stop the rust      
154,5.0,                       this is my third lodge skillet  i typically use my    inch for everything  but i live alone  and this is perfect for eggs or grilled cheese  my biggest tip that i can give for lodge preseasoned cast iron    wash it  first  i don t use soap  but i use a stainless steel scrubber and hot water and thoroughly scrub the whole thing inside and out  i then dry it over medium heat on the stove  put a thin layer of oil all over the pan with a paper towel and then  bake  the cast iron in the oven at     degrees until it starts to smoke and stink  it kind of smells chemically  once i smell it  i turn the stove off  let the cast iron cool in the oven  take it out  and it s ready to use  it may take a couple times before it s perfectly nonstick  between each use i scrub it with the stainless steel scrubber and hot water and dry over medium heat on the stove  i rub more oil on it after drying about every   th time i use it  or when it looks dry  i have never had to rebake it  my twelve inch has been perfect for years and this one is well on its way  so low maintenance  great  heavy quality      
155,5.0,                       first of all  these cast iron pans are extremely versatile and durable for cooking   second of all  you don t have to worry about any pfoa or other types of coatings coming off in your food and you ingesting them in some way   third  cast iron cooks extremely evenly  and does an amazing job in browning all type of foods personally  i use it for cooking sliced fingerling potatoes in olive oil   the       size allows for more than enough potatoes  and doesn t require you to use a bunch of expensive olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan for frying   if you buy the pan  you ll have to try this    the potatoes are easy to make and absolutely delicious   also  for the issue of splatter   i ve found that my swiss diamond glass lid fits pretty good   not perfect  but since i already have it  and i don t need to store yet another lid  i highly recommend using another glass pan lid if you have one rather than having to buy a new one   i also purchased the lodge silicone handle  at only five bucks   it makes dealing with these hot handles much easier and at that price  i highly recommend it finally  you have to love that this is a       year old legendary american made and owned brand   the fact that you can buy this at the same price as some no name chinese pan is a huge bonus  and you really have no excuse not to buy the lodge enjoy      
156,5.0,                       what can i say but that it s perfect for what it is  cooks brilliantly  and just does an amazing job at heat distribution  pretty much none stick without all the chemicals you get with a cheap teflon skillet  the seasoning of the metal was expertly done and really the best i have personally owned  my parents still have family skillets from the dawn of the early   th century but for whatever reason i just never bought one  now that that i have this one i am kicking myself for not getting it earlier  it s really inexpensive too so don t waste your money trying to save    on the crappy chinese knock off junk  also be aware that once you wash it you ll want to rub it lightly with vegetable oil so that it doesn t get a little rusty      
157,5.0,                       i was always afraid of cooking with cast iron until i finally broke down and bought this pan   i use this for everything   if you take care of it and use it correctly nothing sticks   just wash with water and scrub brush after every use and apply thin layer of oil with a paper towel and it s ready for the next use      
158,5.0,                       this is my first cast iron skillet and i was worried about it rusting   but after some research online i m slowly getting a better understanding on how to use and care for this type of pan   when it first arrive  i lightly cleaned the pan to wash away any residue from shipping  the box was very beaten up when it arrived    the first thing i cooked was a fried egg and it did stick a little to the pan   the key is to wait until the pan is hot before adding the oil and then the egg   depending on your stove type you ll need to figure out the strength of your fire  if a gas stove  or the heat on an electric stove   the advice i found online said the skillet hasn t developed it s non stick surface yet   so i made a few more fried eggs later in the week and it started to improve   each time i used the pan  i cleaned it right away with hot water and very minimal dish soap   then i placed the pan on the stove to dry off   if the surface looked dull  i added a coating of oil   a week later i cooked some bacon and that helped season the pan a bit more   today i made some fried chicken and after cleaning the pan of excess oil  my skillet is looking to be taking on a good surface   it s not greasy or sticky   i know eventually i ll get to saut  some vegetables  pan fry tofu  or make a few pieces of french toast without them sticking to the bottom      
159,5.0,                       i received it quite prompt  to the other part of the globe   i was frightened by negative one star reviews  looked scrupulously caves  rust  rough surface  glue remains  but this cast iron  pan  skillet by lodge terminology  was just perfect  it seems lodge read reviews and improved their product  for example  there is no glue for advertisement  they put some plastic gel layer  that you can tear off easily     lodge weight is circa     kg      pounds  if you are teflon generation do not buy it  unless you read about cast iron cookware  how to treat it and why you need it  i bought it for a health reasons  but find it also enjoyable  so pity that amazon don t sell lodge s wooden plate suitable for this    skillet  i use to eat directly from the skillet  learned this  patent  in restaurants   so this cast iron skillet keeps my food warm for a long time now  i am eager to buy more cast iron cookware   it will be lodge via amazon      
160,5.0,                       this is my first piece of cast iron   it came packaged nicely when expected   although i haven t used it much i must say it is good quality   the very first time i used it i was frying chicken  our fire alarm went off  and we had to leave the building for about    minutes   i took the chicken out of the pan and turned the burner off   when i came back in i turned the burner on and continued to fry the chicken   best fried chicken in town   i m tempted to use my cast iron to fry chicken like this all the time   because i purchased the lodge scrub brush also  the clean up was not too difficult    after reading some other reviews from pro cast iron users  i will take their tips   overall  i enjoy my purchase of the cast iron skillet   i recommend it      
161,5.0,                       aside from two small      areas of finish  pictured  on the edge which i was unsure if just color difference or finish potential problem  these are great  those spots haven t caused any issues cast iron pans really are not for people who tend to set dirty pans in the sink over night full of water  don t do that then complain about the pan developing rust  they are iron   sit in water   eventually develop rust i don t use it for everything  though i could  because sometimes i prefer to set a dirty pan in the sink full of water overnight i use it mostly for searing  and for baking cornbread and getting that amazing crispiness on the bottom crust this pan has been easy and non stick having been pre seasoned  just wash and dry after using  add a quick and thin coat of vegetable oil  and it s ready to go for next time  i usually put on burner after towel drying to heat it just a moment  then add the oil to still warm pan  and spread with a bit of paper towel   that s how my mom used to do it  and it works great for me keeping the pans fresh  well dried  and non stick very happy with this pan  and the price was surprisingly good    cast iron pans will last a lifetime    or more      
162,5.0,                       crab meat is expensive and while crab cakes are not difficult to mix two things are critical  first  scoop     cup crab mix onto sheet and refrigerate at least two hours or longer  two  use a lodge cast iron pan to cook  the heat and heat retention of this lodge pan quickly seals and sears crab cakes      minutes on each side  keep warm in oven if doing more than the four that will fit in the pan  i do not believe you can get the high point of corn bread  a bottom and side crust and a good browned top other than in a pre heated lodge cast iron pan and into the oven  i am not much of a meat eater  i serve meat and as noted above crab cakes on special occasions  friends swear by the searing in a cast iron pan  the thickness  the ability to hold heat as food is added of the cast iron pan is tough to find in other pans  and the price is crazy good  follow lodge s directions on cleaning the pan  i store upside down between uses      
163,5.0,                       so this is my first ever cast iron pan   after years of having a ceramic stovetop i now have a gas one and lost my last excuse   i ve had the pan about a week now and love everything about it as a first time cast iron user i read a lot of the reviews here and seasoned it in the  cathartic  method  nice review bud     heated the pan  rubbed it down with oil and then let it preheat in the oven        left it for an hour after it preheated and then shut off the oven  left it in there until cool   did this three times over a couple days  got a lovely black sheen   i even  messed up  the first time  using too much oil and too little time   to help anyone else who makes the same mistake if you end up with a  tacky  pan  simply lightly oil it again and bake it off in the oven just as if you were seasoning   came out perfect as far as cooking goes   i ve had a blast using it   my first ever meal was steak and cheese   got that nice hard crispy brown  steak shop  crust on the shaved steak  delicious   next up was attempting a filet and ribeye   again awesome hard brown  not burned   sear on the exterior and perfect medium   midrare on both  filet went in first  ribeye shortly after    the last thing was an omelet   with all this  i ve heated up the pan on medium low  added in fat after smoking then added in whatever i was cooking    and it s come out perfectly   the omelet floated right up above the bacon fat and slid right out of the pan when done   awesome one thing i was worried about was cleaning   knowing i can t use soap and fearful there d be tons of grit on the bottom had me thinking post dinner cleanup would be a pain   but it s been so simple   there s very little stuck to the pan  even the omelet left only a small amount of egg  and the stainless steel  chainmail  scrubber i bought with the pan works wonders   it hasn t been a chore to clean at all  and it was something i was worried about  would the pan never hit the stove if it was a    minute process to clean after cooking  eating  dishes  etc     instead  it s almost fun to go through the ritual of scrub  dry  heat and oil  yes i heat the pan after cleaning then rub it down with a tiny bit of oil  so  overall this thing is a bit like a kitchen gremlin  what with all the initial rules and such    but the results are fantastic so far   it s a joy to cook with and i actually like the little niceties of caring for it   like any other tool  take care of it and it will take care of you      
164,5.0,                       this skillet is absolutely amazing  i cleaned it and seasoned it the first day it came  and it did not stick at all  after every use  i clean it with hot water  put it on the stove to heat dry  and then apply a very thin of vegetable oil  it only takes about   minutes to take care for it  but the result is wonderful for those who may want to know how to season the skillet the very first time  here are my steps    pour water in the skillet and put it on the stove until the water boiling for a few minutes     clean the inside   discard the water  then pour another cup of hot water with baking soda to clean it out     clean inside outside   put the skillet on the stove to heat dry and apply a thin layer of vegetable oil on both sides     season   put the skillet in the preheated    f oven for   hour      make the oil dissolve into the small pores on the skillet  which is critical to turn the skillet nonsticky      
165,4.0,                       pros  works great with a metal spatula  lots of room to fry dumplings cons  very heavy  takes a long time to heat up across the pan  outer edges do not cook well on a regular burner      
166,1.0,                       maybe we don t know how to use an iron skillet but everything stuck to it  hard to clean  started rusting  threw away  not worth the hassle      
167,4.0,                       i love my lodge pans  the only reason i hesitate to give them a   star rating s because of minor manufacturing impurities defects present in the pan that you don t find in more expensive brands  but for the price  lodge is the best price performance product that still exceeds minimum standards of excellence to be used in a master chef kitchen the       pan itself is about   pounds  if you are not used to sturdy cookware  this may seem heavy  but if you want the best  you may find this to be the optimal balance between sufficient cooking mass to retain and distribute heat  and being still light enough to hold in one hand  i also bought the     and    pans  the     is too big for my stove and way too heavy to hold in one hand  the    pan is light  but a little too small for many cooking jobs  if i had to do it over again  i would have bought the       before anything else  then eventually the    haven t had any issues with rusting  though i always wash  dry  and slightly reheat after each use  rub a little cooking oil on at the end of each use  too  the only time i wish i had a stainless steel pan is for frying eggs or fish  which are both very difficult to scrape of the pan  and don t need the heating properties of cast iron  anyway       
168,5.0,                       i purchased this pan nearly a year ago  and am now adding to my set  i actually grew up with cast iron frying pans  but it has taken me some time to get used to using them again  i highly recommend these to anyone concerned about the chemicals that leach into your food from non stick coating or traditionalists or even someone who wants to invest in a pan that will last you a lifetime and never need replacing  you can t break them  you can t ding them  and they won t warp  as long as you take care of them  they will not rust  and you probably get some minor iron intake from cooking in them regularly follow the manufacturers instructions about not using soap is the most important thing  use a stainless steel scouring pad or other scrubber  brush  chain mail  to remove food shortly after cooking  i find that if i leave them dirty on the stove for a day or two  the food debris sort of act as moisture on the pan and can create rust if you ever get a rust spot  scrub it immediately  dry the pan thoroughly  i like to put mine on the stove for   minutes on low to warm the pan and evaporate any moisture   and re oil it lightly with olive oil or coconut oil on a paper towel  this includes the bottom  which may not make sense to anyone who is grease fire fearful  but we are talking about a light coating to seal out moisture  the pan should look dark on the outside  not shiny or dripping my best suggestion is to fry bacon  yes  fry bacon in each pan when you first get it  although they are pre seasoned  it is a light seasoning that needs to be reinforced with something greasy several times before you start to develop a deeper seasoning  before this  you will find that foods will stick  aka  eggs  stick with the pans  and they will not stick to your food after some time   keep to oily foods like bacon  ground beef  or frying something in oil  etc  until you see them darken up a bit  or even follow the manufacturer s instructions on reseasoning  but do it a few times in a row it will probably take more than a year of regular use for these pans to develop that smooth bottom that you may remember your mama s pans had  but with proper care and oiling  they will be no stick within a few weeks or months  always use a bit of cooking oil or butter when you heat them up before adding food  unless it s bacon best of all  there is no need for plastic utensils to avoid scratching non stick coating  you can use stainless steel or wooden      
169,5.0,                       i m brand new to cast iron pans but always wanted to broil my steaks so i tried this  i was extremely skeptical because of the price tag  it seemed almost too good to be true but several google searches later and i was sold  couldnt be happier with the purchase  the pan is incredible  and countless uses later and it is still like brand new  i also purchased the lodge brand brush for cleaning and simply using that with hot water after using has been plenty to keep it looking new my only recommendation would be purchasing something for the handle  i did not and am currently using   oven gloves when i take it out       
170,5.0,                       i m happy so far   the pan is an ideal size and i m getting used to it  i do wash it out with a few drops of dish soap  without immersing  then i rinse it  dry the outside  and put it on the stove to dry the inside as i wipe the surface with vegetable oil  i have been cleaning it out as soon as it is cooled from cooking and have found that easy and quick to do  it is not   non stick  but i don t need it to be  i would just like to keep it nice for many years of use  and if it eventually becomes  non stick   i m fine with that too  the price was excellent  and the shipping was lightning   fast      
171,5.0,                       never used a cast iron pan   never realized i had a use for it     oh did i ever it s primary purpose was for caramelizing onions with the side burner of the grill  without damaging the pan     flawless there then i found these other recipes that called for using for baking   saute and caramelize strawberries in it  set aside to cool  and clean the pan   add pancake batter in the pan folding in the strawberries   then bake it in the cast iron skillet or baking cornbread in it  with bacon or sausage crumbles with cheese in it   god does it come out good and it s far less of a mess to clean up than a traditional pan now i own   of these things in varying sizes for various cooking tasks   love the old school over this new school crap      
172,5.0,                       didn t use our     cast iron skillet because it was too large for our standard gas range stove but it looked and felt high quality  i ve been cooking a lot recently and was told  to really up my cooking game i had to get a cast iron skillet  so finally getting around to it  exchanged the     for a       and it comes tomorrow  excited to throw some salmon and steaks on this thing      
173,5.0,                       only dislike i have is that lodge doesn t smooth down the cooking surface a little bit   it takes a lot  and i mean a lot  of seasoning before it s not pretty rough   there s a guy named cowboy kent rollins who has good youtube videos on cast iron cooking who uses and orbital sander with    grit pads to smooth the inside of the pan before re seasoning   i may try that sometime on the other hand    it s so inexpensive that it s practically free   i use mine on the stovetop  the oven  on the gas grill in the backyard  on the campfire grate  and directly on the campfire coals   it does great everywhere   from bacon and eggs to an awesome ny steak   if you know how to use cast iron  you can t go wrong with this skillet      
174,5.0,                       i have a much larger cast iron skillet i use for dinners and such  but i finally decided a small one would be nice when i need just one egg  or just a little something and don t want to dirty up the whole big pan in the process  this is the perfect size for single person small batches of food  love it   it comes pre seasoned  which is convenient  but the patina is not significant so i seasoned it again the old fashioned way  oiled and oven baked   it will take much more use to build up just the right surface  but even with the from the store level of finish  it is a mostly non stick surface   so yay for that too  very happy with this  and i wish i d bought one a long time ago      
175,5.0,                       just what you d expect from a lodge   this skillet is so large that i can put this across two burners on our stovetop   it s nice having the extra surface space to cook things like several eggs without having them all bunched up   or  i can cook pancakes and eggs on the same surface at the same time   only thing with this size is that it s very heavy   i expected that but some might not anticipate the weight if they haven t used cast iron before  these skillets last forever as long as you don t completely abuse it so i expect to use it for the rest of my life      
176,1.0,                       this is just the cutest little skillet but    way too tiny to be of any use at all in preparing food  i wanted to make little individual pies  but it would not hold more than two tablespoons of filling  disappointed and should have paid to other reviews  they make nice coasters in the camper however so maybe not all is lost  have to make sure they don t get wet and rust though      
177,5.0,                       as soon as i got this pan i gave it a quick rinse  wiped it down with oil and seasoned it in the oven for several hours   the first time i used it  i made pan seared ribeyes and they turned out so good   the thick cast iron holds in heat better than my previous thin stainless pan and it reduced the cook time of my steaks by a couple minutes   i ve only used it to cook steaks and burgers  but cleanup has been super simple and the results of the food cooked in it have been really good       for a pan that will outlast you is a pretty fair deal      
178,5.0,                       adore that lodge still makes their skillets in the usa   the design  rosie riveter  is the perfect birthday gift for my coworker  my assistant  sister and nieces  yes  i bought seven of these   i also purchased the atk cast iron cookbook and silicone handle cover love my lodge skillet and am hoping to inspire those near and dear to a love of cooking with cast iron      
179,2.0,                       this pan had a very rough surface which made me wonder how foods would move around on it not well is the answer i treated it with oil in the oven for seasoning but seasoning is not the problem the rough surface is not like my other cast iron pan i bought    years ago  still going strong  and the victoria pan i just bought on amazon i gave the lodge pan away today      
180,5.0,                       no problems  people who said there was immediate rust may not have dried it as well as they thought they had  i also seasoned it beyond how it came pre seasoned  and its very non stick now  the only problem i foresee is going to be all my fault when i crack our glass top burners placing this down too heavily   how i longgggg for gas burners          
181,5.0,                       i purchased this skillet a long time ago and finally go around to season it properly and start using it  i have been using a similar but ribbed skillet for years to cook chicken on a gas stove  i like the strips that a ribbed skillet provides  but i also like how much easier it is to clean this flat surface skillet compared to a ribbed one  it s holding up well so far to my weekly meal prep that involves       lbs of chicken breast that goes through it  if you have never cooked in an iron skillet  try it  you re likely to never go back to other pans  the only hassle is the additional effort in scrubbing and cleaning  but that s a small price to pay for great tasting food time after time after time      
182,5.0,                       i was concerned about food sticking to the pan  even though it says the pan is  pre seasoned   i still felt the need to season the pan a little bit i heated half of an inch of oil on medium medium high for several minutes until it just started to smoke  then i turned it down low and let the hot oil  simmer  uncovered for a half hour or so  i also rubbed the frying surface a little bit with the tip of a wooden spatula while the hot oil bubbled around it  then i poured out the excess oil  and i put the pan into the hot oven after some baking was done  and i let the pan cool as the oven cooled the next morning i put the pan on a medium low burner  allowed it to heat up  splashed a small amount of oil into it  and fried an egg   the egg did not stick  not even a little bit  then i wiped the pan with a paper towel  and it was clean perfect  i feel this pan is ready for decades of service  as long as it is treated properly      
183,1.0,                       bought this to use at our campground because i was tired of cleaning the char off other pans  it comes already  cured  yea i don t know about that  its the hardest thing in the world to keep clean  i used it for one meal and have sat it on the side and probably will throw away  its just way too difficult  cast iron shouldn t be difficult in fact they should be rather easy to work with  but this was not  perhaps i should have cured it before using but the directions with this one say not to  that was a mistake  if it wasn t then this simply isn t a good brand      
184,5.0,                       since learning to cook on cast iron a couple years ago  lodge has been a mainstay in my kitchen  i was wary of the silicon grip at first  wondering how effective it would be  but it has proved very effective in eliminating the need for a mitt when handling the handle of the pan  like all lodge products  it comes pre seasoned  so it is ready to use out of the box  though i chose to put it through the oven with oil a couple times  personal preference   it s the perfect size for cooking individual meals or even cooking for a few folks  though some folks might find it a little heavy   it s cast iron  after all   i used it the other weekend to cook a potato dish that fed    people  and i use it a couple mornings a week for omelets  if you re looking to start cooking on cast iron  i firmly believe you can t go wrong with lodge      
185,4.0,                       i ve gone through several cast iron pans  this one is by far the best one  i bought this late      and still use it at least     times a week  it really brings out the flavor of every dish  i even made deep dish pizza with it  every kitchen needs to have this pan  make sure you season it after every wash  if yours comes with a silicon holder  don t use it  it s too dangerous to use  it doesn t fit well and the handle gets very hot  the only other complaint i have is that i wish the handle is a bit longer and wider      
186,4.0,                       love the durability and heat retention  although described as  pre seasoned   it isn t  the first time i cooked hamburger meat  i couldn t get the stuck on pieces off the surface  even with aggressive use of a stiff scrubber and soap   i ll be treating it myself going forward  and suggest this for others as well  other than this  i like the size and performance  if you re cooking anything larger than a couple of eggs  e g  saut ing veggies or cooking hamburger meat  you ll want at least this size                
187,5.0,                       non stick cookware is a dangerous game to play with the petrochemical industry  read this book for free at b ok cc for free to learn more  stain resistant  nonstick  waterproof  and lethal  the hidden dangers of c   cast iron   ceramic   stainless steel are the only real safe options  this cast iron pan is a part of what it means to be healthy  stay woke my friends     
188,5.0,                       i only expected a cast iron pan nothing special  but once i picked this thing up and saw the way it was constructed  the way it felt to hold  very heavy  by the way   but that s a good thing     i followed the instructions  oiled it up  put it in the oven  turned off the oven    and the next day i had a beautiful work of culinary art  i love the way this pan feels and the way it cooks  evenly   it gets hot quickly and i have since put away my favorite non stick pan   as this will now be my everyday cooking pan      
189,5.0,                       this is my favorite cast iron skillet   i also have the     lodge signature series skillet with riveted stainless steel handles       lodge signature    inch seasoned cast iron skillet with stainless steel primary and assist handles                         but this         skillet is  much  easier to handle  perhaps because the handle is shorter and you are gripping closer to the heavier mass another advantage is that a lid is readily available for this item   both an iron lid       lodge logic        inch cast iron lid                          and a glass lid       lodge       inch tempered glass lid                         the disadvantage is that the handle on this all iron skillet gets very hot   some sort of holder is required so far  a glass lid is not available for the     signature series skillet  link inserted above    and the iron lid that  is  available for the     signature series skillet  link inserted above  was priced at     directly from lodge   add shipping costs to that also this         skillet with the         glass lid on it is lighter to use in combined weight than the     signature series skillet with stainless steel handles alone  even before a lid see also my review on the lodge     signature series skillet with stainless steel handles  link inserted above       
190,5.0,                       i tried cooking eggs in it right away and it didn t go well  i couldn t get all of the egg off the pan so i sanded down the inside which of course took off the seasoning  so i had to redo it  i used sunflower oil and baked it in the oven at     for an hour  i repeated this   times  now its perfect  i ve cooked eggs and pancakes with no issues  i m so happy i took a chance on a pan i assumed would be a pain in the ass      
191,4.0,                       this seems like a really great pan  although i feel like i ruined it after the second use  maybe it s because these are  high maintenance  but i tried to cook a steak on this by pan searing it and pretending it was a grill    one of my friends told me you can do this by putting it in the oven at     degrees  and i did that  but it didn t stay hot for long enough to continue cooking it  so the next time i put it at a high temp on the stove top and slammed down those steaks  and not long after that the fire alarm was going off and we had to air out the house  i do know how to cook in general  but maybe not with a cast iron skillet  my boyfriend cleaned it without soap  but i noticed it looked weird  and possibly hadn t gotten cleaned completely  it seemed like there was still burnt crust on it still  so i took a brillo pad and very gently rubbed it around on it  blackness ensued  then i took oil and rubbed it around with paper towels  and it came off black  the blackness wouldn t stop  i finally used coarse salt to scrub at it  but it was still black  so i feel like i ve already ruined it by taking off it s top layer  i m now afraid to use it again      
192,4.0,                       i recommend the     cast iron skillet  it has a       cooking surface and you can cook two burgers side by side in this pan  canola oil works well with this pan  vegetable oil might fill your kitchen with smoke   to cook burgers  season the burger patty with salt  pepper  and garlic powder  heat the pan up on    medium high  until you see the first sign of smoke coming off of the pan  turn it down to    medium heat  and add the burger  flip the burger after     minutes  flip again after     minutes  and then flip it every minute until they re done  you can cook a burger as thick as you want by adding a few minutes on medium heat  i ve cooked up to      lb burger patties   i seasoned the pan   times with flaxseed oil before using it for the first time and it helped smooth the surface slightly  however  any modern cast iron pan really needs to be sanded smooth to be considered a non stick pan      
193,5.0,                       i have used the product over the stove and in the oven up to     f without any problems  surface is nice  it does not stick when you put enough oil and preheat the skillet  heat distribution and retention is really good  i noticed it cooks much faster than regular pans   i am always hand washing it and it is easy to clean with regular dish detergent  after each wash i quickly dry it with towel and rub regular cooking oil to coat all surfaces  including he bottom and the handle and remove the excess oil with paper towel  and it works fine for me  i dont think you absolutely need an expensive special oil to rub      
194,5.0,                       i haven t used non enameled cast iron since my later childhood years   i always had some good memories with lodge   grandma s pancakes  a hearty stew cooking in a ben franklin wood burning stove and so on     i love my le creuset  the only enameled cast iron i ll buy   but i have been wanting to bring back some old family recipes  prepared in their traditional way   with lodge   still made in the usa   i had to get some pieces i ve always hated nonstick  teflon coated and the like cookware   i even tried enamel over metal pans   they work ok  but i like cooking with fats and oils   and that tends to make the enameled layer not so nonstick and the flavors just aren t right   so  back to lodge   i almost forgot how inexpensive and easy these are to care for   i  started with this        skillet   it was easy to clean with mild soap before use   i did a quick seasoning  although it is pre seasoned well  with an organic cast iron oil   super easy my first  dish  made in this was a custardy french toast for my daughter and i   the heat was easy to attain  and our french toast cooked evenly and to perfection     absolutely no sticking   i seriously wasn t expecting nonstick effect upon first use     the butter and coconut oil i used melted beautifully   no scorching and the oils were evenly distributed in the dish  while cooking   i was also able to use stainless steel utensils without fear   i ve always made a good french toast  but this batch was my best yet   the egg mixture that overflowed and surrounded the toast was delicate and fluffy  as it should be    not the hardened crispy fried egg effect  gross  the most beautiful part of our experience with this lodge fry pan    clean up   everything wiped out with just a simple paper towel  mild soap and water wash  then quick seasoning on the stove  wipe out excess  put away   this seriously is the best no frills  no stress   no need to sacrifice or skimp on flavor  and  healthy for you  nonstick cookware   and it s just about as inexpensive as the throw away  unhealthy nonstick cookware at your local discount store what i love about lodge cast iron   it can be put on a campfire  grill  wood burning stove or firepit and still keep it s appearance with simple care  no worries over pretty enamel getting ugly or metals losing it s shine or luster  and still be able to use it on the stove or in the oven   no warping   it s an inexpensive investment that i ll be able to pass down  along with my more expensive investments like le creuset  all clad and mauviel   i also love that lodge cast iron is made in tennessee  usa     their enameled items are made in china   it s not  beautiful   but i love incorporating it s rawness with the beautiful   nice balance in a functional kitchen i also purchased the  qt lodge dutch oven      lodge l do  cast iron dutch oven  pre seasoned    quart                            the lid fits my        fry pan perfectly  and i don t need to spend      for a special fitting lid   cast iron may not be expensive  but i still enjoy saving money and having less clutter  of unnecessary pieces       
195,5.0,                       some people will tell you that it is laborious to have a cast iron skillet   not so with the lodge   i watched a lot of videos on the youtube about cleaning and care and people were all over the board about removing the factory seasoning and starting over   no way   i washed the pan after i received it and the first several times i cooked with it i used some vegetable oil and butter to make sure nothing stuck   the directions say you can even use soap and water to clean it  so i do   then i put it back on the burner for a few minutes to dry as i do the rest of my dishes and then i rub some vegetable crisco all over it and then wipe it down real good and put it away for the day   so maybe   extra step in the cleanup process   i have cooked eggs and meats and so far i have had nothing stick      
196,2.0,                       first  i though this was a much bigger pan  very small  first thing i did was to cook some eggs  however it was difficult to clean had to end up using a brillo pad to get everything  for the price i was hoping for bigger since i hate replacing pan with teflon after a couple years  will have to try the larger size also buy the silicon handle  the handle is impossible to hold without one  too hot   unless you use a rag or something      
197,2.0,                       i thought these things were supposed to last forever  we had them when i was a kid and my sister still has them  this pan is supposedly pre seasoned  i didn t believe it so i seasoned it my self  a month after that i seasoned it again  now it s starting to peel  this pan lasted less than five months and now i m afraid i have swallowed some cast iron and i m hoping i m not going to get sick      
198,2.0,                       not pre seasoned at all  i ve had to season this again and again  i follow instructions accordingly  and food still sticks  ended up tossing      
199,1.0,                       my first lodge purchase was a cast iron pot that i loved  it came pre seasoned and has never given me any issues in the two or three years i ve had it  this supposedly came pre seasoned too  and since getting it a little over a month ago  i ve seasoned it myself several times  i don t know why food sticks to it so badly  my pot has never had the issues my skillets have  i have lost so much food to this skillet from it sticking or burning and spent hours scrubbing and re seasoning  it s infuriating  apparently quality control has tanked since buying my pot a couple of years ago  i ll be looking into other companies to buy my cast iron from and would recommend future buyers do as well      
200,3.0,                       i love cast iron  i have two pans from great gatherings  big lots store brand   one is a large and deep welled        inch pan and one is a smaller    inch pan  i now wanted an even smaller pan to round out my collection  but great gatherings doesn t make a smaller size  so i decided to go with the   inch lodge pan  lodge is a name that many people associate with cast iron  and it is an extremely popular  and costly  brand  so i expected a top quality pan for my money when i opened the box and felt the heft of the   inch pan i was surprised  it was heavier than expected  not a bad thing for me  and it was much thicker than expected as well  again  not a bad thing  in fact  it was slightly thicker than my two other pans  which is why it had more heft than i expected i ordered two pans  one for myself and one for my daughter  so i compared the finish and quality of both   that is where i was disappointed  although i expected the pans to be rough  all cast iron brands are rough these days   except for one or two brands that are extremely expensive   these were even rougher than i expected  but even that i could live with because with proper seasoning  and continuous use  the pans will smooth out and be slick  yet  i was surprised they were much rougher  out of the box  than the inexpensive big lots brand i already owned most cast iron come from the factory pre seasoned  but anyone who owns cast iron cookware knows  you still need to season your pan before use  usually the pans arrive lightly  yet evenly pre seasoned  but both of my lodge pans arrived with uneven seasoning and with heavy doses of oil on parts of the pan  that was sticky  that should not be  so before i began to season my pans i had heat them to soften the seasoning and smooth them out with a metal scrubbing pad  it took a while to do  but i got the job done  then i took to giving the pans two rounds of seasoning to get them cook worthy i used one this morning and it was fine  i made fried eggs in it  yes  you can make eggs in today s rough cast iron pans  and sticking was minimal as expected  one reason my eggs stuck was i cracked them into the pan before the pan was fully heated  and second  i used a plastic spatula to release them from the pan instead of a metal spatula  the trick to cooking on cast iron is knowing when the pan is hot enough to add your food  and using the right utensils  also  it is important to know when to gently shift your food in the pan   example  if you are frying up some chicken wait until it has cooked a while before you nudge pieces to shift them in the pan   nudge them too soon  and they may resist and stick slightly  but get out your metal spatula and shovel it under after the chicken has cooked a while and it will slide without sticking in conclusion  i expected more from lodge  i expected the pans to be rough  but not so rough  and that they would be better  and more evenly seasoned  but in the end  if they last a lifetime  as they should  i won t remember the misgivings in years from now      
201,1.0,                       i ve had it less than   month and only   uses after using i clean it and wipe off all water moisture so i don t understand why this thing has rusted so badly when i first received it in the mail it came with a chip on the lip edge but i ignored it as no big deal to complain over  i guess this was a sign of things to come      
202,5.0,                       i bought the        skillet to complement the     lodge griddle we ve had  and loved  for over a decade  as expected  the skillet is solid  heavy  and big  carefully measure your cooking space  stove burners  outdoor grill  etc     before purchasing this skillet to ensure it s a good fit  additionally  make sure the skillet can fit in your sink to be washed  it may seem silly to stress this point but i forgot to measure my sink and lucked out in that the skillet fits  but with only an inch to spare  so far i love this versatile skillet and reach for it at every opportunity  it is roomy enough to put a great sear on a large roast  the sides are tall enough to deep fry chicken  you can make gravy  beautifully caramelize onions  whip up a party sized batch of cornbread  and the list goes on  i ve had absolutely no problem cleaning the skillet  let it cool completely so that it s safe to handle  pour any remaining oil into an appropriate container  and use a pan scraper to remove as much residue as possible  to avoid damaging your sink  especially if it s enamel  line it with kitchen towels and then transfer the skillet to it  fill the skillet with very hot water and let rest for a few minutes to soften stuck on food before using a scraper or non abrasive scrub brush  pour out the water and repeat the process as necessary  give a final rinse and  thoroughly dry with a lint free cloth  moisten a paper towel with some cooking oil and apply a light coating to the skillet before storing it in a dry location  i can  t say enough good things about this skillet and the many tasty meals it s produced      
203,5.0,                       been wanting another cast iron pan   i first bought the    inch   almost immediately i regretted not getting a bigger one   i still use the    inch but you definitely need a bigger pan if you cook for others and not just yourself   i needed to brown   large pork chops last night and they fit beautifully in this new pan   the pan could have held a  th but would have been a tight fit   i frequently make rack of lamb as costco sells a great australian brand that is very affordable   searing it in the    inch was kind of a pain   now that i have the       inch pan i like it much better   no matter what you are going to get splatter on your stove top  but the larger pan helps keep more in the pan and not on the stove   the only thing i don t care for is the weight of the pan   even the    inch is heavy   i just have to work out more i guess and build up my biceps   i have to use both hands to lift the       inch one   that to me is not a deal breaker but  dang  they are heavy   it was also important to me that this product is american made   big selling point for me every time   if you have a glass stove top  as we do  you must be careful not to drag or shake the pans on your stove top as the cast iron will scratch the glass   care is easy as well   you can give it a quick scrub using cold water and then just wipe it out with a cloth or paper towel   never use soap on it   sometimes i ll put a tablespoon of kosher salt in the pan as a scrubbing agent   make sure to re season it with oil  i use olive or avocado oil  before putting it away   it will last you generations      
204,5.0,                       this pan is amazing  if you have never tried cast iron  you should  i have used  far far more expensive   swiss diamond  nonstick pans in the past  and while that doesn t scratch as easily as other nonstick pans  it still wears out  even with a lifetime warranty  you still pay shipping when the screws wear out  this pan  on the other hand  is indestructible  i have left the heat on and forgotten about it  no problem  i can use a sharp metal spatula without worrying  the iron even seems to add a bit of flavor to the food  as for non stickiness  the other day i cooked an egg in it with just a tiny bit of sausage grease  the egg didn t even try to stick  for cleaning  it is a breeze as you just run some water over it and brush off any gunk  if you find out a way to get something to stick to it  you can just put it in the oven to burn it off  and reseason  try that with a nonstick pan last but not least  this is the new weapon of choice if a burglar comes      
205,5.0,                       love this  cast iron is life changing when it comes to cooking  my husband and i love it  we did the full seasoning process when we got it  look up the process on youtube   even though the manual said it came pre seasoned  but since then  haven t had to redo the the process  and almost no washing required as it is so non stick  just wipe it out with a paper towel once it cools and occasionally rub a little olive oil in it  as long you let it heat for a few minutes on med low before putting the food in  it s      non stick and cooks perfectly  we highly recommend it      
206,5.0,                       do not buy before knowing how to use a cast iron pan  requires maintainence else it will rust  it is not non stick  though it can be made non stick   it is quite heavy my first cast iron pan  used it to make stir fry a few times  can t say i had any issues cleaning it and maintaining it can be a pain though  know what you re getting into before buying it      
207,5.0,                       if you haven t seared steaks on a cast iron pan with butter  then baked them in an oven  ruth s chris style   then you really haven t had steak  buy yourself this pan and stop reading reviews on amazon they re affordable pans that are super versatile and will last you a lifetime or two      
208,5.0,                       this little babies have been on sale and ii got     one for each childin the last week the kids made their own corn bread  dutch babies  bacon etc in these pans and they are handling them great not as heavy as my big pans that means not i do not have to worry about my stoveif you know how to handle cast iron   go and get themthe only regret  i should have got more     
209,5.0,                       i had my first lodge for     years and still going strong and very well seasoned with age  just could not pass up this newer version with a convenient little handle across from from the main handle which makes it easier to drain grease  it comes pre seasoned and i tested it out on my expensive filet mignon   the steak was perfect and the heat was evenly distributed it was so easy to clean and and just  added a touch of cooking oil the next time  i originally receivedmy first years ago as a bride years ago   and am ordering as christmas gifts for my grown  kids       
210,5.0,                       i ll start by saying i absolutely hate the pre seasoning lodge uses on all their stuff  it sticks and is generally just not great  however the iron is great quality it just takes a little tlc to get it to the point that it s truly non stick  what i did for starters is i used yellow cap easy off oven cleaner with lye and coated the skillet thoroughly and sealed it in a trash bag  then after about two days pull it out and wash all that seasoning off down to the bare iron may take two passes to get it all off  then i took my sanding mouse and smoothed out the iron inside the skillet  once it was nice and smooth to the touch i gave it a nice wash with soap and a sponge  and after all that i began the seasoning process  i use flax seed oil for the initial seasoning then grape seed oil for maintaining it  i seasoned it three times and after that the beast was non stick and i could slide an egg around in it  i have to give credit to the idea of sanding it to kent rollins on youtube  i suggest any beginner to go check him out he has some great videos about cast iron  anyways all in all i m really pleased with this skillet and would definitely recommend it      
211,4.0,                       it just doesn t compare to a vintage cast iron skillet when it comes to making eggs   the lack of a polished bottom really tells   it takes quite a bit of butter to avoid sticking i like loge as a company  it s good heavy solid cast iron that heats well  and it ll last a lifetime   i m very happy with my loge dutch oven the bottom is too rough after a good seasoning   i bought this to supplement my big    inch griswold when i just want to make some eggs and don t need the huge pan the difference is massive   nothing sticks to the     y o griswold   everything sticks to the loge i ve used cast iron for nearly    years   i know how to season a pan   that s not the issue loge really ought to offer a line of polished skillets   fair enough if they have to charge a bit more for the polishing  make it a premium line  whatever      
212,1.0,                       this is for the      lodge cast iron fry pan  the description says good for  frying an egg   that might be true for a hummingbird egg  but definitely way to small for a chicken egg  even if you cooked a minuscule egg  the pan would only work over a match or lighter flame  anything much bigger would also burn the tiny handle  which you can only grasp with one finger and thumb   i keep this fry pan on the    ledge behind my stove to remind me to not take description claims as fact   this might be good for a toddler s toy stove to play make believe      
213,5.0,                       my second     cast iron  ordered in the morning and got it before noon  thanks to amazon prime   my first lodge lasted me over    years and i enjoyed cooking with it a lot  it s so heavy duty that amazon shipped my second lodge in a white plastic bag without any stuffing protection  and it arrived with no problem with cast iron  seasoning is the key and you are good to cook  looking forward to another     years with my new lodge cast iron      
214,1.0,                       things for lodge have somehow gone even further downhill  i know this isn t the lodge of even the post war era  but that is is even worse than that of the early     s is surprising  with a parrot in the house  we needed to replace our non stick cookware  with years of experience in using cast iron  these moderately priced lodge pans seemed a good option    until they arrived the cooking surface is so rough that it is unusable  even with proper seasoning  read up on it  you can t smooth it out as apparently it won t take seasoning if you do any more that remove the sharp points of the rough surface soy oil is used for seasoning  which for those with allergies or sensitivities is beyond problematic  the seasoning can t be removed with any reasonable cleaning approach used for cast iron there s a reason lodge acquired finex this year  apparently they either or both can t manufacture a quality product  or their brand s value has plummeted so far as to be unrecoverable do yourself a favor  buy a https   www amazon com gp product b     qwta ref ppx yo dt b asin title o   s   ie utf  psc   or similar if you re looking for an inexpensive   seasonable  pan  if you want cast iron  go for a field or one of its competitors      
215,5.0,                       just as good as anything twice as expensive  and perhaps even better  i ve always had a good experience with lodge products  and this skillet is no exception  the       version is a perfect size for most uses i think  unless you re planning to cook a lot of food at once or something  first time cast iron skillet owners should be aware that they need proper care and any issues arising from putting it in the dishwasher  or other bad ideas  isn t the skillet s fault      
216,5.0,                       my first iron cast skillet  i love it  i watched several tutorials on how to properly season  clean and maintain an iron cast pan  i thought this would be harder  but it isn t  after you get the hang of it  it s pretty much automatic  after you cook with it  just wipe and clean it  and that s it  great quality  heavy  and cooks great  making pizza on this iron skillet became my favorite thing      
217,5.0,                       at first i thought it might be too big and heavy  but once i got it seasoned with a couple of bacon cooking episodes   it s my go to pan for steaks and fish  i don t mind the size and weight because it s so versatile  i can cook three large steaks at once or two steaks plus veggies  easily to clean  just keep it seasoned and dried during storage and it ll last forever  this is my forever pan      
218,5.0,                       wow  love this skillet   pre seasoned and performed as well as my old faithful on the first go round   some people recommend seasoning again even though it s pre seasoned but i did not find that necessary   it is lodge  after all  so quality is what i expected   i browned a whole chicken on the stove then finished in a     degree oven   delish  and cooked perfectly   it was easy to clean as well  a little soap and water and it was done   the silicone handle is a nice addition  it fits a little loose but that s necessary to get it off and on while hot  for example going from stove top to oven  don t put the silicone handle in the oven    i use it on my ceramic cooktop with no reservations  the finish on the bottom is smooth and left no scratches   you will not be disappointed   i wasn t      
219,5.0,                       this is so adorable cast iron just like the bigger one i got smudging my home i got the idea from patty from the g team paranormal they re a little charcoal coals you could put in the pan light them they stay hot and you can put your sage on top and let it burn you can walk around the house by the hand the handle does get a little warm so you need to wrap something around it     
220,5.0,                       i love cast iron pans for steaks  chops  hamburgers and eggs   i haven t had a cast iron pan for    years and i missed them i especially love this pan which is made in the usa and comes pre  seasoned     how cool is that   cast iron is versatile   i can brown on the stove and finish in the oven   cast iron even works well on camping trips the pan is everything i wanted and more the only negitive about cast iron is the weight  but that s what makes it a great pan i use non scratching pads to clean my pan and i heat it up a bit on the stove to make sure it s dry before oiling the pan for storage      
221,3.0,                       i looked up many videos on how to take care of your cast iron pan and its a great experience  cooking with it made me love cooking even more  however  beware of the red silicone  hot handle holder   this thing is practically useless  while cooking  i still recommend you wear an oven mitt if you plan to reposition the pan or lift it up during the cooking process  the hot handle holder is made of silicone which i believe is not heat resistant at all  in fact  i believe it will melt during the cooking process  great skillet  horrible handle      
222,5.0,                       i love cast iron  got this pan cleaned it with hot water and corse salt  then heated it till all the water was gone  and then applied a tsp of crisco today i used it to do a small batch of scrambled eggs work just fine  if you treat cast iron right it will last three or four life times follow these rules and you will be happy for years to come lodge cast iron cleaningi needed a new skillet and decided to go with another iron skillet and purchase this one from amazon  it arrived in a couple of days and in perfect condition  as with all my cast iron i treated it the same way out of the box  i scrubbed it with hot water and coarse kosher salt  rinsed  then set on a burner and turned the burner on low  then gradually increased the heat until fully dry  while the pan is hot  i take a little bit of crisco shortening  about a tablespoon  and drop it in the pan  using a pasty brush i spread the melted shortening over the full interior surface  then i take a paper towel and wipe out any excess  but not too dry you want it to have a slight sheen to it   then i rub the outside of the pan  including the handle  sides and bottom   note  do this every time you ve used your cast iron cookware  and you will never be disappointed in its performance      
223,5.0,                       i m adding a photo in case anybody else was struggling to figure out what size to get  this is the     inch  it s the basically size of a regular napkin  i also put a large egg and a stick of butter in to show a comparison  i got it to make pizzookies in   pizza cookies    and i ordered too small at first  this size is perfect for me   lots of people are complaining about the food sticking   i ve used my skillets for cookies and eggs  mountain man breakfast   and it hasn t caused me any issues   in fact  my eggs didn t stick at all   i did use butter in the pan  but i assume that s normal   overall  great   i think i ll order   more to use with friends over      
224,4.0,                       i was initially skeptical about cast iron  after using it for a few months  i appreciate the consistent temperature it can maintain  it holds a lot of heat  so varying the burner temperature does not immediately affect it  and it can heat more substance without quickly losing temperature it is slow to heat up  as well as slow to cool   but it s very consistent  so harder to burn things on   cleaning so far has been simple  with nothing really sticking  and don t be afraid to use dish soap  the seasoning is a bit bumpy  but i don t really see a problem with that   some people re sand and re season  but i have no idea why that would make a difference  especially if you re used to steel   teflon  pans      
225,5.0,                       i have read a couple of reviews complaining about the lodge pan s rough surface   a few people referred to other pans that are way more expensive   with a little effort  it s easy to smooth and re season a lodge pan for next to nothing   a common drill with some inexpensive sanding pads  start at    grit  end at     grit  and in less than an hour you have a super smooth pan   after sanding  clean in hot water and dry   put a light coat of flaxseed oil on the pan  dripping is too much  then bake up side down at     degrees for    minutes   allow to cool in oven and you have a better pan than the super expensive guys    photos attached of the process       
226,5.0,                       exactly what i wanted  no issues with any of it  just as expected  and an ideal size for me to cook for one person  although i have a bigger pan that i use when making a whole meal in it    heat up things  melt butter  cook an egg  etc      
227,5.0,                       i already love cooking in cast iron  but this is better than i expected  i had read on various forums that the current lodge cast iron cookware is rough and not as smooth as vintage cast iron because the insides are not machined  and that s true  even so  i finally purchased this because i needed a large skillet for cooking for larger numbers of people  i discovered that the slightly rougher cook service cooked just as well as the smooth vintage cast iron i had previously used  at least for the sorts of foods i was making  mostly meats and saags so far   the skillet i received came pre seasoned and made in usa as advertised  i m only about a month into cooking with it  but so far  the seasoning is holding up nicely also  as far as i can tell  this is the largest size cast iron skillet that lodge makes a matching cast iron lid for      
228,5.0,                       my first new cast iron pan and after some consideration and a deal push in this direction i am not sorry for taking the plunge   this pan came preseasoned which was awesome   care is easy and is virtually nonstick from the start this pan will get very hot   if you re not use to cooking on cast iron  you re in for a shock if you don t have proper hand protection even when you think it s cooled enough to handle  follow all instructions for use to the letter and you re going to have a pan for life   and it s true    it gets better each and every time you use it enjoy great food and a one vessel option for your best cooking ahead      
229,5.0,                       there are plenty of people online that will tell you that you need a smooth surface on cast iron like the old griswold and wagner skillets in order to get a nonstick pan  the truth is  as long as you baby the seasoning for the first few weeks  it ll fill in just fine  mine is a beautiful shiny black after just   months of use  and as long as you know how to cook on cast iron  preheat the pan  don t use high heat  etc    then you shouldn t have an issue with sticking  i just use a knapp chainmail scrubber after cooking and it cleans up just fine  can t recommend this pan enough  the perfect size for     people  and the most versatile tool i have in the kitchen      
230,5.0,                       i bought the extra large        inch skillet because i wanted to the ability to do large stir fries with leftovers  the best part is the flavor  once you start cooking with this  you won t go back  the pan provides a noticeable taste different in food  it also an absolutely swiss army knife in the kitchen  stove top  over  grill  you name it  holds heat and wont let you down  if you plan on cooking a good steak with out a grill this is the best pan to do it   sear it for a few minutes on a stove top and just transfer the whole skillet into the oven to finish tip s      it says it comes preseasoned  but i would recommend also preseasoning before you use it  if you google it  there are a million ways opinions on how to do it if you are unsure    get a grease splatter guard  keeps your stove top clean and minimizes clean up      
231,5.0,                       i love this little thing   made in the usa   support american business   i make one or two eggs in this or heat up   little sausages in it  great for making breakfast for one or two people quickly  small and light  also makes a good meat tenderizer  also good for self defense  the uses are limitless  always buy american made cast iron pans      
232,5.0,                       i ve been married for almost six years now and have been doing the majority of cooking for about four years  i ve owned a few cheap non stick pans when we were super poor  bought some decent non stick pans when times were looking up  some stainless pans that were hand me downs  and i ve replaced them all with a couple lodge cast iron pans  i managed to destroy a couple non stick pans by overheating them or scratching them or looking at them funny  i had never used a cast iron pan but after a little research i realized how nice they can be for not much money  seriously  this pan cost half the price of some of the  better  pans i had bought it comes pre seasoned but i realize that it will take some work and time to get it really well seasoned and truly non stick  the fist couple uses i did nothing but cook bacon  caramelize onions or crisp up tortillas  nothing too fancy just to get used to it and help break it in  bacon wanted to stick initially but moving the strips around as i set in helped lubricate it and once the fat started to render out there as no problem with sticking whatsoever  after about    or so uses it s much more non stick than it was and i m sure it will just get better what i wasn t prepared for though was how much heat retention this pan has  once it gets hot it stays hot and for a long time  food cooks faster because of that  i m used to putting food in a hot pan and immediately losing a bunch of heat  this thing stays hot and cooks food fast  i ve had to adjust my cooking temperatures and times a little bit to re adjust  overall though  with a little bit of re learning i wouldn t think about cooking with anything else now  i ll probably pick up a second one because it s so cheap and indestructible      
233,5.0,                       after using it for a week i have to say this is one of my best purchases to date  i see a lot of people complaining about it  sticking  and i would have to say that is user error  i put some olive oil in it and essentially cooked the oil then wiped it clean before the first use and it cooked my chicken wonderfully   if needed you could always put some water in it bring it to a boil and wipe it clean when it cools down  just make sure to add a little bit of your choice of cooking oil after you clean it  i find it especially wonderful for making pizza  turns out perfect every time      
234,5.0,                       can see why this skillet could be passed down for generations  it is heavy cast iron that is vey versatile as it can be used in ovens  stove tops  outdoors  grills  or just open campfire   and high heat temps  this one came w  neat silicone removable handle that comes in handy when handling while hot  with proper care this is one of rare items that gets better after each use  recommended for sure      
235,5.0,                       love it  this is my first cast iron skillet  prior to this i had been using non stick and stainless steel  have to admit  i was always intimidated by cast iron because of the care it requires  realized how wrong i was after cooking with it  i wanted to start making dishes that required stove top to oven cooking and had read that cast iron was perfect for just that  after doing some research  i decided on this one for the quality and affordability  first dish i made  i seared some meat and finished cooking it in the oven  sidenote  i love how this process only uses one pan    less to clean  i was initially worried that the meat was going to get stuck to the pan    but it didn t  produced the perfect sear that my previous skillets cannot even compete with and the meat turned out delicious  next  i was concerned that it would be difficult to clean  since there was some bits burned and stuck on the bottom  when this happens in my stainless steel pan i d have to soak and scrub and scrub   i was amazed when i only had to use a bit of water and some light scrubbing and rinsing to get it up  no soap needed  took about a minute and the skillet looks just as good as brand new  can t even tell i used it  and it is still well seasoned  which is another thing i d like to remark on    lodge did a phenomenal job preseasoning  i can t wait to put this to regular use in my kitchen  also  i used silicone oven mitts when cooking with this and it made it so much easier to transfer the pan  with the grip and the heat resistance  definitely plan on purchasing more cast iron from this brand      
236,1.0,                       the small    cast iron pan from lodge was a disappointment  the interior of the pan looked like a matte finish of a newly rough tarred road  we own an older and larger pan from lodge and it came with a smooth interior and once seasoned  works beautifully  what has happened  is the company sending out unfinished pans in order to save a manufacturing step and money  too darn bad      
237,1.0,                       quality is fine  this will still be a useful addition and we will use it but   it s nowhere close to the size that is quoted in the product description  the product dimensions are listed as   x  x   actual dimensions are   x  x      that s right       in instead of  in  so  i went out to the lodge website to look at their product specs  lodge does not even list a skillet deep skillet that is  in deep  the deepest they list is      in  most of the skillets at the lodge website are between  in and     in this specific skillet sold at amazon as a deep skillet  is in fact the normal lodge   in skillet which has a cost of        at the lodge website  so  basically you get a typical lodge   in skillet plus the silicone hot handle for the same price as the skillet at the lodge website  e g  no savings  i just feel that amazon lodge should just be upfront about what is really being sold  it s not a ripoff  but it s also not as advertised      
238,1.0,                       this pan is supposed to be preseasoned  i followed the instructions and cooked eggs  and they stuck on like superglue  had to use steel wool to get them off  then reseasoned it as per instructions  and the same thing happened again  tossed the pan  not worth the pain      
239,5.0,                       there is nothing i dislike about this skillet  it s everything good i ve read about and expected from a cast iron skillet  i ve cooked breakfast  lunch and dinners in it  never disappointed  i bought a magazine titled cook it in cast iron by america s test kitchen and have cooked a number of the recipes in it  try it and you ll like it  as far as i m concerned  this lodge cast iron skillet is the only skillet i need      
240,3.0,                       this is the perfect size for a couple eggs or small items  i have experienced great results from my larger ci pan  so i was excited to try this  same company  excellent quality  but  the very center has a residue remnant that i cannot remove  it s where the packing was  forget about  pre seasoned  because after scrubbing and scrubbing  it s gone  i cannot get it clear      
241,5.0,                       i bought a few cast iron pans on amazon recently and some of them didn t work out well at all  however  this one out performed and out lived all of its peers  while other pans rusted and had food stick to them  this pan maintained its condition meal after meal      
242,5.0,                       this is certainly one of the simplest items to review on amazon   it seems to be well cast  as this pan has gone straight from the stove top to the oven to the cold sink  not a good idea  and has not cracked or warped at all   the handle is fairly easy to grip with an oven mitt or dish towel   i ve used this pan for everything from morning eggs to deep dish pizza  and it has performed admirably   the factory seasoning is superb and easy to clean   i live with   other college students who don t know how to properly take care of cast iron  yet it has survived all the abuse it s been subjected to   i ve had to re season it a number of times  but that is to be expected with any cast iron cookware in this setting   this is probably the best new cast iron on the market      
243,5.0,                       this heavy duty  cast iron pan will be around longer than we will  this one is small enough not to weigh a ton  perfect for one or two people  and seasoned right out of the box  also  healthier than other metal or   non stick coated  cookware  i don t mean to sound like an advertisement  but cast iron is good  a few simple rules make it easy to cook with and clean up  lodge is the only company still making cast iron pans in america  american since the      s  what s not to love      
244,5.0,                       when you need a big cast iron pan  this is it  this falls in the be careful what you wish for category  like     chef knives  it s heavy  and big  so washing it by hand in the sink you need to take care not to dent the steel or chip the countertop  it s not going to play nice in a jumble of other pots and pans in that hard to reach occasional use cabinet  but it does what only a cast iron pan can do  also makes a passable cat bed      
245,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          lmfao ok  so i thought i could use this for desserts  but this skillet is only appropriate for american dolls  there is literally nothing that can be made here  maybe a single fried egg and even that is questionable  i can t even safely place this on my gas stove because it will fall through  all this skillet did was make me sad  it s purely decorative now      
246,5.0,                       definitely a one person serving pan  as the   inches is just barely enough to cook two medium sized chicken breasts  but as one person who uses this pan  this is the best pan for cooking meat   hands down  i take good care of it  every once in a while i clean and season the pan  and after every use i scrub without soap just elbow grease and a brush  if there s stuck food on the pan just pour a little water in it  leave the water simmering on the stove while ya eat  and scrub it off again i wouldn t call this a non stick pan but i use a pastry brush to brush a little oil on every time i use it and that does the trick to keep most food from sticking  a little food might still stick though  get over it      
247,2.0,                       for one of the leaders in the cast iron pots industry  i was surprised with what i got  there is a crack in the pan that appears to have been welded over  i could see bumping this against something some day and the piece fall off  second  there s an instructional cardboard flyer that they glued to the pan  yes  glued  this rubbery glue was difficult to take off and some residue remained  so i had to scrub it off  which removed some of the seasoning  why lodge thought they had to do this  which is also not so environmentally sensitive  is beyond me  i m returning it      
248,5.0,                       got this for roasting chicken and baking pot pie but it s great for stove top cooking  too  comes pre seasoned but i season it after each use and it s virtually nonstick  i have the cast iron cookbook as well that has care and cooking tips that are helpful  there are some good recipes online  too  the silicone cover for the small handle is a good investment as the pans have some heft to them      
249,3.0,                       even though it claims to be  pre seasoned   this is not so  you will have to go through the same long process as normal to season this pan  also the hand holder it comes with is not a good fit  and is able to spin and come loose when lifting this pan because it s so heavy   the holder is also not very good for the high heat that this pan can generate  i don t even use the holder   i use a oven mitt instead  the   stars i gave it have everything to do with durability   this thing seems to weigh like   pounds  and should last a few years if taken care of i still am trying to season it correctly so that i am able to actually good with it without getting food stuck on it every single time   despite the fact that i use cooking oil with it      
250,3.0,                         after pretreating with flax oil  eggs  that was a mistake  i later read that eggs are chemically  sulfur iron  a mistake in iron and hard to cook well besides the eggs stuck and in using a spatula to remove them  a nickel sized hunk of the baked on many layered coating came off  i was not able to even the surface  i d have had to remove all baked on  and factory treated   layers of the skillet customer service kindly offered  after i asked for suggestions several times  to replace the skillet  the agent did not feel the skillet was defective      
251,5.0,                       cast iron skillets are great tools and a great value  i already had a     lodge cast iron skillet  but wanted the     to make dutch baby pancakes and other things  it worked perfectly  right out of the box  i think cast iron is a healthier alternative to teflon coated cookware  cast iron lasts forever and you can take it from stove to oven without worrying about damaging it from high heat  the fact that lodge makes these in the usa is a real bonus      
252,1.0,                       i love lodge products  i really do  they heat well  great for everything from eggs to pizza and more one flaw about lodge specifically  pre seasoned items suck  take the time to reseason them yourself  maintain proper cleaning techniques  you ll have a glorious pan for eternity the reason for   star is how amazon ships it  and possibly stores it  look at reviews and you ll see many instances of pans having minor damage to pans that are literally broken into pieces my   inch skillet appeared with two chips  one that existed for so long it began to rust buy a lodge pan in a physical store  so you can thoroughly examine it  never on amazon      
253,5.0,                       i can t believe i just found this gem  i have been using nonstick pans for years and decided to try something with less chemical on it  this lodge cast iron skillet looks like it will last for centuries  it can easily go from stove to oven  even to my outdoor grill  the seasoning part seemed daunting at first  but once a nice protective layer is built up  cleaning just means an easy rinse with water and drying with heat      
254,5.0,                       this pan is great  i think its a nice size and you can cook a lot of things with it  its really good for induction tops  but if you got a glass top i recommend parchment paper to go underneath it to prevent scratching  great for searing meats and things i think many of the reviews that involve rusting and what not are because people did not take care of their cast iron properly rule of thumb  you shouldn t wash your cast iron with soap and water  just give it a nice rinse and scrub it with a hard side of a sponge  immediately dry it  and slather some oil around it to preserve the seasoning  if you just take care of your cast iron  it will do you a great benefit cast iron is really good for you in general  as you can cook using high heat and it won t release chemical fumes unlike using a teflon coated pan  you can also use metal utensils on cast iron when cooking  i would limit the use  but again no teflon chemical poisoning  it also cooks very evenly and distributes heat nicely  while aluminum pans may also do this  there is a lot going around about aluminum leaching into food while cooking  you should stick to anodize aluminum instead just do your research before you buy the cast iron  it s wonderful  and even better if you use induction cooktops      
255,5.0,                       i am using this cast iron for the last   year and its a perfect one  i am glad that i chose this product i seasoned it by myself  before using it this one is perfect for grilling veggies  fish and meat easy to use and clean temperature is evenly distributedheavyvery good package and deliveryoverall  i am very much satisfied by this producthighly recommended      
256,5.0,                       this skillet was everything i expected   note  you need to care for it   the first thing i did was put a light coat of olive oil all around the skillet  i put it in the oven on     for   hours or so   when i i m done using it i scrub it  i don t use soap  after i put it on a burner on my stove to let it dry  once it is dry  i put a light coat of olive oil in and around it   if you put too much oil in it  it will burn in the oven   i then put it in the oven at     for an hour or two   it requires care  but is well worth it      
257,4.0,                       we ve gone through a few grills in anodize aluminum  they get really stick prone after a few years  stainless steel is just awful for frying and incredibly hard to clean  teflon wears out  cast iron is where it s at  i mean for stock pots and sauce pans stainless is probably better  but for frying and grilling  cast iron  after using it for a few weeks the seasoning on this is pretty good  i have read that super smooth cast iron is better  and we have a really old smooth     wagner classic iron frypan up at our shared mountain cabin   the really sought after kind   i think the wagner is about perfect  but this new lodge pan is actually pretty darn good  i have recently come to appreciate cast iron  what i really notice is that you can truly brown meat and even veggies really quickly  whereas stainless and aluminum it take far longer and just doesn t get as brown and crispy  also fried hash browns are actually very crispy in a cast iron pan  whereas is stainless or aluminum they just aren t  we ve done eggs and fritatas and dutch babies in the pan and they don t stick much at all   at the price this is just a steal  i would say everyone needs one of these pans  they are just awesome  and will last a number of lifetimes      
258,5.0,                       perfect for egg muffin sandwiches  it s the right size and height after cooking compared to the  mc  brand  it is the best i have found after many years of trying  if you have ever wanted to make your own egg muffin at home  this pan is the one to use      
259,1.0,                        pre seasoned  is laughable at best  i ve used other lodge products in the past  so i knew to do my own seasoning when it arrived  even so  the pancakes i tried to make were totally ruined  everything stuck to the pan  even with liberal use of shortening  and the heating was completely uneven  this pan is totally useless      
260,1.0,                       i just needed a pan for frying an egg or two    wrong decision by me  if you have the same idea  don t buy this  buy a teflon coated instead  this pan does not have a mirror surface  rather a porous one  eggs get stuck in the pores and don t clean off easily  it looked so beautiful in the beginning  but i after i tried to fry some eggs  i got the horrible result  everything is sticky and i spent almost    minutes to properly scrub the food off of it   do not recommend if you wanna have an everyday pan for frying      
261,5.0,                       was really tired of watching my wife bring home expensive cookware  williams   sanoma  lecreuset   calphilon  etc   then watching it be thrown out a year or two later because it was burned  or discolored  or the lid holder worked itsself loose had gotten chipped etc told her that my grandmother used one cast iron skillet her entire life  probably cooked with it everyday and never had any issues with  in fact my cousin ended up with after she passed away and always bragged about ending up with it took the plunge with   different lodge skillets and pots of different sizes  seasoned them   or   times each to make sure cooking surface was as good as it could be  i d recommend everyone do this very happy so far and it s been several months since buying them  they also are great on the grill and the smoker  can t do that with the more expensive cookware  so bonus points there      
262,5.0,                       i received my lodge cast iron skillet yesterday  on a sunday   i d say that s pretty darn fast delivery about the product itself   what can i say   it s a lodge i ve yet to use my skillet and have only just seasoned it    it s recommended to re season the skillet again even as it comes pre seasoned   i used the  oven method  of seasoning  applying a very thin film of cooking oil on both the interior and exterior of the skillet and then placing it in a    f oven for one hour   i allowed the skillet to cool on its own while still in the oven   it came out looking great and is now ready for use i ve had lodge skillets in the past but lost them  usually as a result from moving from one apartment to another when all of my possessions  mostly books and lp s  could fit in my old vw beetle in just two trips   i had more books than anything else and they were heavy   asking me to sacrifice a book would have been like requesting that i offer up a child for sacrifice   so the heaviest of items were usually omitted from the move s    what are lp s   google it at a young age one isn t as enamored with quality cookware or can appreciate its durability or longevity as one can today   of course i am speaking of this  one  who is so old that he knew dirt before god lodge cookware has been setting the standard for incredible quality for generations   i have absolutely no doubt that this incarnation of my lodge cast iron skillet will perform as exceptionally as my other skillets   of course  they never were around long enough to establish the classic seasoning that lodge has become known for this skillet will be with me for a very long time and this baby will have the time to grow into its seasoning  by golly  by gosh      
263,5.0,                       just the right size to make one burger or a small batch of eggs  i have a larger lodge pan and found it cumbersome to clean  especially for one person   right out of the box this was very  easy to season  i use flax seed to season all my cast iron    it cleans like a dream   even with burnt on cheese      
264,5.0,                       my husband mentioned to me that he wished we had a  larger  cast iron skillet so i saw this     and decided to try it because i thought the price was reasonable  we love this pan and i just think everything tastes better when it s fried in a cast iron skillet  i m not gonna lie  it is heavy but at least it does have your long handle on one side and the smaller grab handle on the other side so you do have two handles to make carrying it easier      
265,1.0,                       wait just one minute  either i dont know what   inches look like or someone writing product descriptions doesntthis is something that you use to roast garlic cloves  melt a little butter in    not big enough for even an egg yolklooks like a fridge magnet   without the magnet     
266,5.0,                       still going strong that is probably expected of a cast iron pan  but i am quite happy with how this has held up  it was such a good price and was made well  resulting in no problems with rust or stains  of course  that is partially due to proper care of a cast iron pan that you should always follow regardless of the brand      
267,1.0,                       after a few minutes in water it was filled with rust all around  so i took it out  try to clean the rust again and again and again and then try to use it again  i did not want to put it with water so i tried to clean it immidiatly after using it  the problem that it was too hot to be touched  it is all made from iron  i put it on the marble to be cooled but after a few minuts it had a rust stain what about the food  a rust flavor is not one of my favored tastes so i throw to the garbage with the  skillet itself  now i just have to find a way to get rid of the rust stain on  the marble      
268,5.0,                       this is almost exactly like the type of iron skillets that i grew up with  it s not as large as the ones that we had but that s okay  i knew that it wouldn t be  it s medium sized and just what i needed  everyone must have at least one iron skillet  it came already prepared and seasoned  i never knew that you weren t supposed to wash them  i always washed ours growing up  i just get really weird when it comes to what is stuck in the grease that i cannot see when i use it again  that s just me though  i m sure that you would get better results if you didn t wash it and reseason  thank you for the fast shipping too  now i wish i would have gotten the rubber cover that goes on the handle  i think i ll have to purchase one      
269,5.0,                       throw your money at amazon and never look back  i cook a great steak  i love cooking steak  enter this cast iron skillet  shout out to my momma for the recommendation   holy crap this thing rocks  i cook everything in this baby  you ever reheat pizza on a cast iron skillet  you ever get cold in the winter so you just heat up the skillet and let it sit in bed with you  well i have  and i have the burn marks to prove it  i love this skillet  what a phenomenal  purchase      
270,5.0,                       i had   cast iron pans before but one got ruined and i am now down to     i make cornbreads as gifts around christmas and missed being able to do   at a time  i found this on amazon and oredered   while they are  preseasoned  i always season them again at least once or twice before using   my other two are black now and this one needs to be close to that before i will use for the cornbreads   i wash them with a scrubber or nylon brush  no soap  and put them on a burner until they are dry   if the black looks a little thin i rub a thin layer of oil in them while they ate still hot or i will oil them and put in the oven      
271,5.0,                       this pan is made with the usual lodge quality  and the rosie the riveter tribute is wonderful   i recommend this pan to any cast iron cookware enthusiast   i was concerned however when it arrived in a loosely fitting box with inadequate packing   cast iron pans are prone to shipping damage when poorly packaged   mine arrived intact  but i credit that more to luck than the packaging     stars for the product  but a much lower score for the packaging      
272,4.0,                       this skillet really is a great skillet for just under          the only reason i didn t give it   stars was the fact that it was pre seasoned from the company  however  i have had to give it a few more seasonings   but this is such an easy thing to do that i didn t mind putting forth the extra effort due to the price   i used it this morning for breakfast and had some foods stick   just a bit   so i decided to give it one more seasoning go around     in total   should be great after this   i highly recommend this skillet if you don t want to purchase a higher price one and don t mind the little extra effort needed      
273,5.0,                       how to use this pan    don t use dawn or ajax  because it won t completely wash off  use heat to melt oil off and kill germs    use flax seed oil for a hard  fragile seasoning  or grapeseed oil for a soft  clingy seasoning    use a soft sponge  adding salt for abrasion if necessary a review for a     pan  the quality is acceptable  the pan works exactly as advertised  including the pre seasoning  it was on sale for          
274,5.0,                       don t you just love real butter  but hate how it tears up your toast even at room temperature   the     inch lodge cast iron skillet will cure that problem  throw your tablespoon of butter or however much you want in it and warm it up with your eggs problem solved     
275,5.0,                       as person who loves to cook i love anything that makes cooking easier   so when i first got married  i wanted stainless steel everything   i bought a beautiful set of stainless steel t fal cookware   i quickly learned that stainless steel is not the way to go unless you want to be best friends with pam  the cooking spray  or if you use a lot of cooking oils  butter  grease  shortening  in your foods   so i bought more t fal  this time i purchased   non stick skillets for my daily usage   i learned a short time after purchasing that non stick fades   suddenly i started finding little black chips in my eggs and the interior of the skillet had all kinds of scratches as the non stick coating was peeling   i did some research and found this is a common occurence in non stick cookware   and it will happen to every item sooner or later   i also found that the little non stick chips are toxic   well  that was enough for me   what else is there   cast iron   i decided to buy an iron skillet for the health benefits as well as the longevity of the cookware   how many grandmothers  mothers and aunt have a cast iron skillet from         years ago   pretty much every cook i know   so i knew going into the purchase that this would be a long term investment of time   but after   years    it was all worth it i cook pretty much everything in this skillet   from eggs to fried chicken to alfredo sauce to grilled cheese sandwiches   this is my go to skillet   the only thing i dont cook in this is anything with tomatoes or tomato sauce   the acid from the tomato just kills the nice non stick loving i have going in this skillet   besides that its a perfect size for large and small meals i ve heard of different methods for cleaning and seasoning an iron skillet   as much as they say that this skillet is pre seasoned  it is not non stick yet   you have to do that work yourself   personally  this is what i did when i first got it i used it for everything   eggs  baked chicken  fried foods  burgers  pretty much anything you can cook   you have to actually use it after i cook in it  i cleaned it with only hot water and a really really tough nylon scrub brush   sometimes  i would sit and scrub that thing for what seemed like hours   sometimes  it took an overnight soaking in hot water to get out baked on lasagna   never use dish detergent or put it in the dishwasher   the soap with eat away at the non stick layer you re slowing building up either way  after you clean it  dry it completely with a towel   not a paper towel because the surface of the skillet will scratch away little fibers from the paper towel and you ll have small white things stuck to your skillet   place the skillet on the stove on high heat and use a small bit of shortening and very  very  lightly grease the interior of the skillet   i have an old cotton dinner napkin that i keep specifically for this purpose   keep it on the burner and let it heat up until you see the skillet begin to smoke   turn off the burner and let the skillet sit while it cools over time  using this method every time will get you that nice non stick layer   of course  this layer is just shortening or cooking grease building up and baking into the skillet   years into this  i don t have to season it like this anymore   i just cook on it  wash it with hot water and my scrub brush and dry it completely  good luck with this method      
276,4.0,                       for a woman who is not terribly strong  it is heavy   i had trouble placing it in a hot oven without spilling a little because i couldn t hold it even  from just one hand on the red safety handle provided   also  although i greased it well before baking cornbread  even after the first use it seems the finish is slightly damaged   i  hope not  afterwards  i greased it well after carefully rinsing it  not scrubbing it    i guess time will tell whether i ll need to re season it already      
277,5.0,                       i had been reluctant to own cast iron because of the  fear  of all food sticking to it and clean up being laborious   neither of those notions i had are true with this pan   meats  eggs  pancakes  etc leave very little sticking to the bottom or sides   from stove top to oven in the same pan is very convenient   the only reason i put   stars on  easy to clean  is because the pan does require a bit more attention than rinsing and throw into the dishwasher   i usually just scrub the bottom with my brush and water  maybe a touch of liquid soap  and dry well   i heat it and add a teaspoon of oil and wipe it around after cleaning   of note   it is beyond slightly heavy  surely being a   hand pan to handle for     of users      
278,1.0,                       i cooked in cast iron skillets years ago but they went with the ex  so thought i d start cooking again in cast iron  these new lodge cast iron skillets are nothing like the old ones  maybe if you do as the youtubers say and sand the bottom smooth it may be ok but why should i have to do that  if i coat the bottom with crisco and leave it in the oven while i bake something        for an hour it will be non stick the next time i use it  but then if i do not repeat this process it will stick  i clean it while it is hot using only very hot water no soap  no scrub pads  if you want to use cast iron that is great  but invest in the older smooth bottom ones      
279,5.0,                       this is a great cast iron skillet   i see complaints about eggs sticking  yeah  this isn t teflon coated  so you will rarely get the whole egg without leaving some behind   i also have a really old cast iron skillet that the cooking surface is smooth  that takes years of use though   i scrambled some eggs up the other day  no problems at all  but  again it s not a stick free teflon skillet   i seasoned it again out of the box  even though it says it s pre seasoned   really makes a nice steak  bacon  ham  potatoes etc      
280,5.0,                       i know many people that rant and rave about how well cast iron works so i thought i d give it a go with this cheap skillet  this thing is so amazing  i don t know how i ve gotten this far in life without one  i cook pretty much everything in it now  i ve had a few small spots of rust on the bottom side  but that s because i was careless when washing and drying it  left it sitting out  and i live by the beach  a little oil and heat fixed it right up      
281,5.0,                       i have been looking for a lodge pan for a long time  infact my hubby wanted to prepare fish and egg dishes  i live in apartment and have stove top which has coiled top  and while prepping meat the heat wont spread evenly and the meat  fish would get over cooked and lose its taste and texture   it has spoiled my last minute week day dinner   so i had to get this after getting reviews from friends i bought the   inch pan when there was some discount on it it is pre seasoned but   i did wash it before use and seasoned it again  so far i have prepared fried fish  eggs omlette   without getting over done  chicken fajita   veggie stir fry   all came out very good   the handle is sturdy and needs to be picked using mitts when hot this definitely needs proper before and after care   i season it after every use  cleaning and seasoning video is on the product page      
282,5.0,                       perfect size for two person meals  i haven t used it yet  but i do plan to season it again before i do  just to be on the safe side with the non stick aspect of it update           i had to season this pan twice in a row to get a good surface  then two things  first  when making fried eggs  i had to be more patient  the pan will let go when the underside is cooked enough  i am used to making eggs over easy  and i still can  but i need to wait just a bit longer to be able get the pan to release the egg  second  if only doing a simple fry  i just wipe it down with a paper towel after letting it cool about      min to get any excess oil and or food particles  and that s it  this method has definitely helped with creating the perfect surface for frying and searing      
283,4.0,                       will add to this review later  purchased this as my first ever cast iron cookware  love the size and weight  had read enough to know i needed to add to the seasoning of the pan  that said  the interior was still rough  gave it to a friend who sanded the interior down and has been seasoning it for me  cooked eggs on it today and am delighted with the results  this is the only reason i gave it   stars  for the price you can t beat it  will let you know how it works out as time goes by   st pic is before he seasoned it   nd pic is after seasoning     
284,5.0,                       this thing has some serious heft to it  you cna really tell it is alot higher quality than some of the cheaper ones  if you need to defend the home with this it d do the job  it does a good job cooking without making the handle too hot  i know some people don t clean cast iron skillets at all but if you would like to clean let s say egg off this your in for a tough job  if your going camping and want to cook over a fire this is the skillet to own      
285,5.0,                       i must say  after having purchased many higher end  non stick  skillets  i should have listened to my dad years ago  my last purchase prior to this was awesome for a year  and even with care the non stick coating has scratched   i love this skillet  i took it out of the box  rinsed it as recommended and made sausage gravy  i am thrilled  i have a glass top range  i ve found other cookware heated unevenly producing hot spots and not the best results when cooking   with this skillet  none of that  i purchased the glass lid that fits the skillet  no complaints there either  i know it seems like a no brainer  if you own a glass top range  lift the skillet to move it  it s heavy but the assist handle is a huge help  i will be adding to my lodge cast iron as i can and won t ever go back to the  non stick  brands  thanks lodge for an excellent product      
286,2.0,                       i have the lodge    dutch oven   and i love it   it does everything and never sticks   so  i bought this one   first one  i sent back because food stuck   there were flaws in the surface   second one is fine for cooking and cleaning  etc   however  i may sent this one back  because the handle is too short to protect the user   the red silicone handle is useless  so i use the large one i bought for the other   it works okay  but is awkward   can t take a chance to burn my hand every time i use it unless i use a potholder   i will try that to see if it works  but i m skeptical   too bad  someone at lodge should take a good look at that      
287,5.0,                       this is one gorgeous heavy duty skillet  i didn t know if the pot holder could go in the oven but i slid it on and off when placing the skillet in and out the oven and didn t feel any heat  it cooked nicely  cleaned up nicely n made me want to order a larger one  i used it the next day after receiving it to make a peach pancake fluff with my son cooking receipe card from raddish use my referral code    jp      
288,5.0,                       i am a college student and i bought this to use for camping and then i just started using it in the kitchen and now i use it everyday  i am also looking at getting another one  i did not season this skillet in the oven as other reviewers mentioned  food did stick to it for the first couple uses  but it scraped off with no particular difficulty  after a few uses i could cook an egg without it sticking at all  with some oil i now cook everything in this skillet  i even put it right on the table to serve the food in  it looks great and stays hot for a very long time relative to cookware of other materials  i have been using it for about a month and a layer of polymerized oil has build up on the bottom  there is a     inch ring near the wall of the skillet where there is no built up seasoning yet but it does not seem to affect the nonstick quality i just use this on an old style heating element on my kitchen stove  it takes     minutes to heat up  i usually leave it on medium heat to heat up and just leave it on medium  i have researched extensively and i have concluded that soap does not really hurt cast iron  i wash mine with soap and it is still nonstick  i also purchased the lodge plastic scrapers that i really like i also like frying things in cast iron  the oil seems to hold its temperature really well which may be why things turn out more crispy than in a regular skillet      
289,5.0,                       i received my skillet today and as all other cast iron  i soon will season it according to the directions under lodge l  sk  pre seasoned cast iron skillet   the directions are long so i will not reprint them here  but they were supplied by joe bob  barefoot in fl  on november           timeless classic for the modern kitchen    i bought the       inch size and it s  just what i want   the pan is heavy  so the person at amazon needs to be retrained in packing   the packing job was bad  as part of the handle was sticking out of the box  but no damage to the pan so i m happy   like i said  this pan is heavy   it s nice and flat and just the right size for me   lodge is made in america too   well made and i ll pass it down to my daughter when i bite the dust  secondary small handle is good to have     stars as this is a really nice cast iron skillet   spend the time to season it properly and it will outlive you and make cooking much more pleasurable   say goodbye to no stick pans that need to be replaced yearly   say goodbye to the associated cost too   lodge for me      
290,5.0,                       i have an induction cook top that makes an annoying buzzing or cycling sound with my magnetic stainless steel cookware  i was advised that cast iron pans would eliminate this noise  i m so glad that i took the advice and bought this pan  i now have noise free cooking and the best tasting food i ve ever cooked  i fry up eggs and bread on weekend mornings and the whole family raves about them  crunchy on the outside  light on the inside  i rarely use the toaster now because bread and bagels taste so much better fried in this pan  this pan gets a perfectly even heat and which is easy to quickly control with an induction cook top  i have seared meat for stews and made stir fries in this pan  and it also works well for making sauces as well  at first i was a little intimidated by the cleaning instructions and the need to keep a coat of oil on the pan to keep it non stick and rust free  but i have found the cleanup to be extremely easy  i simply clean the pan with the scrubber side of a damp sponge  no soap   rinse it out with clean hot water  dry it well and then apply a thin coat of coconut oil with a paper towel  i bought the scrubber brush and plastic scrapers that are recommended with this pan but haven t found a need to use them      
291,5.0,                       a cast iron skillet is an age old tool and a must have for any cooking enthusiast  we purchased our lodge specifically for outdoor cooking and we fell in love with it immediately the design of the skillet is no nonsense  there are no fancy gimmicks or tricks up its sleeve  and none are needed  it s just the right size to cook for two people  it comes pre seasoned  which was great because our past attempts to season a vintage skillet did not work out  this bad boy was ready to go right out of the box the extra handle and pour spout made it easy to pour juices  melted butter  etc over the food we made  everything cooked perfectly due to the fantastic heat distribution of the iron  so far  we have prepared steaks  potatoes  bacon and mushrooms in it with amazing results  it is easy to clean  but follow the included instructions to ensure a long and fulfilling relationship with your skillet this is a simple  solid and reliable skillet  i can t imagine campfire cooking with anything else  and look forward to many more adventures and amazing meals      
292,5.0,                       i wanted to try cooking on cast iron for a long time now  but i was always worried and intimidated by the large heavy pans  this little guy is cheap but high quality  so it s low risk to try it out and see  it s perfect size for a lot of things  like cooking meat for two  we ve tried steaks  burgers  chicken  and bacon  or making a quick full meal for one person  excellent for grilled cheese    it was easy to use and easy to clean  we like it so much  we ve now taken the plunge to get a larger cast iron pan for bigger meals  i m totally recommending this one for other beginner cooks      
293,5.0,                       after having the pizookie and similar chocolate chip cookie desserts at restaurants  i was on the hunt to find a little cast iron skillet to make the same dessert at home  this little skillet works perfectly  just add chocolate chip cookie dough to the pan  bake the cookie  and then add a scoop of vanilla ice cream and hot fudge  it s a great once in a while treat  the cookie cooks evenly and has the perfect consistency      
294,3.0,                       i already had a     cast iron skillet  another brand  but wanted a second one  so i bought this lodge skillet because of its low price and reputation  sadly  it is a dud  i seasoned it as per lodge instructions  the first use was ok  but the second one proved disastrous  i cooked marinated skirt steak  the meat came out great but there are tons of black bits crusted on the pan and i can t get them out  i cooked a second batch of the same exact meat in my other skillet  no black bits  no problem wiping it clean  i m throwing out this lodge pan and getting another one of the same brand that i had  also  the red silicone handle cover is worse than useless  it s downright dangerous  you think it will protect your hand  but it won t  use proper oven mitts      
295,5.0,                       i put this on my wish list since i already bought the cover some time ago for another pan  bought when the price dropped on a late late night  anyway  this is the largest pan that lodge has  that has an accompanying cover  i can make large quick braises with it  as long as the braising liquid isn t too acidic  also fantastic for oven roasting  preheat pan in     oven  then place your items in the pan and turn on the broiler  it cooks from both sides with no flipping needed  quick hot cook juicy foods  you need a good insulator to pick up from the helper handle  the radiant heat goes through most oven gloves      
296,1.0,                       this is by far the worst frying pan i ve ever had  i was able to use it one time  after putting it in the dishwasher it was chipped and rusty  what a complete and utter waste of money      
297,1.0,                       the center of the skillet protrudes  it s higher than the sides  the oil runs down to the sides while the center is dry  as a result the center gets hotter  which means uneven cooking  it s junk      
298,5.0,                       i ordered this       inch lodge skillet when it was on sale  and i m glad i have it   i have a    inch burner on my stove  and this skillet fits just right   the       inch measure is across the top  and the sides slope inward so the bottom is    inches   if you don t have a    inch burner  this is not the skillet for you   it will not heat properly on a smaller burner   the first time i used it  there were several spots where my steel spatula snagged against little bumps on the cooking surface   i took some     grit emery paper on a sanding block and sanded the bottom of the skillet for about    minutes   i ended up with about       tablespoons of dust that i washed out  then generously oiled the skillet   the next time i used it  the bottom seemed smoother  but not completely smooth like my old wagner ware   my spatula no longer snags anywhere   because of the size and weight of this pan  i leave it on the stovetop most of the time   if i have to move it  i put it on a rack next to the stove  so i don t take a chance of chipping my granite counter with it   i have to lift it with both hands   i use it as a frying pan for breaded chicken and pork chops  as well as a griddle for pancakes  quesadillas  french toast  bacon  fried eggs  and anything else you can think of   i m looking forward to when we can have a party again  and plan to bake a humongous cornbread in it   bacon and sausage often leave residue stuck to the bottom  so to clean it i will pour in about a cup of water while it s hot   then take it to the sink while still warm  and run hot water into it and scrub with a brush   i put a dishcloth or dishtowel on the sink divider to protect it from scratches  and rest the skillet on that while washing   no soap is needed most of the time   just don t leave it until it gets completely cold   wipe it dry  and use a paper towel to spread a little oil over the cooking surface   put it on the rack to completely dry   now i just have to figure out who gets it in my will      
299,1.0,                       rough as    grit sandpaper  maybe some work with a grinder will make it usable  on the plus side not expensive enough to bother with a return      
300,5.0,                       i ve got several other lodge cast iron pans  and i ve been very happy with all of them   cast iron isn t nearly as tricky as you might think if you ve never used it  and it is definitely a super pan for when you want to brown things   i wish recipe writers would settle on one size pan though because it s nuts that i need          and a    inch pans   i m looking at you  dutch baby recipe writers      
301,5.0,                       this is a great skillet  the benefits of cast iron are numerous and well known and lodge knows cast iron  i use this for almost everything especially meats that must go from the range top to the oven and back again  the thing one must be aware of is the maintenance  the care and feeding of cast iron is not an easy thing and there are do s and don ts to adhere to  i ve been cooking with cast iron pans my whole life and didn t know all there was to know about  seasoning  until looking on line for recipes  having said all that  it is totally worth the additional attention      
302,4.0,                       have been using it for two years since i purchased  and it s still wonderful  it s a little different to wash care for than my previous cast iron pans  which let to a bit of rusting at the beginning as i got use to it  but now it s wonderful  cooks wonderfully both on burners and in the oven  people with cheaper burners should beware that the weight of this pan is quite heavy the reason i m writing this review now is because my house got broken into a week back while i was home  came down to confront the dude in the kitchen and  seeing that this was the first thing within reach  swung at him with it  i only hit him in the shoulder  but it sent him scrambling away with some visible damage  the pan survived without a scratch so overall     stars  cooks well  durable  and does more to prevent crime than my local municipal police force      
303,1.0,                       i really wanted to love this pan after reading all the reviews  but i must have done something wrong that it failed the very first time i used it   the day i received it  based on the instruction from lodge s website  i used hot water to rinse it without soap  dried it completely using paper towel  and applied veggie oil   i then put it on cook top  turned on heat to low  and slowly to high   i then cracked an egg into it  and a few tomato slices   i thought i followed every step correctly  but everything stuck on the pan   it was super hard to clean   i used a brush with nylon bristles  but in vain   i then again followed instruction and boiled water for a few minutes  but the food still got stuck on the pan   i tried boiling water three times and didn t help   very frustrated  i dried it and coated with oil   i tried again the next morning with a dutch baby pancake in the oven  and again was very sticky   i wonder what i did wrong and how to fix it   i emailed lodge  but a week passed and i have not heard anything from them   i had high hope on this pan and now super frustrated      
304,3.0,                       really small barely large enough to hold one large egg  egg stuck in spite of using olive oil and cleaning was very difficult  i let the skillet soak in warm soapy water and it started showing signs of rust  too small for practical cooking and cleaning is tricky  i do not recommend buying this for cooking  it is hung up as a decoration now      
305,5.0,                       because of my wrist issues  i resisted getting a cast iron skillet for years  but a week a go  i was at the point of replacing my non stick pans  again   so  i decided to give lodge a try  i ve cooked eggs  bacon  sausage and steak in it  success  i got the crispy ends on eggs which i love  the iron skillet browns a steak beautifully  i was going to post a pic of my steak  but hey  i was hungry  i suggest letting the skillet warm up for a while  washing the cast iron skillet was easily achieved  however   the lodge cast iron skillet is heavy for me  ahhhh  i will just live with it or get a wrist splint and increase pt the instructions said to use more oil on the first few uses  so my breakfast had more oil than usual  i had eggs and sausage with rice  i plan to invest in more cast iron skillets  i plan to use the skillet daily  these baby is durable      
306,5.0,                       great price the pandemic started me on a wonderous cooking adventure  a cast iron skillet was my next step in this cooking revolution  the price was amazing  half the   of sheckles compared to similar sized   st thing i cooked was bacon  to really lock in the seasoning  i ve since cooked   total dishes   they all came out fantastic  heating seems to be pretty even i like that the handle is not tilted upwards  so it fits easily into an oven it s so heavy  i would use it as a weapon during the inevitable zombie apocalypse      
307,5.0,                       i bought a couple to use for desserts for my husband and i   based on some recipes and the site description  i thought this would be the right size   when the pans arrived  i realized that we were use to larger dessert portions     they produce cookies   brownies   tarts   cobbler about the size of a mid sized cookie   the    is at the rim  so the bottom of the pan is closer to      it s everything that you d expect from a lodge  they just weren t large enough for us   i ended up buying a set of    which works better for us      
308,4.0,                       this is my daily use skillet for my family of five it came with a decent seasoning from the factory  however  i recommend a giving it a good one or two seasonings before using it for sticky foods  like frying eggs   with the rougher surface on these lodge pans  it won t take too long to build up i m able to do steaks for the whole family  deep dish pizzas and of course  big breakfasts it s well finished and consistent with lodge quality  the only challenge that i have with it is that it is thick and heavy  the short handle makes it unwieldy so you need   hands to move it around  you definitely need a good  consistent heat source to keep it warm enough as well if you need a larger skillet  the price and quality make this well worth it  just be prepared to work with it s weight      
309,3.0,                       so i don t usually write reviews  but i also get real annoyed with the  only buy usa made crowd  because chinese made us crap  crowd  so i just needed to review this particular usa made lodge skillet to assure them that some products made here aren t so well done either i ordered the rosie the riveter skillet from lodge because i have a special affinity for the gals who rolled up their sleeves and went to work in what was normally men dominated fields when their country needed them to  i don t usually buy anything  special edition   because it s not special  there are thousands made  but having spent some real time with various rosies  this one was near and dear to me came out of the package great  no worries about it being shipped  i took off the label that sits attached to the interior of the pan and was honestly a little shocked by what i saw massive  for cast iron  pits in the center of the pan  i mean  these are legit holes in the cast iron itself  not just the seasoning i ve got many cast iron pieces  most of them i ve gotten secondhand or they re enameled  but never have i seen one with actual holes on the cooking surface  the bottom of the pan looks great  and i were just planning on hanging it up and making it a conversation piece that would be fine  but i also expect it to function properly as cookware so this was super disappointing      
310,2.0,                       this is my second lodge pan purchased on amazon  the first was a square grill pan which is still great  see photo  after many high temp uses  this round pan came with a chipped rusty portion on the edge  photo      it also lost its seasoning after first use in which i pan fried chicken fillet  the picture is the morning after i washed and scrubbed it with foam  i ve re seasoned it according to lodge s instruction on their website  it darkened a little but still visibly faded and looks different  lighter  than the handle or the bottom  i still like lodge products  i just did not like this specific pan      
311,5.0,                       it s not often you can find something that just works as intended  will last a lifetime  and at a good price   there may be lighter ones out there  or some kind of better  design  like a double spout  whatever   save yourself some time and just go with the reliable standard   lodge   their youtube videos are also very informative   but you have to learn how to maintain and season a cast iron pan if you re looking at cast iron   there is no skipping that part   but once you get the hang of it you ll wonder how you ever cooked without one   we use ours both in the kitchen and out camping   we have them in different sizes and shapes too  check out the dutch oven for camping    you cannot go wrong with lodge      
312,2.0,                       i love cast iron products in general and i had high expectations for this skillet  the pros are basically what most cast iron products offer  evenly heated surface that cooks meat eggs thoroughly  nonstick surface when seasoned  great with slow cooking however  i noticed that this skillets handle is quite short when comparing to some of my other skillets  combined with the weight of this item  i find it extremely difficult to maneuver  i also purchased a rubber handle protector that s suppose to help with gripping the handle during cooling  but guess what  the handle does not fit properly and it s hard to safely  without burning your hand  lift the skillet i strongly recommend that the handle to be extended  or provide a better sleeve  to be included with the product  not only sold separately  that fits properly so you can actually lift the skillet during cooking      
313,5.0,                       got this as my intro to cast irons   i literally have only used it to make pizookies   more just to practice using  cleaning  and seasoning before i invest in something larger   i do wonder why it has such a bumpy gritty texture   i ve seen many cast irons with a more smooth texture   i have nothing to compare it to  so maybe it s the brand  no idea   but it works for its purpose  super heavy for being so small   i m also making sure i m not knocking off edges of my countertop etc lol     
314,5.0,                       tonight i tried out my new lodge cast iron pan   the pan looked well seasoned and it was  i cooked up some pork tenderloin medallions and then removed to make a sauce  put them back in and i was amazed at how evenly everything cooked   the meal was delicious and the clean up was pretty easy  i had three little spots where food stuck and i got them off with a soft sponge and hot water   pan was washed in warm water  dried and oiled   i can t wait to cook something else i have always used good cookware  but nothing really compares to cast iron   no mistake  it is heavy  but maybe i will build up some muscle using it   now i need to dig out my little ones and get them seasoned up      
315,5.0,                       i ordered this skillet with the intention of hanging it in my kitchen   when i received this skillet i was really surprised to see that it was a non stick skillet   i have always been a  cast iron snob   old school   i  have  cast iron from my great grandmother   although this lodge cast iron  rosie skillet totally rocks  but it is now my favorite frying pan   i have to order another one now          
316,5.0,                       i have been contemplating getting the cast iron pan for many years now  i finally got the   inch skillet for my husband to replace his non stick pan frying eggs in the morning  i did season the pan but only using the stove top  instead of baking it in the oven per instructions   it came seasoned anyway  eggs came out perfect like cooked in a non stick pan  of course you will have to use a little oil before cracking the eggs in but which pan does not require oil anyway  i am super pleased with it and it gets better and better the more we use it  i am planning to season it about once in two weeks to build up the non stick surface  the only regret i have is not getting it sooner      
317,2.0,                       came with a sizeable hole in the bottom of the pan  perhaps from a bit of sand in the casting process  i m returning it for an exchange  and hopefully the new one won t have holes  but i m still disappointed that no one at lodge bothered to check for quality control  if you google  holes in cast iron skillet  you find that this is a common complaint with lodge    in addition the  pre seasoning  was flaking off in chunks  and there were bits of burnt charcoal chunks stuck to the pan  presumably  seasoning  that wasn t applied properly  but i could have easily fixed both of those by stripping the seasoning and re seasoning the pan  i own other lodge cookware that i love  they make good products  but they don t seem to have any quality control  i m wishing now that i had just gone down to the hardware store where i could see the pan before buying it      
318,2.0,                       i was so excited to get this in the mail  i ve owned several cast iron skillets  molds  what have you  our last one of this size pitted it was ancient   and there was no coming back and i didn t realize how important this size was until we no longer had it  so i ordered another  it arrived with a crack  so disappointed  i had already thrown all tags away and begun to cook with it when i realized  i m going to use it anyway it s just frustrating because it s not like this item was cheaper than you can find elsewhere  check your skillet before tearing the tags      
319,5.0,                       my wife has been using this skillet about   times a week since she got it  it came oiled   ready to use  she made some stove top chicken with what they call smashed potatoes which was fantastic  looked just as fantastic as it taste  i am amazed at all the recipes that are out there online  i think she got this one from facebook but i assume amazon probably has recipes somewhere on the site also for free  if i would have known she d be getting one of these skillets  i would have went garage sailing more this summer since they re usually a buck or    i can tell you from a husbands point of view who s not the cooker in the family  guy s  if you are looking for a gift for your wife  get one  you won t be sorry  for you ladies reading this  it s great  you ll be amazed with what you can cook with it   the recipes out there are nothing short of fantastic  i ll post another review with a photo this week i had to fix the errors on this review because i was calling it a pan   not a skillet  i just ordered her a    inch skillet with   egg pancake rings i might as well get those accessories since she ll be doing sunday morning breakfasts again  the egg rings do help you make the eggs all uniform  with our    inch x    inch electric skillet  she ll be able to cook   eggs at a time  which helps out  plus it helps you make a restaurant style egg  without any broken yokes or egg runs where it looks like one gigantic egg  at least when i am elected to cook that s what usually happens  as for using the egg rings for pancakes  our favorite server at our neighborhood restaurant told us that if we can t get the real restaurant pancake mix  use sprite or   up in the place of water  when we make our pancake mix  not only will they have a sweet taste but they ll be nice and fluffy too  one more thing  if you like to cook outside on a grill over a log fire out on the pit  there s nothing around that beats a cast iron skillet  those teflon coated skillets warp so easy  they can get ruined after just one meal made outdoors   you now how good food taste s when you cook over an open fire     dan     
320,5.0,                       i purchased   of these mainly because of the reviews and price of the item with such high reviews  i m definitely glad i decided to purchase these  i made the mistake of putting oil in the skillet during my first use as i read that cast iron skillets need extra oil in the beginning  i learned my lesson the hard way  i either had too much oil or didn t use the right kind because my house was really smoky and the quality of the pork chops was not as good as the ones i cooked with the other skillet that did not have extra oil these are very heavy and sturdy for paying a little over     per skillet  they do not feel flimsy and are very secure  i would recommend making sure you have another pot older for the handle as the skillet does get very hot and an accidental burn over something that could have been prevented would be no fun      
321,1.0,                       have wanted a cast iron pan for a long time  finally got it and it s a disappointment  there were scrapes all over after the second use  used only silicone utensils and cleaned it with damp paper towel  so i couldn t scrape it  it just cracked  it heats up so much that even the silicone holder doesn t help  you still can t touch it  really heavy and not comfortable in use      
322,5.0,                       compared this skillet to other lodge products i own and the surface is different   it s minutely dimpled   i think lodge started using this when they pre seasoned their cast iron   i believe the dimpling is much better in reducing sticking   amazing that this american company has resisted  the china  syndrome and continues to produce a superior product at a competitive price   also this pan is    less on amazon than at walmart   this is really a good deal      
323,5.0,                       this is my first cast iron pan  i use it almost exclusively for many different types of food  it is easy to clean  it heats evenly  and it has held up well  make sure to dry the pan completely and oil it after use  do not set it on a drying rack and leave it because it may rust  the        inch pan fits a one dish meal for two adults most people opt for non stick pans because they think cast iron is intimidating or too much work  but non stick is actually more temperamental  you have to use special utensils  you have to wash it carefully  and the non stick coating quickly wears out and you have to replace the pan with cast iron  if you keep it oiled properly  it gets easier to clean instead of wearing out      
324,5.0,                       this is one big skillet   i love it   i can cook almost anything in it from a big batch of fried okra to one small fried egg   i just leave it on the stove top and cook anytime   this is the skillet that everyone needs to own  the grand and perfect skillet      
325,5.0,                       i had a cast iron pan a long time ago and after one move  it must have disappeared and by the time i noticed i decided i really didn t need it   lately  i ve been coming across a lot of recipes for which a cast iron pan is ideal  so i decided to buy this one   it heats very evenly  its easy to clean and the silicon handle works as long as you don t exceed what it s rated for   i m very happy with it  and as a bonus it gives my right arm a workout just taking it out of the cabinet   washing  it  and putting it back      
326,5.0,                       our household kitchen wizard has been requesting a larger cast iron skillet for a while now  and this does the job just fine and dandy   does need to be re seasoned  but not a problem  pretty much expect that with any cast iron product   pretty sure that paying triple  or much  much  more  for a more highly rated pre seasoned pan is really not worth it   what   you can t buy some flaxseed oil and turn on the oven for a bit for under     price is right  product is what it is  a nice cast iron pan  and the shipping was astronomically speedy to boot      
327,5.0,                       i bought the   in lodge skillet and i love it  it s heavy and you ll probably want to get silicone covers for the handles  it s very heavy  i have a ceramic cook top so i m careful to not slide the skillet around on the stove  i haven t had any scratches but i ve read it s possible on these stove tops i feel like an idiot for not trying cast iron sooner  i cook eggs a ton and i thought it couldn t be done well in cast iron  i was wrong  i can tilt this pan and slide my eggs out most of the time  it does require some prep to get to this level of non stick though when the pan arrived i covered it in the thinnest layer of canola oil i could and baked it at    f for an hour  over several days i did this   times  some say that s overkill but my skillet is hella non stick now  just make sure to use oil butter to cook sticky foods like eggs and wipe the pan out while it s still warm  always dry it completely as it will rust quickly  but rust can be removed from these fairly easily      
328,5.0,                       this guy was my first foray into cast iron cooking  and i am      hooked  this skillet is super solid  read  quite heavy  and reasonably pre seasoned  the pre seasoning was a little uneven  with some obvious pooling on the handle which led to dark splotching  i ended up giving it a very light wash and re seasoning it before use  it s been a joy to cook with   no sticking at all  and so easy to wipe clean  this is built to last  and definitely will with the right care      
329,5.0,                       i bought this skillet to cook some steaks  starting in the pan and finishing in the oven  and this pan was perfect  it arrived in good condition  was simple to use  it can get hot while cooking  be prepared with oven mitts   and even easier to clean  i think this is the perfect skillet for young adults who want to start building their cookware collection but don t want to break the bank doing so  it s sturdy  affordable and big enough to cook steaks eggs veggies    pretty much anything you might want to pan fry under normal circumstances  would absolutely buy another for a friend      
330,4.0,                       i have to say this will be the first negative review i m leaving on amazon  i m well aware not everything will be perfect through mail  but the packaging on these products was atrocious  not only was there absolutely no packing materials between the two cast iron pans but there was barely any in the box  there s a small scratch on the larger pan because the smaller one was sitting inside of it and probably rubbing the edges onto the other  the box didn t look sturdy enough for a small rug let alone two roughly   lb pans  otherwise the pans are beautiful they look well made and very sturdy considering they held up in the cardboard box it was sent in  will review the other pan good or bad if i have any issues or positive comments to make  giving it a   because i m unsure if this is an amazon mess up or the seller  don t want to see a company have a bad review if it s not even their fault      
331,2.0,                       while i ve had good luck with the smaller diameter lodge brand iron skilets in the past  this     model proved to be an epic failure  i m definitely  old school   so i ve bought  seasoned and utilized these older types of cast iron skilets for well over    years  but we repeatedly seasoned and used this one  and it was just a doissster  the quality of the cast iron on this model is dismal  its way too porous and low grade  in addition  the heat distribution was pathetic out to the outer margins of the pan  in fact  on only its third use  and at moderate stovetop heat   while making routine fajitas  the very center of the pan overheated  with the metal becoming molten and it literally sagged  absolute fifty dollars worth of garbage  we have four other lodge brand cast iron skilrts of smaller diameter  and none of them have shown this type of failure  and cleaning it  a virtual nightmare  so i would recommend opting for another brand  or at a minimum  i would suggest avoidance of this largest       skilet in favor of two smaller ones      
332,5.0,                       omg   my husband loved this as his father s day present from our kids   he is a fan of cooking with cast iron skillet s and has been asking for a while for a  huge  skillet   so i figured with fathers day nearing  i would start researching  the different sizes available in cast iron after further research  i decided on this lodge brand       the     we currently own is also a lodge brand that is several years old with no issues or concerns of cracks as i have read on other brands   he has used this skillet already a couple of times on our smooth top stove with no issues  just don t go silly and bang it   this is a well made heavy cast iron skillet that i know we will get a lifetime of use from   highly recommend      
333,5.0,                       awesome skillet  no complaints  it s a larger pan so if you re looking to cook two eggs it might be a little overkill  two  lb new york strips fit perfectly with room to spare for some aromatics  there s some reviews talking about food sticking and sending the pan back because of that  i took the time to season this pan twice before i ever attempted to put food into it  the steaks didn t stick and cooked just fine  the mashed potatoes stuck some but i fully expected that to happen  afterwards during cleaning it flaked right off and barely required any scrubbing  i fully expect this pan to last well beyond my life time and will be given to my kids who will probably throw them in the back of the cupboard  oh well  for     it s a helluva deal for a brand new piece  without a doubt i ll be buying a smaller size for smaller breakfast type stuff  again take the time to understand how to use cast iron and how to care for it and you won t be disappointed  if you re looking for instant gratification  stick with something teflon coated      
334,5.0,                       note  i received nothing of value for this review and paid full retail price for this item i have the     lodge skillet that i use for lots of things but it s often too big  i m very happy with this smaller  commemorative skillet  they really last forever cast iron cooking tips  it takes the iron a long time to heat up  rarely would i use more than medium heat  give it time  it will heat up  i set the pan on the stove     minutes with oil in the bottom to preheat  once properly preheated  it cooks very evenly  when i m finished  while the pan is still hot  i wipe it out and then scrub it out with more oil  then rinse oil off when cool  rarely needs seasoning this way      
335,4.0,                       this is a key pan for home cooking  core cook wear is stainless but over the last    months the need for cast iron became obvious  this pan is made in the usa by a long term manufacturer and is an exceptional buy at the amazon price point  caution is required in use and emphasized by the manufacturer for electric induction flat top stoves  it heats well  note the handle heats up as well  and holds the temp  great utility for going from stove top to oven in cooking as well as direct baking  recommend d l mfg guidance from the net on use and maintenance  re seasoned before first use  clean up   out of   depending on use  use hot water and stiff brush for cleaning after use with oil wipe      
336,5.0,                       i was a little skeptical about how well this skillet would work for the price  but i have to say i have been pleasantly surprised with my first cast iron cookware  i took the steps to  season  it once by adding some oil and baking in the oven for about an hour  i also did as others have suggested and made sure to add oil when heating up and heating slowly  the first couple uses the skillet was a little sticky  but after that it has been great  good even cooking and easy clean up  i make sure i always scrape it right afterwards under hot water and avoid using soap  couldn t be happier with the quality of this cast iron skillet for the price      
337,5.0,                       i read a lot of reviews of these  i grew up on a cast iron pan house  and cooked a lot of moosemeat in one  but i was a kid then  and really didn t have a clue one from another  so when i read the reviews  i decided to give it a shot  i wanted something i could make single serving egg dishes in for myself  well  i love this  it is  indeed  rough  not smooth  on the inside  but i have a feeling that this is a good thing  it comes pre seasoned  vegetable oil   and i seasoned it before first use with canola oil  i rubbed it  heated it  and threw it in the oven to keep it clean  then i baked something  and left it in there  finally i used it for scrambled eggs  nothing stuck to the pan  then i got brave and cooked a cheese and jalepeno omelette  nothing stuck to the pan  in fact  i can put a   egg and cheese mix in the pan  let it set on a medium burner for a few minutes  put the stainless steel walnut spatula  sold on amazon  under it  flip it intact  turn off the heat  then just flip the pan over and drop it out onto a plate  nothing sticks  and i cannot say that for my older teflon pan from a big name anodized aluminum maker  at all so when you wash it  use a plastic brush and warm water    not even hot  then rub a little vegetable oil on it  and put it into the oven and let it reside there the next time you bake  or just heat it on the burner and let it smoke big tip for cast iron and stainless pans  let them heat up before you add any cooking oil as you first start to cook  things will not stick  if you add things to a cold pan  they will very likely give you problems      
338,1.0,                       i got this yesterday   and this morning i have tofu  scramble for breakfast   so this is how it looks after on use    i dont understand  how i ruined the pan after one use  i also put a pic of another pan that i had for years to compare     
339,3.0,                       several family members have a cast iron skillet and they think they are just great   i do not agree  first of all  my new skillet is way too heavy for me to comfortably use  i have a glass stove top that i love  cast iron skillets are a bit dangerous to use on glass top stoves  i must be very careful about moving it around  clean up is most difficult  i do not feel that it is actually clean when done the way that i have been instructed   yes  it can be put into the oven  but so can my other fry pans  they are lighter  they are not dangerous to my stove top  they can be cleaned just fine  luckily  this cast iron skillet was not too expensive  because i feel that it was a waste of money to buy it      
340,1.0,                       i liked it for cooking steaks  however it got a tiny bit of rust from a pot that was set inside it briefly while cleaning up  i tried everything recommended   the rust went crazy spread all over   on both sides  so its in my donation pile  i had a cast iron skillet once before   never had this happen  didn t have it more than a few months      
341,5.0,                       i love cast iron cookware it s bulletproof i have a          a jiant     skillet for cooking bacon they don t warp there s no coating to wear a way there easy to clean the only thing to be a ware of is there weight the          are not a problem but the big     skillet is heavy about       pounds dosn t sound like a lot but when your holding it buy the handle leverage works against you it s heavy for one hand but hay you got to hands i m just saying my be not a good gift for grandma     
342,5.0,                       update            returned original pan and amazon shipped me a new one  new one arrived in pristine  amazing condition without any manufacturing defects i was really looking forward to lodge s quality having read so many great things about them  at first i thought my cast iron pan arrived used  but upon further inspection  it just seems like a factory issue  if you look at the pictures i attached  you ll find unevenness in the finish  it s quite obvious it s not the seasoning since there are bumpy ridges  returned for an exchange  giving you a second chance lodge  please don t disappoint      
343,5.0,                       i am no passionate cast iron enthusiast  who knows the nuisances between different brands of cast iron  however  in my neck of the woods lodge produces what would be considered the modern quintessential        cast iron pan  i find it in most cooking stores  amazon just had the best price at the time  the product received was as anticipated there are always going to be people recommending you thirft shop and restore an old one if you can  however  for ease of access and price  you are not going to go wrong  just remember to always do some additional cleaning and seasoning prior to its first use  the standard online method usually take    min   hours depending on repetition if you want to know more  the internet has many more educated people than myself to tell you all about it      
344,5.0,                       i love this skillet   i ve used it on the stove gas and electric on glass tops do not drag this skillet on it  it will scratch the glass  as well as over fire outdoors   i ve owned it for   months now and it still looks as new as it did   months ago   make sure to research how to clean your cast iron cookware and always heat them up to evaporate any surface moisture after cleaning before oiling  i ve made many different foods in this  utica greens  bacon  eggs  steak  pizza   etc   all have come out perfect   be aware this skillet is huge so make sure you have room to store it and it is also heavy   about    pounds i think  so my wife does have trouble moving it  i also need   hands to carry the sucker especially when its loaded with food   i would say i would buy this again  but i see this skillet lasting for ever      
345,5.0,                       first holiday meal we cut apart two chickens and made classic fired chicken in our new skillet  the pan is nicely cured  heavy and provides an even stable heat once at temperature   we used the gas ring from our smoker to heat the pan and oil  once the oil temp hit     we filed it with chicken and turned the burner up a hair  the oil temp never dropped below     and quickly regained heat  it produced beautifully fried chicken on our first attempt   the only caveat is  the pan is very heavy for draining oil from and cleaning at the kitchen sink  at      you could probably spatchcock two whole chickens or a small turkey  this is a big  heavy frying pan and worth every penny  american made      
346,5.0,                       i ve recently gotten back into using cast iron   i got a good deal on this one as a  scratch and dent    amazon return   i m not sure where the scratch or dent is   was  but it works like it should one thing to keep in mind is that this thing is huge   no really  it s bigger than you were thinking   that poses two  problems  for the average kitchen user  that aren t reasons to take stars away     this is heavy and  like all lodge cast iron  has a tiny handle   you ll want to use two hands to move it around once it s hot and is full   fortunately it has a second handle   be sure to use oven mitts  welding gloves  or something else to protect your hands  because once it is hot  it is going to stay hot for a while    did i mention it s huge    so big in fact that the burners on my kitchen stove don t heat the entire pan very well   you ll want to spend some time       minutes at least  pre heating this on a medium low setting before cranking up the heat  and even then you ll probably have a hot spot in the middle  and cooler temps out at the edges   this isn t an issue if you re cooking over a large burner camping   expedition type stove  but burner size should be factored in      
347,5.0,                       i ve been wanting a really large pan for a while and am very happy with this one  i really like the versatility of being able to put it in the oven  even a campfire  even though it s bigger than my stove burner  it heats evenly  the biggest strength is also the biggest weakness  and that is its size  it s heavy even when empty  so keep that in mind  it s worth it to me though      
348,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          this is a perfect fried egg pan  i used a spray oil and did not pre treat the pan  it cooks up the sides of the pan and came out perfectly  this is the small     inch one      
349,4.0,                       once i finally got this correctly seasoned  the pan is amazing  there is a lot of conflicting information on how to season cast iron in general  with what seems like a bunch of  science  explanations that are bs  after reviewing various instructions online and trying a few things  here is exactly what i did to finally get it right    by hand  sand the pan down using     grit sand paper  just to get the major bumps off  probably     of the bottom of the pan was still black when i finished  many people say not to sand cast iron as a mirror finish won t take seasoning well  but it would appear that higher end pans have additional processing done after casting such as machining or polishing sanding  lodge doesn t seem to do anything to the pan other than season it after it is cast  so my sanding probably brought it down to similar roughness to higher end pans    rubbed with a light coating of bacon grease and let sit upside down in a     degree oven for    minutes  this resulted in an even  sticky amber coating on the pan    since the amber coating did not appear to be a fully formed season  i put it on the stovetop on high for a few minutes  the pan smoked a lot until the coating turned black  this was finally the season i was looking for    let it cool then rubbed it with bacon grease again and just cooked it on the stove this time on high  for probably    minutes  again  until it stopped smoking and the coating turned black  this was just to make the coating thicker      
350,5.0,                       ive been wanting one of these cast iron pans for awhile but hesitated because of how heavy they are  finally decided to try this one  so happy with it so far  takes awhile to season but after that  its a great pan  best thing is to never wash these with soap  i seasoned it cooking bacon  now it works so well and i don t even have to use butter on my grilled cheeses  my mac and cheese turned out so yummy in this  so simple to clean with a paper towel and some water  great pan even if i can barely lift it      
351,2.0,                       cute  but thought i would be able to bake apples in them  iffy  certainly not individual meatloafs i ll keep  but would have to be horrible for me to return  seldom do  they were packed really badly   good thing cast iron  hugh box for small items  bought    then  l little blowup pouches liked the picture delivery took of the package on my porch  probably not necessary in a gated community  i ve been here    years and one golf cart has been stolen      
352,2.0,                       these are not worth your money  they have a rough finish  and so food sticks to them   and they become quite gunked up during cooking  i put a piece of salmon on mine with a nice layer of seasoning  and when i tried to flip the salmon  i lost the spice layer that had been face down  which pretty much ruined the meal  these are inexpensive and will last a lifetime  but if you re going to be cooking saut ed veggies  rice  or any kind of meat  you re going to wish that you had something nicer      
353,5.0,                       what can i say  i am obsessed with this pan  i absolutely love it and i m frustrated when i have forgotten to clean it right away because i can t immediately use it  i cook everything in this  steak  eggs  veggies  ragout  it s so versatile and i love being able to go from stovetop to oven without any real thought says it s pre seasoned but that s a lie  no such thing as a pre seasoned cast iron pan  i recommend using flax seed oil for a solid  shiny seasoning  it s really inexpensive at walmart and i ve barely used any of the bottle i bought despite having had this pan for months now  i bought it when i had a different pan i accidentally left behind at my old place of residence  i like that the other handle has finger loops  makes gripping it with a potholder much easier  i would still suggest getting a leather or silicone sleeve to cover the main handle for safety  just remember to remove it if you stick it in the oven no complaints  this is a great product      
354,5.0,                       well i bought this five years ago and figured it s probably time to write a review   up until last year it was my only pan  i cooked fish  pizza  sauces  meats  eggs etc   about a year ago it started having sticking issues  i fought with it on and off trying to get it to reseason   i finally fixed it yesterday and had scrambled eggs sliding around better than a nonstick panissues  smoking is a problem  it heats up real hot and the oils you add start smoking  sucks if you don t have great ventilation which is us   so i had a lot of trouble getting a reseason as i cant use the oven to do it without filling the house with burnt oil smell   there doesn t seem like to be a way around this unless you have a grill or good ventilationi used my charcoal grill fired up to    f for three hours after scouring the pan and put on  thin layers of flax oil every    mins   this morning it was better than our non stick pan which is definitely seeing its end of days after one year of use  so after five years it s like brand new which is exciting   that s something you just can t do with other pans   i ha e no doubt it ll last my lifetime as long as i don t temperature shock it      
355,5.0,                       wife and i used this iron skillet for a camping trip in mendocino  ca  this past  th of july weekend  it worked great for cooking meat  bacon   and eggs  only thing that we didn t like was the cleaning aspect of it because it was tough to scrub  we re not sure if there was a specific technique or step that was needed prior to using the skillet such as pre oiling the skillet before use  i think that would have been important to do before cooking on it  but overall  it served its purpose that weekend  and we will be using the same iron skillet in our next trip      
356,3.0,                       i love lodge products and have used my other size skillets for years  however after receiving this one i am not impressed first  the skillet i received is not a     inch skillet and even says   on it second  the skillet i received has a large pit in the side  and scrape marks where it is cleare a grinder was used to shape it  the problem with the hole is it is big enough to be noticeable  but small enough that you won t be able to get all the moisture out after washing  and may be a potential rust spot unfortunately  i live overseas so the effort of returning it for exchange is not worth the effort  but i don t know if i will order any more cast iron products i can t see first      
357,5.0,                       we thought cast iron might be hard but after the first   uses this is our fried egg pan and anything else  no kidding  eggs   and   were rough but by the third seasoning they slide around better than teflon and it s not possible to damage the surface   this is our second lodge cooker  griddle grill was     grilled shrimp skewers  steaks and tuna are easy  and we just purchased the dutch oven  everything has exceeded our expectations great price and made in the united states      
358,5.0,                       funny story  late one night i thought i would buy a small cast iron skillet for baking chocolate chip cookies  well i thought i was buying a    pan but when this little    one arrived i had quite a laugh  i use it daily as a cute spoon rest  could use for baking individual items but i think one will be enough for me  lol     
359,5.0,                       i was looking to replace my tramontina     nonstick fry pan which was getting old and the nonstick had lost it effectiveness after almost   years even though i used it only occasionally  i like a big pan for family meals or when you just need the room such as making multiple pancakes in the same pan  nonstick teflon pans are simple to use but they are not made for high heat and the nonstick coat will only last for a few years then it needs to be replaced  i mainly use a large pan for braising or frying meats and vegetables and sometimes adding sauces to them once cooked  like when i cook chicken thighs until browned and then drain oil and add teriyaki sauce to finish the dish  i was going to get another nonstick pan but i have recently started using my cast iron pans more so i decided to get the        lodge skillet at under     it is a fantastic deal  i was happy with the size  but beware it is a very heavy pan so my wife can only move it with two hands  cast iron requires care and knowing how to wash and prevent staining and rust  a few extra steps will keep it great shape and you will have a pan that last decades i have also seen people doing extreme re seasoning on these pans to make the sandy texture perfectly smooth on the cooking surface  they are stripping or sanding these pans down  my experience after using this pan for many meals is that it works great  and there is no need to go to the trouble of resurfacing it  what i did was wash the pan thoroughly when i received it with warm water and dish soap  this is the only time dish soap is required  and then put it on a medium flame to finish drying it for a few minutes  while it is still warm  carefully  add buzzywaxx or crisbee seasoning all over the pan in a  very very thin coat   put your pan in the oven for   hour at     degrees and let cool afterward in the oven for another hour  once the pan is cool put a very thin coat of canola oil on it  and your pan is ready to store or cook with  it should be nonstick for the most part but you have to some cooking skills to properly use the pan in accordance with the food your cooking  after cooking just use hot water and a soft brush to clean thoroughly  dry pan and heat on a medium heat until completely dry and let the pan cool then apply a very thin layer of canola oil before storing it   i have cooked eggs  pancakes  meats with sauces  french fries  country potatoes  fajita steak etc    and i have had no problems with cooking or sticking  just great food and a pan that will last forever      
360,2.0,                       the surface of the   inch pan i received was semi decent  half of it is smooth  he other half a little course  this did not bother me  the pan will smooth out with constant use and reseasoning  the reason i will return this is the rough burrs that were still attached to the hole by the handle  disappointed in lodge recently  i don t understand why the outside of their pan is smoother than the inside  the chinese seem to be catching up to lodge as far as quality goes  i ve puchased   pieces of other brands  camp chef  bayou classic  king kooker  that are comparable to lodge quality and had no defects     
361,5.0,                       lodge is a known name for cast iron skillets   other cast iron cooking units cleaning is not a problem or hard if you follow simple basic described rules or go online for experts advice  i have been using lodge for years and decided tpadd another to my kitchen i finish mine with kosher salt using a soft sponge to swrl it around  to get any small particlesstill evident  then rinse out  then use pam spray  in the skillets   reheat for   minuteson high  wipe it out  it seems like a lot but truly is not one skillet is always on grill ready to go      
362,2.0,                       i have several lodge skillets  use them all the time  when i saw the      mini skillet for    i thought why not   i could make a quick breakfast in it  toss in an egg  maybe some hashbrowns  a little meat and viola  instant meal   not  you d be lucky to fit an extra large grade a egg in this thing  it s that small   the best this could this could possibly be used for is a poached egg  there s no adding anything extra to this   you could cook a cupcake in it i suppose but then what would you do with all the extra batter   seriously  it s that small   sorry to say i can t recommend this at all  i ll just have to use my other lodge skillets if i want a quick single serving meal      
363,5.0,                       saddest day  this was my first cast iron skillet and i let it rust by accident  thankfully  the lodge website has a little  how to restore rusty cast iron skillet  page  i scrubbed it clean with soap and water and coated it with oil and it looks brand new again  phew  it s definitely a great quality skillet for anyone considering to buy one      
364,5.0,                       this is a great little cast iron skillet  it heats evenly and quickly  and cleans up beautifully  the food doesn t stick to it at all   i just seasoned it before using it the first time  and then  after each use  season it again with either olive or vegetable oil after washing and drying it  seasoning  for those who are new to this  is just putting a small amount of oil inside the pan and spreading it around with a paper towel or napkin to give it a light coating   that s it   the cast iron is fine on your corelle cook top  it does not scratch or damage the cook top  i know because that is the cook top i have   this       inch size is perfect for   or   eggs  a toasted cheese sandwich  a pork chop  etc   or for cooking and sauteing things to be added to other dishes you may be preparing  i couldn t be happier with this lodge iron skillet  i bought this small size to give cooking with an iron skillet a try  and now i am sold on them  i plan to buy another in the     or larger size but will only buy the lodge because it has proven to be great for me   there is a hint of iron taste at first  but that is one of the reasons for an iron skillet   adding iron to your diet  that taste has dissipated with use  though  but you still have that iron added to your food   price  amazon always has the best prices  i don t think this is returnable though  you may want to check that if you prefer that option   at the price i paid as an add on item of a little over     i wasn t concerned about that   happy i bought it      
365,1.0,                       i am disappointed with this lodge pan that i purchased from amazon in august       i followed all of the directions for using it   i even used organic flaxseed oil on it  as recommended by cook s illustrated   my old    inch lodge responds well to the flaxseed oil treatment  but it doesn t seem to have the same effect on this new eight inch pan  after just four months of use  my eight inch pan is half rusted and half  almost rusted   see photo  i m wary of buying lodge pans now   i wonder if this is a genuine lodge pan  i feel as if i wasted my money      
366,5.0,                       i m southern so love me some ham hocks with beans and cornbread  that said  i purchased this cast iron skillet      to bake cornbread and it did not disappoint   my cornbread turned out perfectly moist with crusty edges  i received exactly what i ordered from a trusted name in cast iron products and at a great price  very happy with this purchase      
367,2.0,                       i had to replace my wonderful cast iron skillet i had been using for about    years  i dropped it and it broke  i bought this one by lodge and overall it s  ok  but it is not ideal  the skillet surface is rough and no matter what i do food sticks to it very badly and is quick to burn  forget about scrambling eggs or frying something because it always  always sticks  i suppose i will be returning this and buying something that i can see before i actually purchase  the surface needs to be smooth and i am not sure if that is something that happens over time or if it should be smooth to begin with  i don t recall with my old skillet unfortunately  because it was handed down to me by my mom and it was given to my mom by my grandmother  i m disappointed      
368,1.0,                       upon opening  i did noticed a flaw   skillet  like a crack was  rubbed out    did everything right on glass top   turned heat up a bit but noticed the skillet was cracked with a max opening of     inch   went to look at the other and you could see the crack already   both shipped in huge box together   went back to kitchen and  once the heated skillet had cooled  crack was     gone   i would maybe have noticed the crack in the unheated skillet  but i had purchased over      worth of lodge items      total cooking items  tripod  and handle gloves  all lodge   wanted lodge for quality      
369,1.0,                       when this lodge product arrived with a chip  it is hard to give it anything but a one star  it did arrive so one star  i added a photo and it may not seem like a lot but when cast iron has this flaw we all know that nothing but rust follows it  no matter how well oiled it is kept  i m also going to knock amazon because a     skillet came in a   x   x   box with no covering  no packing peanuts  plastic or even brown paper  just a skillet in a huge box  i can t rate the other items for star ratings because i haven t used the product and i m thinking about sending it back  if i m forced to rate it because it won t accept submit i will give it one star for not being able to bypass      
370,1.0,                       my first lodge purchase was a cast iron pot that i loved  it came pre seasoned and has never given me any issues in the two or three years i ve had it  this supposedly came pre seasoned too  and since getting it a little over a month ago  i ve seasoned it myself several times  i don t know why food sticks to it so badly  my pot has never had the issues my skillets have  i have lost so much food to this skillet from it sticking or burning and spent hours scrubbing and re seasoning  it s infuriating  apparently quality control has tanked since buying my pot a couple of years ago  i ll be looking into other companies to buy my cast iron from and would recommend future buyers do as well      
371,5.0,                       nothing made of cast iron heats evenly  and you do have to be careful when you clean and dry cast iron cookware   that said  i oiled and baked mine a few times when i first got it  and now it is virtually non stick   there is nothing like cast iron for baking cornbread and i can sear anything in it beautifully once it heats up   i prefer it to a non stick skillet for bacon and eggs in the morning  it will sear pork chops beautifully  deglazes easily to make a great pan sauce  and it usually wipes clean with just a damp cloth   i put it back on a burner or in the still warm oven after washing it to be sure it is dry and it stays in great shape   it is the most versatile skillet i own   you just need to work with the quirks that go with using cast iron      
372,2.0,                       got this pan for christmas  first cast iron pan i have owned and requested based on its great reviews   i have not used it  so not sure how it cooks   hand washed the pan last night let it sit on dry mat and woke up to rust spots everywhere   both inside the pan  and under  not about to cook with rust   will return      
373,5.0,                       amazing  it cooked a perfect fried egg on first use  all i did was   take the label off     wash with water     preheat on low medium for   minutes  i tested with a     tsp butter to see if burns      cook on medium heat    put butter in the pan     place egg right on top of butter or oil     fried egg   i had to loosen the egg up with spatula and it loosened easily and the egg was able to freely slide around the pan     flipped over and fried to medium     put on plate and enjoyed a perfect egg  first time no stuck egg  washed with water  dried well  put small amount of oil  i used cast iron oil i bought on amazon   rub like you want all oil off  that s it  that oil is awesome  too amazed      
374,5.0,                       if you haven t already taken the leap into cast iron you should think about it   first off the pan is cheap  durable and generally non stick   does this mean nothing will stick to this pan   no but if you have the right temperature and use the right amount of fat oil when cooking and take care of this pan it will take care of you   i would say this pan excels at proteins first and foremost   i have cooked bacon  eggs and pancakes right after one another and nothing stuck to this pan   i would say vegetables are also a favorite in this pan as well because of the great flavor this pan helps create through the oil and char you can achieve with this pan if you are the type of person that cooks and then puts the pans in the sink for a later time then cast iron might not be for you but i have left this pan in a sink for a few hours or on the stove top overnight and cleaned the next day so it is worth a shot   if you are the type of person who lets pans soak in water overnight or puts them immediately into a dishwasher for cleaning then this pan is definitely not for you unless you are willing to make an exception with this pan did i have immediate success with this pan right away   no i didn t   i had food stick and i had issues with cleaning the pan and reasoning the pan and had to look for advice on the internet to solve my issues because not many people use cast iron so i couldn t ask them some of my mistakes were simple ones to make as i have always used either stainless steel or non stick pans   i didn t wait long enough for the pan to heat up   take it easy and heat this pan up on medium before you start cooking   don t think this amount of iron will be hot in   minutes   you may need to wait    minutes to get this pan heated evenly but i would say put the pan on the heat before you start your prep   the next issue is using enough oil   you don t need a ton of oil but you should use a healthy amount   if you are frying then yea sure use a ton of oil but generally your food doesn t need to be swimming in oil but coat the bottom of the pan   i would advise against using black pepper on your steak if searing   the high temps will burn the pepper causing smoke and burnt flavor on your steak   you are better off using just salt before cooking and fresh cracked pepper afterwards   acidic food like tomatoes are okay in the pan but make sure you have a well seasoned pan   i would stay away from sauces but cut up tomatoes in the pan for your first few uses should be fine   you need to build a good layer first before tackling sauces   this pan excels at bacon and frying so if you are in the mood to do either this pan will be your best friend   the pan is shallow so it isn t meant for deep frying but i have done fish and chicken where i had to flip and it worked great also take care of this pan   scrub it down with soap and water   yes you can use soap i do all the time but i also rinse thoroughly and dry immediately over heat and spread another thin  thin  thin layer of oil on it too   every other month or so i give it a good scrubbing and then apply a light coat of oil and stick in a     degree oven  upside down for an hour or so and then turn off the oven and let it cool   this adds additional seasoning to the pan   you can overseason the pan which i have done and all i did was heat  scrub  wash which eliminated most of the excess seasoning   a salt scrub can help as well or if you really are in the weeds you can get a more aggressive scour pad and remove all the seasoning and start from scratch   shouldn t take more than    minutes to strip and then dry   the time in the oven will be what takes the most time but at that point its set and forget   you just need multiple layers so it will need a lot of oven time like   hours or more depending on your diligence the best advice is keep cooking and don t be afraid to experiment  keep the temperature lower than you think you need and don t rush the food it will be done when it is done      
375,5.0,                       i ve owned the bigger one for a few years and enjoy it but it is heavy  a little hard to handle  the     is more manageable  i am enjoying the art of skillet cooking and it is pretty cool  in many ways the best  still trying to perfect the cleaning  but enjoying it  it is amazing and true  the skillet develops a non stick surface over time  in fact  the best      
376,2.0,                       i wanted to love this cast iron skillet  but everything about it has been wrong   i followed the instructions and oil down the pan for first use  but everytime i have attempted to make something in my skillet the food sticks to the bottom  i am very disappointed   i even brought the metal net to clean the pan  that didn t work well  i brought this pan to use as my main cooking pan  know i now i should have done more research      
377,3.0,                       i bought the    inch pan when it was on sale wanting something larger than my old   inch pan  when i received the pan i was disappointed to find the pan is tiny  apparently the pan is measured from the top of the lip of the pan and not the actually cooking surface  my old   inch pan actually has a bigger cooking surface than this    inch  pan  i would say it might have a   inch cooking surface that would probably be good for a couple of eggs but you couldn t fit full size bacon in it or even   chicken breasts      
378,3.0,                       this is a big skillet  be sure you want to go this big  i m single  so i ll rarely need this size  the cute little red handle cover   well  i m not impressed  bottom line  whatever i may have used this for  i ll probably still use my big crock pot  and it has a lid  walmart has these same lodge items   at better prices  update  same day    i just checked my recent walmart flyer  and ordered   skillets  made by lodge  that i can use  for     less that the     i paid for this one  that is too big for my oven    returning this one due to high price  update    oct   i started the return process  was given the options to refund or exchange  opt d to refund  they re charging me      to return it   wonder what if i exchanged it  walmart has this exact same skillet for         it s a  no brainer   even when it s costing me      amazon  i m not very happy with you tonight       oct   i may just keep it      
379,5.0,                       i love cast iron  as well as stainless steel  and i ve finally tossed all of my teflon aluminum non stick pans  i trust lodge stuff  yes  these new lodge pans have a sandpaper like cooking surface  unlike smooth old milled out wagner grissy  but that doesn t mean they can t be non stick  i bought this new lodge last week and it is already non stick  i fried eggs and made swedish pancakes in it yesterday  the trick is to season the thing properly and cook at medium temperatures  i don t trust the lodge pre seasoning because it s filmy and leaves residue  so i remove it using my ovens self clean process  then i wash the pan with soap  dry it  heat it  then start the seasoning process with cooking oils      degrees then oil  wipe off      degrees  or above whatever your oils smoke point is  for one hour  let cool  repeat and cook on medium heat  hot pan cold oil if you must have a smooth surface because you don t like the scraping sound from your spatula touching the lodge  then there s always that stripping pad and   inch stick on sanding pads for your drill    less than    minutes of work and your lodge will be smooth as a baby s boo boo i have wagner griswold old pans and the lodge  at    to     on sale  is so worth it  the lodge can be non stick and smooth at fraction of price with no wobble or spinning      
380,3.0,                       this is a great     cast iron skillet  but for one factor   the handle is too small   both too narrow and too short   with something this heavy  even with the  handle holder   it s very hard to lift hold and maneuver  especially when it s hot  plus  no lid  if i d had any history using cast iron ware  i would not have ordered this model      
381,5.0,                       i have wanted a cast iron skillet for some time  i carefully read about each one before choosing and am so glad i went with lodge  after reading about the history of it  i knew it had to be the right one  it s a great pan  i am still working on getting it seasoned but i am really enjoying it  even thought i read that most recipes are for     i felt the     would be best for me since i often have guests  i really don t think it will be difficult to adjust the recipes  just a change in length of cooking time      
382,5.0,                       doing a lot of home cooking lately  and many recipes recommend using a cast iron skillet   decided to give it a try and checked amazon to see what was available   saw this        lodge being sold for     and ordered one   glad i did  it has become my go to pan for most of my cooking and frying   this is a heavy well made heat holding skillet   yes  many of the negative things you read about cast iron cookware are true  it s heavy  requires seasoning   specific washing  and maintenance before storing   but to me the pans performance makes it all well worth it   once you get into caring for c i it becomes second nature this pan comes pre seasoned  but i gave it two hot oven seasoning sessions before it was put to work   then first uses were for frying chicken  bacon  and then french fries which helped to build on the initial coatings  you can find a lot of good info online regarding caring for  and cooking on c i   don t be concerned about this pans stippled finish   when  you apply a couple of initial seasoning coats the finish doesn t have any effect at all on your cooking   i highly recommend this skillet      
383,5.0,                       you can t go wrong with lodge  i see a lot of comments about people getting upset about rust  but honestly i think a lot of that comes from not knowing how to properly care for cast iron  i know people get huffy and say they know what they are doing  but they usually don t  this little pan is awesome  we did a skillet cookie and it cooked evenly and perfectly  i seasoned it when it first came and have used it several times since  it it still has a beautiful black sheen  don t bother buying cast iron if you are not going to do the research of properly caring for it      
384,5.0,                       comes  pre seasoned  ready to use after a light washing  i especially like the side handle so it can be handled more safely than my antique cast iron skillet with one handle only  after i sauteed chicken in the skillet  overcooked it  too   i had to soak it overnight   then after washing and drying it  noted a few rust spots   no problem    just spritzed a bit of cooking oil and rubbed it all around both inside and outside  wiped it dry with a paper towel  and voila  ready to hang up  til next use   couldn t be easier than that  i have the     skillet also  but will be gifting that to my daughter  as it s really too heavy for me to handle      
385,5.0,                       this has quickly become one of my favorite pans   i use it frequently to make a single serving of tahdig   love it it s annoying to clean sometimes if the rice gets really stuck  so i have to re season often   that s more of a learning curve with cast iron than a defect on the actual product      
386,5.0,                       make sure you have an idea what     inches really looks like  i didn t think much about it and didn t pay attention to the size thinking that it s just a small skillet like the one i have  this one is really tiny   but it still works for me as i got it for cooking for my toddler who has low iron  otherwise great quality cast iron made in usa     
387,5.0,                       lodge products are my favorite   this skillet was lager than i visioned but it is perfect for what i need   i cook for   other people in my house so when i make fried chicken i can fry    legs or    chicken breasts  it also is great for baking a whole chicken in the oven  a full roast   overall  everything i have ever purchased from lodge has exceeded my expectations   i will not ever use cast iron from another manufacturer  with out a doubt  the best      
388,4.0,                       no complaints with the pan at all   it s great handle sleeve is clearly too thin  and even with proper placement over the flame  that sleeve gets too hot to grab normally when you use the pan for a reasonable amount of time lodge that s dangerous and odd to do for a great company like you  pplease either stop forcing us to buy these   things together  so that we can buy your other  good silicone handle protector which does workorsupply it with your good protector you sell separately      
389,5.0,                       this cast iron skillet keeps the temperature high  great for searing protein i made fried fish with it  and it works perfectly   the thing you need to remember is that before adding oil and meat  you will need to preheat the skillet  it came pre seasoned so less maintenance required  however you still need to clean it up right after it cools down and dry it on the stove before storing it  it can be a little bit high maintenance      
390,5.0,                       i purchased this skillet and then immediately fell down the rabbit hole of internet forums telling me that the surface would be too rough to be nonstick and i should have shelled out     for antique skillets because everything new is awful seriously  don t listen to that noise do i wish this thing were a bit smoother  sure  but truthfully  it doesn t seem to be making a big difference either way  last night i cooked pancakes and tonight i fried an egg   nothing stuck  nothing  as for quality  it is super heavy duty and came with no cracks  scratches or defects   you will not be disappointed in this regard  also  notice that most of the bad reviews of this pan all happened around the same time with the same complaint   it was just a bad batch  and it was a long time ago  seriously  this is a quality product have reasonable expectations  this is not teflon and you absolutely need to use some sort of oil while cooking with it   actually  i always found that to be the case with teflon as well   but hopefully you get my meaning   but  with a thin layer of oil this thing will perform as hoped   and seriously  don t fear oil   dietary fat is not generally bad for you like we were once led to believe  certainly not in the quantities needed to make this pan work wonders  edited to add  if this is your first time trying to achieve a non stick cooking experience without non stick  teflon  cookware  do a bit of googling around because there is a method to make it work  you have to first heat the pan to the correct temperature  so that water dances across the surface   not sizzling  too cool  or instant evaporation  too hot   and then add the oil  and then the food  with foods like eggs or chicken breasts  you have to then leave them alone for a while    if you attempt to flip too early  it will stick  when the food is cooked sufficiently on that side it will  let go   experiment and don t give up too soon      
391,5.0,                       i do not regret buying this item  cooking food is easy now  i don t have food sticking as often as i did before  i love this skillet so much  i purchased another one from the same brand in a bigger size  it does take a lot of care  easy to do  but not if your inpatient like me  this is not the kind of pan you let soak in water  mine rusted a bit  but that was my own doing for not following the care instructions it comes with  but it was easy to restore      
392,5.0,                       i just got it today  first  i seasoned it again because someone online said the preseason is for stain resistance  not non sticky   the process is as follow  spoiling water to get rid of possible unknown residual   then  used baking soda to wash it thoroughly  next  using a wet tissue to clean it  i found out that the tissue turned dark brown during wiping  i used three tissues to wipe until the tissue turn yellow then almost no color after  last  i used a dry tissue to dip some oil to cover outside and inside  put it into oven     f   heat for   hour  it was ready to use  second  i put some oil in  put some dumpling in it to fry  it was very nice  tasted better than my nonstick pan  after that  i cut several pieces of pork  just have some salt and white pepper on  put it into the skillet  the taste was very good  i fried scrambled eggs after  and it was not sticky at all  i like it very much of course  it is not as non sticky as  nonstick pan  but it is healthier      
393,1.0,                       i bought this skillet a little while ago and i was surprised how rough the surface finish was  it felt like sandpaper  given all the positive reviews  i was expecting higher quality  after some research i found instructional videos on how to grind these lodge skillets smooth  but who has time for that  i found two other american producers of cast iron that come with a smooth finish right out of the box  stargazer and finex  the finex looks interesting but i went with the stargazer because it s fully machined at half the price  seems like i made the right call  the design is great  the surface finish is super smooth  and it cooks like a champ  if you re reading this review  do yourself a favor and pass on the lodge  go with the stargazer instead  it s well worth the investment      
394,1.0,                       i don t know if i got a defective one or not but it s horrible  i looked up online  in these comments  per instructions how to clean this pan and i do so accordingly  i have done everything correctly and according to instructions but everything sticks  ive only used this a handful of times and whether is use a ton of oil or none the pan is completely dry and everything sticks to it  i have ruined several dishes due to this and i m scrubbing like crazy  no soap  and oil it after  still horrible  returning      
395,5.0,                       great product  i almost did not buy it because i thought it too was small to be usefel  i bought it along with the lodge   quart serving pot because the same lid fits both  i have been pleasantly surprised  i have used it often  after careful seasoning after receiving it has become my go to pan for sunny side up eggs for   or    i heat it slowly while i cook my breakfast potatoes in my    inch lodge  spray liberally with cooking spray and put in   to   eggs and cover  a few minutes later over a low heat you have     perfect eggs  i often do omelets in it this   inch is perfect for cornbread  a recipe with   cup of flour cornmeal or just cornmeal fits pefectly   i usually do two at a time  i just got my third   inch skillet  i will be using all   at once for an upcoming family function   cup cornmeal    tsp baking powder    tsp baking soda      tsp salt    tbs sugar    cup buttermilk    egg    tbs oil  preheat the skillet with the oven  melt a couple of tbs of butter in the skillet  spray with cooking spray  in the oven at     for about    minutes or a little less  let cool in the skillet for at least half an hour  some cheese and green chilies in the batter are optional  but a good addition as with all iron  always preheat    that is even more important than seasoning to limit sticking  even though it comes with some seasoning give it at least   coats of additional seasoning  never cook at too high a temperature unless you need to sear for most dinner dishes i transfer the food into a serving dish and wash the piece with hot water and a brush andget it into an oven preheated to     degrees  i turn the oven off and eat  by the time it cools the piece or pieces are dry and sterile and the hardest cleanup done before i take my first bite of dinner      
396,5.0,                       what a nice thing this is  i m no stranger to lodge cookware and this little skillet doesn t disappoint  got this in mail this past week and was waiting to break into it over the weekend  came pre seasoned per the box but i seasoned it at home anyways fired it up and made a fat omelette with all the toppings etc  didn t have no bacon at home but threw in some onions  mushrooms  jalape os  cilantro  cheese and eggs  came out so nice  nothing stuck  gave it a quick rinse and good to go for next time  easy peasy  likely will get a lot of use in my kitchen  very happy camper considering how much i paid for it and how much use i ll get out of it      
397,5.0,                       i have been wanting a cast iron fry pan for a long time  i have all non stick fry pans but love watching how the cast irons pans sear when a chef uses them on tv  i guess i was nervous about the  seasoning  aspect  but since my husband grew up with his mom using cast iron  he was sure it would be fine  i haven t looked back since i purchased this   no more freezing outside in the winter when trying to bar b q steak  i just pull out my cast iron pan  it s fairly easy to clean and season  the hubby does that   and i do love how it sears meats      
398,5.0,                       this little thing is so cute  we are ending up using it as a decoration until the spring because it is so small  we have other lodge cast iron pots   pans   use them regularly  after you get them seasoned   use them regularly they are easier to care for   we used to have some that we never used   they were harder to take care of not using them weekly   this little pan would fry one egg at a time but we dont have a burner small enough to use in the house  we may take it to the camper in the spring to use on the flat top blackstone  it would make a nice circular egg to put on a sandwich      
399,5.0,                       right off the bat  people should know this thing is small   it s advertised as       in  but that s across the top  and  actually  it s only       in    the base is only   in  so it won t even cover the small burners on an electric range   that being said  it s a great cast iron skillet   perfect for my two egg breakfast   i did use plenty of butter to fry them in  but who doesn t like butter  yes  bacon grease would even be better    and the little bit of egg that stuck to the bottom scraped off easily with my plastic spatula  this was the first time i used it  so as time goes by  there should be even less sticking    then a few drops of flaxseed oil rubbed over the pan  and done   the price was great  and it s made in the us   what s not to like      
400,5.0,                       comes in good condition maybe one thing to note is that  oil coating is important though lodge says it has already been done when you receive the product  i would still recommend you to do one or two times  i could be wrong but just from my personal experience   my pan got some black particles leaving behind after my first use  for cooking steak   and i need to really put some effort in order to remove such then i did twice oil coating  and it has not happened again so far for my     use      
401,5.0,                       update           still love this little pan  after only a few times cooking with it  it became well seasoned  didn t have to season it in the oven  as long as i have a little bit of fat coating it  my egg doesn t stick no matter how high the cooking temp  i ve used it nearly every day for months    the only thing i d improve upon it is to lengthen the handle  it s very short  so using an oven mit is unweildy  i don t handle the pan when hot  because if this  i just use a spatula or fork to carefully lift food from it original review this pan is the perfect size for one fried egg  with some cheese and an english muffin  you ve got the basic fixings of a great breakfast sandwich   used it for the first time this morning  it heated quickly and evenly comparable to a non stick pan of similar size  for reference  i cook my eggs over hard  i used butter as a grease fat and though there was some egg stuck to the bottom when i flipped it despite the good coating of butter  i think i only need to cook it at a slightly slower and lower setting to avoid that the next time  even so  the egg was easy to flip with a small rubber spatula      
402,4.0,                       we use this pan for everything except eggs  we ve had this one for quite a while now so i feel like i can give a longer term review  the biggest thing i don t like about this pan is that it didn t feel like it came sufficiently pre  seasoned  so we looked up some videos and instructions and did it  now it feels like the more we use the pan the better it gets  my husband and i both just love this thing  the only thing it doesn t seem to cook right is eggs  there seems to be a bit of a learning curve when it comes to cast iron  but once you figure it out  it s very enjoyable to cook on and the food comes out delicious tips on how we seasoned it  there are lots of opinions on which oil to use but we just went with plain ole vegetable oil  we made sure the pan was clean  then covered it with a thin layer of oil  we put it in the oven as preheated it until     degrees  once it came to temperature  we turned it off and just let the pan sit in there until it cooled  the goal is to  burn off  the oil  so bring it past the smoking point until it gets dry and hard on the pan  that s what makes it coat well  we did this   or   times  but the more you use it the better nonstick surface you ll have tips  don t wash with soap  it ll strip it  we purchased a chainmail scrubber that we love to use  seems to help smooth it out a little too  but that might be in my head  when i clean it i only use the scrubber and hot water  the more i use the pan the easier it gets to clean when you finish cleaning it  don t leave it wet  it ll rust  we just put it back on the stove with the burner on until it s dry  easy keep in mind that cast iron doesn t exactly heat evenly  but it holds heat well  this just means that you have to sufficiently preheat the pan before you use to ensure even cooking overall i love this pan  it just gets better every time i use it      
403,5.0,                       this is a quality item   in all honesty  this is my first cast iron pan   wanted to move away from non stick pans as much as possible as i suspect the chemicals that cook into your food over time aren t meant for humans in the longer run   anyway  this cooks so differently than what i ve always been used to   things don t burn as easily as they do with a non stick and everything cooks very evenly   cleanup is easy and you can use soap but i ve taken to filling the pan with water and leaving it on the stove for a few hours before gently cleaning it      
404,5.0,                       after using very expensive hard anodized skillets for years  so that i didn t have to use butter or oil   they started to fail  when i went to get a replacement because they were guaranteed for    years  or life depending on who i asked  i was asked if i had been using oil and subsequently told that even though they were hard anodized and didn t require oil  i should have been doing so  for health  nutrition reasons  i had started to use ghee about two years ago so i did some more research and decided to throw away the hard anodized  since it didn t stand up to what it says it does  and try cast iron this is the second lodge skillet i ve purchased  with the first  i didn t know what i was doing and i struggled  food stuck and clean up was a nightmare  since i no longer had the hard anodized to fall back on  i decided to really try with the new cast iron skillet  this one  by following recommendations i read on several websites for seasoning and cleaning  including buying a stainless steel enmeshed silicone sponge  scrapers and a scrub brush  now  everything is great   food no longer sticks  although some things do still leave a little residue  e g   scrambled eggs and salmon  and clean up is a breeze  i seasoned both skillets  bought the cast iron oil  which is really just flax seed oil i think  and put them through   seasoning cycles  and try to use both regularly  i clean them by rinsing with warm water immediately after cooking using the stainless steel sponge or brush  initially i was afraid the food would get cold  but the skillets clean in no time  then i dry them well and put them back onto the stove top or in the oven to let the residual heat dry off any remaining moisture  i ve read that rust can be a problem  the skillets do get hot and they hold the heat really well  so i ve had to learn to cook a little differently  but nothing has burned  yet anyway  i do use a little ghee every time and try to make sure that i get it into and up on the edges as it melts  the red silicone handle that comes with the skillet is great at protecting my hand from the heat although i am careful to have another potholder nearby when transferring the skillets to the sink to clean  this skillet is easily managed with one hand  but the original one i bought  which is larger  can wobble a bit due to its weight so two hands are needed i know this is long  but i was so afraid of cast iron before really learning about it and wanted to share my experience to help anyone else thinking the same i m so glad i made the switch  from what i ve read  it should get easier and easier to use as time goes by  it s my belief that s it s a healthier way to cook as well    and the browning on things like breakfast sausages is amazingly delicious        
405,5.0,                       just got this    inch to add to my   inch and    inch cast iron skillets this came preseasoned and i haven t had time to season it additionally   after using it for the first time last week and not having the hash browns stick to it at all i probably won t season it again anytime soon it s cast iron   its a skillet   know how to season it  know how to take care of it   if you don t want to take care of it by washing it properly  not putting it away dry  etc  then do not buy this because you will be very disappointed if  a cast iron pan ever rusts on you it s because you didn t take care of it i have opted against paying a few hundred dollars every  x amount of years to replace my non stick sets that always end up scratched and looking like crap   i like how i can crank the heat up as high as i want and not have to worry about overheating teflon and getting toxic fumes in my house   also cast iron can sear things that teflon pans fail miserably at   i have actually burned food in cast iron because you don t need it as hot as teflon pans most of the time     
406,2.0,                       my sister said this company makes really good cast iron wear at reasonable prices   i washed with soap   water and oiled before using per the instructions   epic fail   everything stuck to the pan   actually had to transfer the food to a different pan so i wouldn t waste the food  salmon    also  i saw a  chip      as you can see in the picture   will see if i can return or have it replaced   so disappointed      
407,5.0,                       cast iron will never go out of style  the hear retention in cast iron is amazing and the searing and browning is to perfection and with the larger      surface area for certain types of cooking it unbeatable  but here s one warning about this pan    this is a      cast iron pan    its very heavy    you go into it knowing that    so if you want to use this pan to pick up and pour things out of it can be challenging because of the size and weigh  it dose have a helper handle on the opposite end of the pan but if you need a free hand to scrape or push out what ever you have in the pan then you may need the help of another person  and being that its iron you don t want to wash it with soap and you should oil it after every use to keep the seasoning  i usually spritz the pan with some natural non stick cooking spray or coconut oil  wipe the excess with a paper towel and store it in the oven  but like i initially said  this is cast iron so you go into it understanding certain things the for lifting and pouring in particular you may want to use another pan for that meal     
408,5.0,                       beautiful  perfect size and a joy to cook with  it s taught me to be more responsible with my cookware and to be a better and more patient cook in my kitchen  i ve been unknowingly cooking at too high a heat for years now not understanding that low heat can still achieve a bubbling temperature on the stovetop if only given the time to get there  it s been over a month of cooking daily with this skillet and i love it  the satisfaction i get from caring for it is indescribable  each time i look upon it s glistening black surface i take pride in knowing i m winning at cast iron skilleting  a crowned achievement in my culinary journey for sure      
409,1.0,                       i ordered this because i have a smaller lodge cast iron pan for years which i love and wanted a larger one to complement   however four months after purchase as i was heating up olive oil on mediumhigh temp   while i was in the kitchen dicing garlic for it   i heard what sounded like a gunshot and found that the pan split in two   photo attached   unfortunately it s past the return date   i m disappointed because i had good experience with this product before and no explanation as to how a few minutes of heat could cause fracture  had to toss the pan      
410,5.0,                       i tried cast iron about    years ago when it all came unseasoned and i could never quite nail the seasoning thing  gave it all away but decided to try it again now that it comes pre seasoned  love it this time around  got this skillet and did do a bit of extra seasoning to it  flaxseed oil     degrees   hour twice  and then decided to give it a whirl   fried chicken with milk gravy made from the drippings  it came out perfect  the  brown stuff  left by the chicken lifted right off when i made the gravy  come clean up time i simply rinsed the pan under hot water and gave it a quick scrub with a brush  done and clean  wiped it dry and wiped it with some oil  done and ready for the next meal  i am absolutely blown away and will be purchasing additional pieces of cast iron in the future      
411,5.0,                       this was my first cast iron ever  boy am i glad i chose lodge  this is a perfect beginners skillet for those who want to learn the seasoning and cleaning process that cast iron demands         seems to be the perfect size for my cooking   seasoning seems to stay on well  it s built like a tank  no complaints here      
412,5.0,                       i ve been cooking on a     skillet but needed a bigger one  i ve used the heck out of this since getting it a month ago  even used it on a   burner coleman camping stove  this thing is awesome  cleans up very easily  if there was any complaint  it would be that it is very heavy  don t plan on using one hand to lift off the stove  especially with food in it  i got the silicon handle guard which i recommend also  but you will still have to grab both sides of the skillet to move it  but hey  its a skillet  its supposed to be heavy saw a few reviews where people complain about cleaning    well  its a skillet  you have to know how to properly clean it  some people complained it cracked  but i used that   burner coleman camp stove which was very uneven heating and no issues oh  did i mention it was heavy      
413,1.0,                       i thought i was getting it from amazon    but the package came from walmart and the refund is supposed to come from zdeals  that being said    some nasty brown stuff was poured all over the air bumpers  the skillet label and into the bowl of the skillet  i forgot to take a photo of the skillet before i tried seasoning it to see if it d come off and while the surface  stuff  came off afterwards    you could still see where it had been  since there was no identifying it    i have asked for a prepaid return label and can only hope they won t turn around and resell it to someone      
414,5.0,                       when our very old generic cast iron pan broke   a chunk of the side dramatically popped off   we immediately went to the dependable lodge cast iron products for a replacement  along with a very reasonable price we were able to take it out of the box  wipe it down and use it as it was preseasoned  of course repeated use will fine tune the surface  but it is holding up well to daily use and is lighter in weight that our old generic pan which is better for my arthritic hands  perfect  thanks      
415,5.0,                       i finally got serious about cooking my steaks and bought this lodge cast iron  as you may already know cast iron pans require seasoning before use where oil is heated on the iron at such a high temperature that it eventually adheres to the iron itself  providing a non stick surface that won t peel off like the teflon in non stick pans like you  i read most of the highly rated reviews before buying it  including the one by  joe bob  from florida  he noted that he cleaned it with a bit of soap before using it and the egg he tested with it stuck  i was worried that the pre seasoning wouldn t be substantial enough after reading his review and that i d have to re season it myself  this wasn t the case  i used a good bit of vegetable oil and cooked an egg on it just fine without sticking  so don t worry  the seasoning on the pan is more than adequate  however  i still use a small non stick pan for my eggs and the lodge for pretty much everything else because i find it easier to flip my eggs and don t want to use such a big heavy pan for one egg since getting the pan i ve cooked steaks with a crust that i though i could only get on my grill  i ve taken the pan camping where i tossed it on the fire to cook bacon  sausage  chili etc  and i ve grown to love how tough this thing is and how well it cooks  one drawback however  is that there is a bit more work in cleaning the pan than i d like  i usually put a bit of sea salt and water in the pan and scrub with a plastic brush then dry with paper towels before rubbing a bit of oil on it to store  the only other drawback is that i had to buy the lodge silicone handle for      so i could pick up this guy while its hot      
416,5.0,                       i wanted to get away from pfas laden teflon so i went back to the basics   cast iron   for my eggs every morning   this is the perfect size   i read another review that said they can t get eggs to come out right on this and i am thoroughly confused   my eggs are perfect every morning   you do need to use enough oil  especially at the beginning  and make sure it seasons appropriately   the description says it is pre seasoned but i find that it takes a few months to really get good   i still use a small amount of oil every day but much less than i used at the beginning   overall this is exactly what i was looking for and i love it      
417,5.0,                       cast iron is inherently not very good at heat distribution  but this is as good as any other iron if you know how to use cast iron  then this will be on par iron is great at thermal capacitance   this item has a sufficient quantity of iron to live up to standard surface is not smooth  but is smooth enough   way smoother than a couple chinese pieces i was given     made in the usa    buy it   this will last many lifetimes      
418,5.0,                       truth be told  my husband loves this more than i do lolits a great skillet  fits one egg  and leaves it shaped perfectly for an egg sandwich  i have  an electric stove  preheat the pan on a      butter generously  put on egg in and cover tightly with foil  reducing heat to a   and cooking for   minutes  the egg comes out perfectly cooked for him with a runny yolk  and you know what they say  happy husband  happy    he complains less about alll the things you buy on amazon  happy shopping ladies  p     
419,3.0,                       this lodge is a decent pan  though it has some issues  like other reviewers  i found that the initial black coating was uneven  or applied weirdly in some areas  secondly  the interior of the pan is way too rough to be truly non stick  the idea of non stick cast iron comes from the interior finish being smooth and seasoned  i ve felt lodge pans wherever i go  and they are all very rough on the interior  i took the roughness down with     grit then     grit sandpaper  then seasoned it twice  and now it s easy to use and works well  but this took me over two hours to sand alone in the end  i d opt for a vintage  turn of the century pan like a wagner on ebay   you ll pay a bit more for it  but it will be truly non stick  and you ll most likely be eating off a pan that cooked a meal for some burly pioneer dude      
420,5.0,                       please read the instruction  or go youtube on how to clean and care of cast iron before you buy   bought one years ago  ruin it and threw it away after it rusted   after reading and learning about it  bought another and  i been using it and love cooking with it   first few times  maybe like       it kinda stick   after it s broken in  nothing sticks and heat well distributed   i love it   neg   you have to kinda clean after cooking  got to wipe it dry without letting water on it   heavy as it s  cast iron      
421,1.0,                       i used this the first time and was extremely excited  however after my second use it had rust beginning in the middle of the pan  i followed instructions and oiled it down but no matter what the rust is there  very sad past date of return  i want to have a cast iron skillet but concerned buying same brand this will happen again        
422,5.0,                       very nice   i had not cooked on one of these since i was a kid   it arrived and while the one pound weight sounds kind of light  the pan is anything but that   good  heavy  solid  well made   very impressive   the gripper opposite the handle is a nice touch   not something my original pan had made in the usa   always nice   as far as cooking goes  the pan does heat up quickly so exercise caution there   i don t think i need the level of heat other pans require   the pan retains the heat   even after i turned off the burner  the pan remained quite warm for awhile   i would say it provides very even heating   of course  the handle gets quite warm and you ll need a holder but not a big a deal and certainly not scorching hot   you wouldn t want to carry the pan around for very long without a holder  though i cooked some potatoes  sausage  onions  and the like   i obtained the right browning desired   it seems to be great for that this is         by    so this takes up slightly more than the large burner on an electric stove   just the right size and the tall sides keep food in place while turning over the food   the bottom is very flat making for good contact with the coils cleanup was a snap   i may well expand my collection based upon this experience      
423,5.0,                       i figured out the joys of cast iron cooking way too late in my life   i bought my first cast iron skillet over    years ago  wagner s  and that thing never could get seasoned    so i never used it and thought i d never figured out the magic of cast iron   on a lark  though  i bought a small    lodge skillet on clearance at a local store   i fell in love with it and have been scooping up every lodge skillet that i can find ever since this is the latest addition to my collection   i now have   lodge skillets of varying sizes and i absolutely love every one of them   love the grip handle that comes with this one  too i ve seasoned all of these pans   others have said it and i will chime in   do not use harsh soap or abrasives on these pans   wash in warm hot water with a nylon scrubbie and just a squirt of mild dish soap and it s clean   sprinkle a bit of oil on it and wipe with a paper towel to keep it seasoned fyi   i ve found that if you sprinkle with the oil that you normally cook with  it picks up that oil flavoring in your cooking   that is  if you normally use the pan with olive oil  use olive oil to rub it with after cleaning  if you normally use canola or peanut oil  use those oils instead these are the only skillets i use   i had a full set of revere ware copper bottom skillets  with lids  in multiple sizes that i gave away because i never used them   lodge skillets are that good      
424,5.0,                       my husband is very hard on non stick skillets and was always buying replacements in the grocery store despite my telling him they were a waste of money   i didn t want him using my calphalon set  and urged him to buy cast iron to no avail   bought this for him for christmas and he s very happy with it   now he finally gets why cast iron is so versatile and economical in the long run  and nearly non stick when seasoned and cared for properly  quality product at a good price      
425,5.0,                       i love this cast iron  it took me to a whole new level of cooking  i was scared at first to purchase one bc i knew there was a lot to learn but it was so easy and so far it has worked great  the only downside side it is really really hard to clean with just salt  soap and water sometimes and it can get super smoky depending on what i m making but i love it       
426,5.0,                       this        lodge cast iron skillet was under     shipped   i don t care if you don t think the seasoning is perfect  or the shape isn t perfect or whatever   that is by far the best deal going on american made cast iron cookware yes  the cooking surface of the lodge is rougher than some of the other american made brands of cast iron   but it cost under       the next best price on american cast iron is near  or just over         take a little time to re season the lodge and it  too  will be just as smooth lodge cookware  for most people  is ready to go out of the box  aside from an initial washing    it s well made and it s durable   and nobody comes close to the price i have a cabinet full of lodge cookware  and i have some of the higher end pieces   when it comes down to it  the higher end stuff may look more pleasing but doesn t function any better than the lodge you can t go wrong with lodge cast iron      
427,5.0,                       after doing a lot of research i decided to go with the lodge cast iron and i am so satisfied with my decision   ive had it for a month and haven t had any issues with rust so far   i seasoned it when i first got it and take care of it by washing it without soap  drying it and putting it on the stove to make sure to get all of the moisture out before storing it   make sure to buy the silicone hot handle holder otherwise you re likely to burn yourself      
428,5.0,                       this skillet is awesome   very versatile   you can stir fry  broil and bake in this skillet   its pre seasoned so you don t have to oil it and bake it before you use it   it s ready to go right out of the box   cleaning is easy   just make sure you buy a lodge scrub brush to clean it with   after cleaning    dry it    then heat it up a little and pour about a tbs of  your favorite cooking oil    spread it around with a paper towel covering the sides too  just be careful  because this skillet gets hot and retains the heat for a while   you might need a couple of dinners to get the feel of it because it heats up fast      
429,4.0,                       it came with the silicon heat resistant handle cover  works okay if you are pushing the pan around on the burner  it really doesn t do the job for moving the pan or pouring off liquids tipping contents into a another pot container since the handle sort of rotates inside the holder since it came with the pan it isn t a huge deal  would not recommend it as a solo purchase  heat resistant gloves  or even oven mitts  would be a better purchase both for versatility and for the specific task      
430,5.0,                       this is my first cast iron skillet and i am overall very happy  it s not really preseasoned that well  i still had to rub oil and heat it until the oil started smoking  i ve used it   times now  i oil everytime after use  cleaning is easy  while the pan is hot  throw a cup of water and use a scrub brush made for cast iron skillet  all the food comes off and you have a clean skillet without any elbow grease involved      
431,5.0,                       i ve been using this skillet for a couple of weeks now  and it s been working great  after opening it  i immediately went to season it   it s pre seasoned  but doing it yourself makes it work that much better   i coated it in crisco  put it in the oven       for an hour  and then left it in the oven to cool  i tested it the next day to cook chicken for a stir fry  and   i had some trouble with the chicken sticking  much to my dismay  i didn t give up  however  and went to make stir fry again the next day  and nothing stuck  maybe it just had to be broken in a little  but i have had zero issues since and have used it for bacon  eggs  stir fry  burgers  mac and cheese  pancakes   it really is a jack of all trades pan  and i like that i don t have to worry about damaging it like with teflon coated pans  and it s super sturdy  and not too heavy to move around when needed  i highly recommend this product  as a cast iron is pretty much a must own      
432,5.0,                       i ve been looking at cast iron pans for a while so when i saw this one  i thought i d give it a try  this is the first cast iron pan i ve ever used and was unfamiliar with how to properly care for cast iron  the first time using it  the food stuck like glue so i left it to soak overnight  yes  gasp  it had started rusting already and i felt like such a beginner  but  i found the directions for how to re season it i it and educated myself on the proper care and now after just a few times of using this pan it s perfect  i absolutely love this pan  heats evenly  food tastes great and it s so versatile    and cleaning is easy as long as i clean it when it s hot  i love the silicon handle too   makes lifting so much easier and safer  i purchased the     and will be getting     as well      
433,4.0,                       honestly  this is a good pan and i got it at a great price  i kind of regret getting the   inch one because it is much bigger and heavier than expected  but would be good to prepare foods for larger gatherings  the reason i won t give it the full   stars is because this did not come properly preseasoned  food stuck to the bottom and the sides so i will have to season it myself      
434,2.0,                       not sure if it is a bad batch they have or what  normally lodge pans are great and arewhat i use for most everything  i ordered one    in skillet and it had a big clump of goop on the edge  when it was removed it was missing a bit of coating and looked rusty  so i ordered a replacement  got the replacement quickly  however  the same spot has a missing piece that is rusty  another chip  and just a messed up edge in general  while i could season the edge and fix the issue  i ll just save my effort  return both  and go to the store to get one that way i can be sure i am starting my pan in good condition      
435,5.0,                       i wanted a big skillet  and this is definetly big   i d read some complaints about the rough interior of lodge pans  but it hasn t seemed to affect my cooking at all   compared to some higher end cast iron  it has a more pebbled surface  but that is just the remnant of the casting process   i ve been using my for a couple weeks  and it is building a nice seasoning   i ve had minimal stickingor burning so long as i m cautious about how hot i keep the pan one word of caution about this pan is that it is almost too big for a standard coil stove   it will heat up  but you end up with an inner  hot  ring and an outer  cool ring    you have to keep moving the food around   it works much better on a larger outsider burner   this would be perfect for an outside chicken fry   this is simply because the pan hangs out over the coils by about   inches on either side      
436,1.0,                       one of the worst products i ve ever got  i had to throw it away after the first time i tried to cook and egg  i say tried because it took forever and never got cooked   i read the instructions and wash it with soap and water  even though i would never do that in a cast iron  and after scrubbing for more than    minutes i gave up  worst quality ever      
437,5.0,                       i have been looking for a skillet that was the perfect size for two people  enchiladas in an oversized skillet is no bueno   this cast iron dream is great  and for the price  you really cannot beat it  super heavy duty  make sure to season the skillet prior to use  as it will get rusty otherwise immediately after you use it  if you don t know how to season a skillet  here are some skillet seasoning skills i shall bestow upon you  scrub it in hot water with dish soap towel dry  do not air dry  spray it with vegetable oil   just a little  enough to cover it wrap it in tin foil  turn upside down and onto the rack in your stove at     for    minutes let it cool you are seasoned      
438,5.0,                       do not hesitate     get it   its been an amazing pan    for the price     it can easily go into the oven without any problems  i originally bought to make cornbread      then it escalated to chicken fried steak  steaks  bacon     its amazing  just make sure to follow directions for cleaning it    an get the chain cleaner it s perfect  do not use the silicon handle when cooking an leave it on   ive read other reviews an thats the    complaint    folks its a type of plastic    to use temporary to move the skillet around      
439,5.0,                       i was raised by a dinner from the box type of family  so cooking with cast iron was an entirely new concept for me  i do remember one of my grandparents cooking from one when i would visit  but didn t give it much thought  we recently just restocked our kitchen  from plates and flatware to non stick pans  i decided to buy the lodge             and        skillets along with the       griddle about    days ago  so far  i love them all  though i use the   inch version the most  in fact  i find myself using these far more than the non stick skillets we purchased around the same time i ve had no problems with rusting due to following instructions  which is always important  the more i use it  the better the food tastes  i also made an attempt to watch some how to videos off youtube  which helped tremendously as well  alton brown has some handy ones on there  when i first used these  food did stick quite a bit  despite using oil  so i decided to start applying oil after each use  i now am in the habit of rinsing scrubbing when i m done  i dry it down and then heat it back up on the stove as i apply a thin layer vegetable based oil  which seems to make it more non stick  not a must do sort of thing  since it s already pre seasoned  but i m loving the results  i don t do it long  just about a two minutes  it also helps me to ensure that everything s dry      
440,3.0,                            skillet s size is very small  diameter is         at top       at bottom  height is     can fry just a single egg  got measurements image from manufacturer s  website  volume will be around         ml  i think  bottom sits on a gas stove s burner  no need to keep holding  compared to                              lodge    ounce       ml  melting pot which seems not to sit on a gas stove s burner by itself  may be because of its shape  https   www amazon com lodge lmp  melting pre seasoned    ounce dp b    cx fe  measurements are for melting pot  diameter   top     bottom       height       as given at  manufacturer s  website edit added  for a small cast iron skillet   seems lodge      https   www amazon com gp product b  ljsetwm     or lodge        https   www amazon com gp product b     rwt     are better options  as the volume will be bigger than this tiny       skillet      
441,2.0,                       the first time i used it  i washed it well  and dried it   put it in the cabinet  the next morning it had red rust all over the pan  so reseasoned it  and baked it in oven   now it is fine  you would think it would have been season alot better that this from the manufacturer   i do not recommend this product
