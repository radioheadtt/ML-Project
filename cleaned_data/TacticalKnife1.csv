0,2.0,                       this was perfect in every way when i first got it   after a few months  the locking mechanism got less and less effective to the point where it opened inside of the pocket and when i sat down it gave me a laceration that needed stitches   the possible medical bills aren t worth the cheap cost of the knife   i wish i could give a good review as i love the aesthetic of the product and it was useful when it was functional      
1,5.0,                       i have never owned a pocket knife in my life  but after binging lnm on reddit for awhile  i thought it time i took my safety seriously  so i got this knife with the prime membership   boy am i obsessed with it  the blade is legitimately super sharp and means business  i love the rainbow  it looks incredible when it hits light just right  i got down the one hand open   close in about   minutes  it does open and close fast like the description stated  the bottle opener   screwdriver or glass breaker is such a nice perk to it  i hope i never have to use it to defend myself but if i do  i know i am in good hands with this product  will recommend to others        
2,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i have to admit  i was ordering one for my bf and decided to order one for myself purely because of how beautiful it was lol it is a really good knife though  it s easy to open  the blade it really sharp and also has a nice serrated part  i also like how it has a little clip so you can attach it to your bag or pants or whatever  i use it mainly to open boxes and stuff and it does a great job at that  i m sure it can be used for many other tasks as well     
3,1.0,                       the knife is pretty  and it would probably be a sweet blade if it worked properly  alas    the bottom of the blade is not properly aligned with the liner lock  and the lock will not snap into place when the blade is opened  this means the knife will not stay locked open  making it entirely likely that i will close it on my fingers if i make any attempt to use it  my fingers have done nothing to deserve this fate  therefore  i will not be using this knife  unfortunately  i tossed it in a corner and forgot about it until it was too late to return it  maybe i ll put it on display somewhere   first picture shows faulty locking mechanism  second picture is just for you to admire its technicolor beauty  disregard the scuff marks around the screws   i took it apart completely to see if i could fix the alignment myself   obviously  i could not       
4,5.0,                       my family loves camping and scouting  and as such  we use pocketknives frequently  of the four of us who have a knife  three of us have this one  and we love them  i ve got the orange  and my two sons have the rainbow ones  the blade locks effectively  and if you take care of the knife   keep it clean  etc   it won t malfunction  i like the belt clip feature so that it doesn t slide around in my pocket or risk falling out   women s pockets are a joke  so this is really important to me  it s easy enough to open close for children to use with proper supervision  and it holds up to vigorous use in the wilderness  we ve used our knives for everything  whittling  carving  cutting off chunks of fat wood  even cutting potatoes and onions when the kitchen knives in our packs failed  i ve used them to cut bandages for first aid  and so much more  awesome  versatile  high quality knife  when my youngest gets his first pocketknife in a month or two  we ll be getting another one of these      
5,5.0,                       first off  be careful because this is extremely sharp  i was playing with it when i first got it and cut my finger because i was not careful enough  so that is good point for sharpness of the knife easy to open  although i cannot personally do it one handed  but stays locked so it will not open accidentally i ve carried it in my purse for quite a long time and it s been super handy and convenient to have around for opening and cutting things when needed  blade doesn t seem to have dulled noticeably either i liked it enough to buy a replacement one when my idiot self accidentally left it in my purse and had it confiscated at the airport  oops   ordered the new one as soon as i got home from my travels    the rainbow color is a nice option as well      
6,5.0,                       i paid    for this knife and am absolutely blown away by its quality  its not a      knife  but its every bit as nice as many     knives i ve owned  smooth to the touch  not exceptionally heavy  though slightly heavier than an expensive brand name  the spring assisted opening is perfectly made  just tight enough not to pop open  but lose enough that it doesn t take a ton of effort to launch it when you want it i cant say firmly enough how much nicer this knife is than anything else for even   times as much money improve  i d love to have the bottle opener work with the knife closed  or  even better would be to use it as a strap cutter with the knife blade inside it when closed  would like some more color choices but  if you ve read this far  buy this knife  its great  especially for the price      
7,5.0,                       this knife which is under     is your best option in this price range  i have had this knife for several months and the blade is just as sharp as the day i received it  it has a belt clip  a bottle opener and a glass breaker on the bottom of the handle  the stub on the side that is used to swing out the blade is extremely useful and fast  the weight of the knife is nice and lets us know this is not cheaply made  you are not losing quality and still spending a small amount of money for what you get  the blade always stays locked in and has not became loose over the several months i have had it  there is no hassle when using this knife  it is very dependable  this tactical knife is ideal for any situation  it holds up and may surprise you on how well it holds up  i have used it to open boxes at my job to cutting rope on camping trips  very convenient knife for whatever you may need it  not to mention the versatile colors that are available for the knife are incredible  overall a bang for your buck and i recommend this knife without hesitation to anyone in search of one      
8,5.0,                       i m a woman with small hands  i can open it one handed but not easily  needs practice  to close it  on the inside just below the blade  right on the curved serrated like area  you just push down  meaning  with the blade at your left  sharp edge toward you  push the inside part  downward  toward the ground  you can see how it goes up to the outer blade area and  releases  it   then close with fingers while pushing down with thumb  i can t fully do this yet  i think my hands are a little too small  anyway  the knife is weighty  seems pretty solid  and of course  it s truly lovely      
9,1.0,                       i am a first responder and my husband wanted to get me a knife for christmas  this knife is very hard to open one handed and once the blade is out  it does not lock  it also gets stuck just before the blade is fully closed  tried to get money back  which hasn t worked out      
10,5.0,                       i love this thing  all the positive reviews are spot on  it s got a great weight to it  feels strong and sturdy  i ve had it about   months now and i have had no issues  it was really stiff for awhile there  hard to open and close one handed without breaking a nail   yes i broke a nail trying to open and close this knife  true story  but it seems to slowly be getting more loose where it opens and closes easier  but not loose loose   just getting broken in  it still takes a bit of effort to pop it open one handed  then again i have small female hands  over all  love this knife  really sharp  great size        all around      
11,5.0,                       opens easily with a flick of the flipper one handed  blade color is beautiful  feels sturdy but not heavy  no play in blade when locked   lock has not failed to engage nor has it shown any tendency to disengage prematurely  edge is sharp but not razor sharp  if you are one of those people that needs a blade that sharp then this is probably not the best choice  it is sharp though and the serrations are also quite sharp  bottle opener is slightly more useful than the one on my crkt pryma  haven t tried the glass breaker  a little harder to close one handed but it can be done  its just a little more awkward so not as smooth to close as it is to open  i am happy as a pig in sheet with this knife      
12,2.0,                       i was really excited for my knife  only to realize that it was extremely hard to open  i know how to  but it made my fingers hurt alot because i had to press on the little mechanism immensely hard to open it  my fingers are still sore after not touching it for    hours  also not to mention when i do get it to spring up  it doesn t even come up all the way and i have to lock it into place by hand  at first i thought i was doing it wrong or just weak but after watching videos and speaking to someone who has the same knife  i realized this is just a faulty product  but you get what you pay for i suppose      
13,4.0,                       this knife is super cool and i really like the style and design  however  if you re not currently playing with it  it is very very very stiff to get to open  i ve played with it for hours  put oil on it and it still stays very very stiff  usually my knives are easy to open by this point and this one is not  it is super sharp and awesome tho and it was a great value      
14,4.0,                       had this knife for nearly a year at this point  it s overall  a very good knife  i have used this knife for near daily  for smacking  cutting ripping  but primarily as a box cutter  biggest issue  a week ago the screw came out of the bottom of the knife  did not come all the way out though  i ll have to wait until i can get a hexwrench to see if i can get it back in  the bottle opener only functions when the knife is out  which seems really dangerous to open bottles with  although that didn t really stop me  the blade scratched  but held up pretty decently  and the color is still very vibrant also the blade has bent slightly  it was worse at one point but i have managed to getting back into shape for the most part  decent  good buy pro  sturdy cheap pretty cons poorly placed bottle openerthe black paint on the grip wore off  very quickly  in under a month      
15,2.0,                       the knife on its own is flashy and cool  the handle has a fantasy quality and the blade itself a nice holographic   i opened it and was pleased  until i actually touched it  the grip is somewhat uncomfortable with ridges in awkward places  the latch has smaller grip ridges on either side and is difficult to use if you have bigger fingers  in addition to that  i discovered it to be rather dull out of the box  and very difficult to sharpen due to the aforementioned unpleasant grip  the rainbow sheen proved to be impossible to keep clean  the slightest touch gives it an unattractive smudgey look  not to mention how easily it scratches off   i suppose there was little better to expect  as i did buy a    dollar pocket knife  but i am nevertheless annoyed by the inconsistency of quality  a year or so ago i bought a tac force knife   black blade w  faux wood handle  and it has served me very well  it needs to be sharpened a little more often than my higher quality knifes  but other than has a very comfortable grip  very disappointed with this more colorful purchase  howevertl dr overall  not a great knife  awkward to hold  difficult to use  and you re better off saving your money for a better one     
16,4.0,                       so i haven t actually had an opportunity to put this to any actual use yet  but just based on general inspection and playing around with it this seems like a pretty nice knife  especially for the price  it has a nice weight to it  feels pretty balanced and nice in my hand  it s a little heavier in the handle than on the blade  the center of balance is a bit past the halfway point   which i like   the screws and hardware and such all look fine  nothing feels loose or doesn t work properly  it is a little bit stiff both opening and closing  personally i like the amount of resistance there is when opening it  it s not too hard to open  somehow a friend of mine   a grown male friend at that   had some issues with it and i ended up having to open it for him but he s kind of an idiot so i think he could ve opened it but was doing something wrong  even though i m not sure what you could actually do wrong  it s pretty straightforward     but it s not so easy that it might come open when it brushes up against something  so as long as you don t have some sort of weird ragdoll fingers that can t press down on things you should be ok haha  i m sure this could vary some between knives though  so if it was too hard to open you could probably either wd   it or loosen up the blade screw ever so slightly   the lock is a little stiff as well  not horribly so  but i do find myself not pushing it quite far enough in and then having to adjust a little more to get the blade folded back in  which only takes an extra fraction of a second so again  not a big deal at all just slightly    not even annoying really  just barely notable enough for me to mention it   also there is still some resistance once you re fully clear of the locking mechanism so you may initially think you haven t fully pushed it aside but once you push down a little harder on the blade it ll fold up just fine the blade itself is pretty sharp straight out of the box  i ll probably sharpen it some anyway around the tip because i like to keep my knives as sharp as possible at all times but this is by no means necessary  in fact i managed to put a little cut in my thumbnail when i was messing around with it haha and with little to no effort at that  because of this as well as the price point and quality i think this would be a great  starter knife   to carry around and try out as an edc to see if you even use it enough to warrant buying a sharpener or a more expensive knife  i also think it would also make a great gift  and you won t need to open the box and sharpen it before you give it to them  in fact i actually bought a second one for my friend  my final thought on this  and i m sure you will see many other people mention this if you haven t already  is that this thing is so gorgeous  i got the rainbow oil slick color  and i knew it would look good just based on other reviewers  pictures  but still figured i d bring it up because it s just so cool looking in person  everyone who s seen it has commented on it overall this is a great buy  i am so happy with it and i think anyone else would be too so i recommend this       i don t really have much to add to what anyone else has already said about this so i m really just agreeing with all the other people who loved this knife but i hope this was helpful regardless  and i hope everyone reading this has a great day      
17,2.0,                       first off  it s cheap  so i halfway expected all of my following complaints   both arrived relatively sharp  but the first time i tried cutting rope with them they dulled almost instantly   cheaply built  made in china  and the rivet that acts as a pivot point for the blade came loose after a couple weeks   buy this if you want to cut yarn or string  don t expect a heavy duty knife    again  look how much it costs   also  the  bottle opener   has such a wide gap that it even fails at effectively opening bottles   looks good though      
18,5.0,                       by no means am i a knife expert  in fact  i know nothing about knifes  i ve never owned a knife until now  and this one i purchased for personal protection  i will say  for      this knife seems perfect  it s simple to use and and sharp  it s heavy  seems like great quality  as you can see  olaf approves  in fact  he seems excited  hopefully i never have to actually use the knife  but if i do  i ll be sure to update my review  if this review never gets updated either a  i never had to use it  or b  i tried to use it and the knife did not work and i died   but as of now  so far so good  cool knife  great purchase      
19,5.0,                       i bought this as a christmas gift for my sister  be careful when handling this knife though because she was trying to open something up using this knife and she cut herself really bad  that was a mistake on her part but it s a really sharp knife right outta the box so fair warning  good knife for the price  it looks really nice with the rainbow like effect on the blade      
20,5.0,                       full disclosure  i am no knife expert  or even a knife enthusiast  i m sure someone with deeper knowledge could tell you why this isn t nearly as high quality as an expensive one  that said  it certainly cuts boxes  slits tape and splits cable ties like a madman  and that s good enough for me  does so at least as well as the kershaw brawler i stupidly lost and bought this to replace  in fact  again  more of a  knife guy  could quite likely tell you why the brawler justifies its considerably higher price    but for my purposes  the tf    rb keeps up just fine  bought the rainbow version on a lark  and heaven help me  i like that too      
21,5.0,                       i just received my knife really fast which is awesome because i was told i would get it in     days but i got it in    i ordered it on a thursday night   got it that saturday afternoon  the box that the knife comes in is just a simple cardboard box  nothing fancy  but  when you open it   take the knife out you will definitely be impressed  it does not look or feel cheap at all  it looks   feels like a knife you would pay        for  in my opinion  at the top of the knife you ll notice a little piece that you push to open the knife  when i first tried it it stuck a little but after opening it a few times it flicks right open  it doesn t feel like it will get loose any time soon though but if it does you can just tighten it if you need to  just like many other knives  under the blade there is a rigid piece that you push to the side to close the knife  on the back there is a clip so that you can clip your knife onto whatever you d like to clip it on  i was really impressed with how sharp the knife is as well  another reviewer said they would give the knife a      on sharpness   i agree  if there s is a con it would be that you can only use the bottle opener when the knife is open  that doesn t bother me but it might bother someone else  just be cautious   you won t hurt yourself  there s also a part at the end of the knife that you would use if you need to break a window  overall  i think this is a great buy  i loved it so much i bought my best friend one   now her dad wants one too  i can t wait to try it out when we hunt   fish  i would definitely recommend this knife   buy more tac force products      
22,4.0,                       i made a review but not sure if it posted  and i was  talking about the switch mechanism and how it s not the best  update  it s fine i just needed help  it s not really a  switch  but i guess that s good for safety  from the videos i watched it seemed you could just switch and flick it open and press it close but it takes more hands on than that and again that s good for safety   i like it and it gets the job done for me as a  beginner       
23,5.0,                       bought this for my    year old daughter so she can easily cut strings on hay bales when feeding her cow   she loves it   she can easily open it and shut it without feeling like she is going to cut herself   she uses it for everything she can  opening gifts  cutting packages  out on the farm   she even loves to compare it to her dads and say it s better   he even tested it out and really was impressed      
24,5.0,                       this knife is amazing   the rainbow color is beautiful  the knife blade color is not exactly the same as the picture shows  but has more colors in it than just pink and blue  i actually like that better  because i got it for my friend  who is a boy  s birthday some of the other reviews said that it was kind of hard to open with one hand at first  which is true  but it gets quite smooth after a couple practices  and is also very easy to close it is very sharp  and the serrated edge is helpful  the knife came quickly  it would be very good for cutting slim rope it s a very good camping knife  where the bottle opener would come in handy i think this knife at least deservs five stars  i d give it six if i could      
25,5.0,                       i like the weight  shape  and color of this knife  it s sharp and does wonders when i need to use it like a swiss army knife  luckily i haven t used it for personal defense  but i feel safe with this on me wherever i go along with other lines of defense  my niece got the same one as me and i helped her get use to unlocking it and closing it  my knife has gotten loose from opening it throughout the years  but that s a good thing in my opinion because i like being able to open it easily  so be aware that the lock may loosen with time and usage      
26,5.0,                       it s a great knife for the price  while it may not be as  refined  as some of the more expensive knifes i ve carried it makes up for it by being stupidly simple  the blade is fairly sturdy  hard and comes sharp  it opens extremely easily and has a satisfying locking click  i can sit there and open it a hundred times  it s honestly all i have ever asked for from an edc knife  definitely      worth the          
27,5.0,                           this knife is pretty  like  really pretty  which isn t really why i bought it  but i m not mad at it      this knife is hard to figure out how to close  i was suuper embarressed when it took me  like    min to figure it out  you can find videos on youtube  and it s really easy when you know how      this knife works  i cut open packages and trim loose threads off my clothes and feel extremely secure walking home alone late at night and just about anything else you might want to have a knife for  it fits discreetly in my purse and is easy to open and close  but still locks securely   and i love it      
28,3.0,                       received item as pictured and described  arrived as expected  love the rainbow color  no fading or wearing  the spring assist works roughly and due to a machine flaw the blade doesn t clear the flange that locks the blade  i purchased   of these knives from this seller  orange  camo and rainbow  and all   looked great and all   had to be adjusted for faster blade release but i find this to be overall a minimal inconvenience  this knife is defective but will attempt to hone flange and reassemble knife for continued and improved use  still would buy from seller and would buy knife again  value is justified  this was defect product      
29,5.0,                       awesome quality  very nice heft to the knife  and the price omg  unbelievable how cheap and how amazing this knife is  bottle opener is weirdly placed but who cares i use it as a last resort  glass breaker is nice as well  i m not into serrated blades but it is very sharp on this knife as well as the blade  very good packaging as well  the finish on the knife is breath taking  super smooth blade and visually cool  i took it out the first weekend i got it up wheeling in the woods  and i got compliments from all the guys saying how cool it was and how great the price was  thanks tac force for solid knife at a great price      
30,5.0,                       the price was really right on these knives  i got them as bridesmaids gifts and i m on a seriously tight budget  was happy to when they came so i could verify they were actually what was pictured because the price was so good  my only complaint is that   of the knives are much more difficult to close  they get  stuck  and that s annoying but for such a good deal i can t really be that upset      
31,5.0,                       i have several of these  they are inexpensive  sharpen up pretty well  and the  oil slick  colorization on the blade makes them easy to locate from a distance  i know it says that this knife has a bottle opener on it  but be advised that the knife has to be opened to use the bottle opener  the bottle opener had no bearing on me getting this knife  and that it why it still gets   stars even with the unsafe bottle opener  of course  like most knives these days  this knife is made china  not the kind of knife you get to be a family heirloom  but a great inexpensive daily use pocket knife      
32,5.0,                       ok  this knife is just badass   after seeing the videos about how quick and easy this opens  i had to order me one   i chose the rainbow option because i ve never owned a blade like it before and wanted it to stand out against the other ones i own   the knife is super sharp and the serrated portion scares me to death   i m going to have no problem sawing limbs off small trees with that   or cutting through rope if need be   i love the way it looks like some sort of alien technology   however  that s where the only drawback  for me  this knife has as it s handle includes a bottle opener feature that when holding the knife  digs into my pinkie finger   should i ever need to use it in self defense  i would have to use a reverse grip so that any strikes wouldn t cause me as much damage as my threat   all in all  i m extremely satisfied with my purchase      
33,5.0,                       very pleasantly surprised with this knife  not only does it look totally badass  the spring assisted opening is awesome  after spending some time practicing opening it by swinging the blade out with my thumb  i noticed a small  button  protruding from the knife when it was closed  whaddaya know  press the button and the blade opens automatically  surprise nice sharp blade  the serrated section is very sharp  and the price    come on  just get it  you won t be disappointed      
34,2.0,                       if you are looking for a working class blade  keep looking  i bought this to use at work while my benchmade is being serviced  i was not expecting anywhere near the same quality seeing as this is one of amazons cheapest knives however  here s my take  the blade is solid and the weight of the knife is heavy  if you are someone who rarely uses a knife this is a fine selection  you can use it for many basic purposes if you are a person who uses knives multiple times an hour to open boxes  cut zip ties  scrape away material  any type of industrial usage  this is not the blade for you  do yourself a favor and get a benchmade  yes they are over      but it has a lifetime blade sharpening and repair warranty  so it will pay for itself and always cut better than this    titanium again if you just want to look cool and occasionally open a box or something this is fine for you      
35,5.0,                       lost my old knife and wanted a quick cheap replacement  i always have a knife on me as they re often useful  this one came with even more uses  while the spring assisted rainbow blade is nice  i got it because it can also double as a glass breaker   a flathead screw driver  and lastly  a bottle opener i m no country hick because i drive a truck  i drive a truck because i see it more useful than a car  same thing with the knife  i ll take something with more uses vs something shiny any day  the fancy rainbow blade is just a nice look   the knife is cheap but well worth it  tac force is now my way to go when it comes to these knives      
36,4.0,                       i really just got this to carry in my car just in case or when i go for a walk in the woods  so i didn t realize it had some sort of spring lock and just pulled it open  pretty and super sharp but now i can t get it to close  maybe i m dumb but nothing is working  if anyone has a tip i d be grateful      
37,1.0,                       caveat emptor  this seller does not offer returns this knife is much too heavy  and poorly balanced   not to mention dull   the lever action is very stuff  and closing is very difficult   feels like a rock in your pocket   overall not a smooth  enjoyable knife for utility  or any other purpose   and definitely not for everyday carrying finally  did i mention the seller does not offer returns       
38,5.0,                       i like this knife  you can probably tell by the picture that it s not the most ergonomical design  but it looks pretty cool  it s not uncomfortably to use or anything  it s got a different feel in your hand  the blade is sharp  and so far the edge is holding up great the autoassist works great  and the knife locks up tight      of the time so far  the rainbow finish on the blade looks great  and seems really durable      
39,5.0,                       great little tactical knife   has some weight to it  easy to open and easy to secure when locking   meets most states requirements for carrying a concealed knife if your plan is to use for self defense   i got the rainbow and it is a beautiful blade   definitely worth the money and i recommend      
40,5.0,                       when i travel between college campuses  i take a couple of buses to do so  unfortunately  the stop between the two buses is usually very dangerous  i ve been harassed and almost robbed  i got this knife to help me feel safer  luckily i haven t had to use it like i ve had to use pepper spray  but it s still nice to have it there just in case  it s sharp and has a beautiful design  i think what i like the most about it is that i don t even notice it in my pocket  it fits just right and isn t obvious  i do wish it would close easier  but that s a nitpick      
41,4.0,                       for the price  you can not go wrong  out of the package it feels solid and is shave worthy  it is over light use though  when it starts to show it s character  first  the rainbow blade is very shiny and pretty to look at  but that nice finish isn t going to stay flawless forever  i noticed quickly that the blade began to hold scratches and any kind of oil fingerprint smudges  but with that said i didn t really buy the knife for it to be perfect all of the time  it gets the job done  very cheap and reliable  as of construction  it has a nice weight to it the blade feels very solid and the lock holds well  as for the handle grip  there isn t much to say  for me i don t like the shape or feel of the grip  my hands get sweaty holding it for some reason  i don t know why  but that might just be me so no points on them  also the screws in the grip were a concern from the beginning  they didn t feel like they were going to last very long and indeed i was right  within a month or so one of the screws near the glass breaker was gone  also a flaw but nothing i worry about too much  it still works fine  again with the blade  it came very sharp  this shave worthy edge does not last long but is not hard to get back  the blade sharpens very easily but that can be a con as well depending on how you look at it overall  it is a great knife with decent construction and function  i just put in order for another for myself and one as a gift to my brother who just lost his      boot knife and loved mine for the idea of a decent knife for less than      i highly recommend      
42,3.0,                       pros  looks like the picture  no scuffs or scratches  very sharp and sleek looking  it s got a nice comfortable weight   grip to it  it locks completely into place once opened   i know some people had problems with the knife locking into place  cons  it s stiff  it takes some real pressure to push down on the spring action button thing    even if i try to just pull the knife out i have to use some force and that scares me because i don t want my hand to slip or the knife to spring out by me using so much force and cut myself  even the button to close the knife takes pressure to push aside  i m going to oil it   see if that solves the problem  or maybe the screws are too tight      
43,4.0,                       for a  made in china  knife  the blade  sharpness  lock  open assist  and versatility of the tac force tf    rb mc is a pretty decent buy   how well this stands the test of time and durability remains to be seen  but for the price i m very pleased with my purchase   i do not anticipate ultra high use since i only camp once or twice per year  and fish   float from my kayak a few times more   i was less interested in this being a defense weapon  and more of an occasional tool   the knife arrived in   days per my prime membership   it looks kind of cool  too      
44,4.0,                       it s very nice looking and i love that it is heavy  it s not very sharp and it s hard to open  overall i love it for what i paid for it  i bought another knife from another seller and paid double for it and its just ok  this knife is very nice to look at but i will need to sharpen it and maybe see if it needs some oil to help it open easier      
45,5.0,                       this is a well made knife  and a great value for the price  it is very sharp  i have tiny girl hands  lol  and it is easy for me to open and close  which was very important to me and rare with cheap knives  i will admit  i have not tried to cut anything major with it yet  but for smaller things it has been fine and handy to have  it is lightweight and not bulky so it is great to pack  also  it s pretty  one thing to note though  it is not spring loaded at all      
46,5.0,                       my husband has a love for iridescent metal and knives  enter  this product  it combined two of his favorite things  i was so excited when i stumbled upon it  his birthday is coming up  but i already gave this to him   we both have a hard time holding onto presents and not giving them early    lol   he loves it  it is sturdy  the blade is sharp  would definitely purchase again      
47,5.0,                       surprised when i actually liked this knife  i only bought it because it was beautiful and cheap  it arrived as a considerably sturdy knife  still gorgeous  flips open with ease  a little tight to close  but better than closing too easy   extremely sharp  id buy it again  pleasantly surprised      
48,4.0,                       the knife is pretty and springs open nicely  i was opening and closing it about   times when i got it today  then it became very difficult to close  i wasn t able to push the lock to the side to close it  and it was a little jammed  i saw some metal shavings fall off where the lock meets the back of the blade so i think mine needed to be filed a little more before it was assembled  i can still open it when i need to so that s the important part  i do prefer knives that have an easier close though      
49,5.0,                       i was surprised to find this was a nice little knife   i bought it as a last minute purchase just before i was going oversees to do some volunteer work  i ve owned more expensive versions in the past  i e  spyderco  but i found i kept losing them at airports or elsewhere   the groove for flipping out one handed doesn t quite work for me  so i need to use two hands  but otherwise this works great   the rainbow coloration is also really cool   definitely worth the cost      
50,5.0,                       i bought one of these about a year ago for a car emergency kit and loved it  recently bought   more to put in my day packs for hiking  very sharp and sturdy  if you are a knife enthusiast  then i am sure this isn t for you  stick to kershaw  gerber  etc  but  if you are looking for a daily carry that you won t cry if you lose  pick up    or    of these      
51,5.0,                       i ve been occasionally using this knife for around   months with little to no issues  the knife is still sharp and the lock mechanism seems to be fine too  i do only use this to mainly cut boxes  but it s serving well for my purpose  the colors are also quite pretty too      
52,5.0,                       driving home today  i witnessed a car flip into a ditch  i pulled over with other people to help  approaching the car that was flipped i heard  someone get me a knife    as there were two infants still in their child seats in the back  i offered up mine to the person in the car and they were out in seconds  everyone was fine  ncluding the infants  the guy who got them out later on asked about the knife  i told him it was a search   recue knife from tac force on amazon for about      he said it cut through the seat belts   straps like a lightsaber  great job tac force  this will always be on me for now on      
53,1.0,                       it s supposed to be a knife that opens with one hand   it only opens with one hand and a desk or table to press the opening button down with   would return  but the choice was losing     or possibly getting covid waiting on line at usps   threw out  will take the hit     
54,5.0,                       this knife is awesome  i get compliments from it at work all the time  the open assist is super smooth and simple to use and it stays locked really well  the only time it s opened when it wasn t supposed to was when i dropped it on a concrete floor  it holds an edge really nicely and it s pretty easy to sharpen  none of the color has come of except the black coating on the clip  it s a really nice weight and sits in the hand very nicely  and i have small  medium hands  super glad i got this knife and it s an amazing price      
55,5.0,                       super convenient to use  really enjoy opening and closing this knife  assisted spring makes it feel badass and easy to open one handed  to close this knife  you just need to push down on the metal bar that locks the knife open  the sharp blade facing you   and then bend the blade down  make sure to read up on knife laws because they can vary from state to state       is the max blade length in wa state      
56,4.0,                       blade is extremely sharp and has seemed to hold up for my use  box cutting and fishing mostly   i rated     because once this handle is wet or you have a light amount of grease on your hands  the grip becomes very loose  the grip itself is all smooth metal where as a rubber grip of the same design would prevent the slippage pros   blade is sharp and has held up  great color and quality  lock out mechanism is sturdy and reliablecons   grip will not be as strong due to moisture and or grease  compared to similar knifes with a rubber grip   bottle opener is mediocre     
57,5.0,                       weight      g     oz     blade  the first     or so of the blade is serrated in a wavy       pattern  the quick release is operated with your index finger   so this can easily be opened one handed  the lock mechanism is pushed aside with your thumb  right handed  or fingers  left handed   this knife is attractive and does not feel cheap  it has heft and sharpness  one large and three small torx screws on each side hold it together  one side of the blade says  tac force speedster model  and the other side says  tf         stainless usa design handmade in china   the belt clip is held by an additional three screws i appreciate that the knife feels tight in its operation  i have cut through masking tape  plastic  bubble wrap and paper  all butter      
58,5.0,                       this tac force tactical folding knife is one of the best buy for your money if you are looking for a rainbow colored flipping knife  this knife is also sharp that i almost cut myself by admiring the craftsmanship of this knife  it s also a speedster model which assist the knife with a type of spring that would pop flip the knife with a blink of an eye  i mostly  usually carry this with me when i go out anywhere  the knife also has a great holding grip and a tight pocket clip  i think this product might of came with a tool for the screws but i ve misplaced them soon as i opened this product  and the price that i got this knife for at the time was about around     usd  so hopefully you get it in a great discounted price  enjoy your products guys gals and be safe to not hurt yourself other than that this product i would highly recommend buying for first time knife owners or if you have a knife already it would be a good buy for a change  if anyone has further questions feel free to leave your questions in the comments with this review      
59,5.0,                       i worked apartment maintenance for    years   broke allot of knives  the quality has been improving  the set screws usually fall out after   months   by then i have damaged the blade enough that i have a back up and rotate it out to a newer one  this is a good disposable knife that lasts just long enough   also sharpens easy once a week      
60,4.0,                       love these knives and have bought several but had issues with three of them so far  the small torx screws come loose and get lost and no luck trying to find replacement fasteners  so now when i get a new one i take the fasteners out and put threadlock on them and not had any issues since  is there a way to reach the manufacturer to see about getting my knives repaired replaced under the lifetime warranty or see if they can send out new fasteners to replace what has fallen out  i have tried calling and email but no luck        
61,4.0,                       this knife is super sharp  so sharp that i accidentally cut myself almost immediately so i never opened it again lol  it s definitely dangerous so be careful  if you really need a knife i would suggest buying this  it was worth the price  it s very nice looking as well i didn t know the knife had a lock feature  so i actually thought the knife had rusted and i tried hammering it shut  throwing it on the ground and it would not unlock at all haha  i then decided to read the reviews and realized it was the lock  so the lock feature is           
62,5.0,                       this is the second knife i ve bought of this brand for personal safety and utility  the first delivery sent me the wrong item  but amazon was great with the mistake and expedited a replacement knife the very next day i recently was helping with a large event   and this super came in handy  i wasn t sure how sharp it would be  given it just looks really pretty and pointy    but it stood up to sticky gaff tape  cutting zip ties on the fly  and breaking down heavy boxes  i know that s not really a true test of a knife  but it open assist was really handy    to be able to flip the knife open with one hand  my girlfriends were impressed by how pretty it looked though   and the dudes impressed that my knife was bigger than theirs        
63,4.0,                       this knife is not only sharp looking  haha see what i did there   but very durable and well made  it s weighted well and the colored blade adds a touch of femininity to a pretty masculine product  i unfortunately ended up returning it but not by any fault of the product  unfortunately it has a tiny bit of an assist when it opens up  which makes switching it open a breeze  however i wasn t sure if cops in nyc would consider this a  switch blade  function  even though it clearly isn t  i personally didn t want to take the risk  but if you live in a lenient city where a small assist is ok then this knife is an awesome choice      
64,5.0,                       especially for the price i paid for it         this was a steal  i have always had the boyish desire to own a rainbow knife  so when i saw the price  i jumped on it  on the deal  not the knife    the knife is well built with a clip on the back that you could use to clip to a pocket or something the assisted release mechanism is really nice  smoothly opening the knife  even with one hand  although it is easier with two  the rainbow sheen is quite pretty  and is not just limited to the blade itself the grip is also well shaped no complaints  boyish fantasy fulfilled i did not receive a free discounted sample for an  unbiased  review  i wish   p nope  i forked over the dough      
65,5.0,                       it came pretty sharp out of the box and the serrated edge is even sharp enough on the tips to cut  the lock release is easy to use and it doesn t hurt your thumb because its pretty wide due to the shape of the frame  i like the little hole in the knife because it can be used to push out the blade for it to spring out  the glass breaker at the end is pretty good  it causes a lot of pain when hit by it while being mostly non lethal  the glass breaker could even be sharpened if that s your thing      
66,5.0,                       it isn t the sharpest knife  but it works well  the blade is thick and not bendy  it looks really nice and shiny still even after all this time of me using it  i like the lock mechanism  it feels safe  you wouldn t accidentally unlock it      
67,4.0,                       this is the first time ever buying a knife and i just love this one  when it first arrived there were no insteon how to open or close it  i had to go on youtube to learn  that s why i can t give it   stars  but once i learned it was easy  has a clip i can put it on and have it nearby for walks alone in the park and look wise it s awesome     
68,5.0,                       don t let the super low price and sexy design fool you  i just got mine delivered today and i m very impressed with the quality of the parts and construction  the blade came with a razor sharp factory edge and locks into place securely when opened  it s very easy to open and close with one hand  despite the fact that it simply looks like it might not be  the handle is also quite comfortable in both my left and right hands      
69,5.0,                       i purchased this knife for my daughter and she absolutely loves it  the ergonomic design of the knife  the lock feature  that s a must  and the overall value for the money  it s a beautiful knife and i would recommend  to anyone in the market for a great quality knife  i would definitely purchase again      
70,4.0,                       its a really good knife  the only   drawbacks are  it comes kinda sharp  but not very sharp  and idk about you guys but i ain t the knife sharpener guy  id probably just mess it up lol  so that sucks  but also the spring assist feature works well  but not all the time    i d say about   in every    times you use it  it won t work  and those are decent odds  but when it comes down to life or death  you don t want any odds lol   overall  for the price  this thing is really well designed  made decently  looks cool      
71,4.0,                       real cool knife  i enjoy flipping it in and out  though  it s not sharp at all and you ll probably have to sharpen it yourself also  if you get the rainbow variant and you touch it a lot  the oils from your skin make the colors real dark i think i actually like the darker colors anyways  more manly  heh   edit   i just gave the rainbow knife to my girlfriend and bought the grey variant and i ve noticed it s not quite as good mechanically  when i first received it  it wouldn t flip out all the way and lock   so i had to loosen it up a bit  still  it doesn t flip out quite as solidly as the rainbow one  most likely because of the paint  still a good knife  though      
72,4.0,                       wanted a knife to carry in my purse  bought the rainbow because it is girly enough without going overboard  very sharp right out of the box  i like the feel in my hand  only drawback is the single handed open  my husband has a kabar with a nipple on the blade that allows you to flip the blade with your thumb  and i love that  this knife however has a nipple on the back of the blade that you drag back with a finger  then the blade pops open with the assist feature  so it does open very quickly  shutting it is also somewhat of a challenge  it unlocks easily and shuts about halfway easily  the remaining halfway is more difficult and requires a good bit of force  i m sure this is to prevent someone from inadvertently shutting their finger in it  but it makes me more scared that will happen because i m struggling to close it  i feel like this will loosen up as time goes on though overall  would recommend      
73,4.0,                       i ve had this knife for a few days now  i haven t really used it a lot  mostly have just opened other amazon packages  it looks really nice  feels nice in the hand as well  the only issue with the knife is that the lock mechanism feels a bit sketchy  sometimes i have a problem closing the knife but it hasn t been much of a problem  if it does become an issue within the following months i might make an update but overall good quality for the price i paid  if you plan to use it for heavy duty work i d recommend looking for something more effective but otherwise i still think it s a good purchase      
74,4.0,                       the knife seems to stick a bit opening and closing  for that reason  i wouldn t rely on it in an emergency situation  however  for opening amazon boxes around the house  it serves its purpose it is also worth noting that the packaging has a prop    warning  if that s something you care about      
75,5.0,                       i cannot believe the quality of this knife for only     i am straight up impressed with this knife  looks amazing  feels great to open  and seems like a sturdy enough build for easy every day use  i m sure if your slamming it on hard material it won t hold up  but hey it s    and all i use it for is opening boxes and maybe for self defense if i get caught in a bad spot with it      
76,5.0,                       i love that these knives have such color variety  and i had to get the rainbow blade  it doesn t come super sharp but it s not bent or seem to be used in any way  i know how to take care of a knife so i ll sharpen it myself  it flips just like it s supposed to and i like how i can get a firm grip on its handle  i m a little unsure about using the bottle opener with how position right next to the tip of the blade because i don t want to dull the end of the knife  i don t know if i ll ever use the glass breaker but it s better to have and not need it than to need and not have      
77,4.0,                       this knife is a great value  it has proven to be an excellent knife to use around the farm  i always leave it in my car so it is handy whenever i need it though  i did read reviews about it opening unintentionally so i don t leave it in my pocket for long      
78,5.0,                       very lightweight and easy to use  extremely useful and definitely gets the job done  the blade didn t come too sharp but it wasn t dull either  i d say it s a good beginner blade for anyone needing it in college or for going out with girlfriends  the assist to open it really springs it out quickly and it locks nicely  fits well in your hand and very comfortably      
79,3.0,                       now  let me say that this knife looks awesome  and it worked well for a while  it cut the way a knife was supposed to cut  the opening and closing was smooth  and it seemed like a great product the problem is that it decided to loose some screws and basically fell apart now  it didn t phisically separate from the handle  but the handle will shift a solid  cm  now  i may not be an expert on knives  but i m pretty sure it s not supposed to do that in conclusion   looks awesome  but may fall apart if you actually use it      
80,4.0,                       good size  super pretty  good weight  i love it  haven t tested sharpness yet  but will  on a box not my siblings lmao  please don t come at me  but i like it  kinda hard to open but it ll become a muscle memory thing     
81,4.0,                       i was shocked at how beautiful this knife was when i got it for such a good price  the only problem i had is that it s a bit difficult to open  so i have to pull the blade out separately  which isn t much of a problem but it can be a little difficult  it s such a nice knife  and it cuts really well  it doesn t get that dirty  and if it does it s very easy to clean  i recommend      
82,4.0,                       appears to be a really good knife  the blade is super sharp  it locks in place without any wiggling   the only thing which bothered me was the weight  it s too heavy  it does have a clip on it so you can belt it if you want  but it s just too heavy to keep in your pocket  for me   for the price it is a great value  i don t know how they manage to sell it so cheap  robotics i guess      
83,5.0,                       i love the color and is very sharp  i carry it everywhere i go  when i m walking to the store or just over to a friend s house  it s my sidekick  it is extremely sharp and it took me a while to get use to the weight and opening it quickly but it is a wonderful knife      
84,5.0,                       holy cow  this knife is so sharp  it s cool looking as well but thought the design was a little odd  i need to look at the knife for a few seconds to figure out where to pull on to get the blade out  minor detail  so i didn t hit the rating for it  but the opposite side looks like you should pull there as well  nit picky  but overall a great pocket knife      
85,4.0,                       pros sharp  i feel safer having it  nice color options cons a little difficult to close  will hurt the heck out of your hand if done incorrectly   wish they had included quick directions for opening closing  i had to youtube some videos on how to close the thing having never used a tactical knife before  i wish it had more grip   it s real slippery  i feel like if i went to reach for it in an emergency situation it would slip right out of my grasp  i don t have calloused hands so i feel everything and my hands are very oily      
86,5.0,                       i got this as a gift  and the recipient absolutely loved it  the color is definitely different  and it almost looks nautical  something a diver should have on hand for emergencies   there s a slick sheen over the blade and other metal parts  but that doesn t affect performance in any way  it s just an interesting texture  knife is sharp  it s got a nice weight to it  and it s very eye catching  for the price  this is an absolute steal  highly recommended      
87,5.0,                       great value for the money  great christmas present  perfect item to carry in your purse for protection too  i love the colors    fast shipping  going to order two more for presents for those that collect knives       
88,1.0,                       i received this knife used and scratched up  there are marks all over it  very disappointed i was expecting a beautiful knife and i got a used scratched up knife  it s so scratched up polishing it doesn t even help and bang marks like the color is just coded scratched through      
89,5.0,                       this product honestly came prettier than i expected  definitely in love with the look  i m probably just going to keep this one in my car so i don t ruin it opening boxes like my other knife  the only issue i had with it was how to close it once you opened it  i youtubed it and figured out you just have to push the bottom oval looking piece a to the side  but other than that is is great      
90,5.0,                       gibbs rule      never go anywhere without a knife  i bought the rainbow hued tac force tf    rb just for fun  but it is a pretty good knife  although it looks like an oddball klingon bat leth  the grip is surprisingly firm and comfortable  the blade has a nice edge  but the serrated section is freakin  wicked sharp the tac force knife arrived in two days in a nice black box  when it arrived the hinge screw was a little too tight and opening the blade was a real fight  i loosened the screw a hair and now i can use the tac force as a flip knife note that the blade locks in the open position and you need to press an interior bar to close the knife  the clip is pretty useless  imo  since it leaves part of the handle protruding from your pocket  others will likely feel differently but at the price  this is a real five star bargain      
91,5.0,                       so cheap great fo the money  i use this a a general everyday knife  keep it hooked on my pants and take it everywhere  nice serated edge  came sharp  beautiful color  nice weight and grip to it  gets lots of compliments on this knife      
92,5.0,                       this is an incredibly nice knife for this price point  much more solid than i expected  it arrives sharper than many knives like this do as well  which is nice  the clip to keep it on the edge of your pocket or tool belt was somewhat loose when it arrived but it was easy enough to unscrew it and bend it to be tighter  i got the rainbow finish and it looks absolutely amazing       
93,5.0,                       i bought this as a gift for my knife enthusiast friend  she absolutely loves it and takes it everywhere  the rainbow oil slick color is even prettier in person  it has some weight to it and it s pretty sturdy  the knife was a little hard to open at first but after playing with a few times it was smooth as butter  it s been roughly a year since she s had it and it s still in great condition and sharp  the blade was a little wobbly after a few months but she just tightened the screw and it was good as new  i m tempted to buy one for myself        would recommend      
94,4.0,                       this knife is a good size and it fits your hands well  specifically if you have small hands like me   the colors are so pretty  but even more importantly  the knife is functional  the only drawback is that it doesn t have a seatbelt cutting option  that being said  i d purchase another one      
95,5.0,                       my fiance and i love these knives  we both have one and i ordered another as a gift for someone and they love it  the bottle opener part is a little useless because of where it s located   but other than that the knife is sturdy  looks good and easy to carry in my pocket      
96,3.0,                       sturdy product  hard to open easy to close  very sharp not sure how well it will hold the edge but will find out in time  the knife itself is slippery and hard to hold onto might be dangerous to use for any sort of stabbing action but i really only use it for cutting company sent me the wrong knife i would have returned it but my girlfriend wanted this one so she bought me one and we hope it s right this time      
97,2.0,                       very pretty   it s at an affordable price  however  opening and closing the blade is very unsafe because you have to manually open   close it by holding the blade with your fingers  not sure if mine is defective or what  it also doesn t stay locked into place when open      
98,5.0,                       great knife that i use all the time  it is always coming in handy when i need to cut packages open or even when i need a screwdriver  i carry this in my purse at all times  which helps me feel a little safer  i plan on getting another one to keep in my car as well to use to break the window should the need ever arise  i live in houston so a flooded car isn t too unlikely   great quality knife with a very sharp blade and the rainbow is really pretty  very cool knife      
99,5.0,                       i ve had this knife for about   months now and i have nothing negative to say about it  the design is smooth and ergonomic  and the knife is very pretty  it s also very sharp and does not have trouble cutting through anything  so sharp that it cut effortlessly into my finger when i got a little careless with it  i ve used it not too frequently since i ve had it  but the spring in it seems to be just fine  no slack in it and still locks in the open position just fine  if you re looking for a functional knife that s also nice to looks at  i highly recommend this product      
100,2.0,                       pretty  but the switch blade didn t fling open and stay open with one movement  you push the button  and it opens half mast  you have to manually open it the rest of the way  not what i bought a switch blade for   positive side  it looks amazing  nice addition to a clllection     
101,5.0,                       i love this knife  after so many years   the price can not be beat it looks cool as well with the neo chrome finish  i love the durability and swiftness thank you for an amazing knife  i will most likely purchase another one soon      
102,5.0,                       good value knife   very nice screwdriver glass breaker at bottom of handle   easy blade deployment   seems decent blade metal quality strange that one has to deploy knife to use the bottle opener      
103,5.0,                       i have many edc s  this thing rocks for    smackers  is this the highest quality assisted knife out there   nahhhhhh  could you abuse and lose one every day  it s ten dollars for crying out loud      
104,4.0,                       my son is going fishing tomorrow and always needs a pocket knife for cutting line and what not he is a catch and release guy so i will keep you up to date on this tac force tactical it s a beautiful knife heavy duty perfect for hunting or a boat he is    so he is allowed to have a pocket knife the color is absolutely beautiful just got it i may use it pilling potatoes tonight     
105,5.0,                       pretty  i wish it had a key ring on it  it s super sharp and i wasn t expecting it to be a switchblade when i opened it so i cut myself   but it s functional and good to carry as a woman     
106,4.0,                       price hike not good  was such a value before   the opening of the knife can at times be problematic   i have had to bend the metal and add wd    in the past to have it work properly again      
107,4.0,                       opened it and accidentally gently poked my finger with one of the serrated points and immediately started bleeding  very sharp  great quality also fairly easy to open after a couple times and clicks into place firmly  nicely weighted i liked it so much that i bought it as a christmas gift for six of my queer friends in december      in honor of the incoming president  i use it for everything from opening up boxes and cutting fruit to carrying around sketchy parts of town at night only complaint is that the bottle opener seems pretty badly placed  you need to open the knife to actually use it  which seems inadvisable if you re trying to crack open your third bottle of beer or whatever  personally doesn t matter as much to me since i mostly only carry it around for the knife and window breaker bit  always good for emergencies   but i feel like it might be better replaced with the seatbelt cutter that similar designs sometimes have instead      
108,3.0,                       its good for the price but its hard to open  you really gotta beat yourself up to get it to open  the spring lever is really difficult to open  everything else is really nice and pretty but the lever gives me issues  what do i look like trying to pull out a spring assisted knife that i need to open by the blade because lever is too hard to open  huh  what do i look like    overall       i love it  its also heavy      
109,4.0,                       i love the color of this knife  it was a little dull when i first got the blade  the black is a hard plastic which has already dented  but still a nice knife for the value      
110,5.0,                       besides being an absolutely stunning knife  i was so glad it also has a bottle opener and glass breaker  you never know when you might need those  it fits securely in my pocket but doesn t snag when i pull it out  the blade is pretty sharp  i use it at work a lot to open and break down boxes and open various things around the house  and for course i ve had to show it off  everyone loves it  really great knife for the price  would highly recommend      
111,5.0,                       it was a little unwieldy based on my personal preference  but spring assist worked well  my girlfriend loved it and it s not like she s going to go around stabbing people all the time so it ll do  good value      
112,5.0,                       i was not expecting to like this knife as much as i do  i can t stop playing with it     gorgeous piece of work  solid and weighty  good grip  and just a very nice blade only drawback is it seems to be assembled really tight  so thumbing the blade out enough before you can flick the rest out is hard  depending on how calloused or not your digits are  expect it to be a rough few days  but i m pretty sure that s just cause it s new  give it time to break in and it ll be fine      
113,5.0,                       as far as my knife collection goes  this is the best one yet  i love the blade color and design and the flame shape of the handle makes it comfortable and natural to grip  the knife has a comfortable weight to it that s not too light nor too heavy  this also fits perfectly in my pocket and the clip keeps it very secure  typically the clip is either too loose that it slips or so tight that you can t clip it to anything easily but this one is perfect resistance and has a high lip at the end which makes for easy pocketing  the blade was sharp right out of the box and the spring assist is strong  this is my favorite knife      
114,5.0,                       got one for myself to carry around  liked it so much and found it aesthetically pleasing enough that i ordered a second one to gift my knife collecting friend for christmas blade is sharp  cuts through most things without effort  lock holds in place  i don t worry about accidentally stabbing myself  looks nice      
115,5.0,                       just got it for protection  i like how great the quality is  i feel confident with the firmly built structure that i won t actually hurt myself by carrying this around with me  the color is beautiful  it feels good in the hand  like it fits a grip really well  the design and the quality is amazing  definitely worth it   also bought one for my mom     
116,5.0,                       nice  heavy  very vibrant colors the spring assist is smooth and powerful   this knife is the perfect size for my purse  and is fairly sharp this knife has a bottle opener  but you can t really use it unless the knife is open    seems poinless   and there s a  window breaker  on the end   haven t had to use that yet i ve used it for several months  and it seems to have kept it s edge the only bad thing is that the rainbow surface shows smudges easily      
117,5.0,                       for a knife that s under     this is surprisingly quality  it s not too stiff or loose  and very sharp  i used it to open all my packages and cut a few zip ties right out of the box  and will be taking it backpacking soon  after that  it ll stay in my glove box for self defense purposes  since i work a graveyard shift it s also very pretty  which is a nice touch      
118,4.0,                       first out of the box  the knife smelled of sweatshop and grease  knife was slippery and extremely sharp  after i figured out where the open lever was  i noticed just how big this knife was  the clip is very sturdy and latches onto anything and does not move  blade doesn t wiggle when folded and it takes a bit to get it open so don t worry about it being in your pocket  glass breaker on the rear of the handle takes a few hits to pop open a window and dulls quickly  color is good  but i did get the wrong color  overall  the knife smells funny for a bit  knife is huge in your pocket  glass breaker works twice  and it is incredibly sharp          
119,5.0,                       took me a few days to get comfortable opening and closing with one hand  but now it opens as easy as a switch bladevery sharp  good general purpose knife   after i bought it i didn t realize it really has a rainbow effect  robin hood was a gay blade so there s that         
120,5.0,                       awesome knife  i love the color  i like purples and rainbows but i didn t want it totally like that  it was nice to see main black body color  it makes the blade stand out  i love the size of this knife  it s not too overpowering for my hands  but not small either   i have a small knife but it s so small it wouldn t e a good self defense weapon  the clip will allow me to clip it to my outside pocket of my purse for easy access  course with amazon prime i got it so fast   love my prime      
121,5.0,                       cute little knife love the price you will have to work with it cause it was a little hard to open and close but that s normal great knife i ve never seen a mainly green purple pink rainbow but to each their own     
122,5.0,                       sharp  moderately easy to use  easy to carry and conceal  gets the job done whatever it may be  stay safe with this object  never fling it open and always fold back when finished      
123,5.0,                       pretty good knife  it s very sharp so you ll have no problem cutting anything  bottle opener is nice but you have to have the knife open to use it  obviously you should exercise sound judgement with that feature  after a year or so the locking mechanism became less secure but if you have the correct tools you may be able to correct it      
124,5.0,                       my son loves to collect pocket knives  this one is super cool  nice design  cool colors and definitely looks and feels more expensive than it was  my favorite kind of product      
125,5.0,                       everything on this knife is well made  i chose the rainbow color and boy does it shine in the sun  it is a bit tough to open with one hand but all i did was spray wd   and it opens smoothly  this knife is awesome   i will definitely be ordering more      
126,5.0,                       i have a hug addiction on collecting stuff and pocket knife is one of them  this particular item really stand out  sharp  and it has a bottle opener  i use this more to cut orange and other foods but i would recommend is you re trying to build a  collection or just want something sharp for cutting    keeping it simple and short for you guys      
127,5.0,                       i like to keep this on me for everyday use  and for my peace of mind when walking alone at night this knife is spring assisted  so you will have to apply a force on the hinge in order for the blade to flip out  you can fold it closed by pushing the lock  located beneath the blade  out of the way with your finger and carefully folding in the knife with your free hand  you might find it hard to open the blade the first few times   but i ve found it becomes easier after having used it over time  others might suggest you could use tools on it or apply a lubricant on the blade hinge  but do this at your own risk the blade comes sharp out of the box  but can dull over time depending on how much you use it  consider purchasing a blade sharpener depending on your usage of this there s a clip on the side of the blade that allows you to slip it into your pocket or on your hip for a discrete carry  i do either from time to time  and sometimes i forget its even there because it fits so well  knife comes with glass breaker and bottle opener  note that you cannot use the bottle opener unless the knife is unfolded  which might be somewhat unsafe for hunting  or other  heavy  uses  i would recommend looking for something a bit more durable  otherwise  i recommend this for general  everyday use      
128,5.0,                       looks beautiful and came as described  only problem is i bought two knives   they were the same   one for me and one for my brother  and the one that i kept was made sloppier than the first  wasn t as sharp and the serrated edges look like the cuts were miscalculated  but nevertheless i love my knife and i take it with me everywhere  but it s resigned to really just being a work knife for me now      
129,5.0,                       this knife is my best friend  it s sharp  lightweight  and has several convenient features  the bottle opener  glass breaker  and serrated edge come in very handy on my ranch  i would definitely recommend this tac knife to anyone looking for a great knife at an awesome price      
130,5.0,                       this is one of the most beautiful knives  catches everyone s eye  everyone is always asking where i got it  i m      satisfied would most definitely order again  maybe another color  either way if your looking i would just add it to the bag      
131,4.0,                       the prices on the tac force mtech knives are so low that i have always thought they must be poor quality  found this one in a local store and was pleasantly surprised at how solid  crisp and sharp it was  bought it and then bought again on amazon for half the price  only one problem  the spring assist is a negative feature  the extra resistance that the spring makes necessary to hold the blade closed makes it harder  not easier  to open  the mtech version i bought at the store is not spring assisted and much easier to flip open one handed      
132,5.0,                       been wanting a knife like this  got this a a great price and works great  my husband now says i am like gibbs in ncis now using this knife like a pro on almost everything  lol     
133,5.0,                       i didn t expect anything more than a knife that looked cool  obviously because of the low price  yes it s nowhere near the same quality as my other knives but then again it is     of the price which is why i am not disappointed  i was already aware that the bottle opener is extremely impractical because i read read quite a few reviews before i made my purchase so i wasn t disappointed at all  it is great quality for the price i paid but if you are looking for a knife to use on a daily basis you are one cheap son of a b      this knife is to look cool and to use every once in awhile  you should be able to tell because of the price   side note if your the type to loctite everything make sure you have a torx t       
134,5.0,                       my everyday carry  easy   hand operation open and close  plenty sharp to open breakdown boxes and any other task i ve used for it  great look and feel  small screwdriver has even been a lifesaver to quickly tighten or pry tool was needed on the spot      
135,4.0,                       the knife was up to standards that i had expected  and was tight and fairly sharpe  but with little effort was very sharpe and what little i used it i beleive it will hold an edge   considering the price and what i received in a timely manner ahead of time quoted i think it s a very good knife at a very low price   if i lose break  or someone walks off with it i won t be out a bunch of money  and if i need to abuse it i won t worry but will pry  chisel or unscrew with it at the risk of breaking off the tip or snapping it in half but with what labor cost verses knife cost if it saves a     hour of going after another tool break it   give it to a deserving youngster for camping fishing or what ever and order another gladly      
136,5.0,                       these knives are excellent  super sharp  easy to switch open closed  gorgeous color  strong and durable material  i carry mine with me when i hike  and the clip on the side allows it to fit snugly into my day pack without me having to worry about whether or not it will fall out  in fact  i love this little knife so much that i had two of them sent to colorado because i couldn t take mine on the plane  but definitely wanted to have one with me      
137,5.0,                       man  this knife gets a lot of bad talk but it s my favorite knife   i bought the colorful one and man i look forward to using it everyday   many people say that these knives come dull but that s a lie in my opinion   my knife came extremely sharp it was crazy   i highly recommend this knife and i will buy more     
138,5.0,                       i purchased this knife awhile back  just as an add on to my order to hit the     free shipping limit  when i received it  i thought it was too big   not something i would want to carry as an everyday pocket knife  that very quickly changed   it has been my daily carry ever since  the open assist is one of the easiest quickest i ve ever had on a pocket knife   it really comes in handy quite often  which is why this became my go to pocket knife  great knife  great quality  definitely worth the purchase      
139,4.0,                       lobe this knife and carry it in my purse daily  it isn t sharp so had to sharpen it bit its sturdy and has some weight to it  really nice knife      
140,4.0,                       i was kind of skeptical about purchasing such a cheap knife  but i m glad i took the chance  it has a good size  weight and feel to it and the rainbow blade is truly gorgeous  the only downside is that the spring mechanism is kind of hard to activate  but i hope it softens up once i really start to use it  so far  i recommend      
141,5.0,                       bought one for him for christmas  i m retired and on a tight budget  spending under     for a cool look  and useful gift was a no brainer      
142,5.0,                       had the knife for about   days now  can easily say it is one of the best knives i have had  i have had no problems with opening the knife with the release or folding it back in  the bottle opener is not the best  it can sort of be used wile the blade is folded in but not all that well  i dont imagine i will use it with the blade out  just seems like a bad idea    the weight is nice as well giving the knife a real quality feel  i purchased the rainbow colored one and have gotten many comments on how cool it looks  came pretty sharp as well but i would suggest picking up a sharpening block or something to keep it that way depending on how much you will use the knife would order another one should i misplace this one  great daily carry knife      
143,5.0,                       i carry knives for self defense and tool usage  i loved the colors on this one and was a little nervous it wouldn t be as colorful when i got it but oh man   it s gorgeous  lightweight  closes smoothly  and gets the job done  also very sharp     
144,5.0,                       bought this knife to keep in my purse and i couldn t be happier  light in the hands and easy to open close  the oil slick edition is quite beautiful as well      
145,5.0,                       i had to go back and check the price because this is a well made knife  beautiful  firm open and close mechanisms  and i got it for     wow  i bought this because my husband made me give his knife back  even though he hasn t touched it  i ve used it multiple times a week but ok  i m a sucker for rainbow and am looking forward to flicking this beaut out when need arises     
146,5.0,                       wow it s amazing knife  i can t believe how much it was i was expecting something cheap  oh no this is a high quality knife  i am ordering three more and giving them as gifts      
147,5.0,                       i got this knife at the beginning of september and it s still dangerously sharp after regular use  at first i didn t trust the locking because you had to literally put your finger in the way of the blade to close it but since it doesn t snap shut and just unlocks it s not too worrisome   for people having issues getting it to close in the second picture you push down on the holochromatic bar and it ll unlock so you can fold it      
148,2.0,                       beware   they re selling used or refurbished products as new i ordered two of these  the first one came last month and i liked it so much i bought a second  however  the second one i purchased came clearly used  despite being sold as brand new   the blade is scratched up in a number of places and the knife as a whole is not of the same quality as the first  it s very frustrating that they re selling used or refurbished products as new      
149,5.0,                       good and simple  i have bought this knife multiple times and will need to buy it again as i accidentally took it through the airport security  it s great for someone looking for an all around handy  on the go tool  the lock feature can be a bit stiff at first but i really do enjoy this particular knife      
150,5.0,tac force tf    rb assisted opening tactical folding knife  rainbow half serrated blade  black handle        inch closed                       this is an awesome knife  the finish has to be seen to be appreciated  the pictures do not do this knife justice  this is a must buy   especially at    i strongly recommend everyone who buys this knife to also check out this zippo lighter      zippo spectrum pocket lighter                       the spectrum color zippo and this knife make an incredible combination together  and they both look amazing      
151,5.0,                       my husband has a knife collection  but also keeps on him as a utility knife  he loves it  i was worried he would think it wasn t manly enough but honestly he really does like it  it is sturdy and sharp if you are supersticious  give the receiver a small coin to give you before you give the gift  as its said that giving knives or scissors as a gift could cut your relationship apart   so technically the other person is buying it      
152,4.0,                       i bought this to keep in my car  kids always ask to open things so this knife will come pretty handy  its b e a utiful and closes and opens fine  it s great for the value      
153,5.0,                       best knife ever  i love it and also bought my husband the grey one  very durable  not super light feels like good quality  opens great  and it s super pretty      
154,5.0,                       i love this knife and i use it to break down cardboard boxes at work  what makes it my favorite is not only the color but also the small cutter at the tip of the knife  it breaks down boxes easily and i don t have to open the knife  the knife itself is also pretty sharp  will buy again once mine wears down     
155,5.0,                       i absolutely love it   the first time you open it though  it is very difficult and requires effort   i would definitely suggest that you oil up very slightly to get a smoother open   also  there is a piece that locks it when you open it    i didn t notice until i went to close it and you have to push the piece over to the side before collapsing the knife   very beautiful and sturdy   i am in love with it         
156,2.0,                       nice looking knife  worked fine for a couple weeks then the screw kept coming loose  a couple weeks later the knife would not fully open and lock nice and sharp knife though  like the color sceme but going to need to find another for long term use      
157,5.0,                       i had to read the comments to figure out how to close it but other than than it does the job and it s stylish     
158,5.0,                       very nice  got several compliments because of the flamboyant finish  works great as my tool for work      
159,2.0,                       this knife is just okay  it s aesthetically pleasing  but it is a bit heavier than i expected  it s a bit too hefty for an everyday carry  i ll throw it in my purse or my backpack when hiking  but i wouldn t wear this on my waistband or put it in my pocket  the blade is quite sharp  which is the major benefit of this knife  it s also easy to open and close  overall  for the   bucks i paid  it was worth it      
160,5.0,                       i bought this knife to help me feel safe at my college campus but i mainly use it as a tool to cut ropes and open packages and whatnot  it s a solid  sturdy knife with an incredibly sharp blade  i have the rainbow blade and the photo doesn t do it justice  it s beautiful  i was worried about the handle being cheap plastic but like i said it s nice quality and feels very comfortable to hold  the spring assistance really allows for easy and quick opening      
161,5.0,                       i purchased this knife to add to my everday carry items  phone  wallet  keys   i wanted this knife primarily for protection and self defense  i am    and not of age to buy and conceal carry a handgun so i figured this was the next best thing  i don t know very much about knives  but this knife seems to be very sturdy and well made  it feels good in your hand  the spring assist does its job and alows the knife to be opened one handed with relative ease  i have only one minor gripe about this knife and it is the placement of the glass breaker  when opening the knife it may poke your hand depending on the placement of your grip  but as i have said it is only minor because in order to avoid this you just have to adjust your grip slightly  i also really like the color of the blade  i was worried it might be a little too feminine  but i was wrong  it gives the knife a unique look that really stands out and looks great for either sex pros costlookssolid constructiongood spring assistperfect weightfairly sharpcons placement of glass breaker may poke the users hand  again  minor but worth noting i only received the knife today so i cannot speak on how long it lasts  but based on everything that i observe i would be willing to bet it will last some time  solid knife at a price that cannot be turned down  would recommend to anyone  thank you      
162,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i love it  its super sharp and the color is beautiful to me      
163,5.0,                       i ve ordered this twice  with very large gaps  and both times i was very satisfied  this one came with tiny scratches  but i can barely even notice them  they re not deep enough to feel them  either  i d highly recommend this as it also seem to be good quality and the color  along with the price are some pros        
164,1.0,                       was so excited to get this knife and opened it as soon as i got it  my son walked in the room and i can t even close it  this is crazy  this is a major safety hazard  been trying to close it for    min  how can i return it with the blade sticking out      
165,5.0,                       i got this for myself  this was a perfect compromise between looks and practicality  i m very leery of how it flips open when using it one handed  so i use a two hand open  but it opens smoothly and locks open well  the locking mechanism is easy to release  the knife came sharp  it has a nice heft and feel to it  overall  i m very happy with it      
166,5.0,                       so pretty and well made  i bought it for myself to go on walks running but my mom really liked it so i let her keep it  the colors are so pretty and the blade is definitely sharp      
167,5.0,                       had to buy a second one because i lost my first one  so cute and perfect if you are opening boxes all the time like i am lol   closes easily with a guard in place and stays closed  very safe if you handle correctly     
168,5.0,                       i have bought  this knife before in other colors as gifts and for myself  and this was for my knife which i had misplaced these knives are aesthetically pleasing  well made and do stand up to a great deal i would recommend them to anyone from boy scouts to preppers  all around good knife to carry      
169,5.0,                       i didn t need another knife but i liked the look of this one   then i saw the reviews  then i saw the price   buying one at that point was a no brainer   even if it was crap  it was only      when it arrived  i got the rainbow titanium one  i couldn t be happier   the style and quality of this knife is as good or better than any knife i have purchased and a fraction of the price   i plan to buy several more and keep one in my truck  bug out bag  and anywhere else i might need a good knife   for the price you will not find a better or cooler looking knife   feels well made  looks great and all at basically a disposable price      
170,4.0,                       everything about this knife is perfect  only wish it could be sharper  it s easy to do normal stuff with it like opening packages and stuff but sometimes it struggles if it s layered enough  if it was sharp enough to glide through paper  i would give it a five star      
171,5.0,                       i love this knife  its pretty to look at and hella sharp  the price was perfect  and the clip makes it wearable under clothes  its kinda hard to open and retract but could be me and my hand muscles  enjoy       
172,4.0,                       the spring assist leaves much to be desired  it s virtually not even spring assisted      
173,5.0,                       so beautiful  the lock was confusing and i couldn t close it without watching a youtube video     
174,5.0,                       this knife is great  i absolutely love the rainbow color  it looks so cool  this flip open feature work wonderfully  it takes a bit of force  but not too much  i can easily open and close it with one hand the blade is super sharp  i use it to cut all sorts of stuff now  it has a nice balanced weight to it as well  i ve thrown it at some stumps and it sticks almost every time  overall  this knife is awesome and a great deal  i definitely plan on buying some as gifts      
175,5.0,                       this knife was a great purchase  the quality of for the price  cant really beat it  i also got it in less than   days  super sharp blade  the lock feature is great  i personally can t open it with one hand  i ve never been able to do that to be fair  but it opens easily and closes gently  happy with my purchase      
176,5.0,                       son wanted a pocket knife for a gift  he loved the design and the easy open feature      
177,5.0,                       it is nice and sharp  and easy to use  i wanted a pocket knife for protection and this doesn t disappoint me      
178,5.0,                       if anyone takes my knife i ll know who it is      
179,5.0,                       extremely sharp  doesn t come open too easily  but still very easy to open  making it safe  the metal looks just like in the picture  which i ve had a lot of people compliment me on  no problems with anything sticking or parts coming loose and i ve had it for a few months now  great for around the house  the barn  fishing  moving  and letting annoying people know they need to mind their business        
180,5.0,                       i love this knife  i have been wanting to get a new pocket knife for a while and i am so happy with this one  seems very sturdy and fits in my hand well  i love the coloring also  it s probably the main reason i even bought this  i also love that it has a bottle opener and a window breaker  it seems very sharp  and for someone like me who mainly wants it for protection self defense  i think this would do the job just fine      
181,5.0,                       you can not beat the price for this knife  very nice product      
182,2.0,                       this knife is very sharp but i can t figure out how to close it   no instructions came with it   as i said  the blade is very sharp and i feel it is dangerous to not know how to close it so i may just have to dispose it so i don t cut my hands      
183,5.0,                       this knife is not only pretty but very functional  this is my favorite knife i ve owned  highly recommend      
184,5.0,                       i only paid about     for this knife  and i have to say that this is about the best knife i have owned for that price   it easily compares to similar knives that run for       it has  some heft and is quite sturdy   the blade came fairly sharp  and  in to place securely both open and closed   while the can opener is only accessible in the open position  the handle is long enough  i don t feel like i m going to cut myself using it   honestly  i think i ll be using the beautiful blade for quite some time      
185,5.0,                       i love this knife  i bought a second one after i lost my first one  i love the color and the finish actually holds up pretty well over time  eventually it gets scuffed up a little bit  but no more than any other knife  it comes razor sharp and holds well  also the blade is fairly resistant to bending  the bottle opener is also a nice touch and works really well  the knife is thick enough that it sits nicely in your hands but is thin enough that i don t notice in my pocket after   minutes     
186,1.0,                       i really like the color of the knife that i got  rainbow  and i was looking forward to getting it  but when i got it i tried to open it and for some reason it just wouldn t budge  i wore gloves so my finger wouldn t slip and i used both my hands and nothing  i looked closely and there s a piece that is broken off near the trigger nudge  i m just upset that it came like this      
187,2.0,                       extremely disappointed  the blade looks great but the handle arrived with chipped paint on the clip and the blade does not open smoothly  and apparently the seller doesn t accept returns  this was intended to be a gift but i would be too embarrassed to give this to someone with chipped paint  it looks used      
188,5.0,                       i bought this for personal protection and was kind of nervous because it was so cheap  but when this came in the mail i was shocked  not only it is literally beautiful  it s very sharp  it s definitely not a small knife  but it s perfect to throw in your purse or your jacket pocket      
189,2.0,                       had to get   stitches today  got this brand new on      this knife is not safe  it does not lock correctly and gets stuck very easily  it s gorgeous but not worth the trouble      
190,3.0,                       i mean this knife is pretty cool  like good for the money and stuff  but its not sharp  i even tried sharpening it but it just doesnt make it sharp  it looks cool  but it isnt comftorable to hold  also spring assist hurts my finger when i press it  but o well  also the tip of the blade is bent  came like that and i was a bit dissapointed  this is my first real pocket knife but i mean its cool and fun  like it has a bottle opener and stuff  i would recommend it if u r looking for something cheap     
191,1.0,                       this is a waste of money  when i received the knife  i opened it once and it won t close  it s locked in place  clearly not a well made product   invest in a better made knife      
192,4.0,                       shipping  pretty quick even as i live in canada  bubble lined envelope was used and the wrapping on the outside was good  inside the packaging tho not so much  this is more of the manufacturer s problem tho knife  feels pretty solid in hand but not too heavy  screws are tight and blade is solidly mounted  the blade is shaped pretty well and the  rainbow  finish is evenly coated on  opening mechanism is smooth and feels satisfying  closing lock is a bit hard to push away but still acceptable  black anodizing on the body looks good but not very durable  it s not rubbing off per say but can be scratched fairly easily  some how clipping it on my jeans induced a few scratches and then when i used it to open a bottle of beer it did a bit of damage as well  doesn t bother me much but something to keep in mind for heavy duty users or perfectionist  ergonomics are okay  certain holding positions are better as it has a curve to its handle  main issue is probably factory defects  have   scratches right out of the box as well as a semi rounded screw quick summerypros  looks cool  solid feel  smooth action  sharpened bladecons  minor factory defects  ok ergonomics  need to open blade to use bottle opener     
193,5.0,                       it s a knife  it s sharp  opens smooth  lock feature so you don t cut your finger off      
194,5.0,                       really like this knife  works and looks great  just didn t come very sharp  but that s ok i had purchased a knife sharpener and fixed that      
195,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          doesn t lock at all  and not eligible for return  it s worse than useless  it s super dangerous      
196,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i have had this knife for almost a year now and i m in love  it is still incredibly sharp and i only sharpen it every month or so  it opens easily but i ve never had it accidentally open on me  the assist gets easier to use the longer you have it  i carry this knife every day and i use it about that often as well  i m an extremely clumsy person and i drop it constantly  as you can tell from the pictures the paint chips off after dropping it about a hundred times  and i m not light handed with it so it is extremely durable  i don t see myself having to buy a new one anytime soon but if i ever lose it i m definitely getting another one of these knives      
197,5.0,                       awesome product  great addition and would highly recommend      
198,5.0,                       perfect for my under eyes   love this stuff  little goes a long way   set with setting powder and we re good to go      
199,3.0,                       this is one really good looking knife   i love the finish and it s very sharp   unfortunately i find it very hard to open  i don t have the greatest hand strength but don t struggle this bad with other knives   i don t know if it s a feature of the series or i just got one that s really though   for this reason it will be a bob bag and camping knife and not an every day carry for me since i am unable to open it one handed      
200,5.0,                       we like these knives so much that we each have our own and we ve now lost two and replaced with the same kind  thank goodness they re inexpensive        
201,5.0,                       super awesome for the price   would have liked it a bit more sharper     
202,5.0,                       nice knife till some one stole it from my daughters car        
203,5.0,                       i love my knife  i keep it in the car with me all the time     
204,5.0,                       i was so pleased when i received my purchase in the mail  the knife is exactly as pictured  it is easy to use  and fits well in my back pocket  women reading this  it will fit in your jeans  i was just as surprised as you are     men reading this  women s jeans have notoriously small back pockets  i don t have a single complaint  in fact  i want to buy one for all my girlfriends      
205,4.0,                       ive bought   of these now  pink  grey  and oil  and they are a decent low cost knife  the grey one i sent to my dad as a basic work knife and he said after a couple of tries he has gotten a decent edge to stay on it and uses it as his edc  i haven t tried to put anything other than the edge that came on the pink and oil slick ones as i just keep them around for small projects and one in my car  the pink one was a bit sticky stiff at first but has since been fine      
206,5.0,                       warning  this knife is extremely sharp  but it s so beautiful  i got it mainly for show as well as self defense  probably will never have to use it but always safe to have  and it seems perfect  it pops out fast and it took me a second to realize how to put the blade back but once you have it down  it s perfect      
207,5.0,                       super cool knife  i got this for self defense and feel much safer with it  i just purchased more because at this price  you can buy a few of you really want to feel prepared  for    i now have peace of mind and feel safe  this is a really good quality knife too  the rainbow color is so cool too     
208,3.0,                       very pretty knife  love this knife because of the color   however its not very sharp and it gets dull very fast  nevertheless its a cheap pretty knife that i still will use everyday at work     
209,2.0,                       not that great  it was hard to open  so it s not great for anything  but to show      
210,5.0,                       this is a great knife for the price  it s very sharp and very well made  i was very pleasantly surprised        
211,5.0,                       this is the  th time i bought this knife   i keep buying it in different color  and the quality of this knife is awesome   you won t be disappointed     
212,5.0,                       definitely took alittle extra time to be delivered but i have received my knife and it s beautiful  seller was very professional and kept me updated bc i thought i was getting my money stolen with no tracking number but due to the holidays just took a few days longer  worth the wait forsure        
213,5.0,                       feels good in the hand  is convenient to arthritic old fossil  holds an edge  that s what it is supposed to do thank goodness it does it  i m happy      
214,2.0,                       i was pretty disappointed with this   if you choose to buy this make sure that when you flip the knife out that the metal part slides over and locks the knife into place   mine doesn t unless you flip the knife out very hard   that is a huge safety hazard and i feel like everyone who considers this should be aware of that factor      
215,5.0,                       i get endless compliments on this knife  and i use it constantly   i love the mini screwdriver at the end  i did have a hard time initially figuring out how to close it   there s a tab you push inwards near the handle to fold it in  super durable and the cool color stays even with extended use      
216,5.0,                       they came early  i like the color  good cheap knifes  felt a little dull but i can sharpen them up      
217,3.0,                       the item came very quickly  the only reason why i did not give this product a full five star was because i was very disappointed with how the tip seems to be chipped off and the aluminum hand holder seems to have many scratch marks like it has been used before  i also found a dented little dot on the stainless steel part and was not happy with that minor spec  otherwise i would have rated this product   star     
218,5.0,                       i got this for personal protection  i really like quality of this knife  i bought one for my boyfriend      
219,5.0,                       great looking and feeling knife  came pretty sharp right out of the box  bottle cap opener works great  and the spring assisted blade is very nice  has minor impurities in the handle on the blade  but nothing that would affect it  and for the price you can guess that it might  i love the blade though  have had   friends order it because theyve liked it so much      
220,5.0,                       it is a lot better than i expected all the reviews on here about its being bad remember it s a    dollar knife and it does it s job perfectly  it s extremely sharp so watch out i cut myself the first day i got it  the cut wasn t deep but it just sliced my finger like there was nothing there no resistance at all  overall worth the money      
221,3.0,                       too big and too many gadgets for my taste for a pocket knife   i keep my knife in the same pocket as my cell phone and this knife is just not a good combination   otherwise works really well   a little too big for my taste to keep in a pocket so it s out by my toolbox for quick easy use when i m out there      
222,5.0,                       i mostly use the knife to unbox the amazon packages and to do review most of the time it s really good product to have if you need it for survival also for packages      
223,4.0,                       a little smaller than i expected  but looks great nonetheless  the rainbow finish is forged in  not coated or plated like some other colored blades  so i would expect it to last for a long time  handle is either a hardened plastic or a lightweight metal  but feels sturdy  the only issue is a design flaw for the bottle opener where you would need to keep the blade in an open position to access it  which leaves your fingers susceptible to cutting while using it  otherwise an excellent little knife for the price      
224,5.0,                       these knives are great for such a cheap price   i m on my second one after beating the heck out of my old one at work for over a year   i m in grocery and don t always remember my  safety cutter    in a pinch the glass break on the end splits packing tape better than keys and i don t freak everyone out using the blade   my  st one didn t break  one of the screws came undone and i lost it  i ll be adding locktite to my new one      
225,5.0,                       love this knife  very sharp  aesthetics are first rate      
226,5.0,                       very beautiful and nice  kinda hard to open but once you get the hang of it its amazing      
227,1.0,                       this knife is supposed to be an easy open and close that can be done with one hand   i had difficulty opening it  and i can t close it  at all   i m afraid of injuring myself if i continue to try      
228,5.0,                       very pretty pretty big came with a good price     
229,5.0,                       i ordered this knife for protection  since we recently had a car jacking in a nearby strip mall that i frequent   this was in broad daylight  so pretty scary for a senior citizen   will keep this in my pocket  just in case   opens pretty easily   quickly with a little practice   can be ready to go at a moments notice   just what i was looking for      
230,5.0,                       i initially purchased this for a friend  but i ended up loving it so much that i had to get one for myself too  not only is the blade beautiful  it s a great knife  the colors on the blade are just as vibrant as in the photo  it s sharp and has a good weight to it  i personally can t figure out how to open it one handed  but i think that s more due to my weak baby hands than any fault of the knife  i ve now had it for over a year and it hasn t failed me yet  i haven t tried to use either the bottle opener or the glass breaker  so i can t speak for those      
231,5.0,                       this knife looks exactly like it does in the picture as it does in real life  the color is very beautiful and vibrant and doesn t seem to be coming off at all  super sharp edges and tip  has a loop so you can put it on a key chain or lanyard  its a little heavy in weight  but that is expected in a great knife like this one  cuts very very smoothly and swiftly  i carry this in my bag on campus just in case of emergencies or when i need to open up a package      
232,4.0,                       pretty good knife  the spring can get a little fickle at times  other than that  it s a sturdy knife      
233,5.0,                       this knife is sharp  very easy and quick to open  compact  and overall is a very good knife  even for     it would still be worth it  but for around the price it is now   it s a definite great value  the only negatives are that the anodized black pain rubs off easily  and it can only be opened when gripping it a certain weird way  other than that  it s great      
234,5.0,                       this knife is such a steal  i absolutely adore it    it is so unique looking and i love chameleon colors  definately recommend to anyone who wants another knife  you can never have too many        
235,3.0,                       love the design but it is definitely cheap  my husband loved this knife and used it at work for about   months before screws started falling out  he is hard on literally everything  but buy with caution      
236,5.0,                       it is a cool knife   i got it for my grandson s birthday   he loves it      
237,5.0,                       it works well and the cost is good  i have bought   of them     
238,4.0,                       i ve had this knife for approximately two months and it has held up fairly well  two of the torx screws that keep the knife together have fallen out at some point but i have replaced them with two phillips screws that fit  this isn t a huge problem since the knife was only   dollars  however  i do have to re tighten the screws  phillips and torx  every week or so to keep the knife from essentially falling apart  i rated this knife   stars when i first received it but i have since changed it to   stars for the screw issues  still a great knife for the money but it just can t take the punishment of an everyday carry      
239,4.0,                       for under seven dollars how can you beat it  great for every day carry  nice to know it s in a pocket  get some micro torx star screwdrivers because all the fasteners will loosen up very quickly  keep them tight    no problem      
240,5.0,                       i ve had this knife for over a year and it did me well i used it for cutting open boxes  cutting ropes  plastic  all sorts of other things it did get a little loose after a while but i guess that s just wear and tear and then i accidentally ran over it with my truck    and that was the end of it but amazing knife overall     
241,5.0,                       value you for your money  also very beautiful colors      
242,4.0,                       solid knife  good built doesnt feel flimsy  assited open works great  reliable  bottle opener and emergency glass breaker are nice extra feautures  bottle opener could be better though not the right shape to grab a good grip of a bottle cap and you have to open it every time  have not use this for anything heavy  but does the job for everyday use      
243,5.0,                       got this for my sister  she loves it  nice and sharp  and pretty  plus i love the spring action       
244,5.0,                       does good  it was hecka sharp when i got it  but ive read some others didnt get it as sharp or blunt  if you got yourself a nice stone you can sharpen this real nice  its kept up very well   for the price i love it      
245,5.0,                       overall   very happy with this nice   the  rainbow  finish is a real eye catcher and my friends love the look of it as well   sharp and does the job well pro s  good blade finish and is sharp enough to get you going  nice  weight  feel  doesn t feel cheap  nice  spring  action to open the blade con s  very minor con  oil seeps from the hinge where they over oiled the spring action but this clears up in no time      
246,1.0,                       not giving a high rating       can t close the blade         
247,5.0,                       with such a low price point  maybe my expectations were low  but this is actually a very nice knife for general use very durable  great lock  nice look  and easy to sharpen      
248,5.0,                       got this for my step dad instead of the adoption papers cause he may suck and be majorly ungrateful  but man does he love knives  good size and weight  color is true  i got the colorful one btw   lock is good  worth it      
249,5.0,                       bought it for fun and just opening boxes  etc  great knife for great price  not sure for more critical things      
250,5.0,                       my son wanted a rainbow spring blade knife like the one i already owned  we could no find the exact same model so settled on this one  what a great knife at a great price  the thumb knob for opening is super slick and the blade locks tight when open  it is easy to close with minimal effort  the blade is pretty sharp right out of the box  but it can be honed to razor sharp with a little work on a sharpening stone  the grip is fantastic even when wet  highly recommend as a carry around everyday work blade      
251,5.0,                       very pretty knife  good quality      
252,5.0,                       this is beautiful  just as it is pictured  quick shipping  i m not sure how sturdy it is  i bought it as a gag gift for my friend  it does look like it could be a handy little knife though  it is comfortable to hold      
253,4.0,                       i was thinking because it s not very expensive  this knife would be cheaply made   i was surprised however to find that it is actually very solid this is an excellent knife in both aesthetics and construction if i were to have any suggestions for the manufacturer  it would be to put the grey camo body  tac force tf     series assisted opening folding knife     inch closed  on this frame still a great product thank you tim bartosic     
254,5.0,                       i really like this knife  it s so pretty and is a great price  the knife itself is really sharp  i definitely recommend this item      
255,5.0,                       bought for a camping kayak trip and was so handy to have  the easy flip out feature is cool  it s a sharp and beautiful product  wore on my wetsuit waists band and often forgot it was there      
256,5.0,                       if you hold it in your hand  and open the knife from the back with your index finger  you can open this knife easily with a little practice  safety spring catch prevents knife from closing on your fingers while using      
257,5.0,                       i love this blade  which is versatile for many purposes  opening boxes  cutting rope  etc  as well as for emergency and or security   blade is super sharp and easy to open if needed or in case of an emergency  plus  i love the rainbow color of the blade  fierce  but girly    d     
258,5.0,                       small enough to fit in my pocket but large and sharp enough to feel confident to use in a defense situation should it arise  i love the little clip that i can clip to my pants or pocket  it doesn t draw attention  i also love the colors  after seeing mine  my dad wants one too   he was surprised at the good price that i paid for good quality      
259,3.0,                       very well made and good craftsmanship   opened it as soon as it was delivered and it is still open   no directions included and nobody can figure out how to retract the blade      
260,5.0,                       good quality very pretty  got as a gift  my brother will love it         
261,2.0,                       the grip is not comfortable   a thumb stud would work better than a finger stud   the belt clip is pointed in the wrong direction  when you pull the knife out of your pocket you have to turn it over to open it   if does not have a can opener  it has a bottle opener and to use it the blade has to be extended       not the best way of doing things   i could have picked it up at the local flea market for the same price quality      
262,5.0,                       awesome and durable knife for the price  the straight portion of the blade is long enough to easily sharpen to ensure it stays sharp as long as you need it to       would recommend for a spring assisted knife      
263,1.0,                       i did not receive the correct knife   i ordered the purple blue color looking one and received this  also this knife doesn t lock when opened  it easily folds back close  what if it s an emergency and i need to take action with the knife and it closes up on me       
264,5.0,                       bought two for myself and my daughter  it s very nice knife and easy to use     
265,5.0,                       love the color and weight      
266,1.0,                       i wanted to like this but as others have said  it s not sharp and it wouldn t close  it s forever stuck in the open position  one star because it is a beautiful knife and i was able to get refunded  now i have to look for a knife that will close and is sharp      
267,5.0,                       bought this for my brother   it looks cool and seems to work well     
268,5.0,                       great buy wish it had more features     
269,5.0,                       i lost my my knife  and picked this one up   it is terrific and a great price   i use it all the time   i like the window breaker and bottle opener that are built in   i love the easy opening blade and the serrated part of the blade   if you are looking for a good  inexpensive knife  look no further   you cannot go wrong     
270,5.0,                       beautiful knife  no one can believe what i paid  got another one      
271,5.0,                       i ve purchased several of these for friend s birthdays  i ve had mine for over a year and gave it to my son and got myself a new one for what you pay  as long as you treat it nice  it will last      
272,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i absolutely love this knife  its so gorgeouse and the lock feature works perfectly  its easy to use and get used to  the colour on the metal is vibrant and gorgeouse  fits lovely in my hands  thank you so much      
273,5.0,                         stars for product   looks great  but i got a defective one where metal thumb release for closing was bent in too much    preventing the spring assist opening to work   but    gave   stars because of fast  no hassle  return accepted and refund issued      
274,5.0,                       i don t use my knife super often  but this little knife works for opening packages and cutting yarn while i crochet  beautiful blade coloring  fits my purposes  good knife      
275,5.0,                       there is no lock feature but i think it great working kinda hard to open at first but it works just fine now  love it looks exactly like picture     
276,5.0,                       it s a spring assisted folding knife  it looks pretty cool  it s got the green and blue and yellow finish on it  also it s got a bottle opener and what appears to be a screwdriver head  so technically a multitool  blade is very sharp     
277,5.0,                       i collect knives  great price and selection from amazon  amazing deals     
278,5.0,                       i love this product  it is stylish  easy to open  intriguing to the eyes  but i believe the paint eventually wears off  and it gives you the feeling of added security  i will surely buy this product again  thanks for the opportunity      
279,4.0,                       like this knife very much  absolutely love the colors  just a little big heavy for me  i am a female and like to keep this in my bag  my only other complaint is i wish it was easier to open  it can be a little tough  otherwise i love it      
280,5.0,                       a guy i hooked up with stole my original knife so i bought the same one again and i still love it  makes me feel so safe and fits in my pocket  purse and bra if i needed it to     
281,3.0,                       good knife  but doesn t lock in open position easily   be careful to make sure it s locked before use  could fold back onto your fingers      
282,1.0,                       this arrived with the lock bar not working   tried to push it out to make it lock and be safer  which helps a little  but doesn t always work still so can t trust it         
283,5.0,                       bigger than i expected but easy to handle  and looks awesome         
284,5.0,                       very nice  great deal     
285,5.0,                       i love this tac force knife  the flipper is very smooth and is the best i have ever seen  even compared to my friend s more expensive kershaw  the blade came very sharp and the serrations work like magic on rope  the size is perfect for me and most of my other friends love it too  the bottle opener works perfectly and the glass breaker doubles as a flat head screwdriver  the steel is very corrosion resistant and has not rusted yet  overall this knife is better than more expensive knives and i think as a knife enthusiast it s worth around          
286,5.0,                       this is a shockingly nice knife for    bucks   lightweight  an easy but firm feeling action on the spring assist and it comes hella sharp   would definitely recommend      
287,5.0,                       this is the second knife i have owned of this brand and they are great  this one needed some playing with to loosen it up to easly open  reliable for opening and cutting everyday things  it is kinda heavy but it is all metal     
288,3.0,                       a       knife   it works like one  i use it to open plastic bags so it s adequate for the task      
289,5.0,                       this knife is definitely solid  sharp and has a great price point  i wanted something around for opening boxes at work  or just whenever needed and i figured i might as well get something badass  i love the rainbow effect for a more feminine touch i ve gotten a lot of compliments on it at work      
290,5.0,                       great knife  it comes very sharp  and has no trouble opening or closing  the colors are great  although im not sure if its actually heat treated  most likely just painted  on  i use this knife every day at work  i always have to cut small branches because i work for a landscaping business and it has had no problem getting through      
291,2.0,                       lock feature broke after opening a couple times   and completely broke in half after a couple uses      
292,5.0,                       works even now after a year  the blade does dull though      
293,5.0,                       what a great knife   yes it s pretty  but also the perfect utility knife  it has a regular blade and serrated so good for cutting many things  including rope  great for camping  hunting and fishing  has a bottle opener as well  weight is good and it fit my smaller hands nicely  i didn t expect such a solidly constructed knife for the price   i will definitely be buying more items from this company      
294,5.0,                       for an under     knife this is get my wife saw this knife and decided she wanted the knife   ended up purchase another one for another family member that liked my wife s new knife      
295,5.0,                       if youre confused you just have to push down the middle part to close it i couldnt figure it out for like a few days and left it open      
296,1.0,                       the locking mechanism doesn t even work and i had it in my pocket and the thing literally stabbed me  don t buy this  i d give it a     if i could  the blade is flimsy and all around it wasn t made good      
297,5.0,                       i own many knives  right now this one is my favorite  looks beautiful  very sharp  besides how could you not love a knife that has a bottle opener on it  fits in my hand very well and the spring blade works perfectly  awesome knife      
298,5.0,                       great knife   had mine stolen  had to get another   i recommend  to get a landky ms blade medic it this knife is going to be your main go to   i love the multi color blade  sticks out better than the rest  the assist opener is hard at first  but one you play with it  the stiffness will go away  there is no play in the blade  stays in place during use  and just showing off to friends   that will not steal it   they will be impressed with it   it is a knife that could sell i the        range  got mine for around   bucks  plus a bottle opener and glass breaker   cant go wrong with this great knife to add to your collection       
299,5.0,                       value for money     
300,2.0,                       this is very poorly made and does not open or close easily      
301,5.0,                       really sturdy and nice knife  i bought it as a joke for my brother because it s rainbow colored  but i think he might actually like it because it s bad ass      
302,2.0,                       i have purchased   of these  the black and the rainbow  the black one is great  but the rainbow does not lock open  the bar that keeps the blade out and locked doesn t move over into position  and is difficult to manually move  i m just glad i didn t put blind faith into the knife and end up with a severed finger lol  other than that it looks nice      
303,5.0,                       super great quality for the price   easy to open quickly as well  love it      
304,5.0,                       awesome knife and extremely sharp  would recommend this to anyone      
305,5.0,                       love it  it s very sharp too     
306,5.0,                       great price for a great knive      
307,5.0,                       i get a lot of compliments on the pearlescent finish on this knife  i use it almost everyday and it is a good knife  very comfortable to hold      
308,5.0,                       use at work and home for opening boxes   this knife is my favorite   sharp  easy to open and close  and colorful      
309,5.0,                       love these knifes  i lost my last one  hope they never stop making these or change the design  they are a good quality feeling knife and pretty to look at  they come sharp  i can cut a cigar with it      
310,5.0,                       super nice knife  super cute  good value for the money  i couldn t figure out how to shut it  but other than that i love it      
311,5.0,                       this knife arrived today in a single rectangular cardboard box            i am very impressed with the sharpness of the kn ife  i got a piece of paper and the knife sliced right through it the point of the knife is extremely pointy i like the overall durable feel this knife has  the clip that holds the knife to my pants is very sturdy too  i also like the less than lethal butt of the knife which could in self defense cause pain but wouldnt kill the assailant     
312,1.0,                       this knife does not work  not only was it delivered frozen  but you have to use two damn hands to open it  a spring assisted knife is supposed to be opened with one hand       
313,5.0,                       arrived on time  as expected  in excellent condition color saturation is excellent and product is just as shown online love it would definitely order again excellent function   quality materials     
314,5.0,                    esta muy linda y manejable y aun muy buen precio        
315,5.0,                       great knife for the price  the blade comes very sharp and keeps its edge  the handle is a bit unwieldy but it s nothing you can t get used to  i ve bought two more of these know and it s become a great daily driver      
316,5.0,                       seems like a really good knife especially for about         
317,4.0,                       good     
318,5.0,                       good     
319,4.0,                       the knife is beautiful  but hard to close      
320,5.0,                       i love my pocket knife got one for me and my sister she loves it as well  very easy to open and close  i didn t have a problem with my knife at all  it is very sharp as well      
321,2.0,                       i ve owned one of these knives before and it was absolutely beautiful  it opened smoothly  and the blade was very sharp i lost it and decided to order another one this new one was absolutely dreadful  the assisted open was very stiff and it never opened completely  the locking mechanism didn t fit properly  so the blade could easily fold back onto your fingers the only redeeming quality of this knife is the rainbow finish and the sharp blade      
322,5.0,                       love this knife     i lost my other knife in the river and this knife has taken its place  i always have it in my purse  works for everything i need a knife for        
323,5.0,                       for being such a low cost knife  i was surprised by how durable and well made it is  i ve had it for several weeks and it is still extremely sharp   i mostly use it to open boxes  so not heavy use  but i ve had similarly priced knives that went dull after a week of use   and it looks cool  which is always good      
324,5.0,                       you really can t ask for a better knife for the price  i took this knife camping and it worked out great  doesn t hurt that it s so cute too      
325,5.0,                       this brand is my favorite none of the knives i ve ever bought from them have ever disappointed me     
326,5.0,                       i like this knife a lot  the colors are cool and it s been pretty darn sharp after all this time  it s pretty safe too there hasn t been a situation where its opened on it own  i d buy another for just around the house      
327,5.0,                       awesome knive  as advertised     
328,4.0,                       i have gotten a lot of compliments for this  pretty knife    it cuts well  and is very durable  so far    my only complaint is the knife is much heavier than most pocket knives   this is a plus for durability  but a minus for usability   the knife fits comfortably in my extra large hands      
329,5.0,                       i love this knife so much  i now catch myself playing with it  it is also super sharp   don t be like me and play with the edges by running your finger over it  will most likely order more      
330,5.0,                       good knife for the price  blade nice and sharp and entire design of knife performs exactly as it should      
331,5.0,                       great knife and it s rainbow color is a nice touch  used it for the first time cutting a proper sized stick off a broken branch to stoke the barbeque pit at  the park  has a very sharp edge  cutting through the wood pretty easily with reasonable application of effort      
332,5.0,                       i love it such a life saver  i carry it around for protection and definitely makes me feel safer knowing i can protect myself  ive had other knife that were flimsy and breakable this one is super sturdy     
333,5.0,                       just like the picture   very cool     
334,5.0,                       i ve had this for about a year now   still use it almost everyday  the black paint has chipped barely but it doesn t bother me  very sharp      
335,4.0,                       i overall like the look of the knife  found the rainbow shine pretty  although the only thing i don t like is the little numb to flip the blade open  it s a bit hard to open the knife with it so i just grab the blade instead to open it     
336,4.0,                       i ve had this for a few weeks now and the only reason i m not giving it a five star review is the belt clip  the metal on it is weak and highly malleable and as such if you move around a lot like i do  the belt clip is going to loosen up  i can t tell you how many times it s fallen under my drivers seat when i get into the car if i don t adjust it further into my pocket to re iterate  however  the knife itself is great  the action to flip the blade out is excellent and i love the finish      
337,5.0,                       i ve been looking for a knife this beautiful for a long time  and the price seemed too good to be true  i m so glad i bought this knife  i m a woman with small hands  and while this knife is a little on the heavier side  it feels sturdy  and the assisted open is a huge plus      
338,5.0,                       this bad boyyy is heavy and once the blade is out watch out it is super sharp  i love it i feel way more safe then i have ever been      
339,4.0,                       it s very sharp i just wish it had a seatbelt cutter in case of emergencies      
340,5.0,                       bought this because it looked cool and thought one of my boys might like it  but i ended up keeping it to myself  this is a very well built knife  i half expected it to fall apart after a couple uses based on the price  but once it arrived i was very impressed with the quality      
341,2.0,                       for some reason the knife i received is stiff on opening  i have had the same tac knives that have never had this problem      
342,1.0,                       within a few uses  knife will not stay locked  very dangerous  almost cut my finger off      
343,5.0,                       great knife for the price  i love the chromatic colors and the assisted spring  sharpen the knife every so often  the blade did come a bit dull but nothing a stone cant fix  bought it for protection but luckily have yet to use      
344,1.0,                       very difficult to open   i ve bought a few and this one you need both hands to open   don t know if it s just this color   the gray ones are fine     
345,5.0,                       very good knifi      
346,5.0,                       works well  nice for fishing and screwing around  if you want a high quality piece then i am most certain you will need to spend more than   bucks you cry babies      
347,5.0,                       i purchased the  rainbow  one because it looked really cool and it lived up to the expectations i was hoping for it came sharp  well packaged  and is very sturdy  if it was a dollar or two cheaper that would be more worth it for some people  but for me i m satisfied and it s a great pocket knife for me      
348,5.0,                       love this knife  great for cutting vinyl floors  drywall  etc   i use it daily for my work and it is great  i wanted a knife that didn t have the replaceable blades and this is a great tool for just what i needed  plus the color is very cool and spot on to what is pictured      
349,4.0,                       bulkier than expected  knife isn t spring assisted  which is fine  but opening it requires a level of force i wasn t anticipating build quality seems good  knife was sharp out of the box  time will tell if the knife has durability or not      
350,5.0,                       this is one of the best knives i have ever bought  everyone at work is so jealous      
351,5.0,                       daughter got this for her boyfriend  he loved it     
352,5.0,                       i have has this knife for around   years  through multiple jobs and moves  and as i moved into my new place this month i was thinking how amazing it is that it is still slicing open boxes and packages  as well as slicing through cardboard  and i have never even sharpened it  worth the money  also  it s pretty    stars      
353,5.0,                       i absolutely love this nice  it s amazing and sharp and really shiny  i was hesitating to buy this but it s really good can cut very well     
354,5.0,                       the knife feels great in the hand  the quick action is dependable and sturdy  all sharp edges perform well  looks good too      
355,5.0,                       i love my knife  i carry it in my purse and always seem to need it for one reason or another  open boxes or what not  love the rainbow colored blade   very good quality      
356,4.0,                       would recommend  mine came a bit  defective   it doesn t lock on its own  i have to open it with force to engage the lock or else it the mechanism will just overlap on its own and not engage   picture included i like to believe i drew the bad luck on that part but still would recommend to anyone      
357,5.0,                       knife looks great and is extremely sharp  will shave the hair on your arm easily it took a lot of force to open with the finger assist switch  but can be adjusted by loosening the hinge with a small star bit      
358,5.0,                       this is the second one i ve bought because we love the first  i had bought my wife one and she loves it so much we bought one for my nephew who collects knives      
359,5.0,                       very sharp and the screws don t come loose like most knives on amazon  it gets you your moneys worth but the color does come off quite easy  great pocket knife but if you like the rainbow design don t use it too much     
360,4.0,                       i love this knife  it mostly has to do with the color  i use it at work mainly to cut zip ties and cable tie  the serrated edge often works better for those kind of cuts the only reason i gave it four stars is because it gets dull after a while  but you ll be hard pressed to find any knife that doesnt get dull after some use    over all a great lil knife      
361,5.0,                       very pretty  opens easily and quickly and heavy duty  seems worth the         
362,5.0,                       very good it is sharp but not too sharp to where you can cut yourself easily     
363,5.0,                       love     
364,5.0,                       pretty and useable  exactly as expected      
365,4.0,                       i recently became a machine shop tech and a knife is a must have  i m also a girl and love to brag about that fact through my gear  even my safety glasses are blinged out  although this knife might not be the best quality  it is great for its price  it s sharp  but the color fades easily  also  the bottle opener is a bit too wide and takes some placement effort      
366,5.0,                       love this knife  my mom and i now have matching ones      
367,5.0,                       beautiful  and very sharp   great for the price      
368,5.0,                       i love the colors of it and its an inexpensive and great knife   i actually bought two of them but at some point the screws do come loose after a lot of use so watch out for that unless you have a precision screwdriver handy      
369,5.0,                       extremely nice knife very impressed very well built very sharp so be careful     
370,5.0,                       u will like it     
371,5.0,                       pretty sharp right out the box     
372,5.0,                       love the stainless steel iridescent blade  easy to clean  no rust  great quality product  sturdy      
373,5.0,                       a really nice and attractive decorative knife for a gift      
374,5.0,                       best knife i ve ever had  except for my k bar  inexpensive  ultra sharp  great ergonomics even with clip  with a little use  opening gets real smooth  and a snap to close  fits well in side pocket  so it s easy to carry  and it s comforting to have a little security in your pocket  bought a second one to carry and practice throwing  a real value for the price      
375,5.0,                       this knife is first off really pretty but also extremely useful  it is insanely sharp and compact  i like that i can carry it in my backpack without worrying about cutting anything  it stays locked and it easy to open when needed  i highly recommend     
376,5.0,                       this knife looks awesome   it is a really good deal and the quality is quite nice   all metal and has built in tools such as  a seat belt cutter  which is what the teeth are for  and a glass breaker which is what you would use the end for and a belt clip   it is a little smaller than i thought but that is good for keeping it concealed  the spring action is nice and the blade comes out the box pretty sharp      
377,5.0,                       so cute and pretty  way more beautiful in person  i needed a new knife for protection and as a tool  and this sharp lil thing is perfect  i love it  let s just hope the rainbow doesn t rub off      
378,5.0,                       i love this knife it s great has a bottle opener and window breaker as well and for only    in not complaining only things i would change is the blade needs to be sharpened  and the flip blade is a little hard to open and shut     
379,3.0,                       it s a nice and sharp knife  but mine wouldn t closed  wore protective gloves to try and close it but it wouldn t even budge  don t know if the lock is stuck or something      
380,5.0,                       love this knife   looks so much better in person  than in the pictures   ordered it since i am a hiker and it clips right on my backpack   i have gotten many compliments on the colors especially when the light hits it   can not go wrong ordering this          
381,3.0,                       won t shut  tried everything      
382,1.0,                       cant close it  dont waste your money  it s very pretty but no way to close  sigh      
383,4.0,                       this is the first knife i have ever bought and i got to be real  i don t know how good it is  but it works great  the colors really look great in good lighting and it is sharp enough to open packages      
384,5.0,                       everyone compliments my husband over this stunning knife thx a     
385,5.0,                       the quality of this knife actually surprised me  it is heavy  and a good quality  i bought this as a christmas gift and can t wait to see how they like it      
386,4.0,                       good look and feel in the hand  well balanced for the price and still feels moderately sharp on most of it   my only complaint was mine had a good flat spot when it came    a lil whetstone cleaned that up just fine with some elbow grease though      
387,5.0,                       this is an excellent quality knife for a cheap price  this just goes to show you don t have to spend a lot of money to get a good folding knife you just need to know which one to purchase  purchase this one it s high quality and just as good as spider co      
388,5.0,                       i just got it because of the colors it is sharp good for use for every day carry     
389,5.0,                       it was a learning curve to figure out how to close it  i don t think i can explain it hear but once you figure it out  or google it  its quite simple      
390,4.0,                       it s a great knife comes very sharp looks like the picture but i can t open it with the trigger it is very hard to open to open it i have to pull the blade out instead of pulling the trigger i tried to loosen the screws that barely made a difference     
391,5.0,                       super sharp and i love the color      
392,5.0,                       love this knife  great value for the money      
393,5.0,                       good price     
394,5.0,                       pretty impressed right off the bat  sturdy  sharp and eye catching  i ll update my review if it breaks within a year the one con i notice is the blade has to be open in order to use the bottle opener  that s pretty inconvenient  if i m opening a beverage i d rather whip out a bic lighter than a   inch blade        
395,5.0,                       this knife is even more beautiful in person  my fianc  loved it      
396,5.0,                       this is one of those knives that gives the most bang for its dollar value  i like this knife so much that i repurchased the same brand after misplacing my other one  the knife is sturdy and maintains its edge quite well  i really enjoy the size of it as well  small enough to fit in my pockets  but big enough to have utility  i really enjoy this brand and reccomend it to anyone looking for a solid knife at an amazing price      
397,2.0,                       screws constantly came loose  and blade went dull fairly quick  i used it to open boxes when i use to work in a grocery store  and now it sits in a drawer with one screw holding the frame together   more like   screws but that s not dramatic   i would not recommend this knife for actual use      
398,5.0,                       great deal  we will see how long it hold up  so far so good     
399,5.0,                       perfect     
400,1.0,                       one of the screws came out within an hour   wrote email to company over a week ago to try to get it fixed but they never responded  gonna return this knife and order a  nd  very poor customer service   knife is fine  nothing special      
401,5.0,                       this is awesome  exactly what i expected  perfect size  design is wonderful  i love the weight of it ps  my kitty is the most beautiful background i ve ever had         
402,5.0,                       if your considering just do it     
403,5.0,                       bought as a gift      
404,5.0,                       it cuts smoothly and has a very nice finish  great quality     
405,5.0,                       i did not expect to receive a knife with this level of quality for this low price   im a very happy camper  thank you      
406,4.0,                       bought this knife months ago use for regular cutting needs such as ropes or tape or boxes  stuff like that  it s durable  hasn t loosened or broken yet  locks fine still and carry it with us  rainbow  metallic design is cool  the jagged and straight parts of blade are handy and convenient  good knife to have for a really good price      
407,5.0,                       loved them so much i bought a few and gave them out at xmas      
408,5.0,                       i love my new knife however the lock feature took me back a bit  i had not had a knife with this type of lock feature so i only figured out how to close it after watching the video that was available on amazon    no instructions      
409,3.0,                       unfortunately  after struggling to open the knife for    minutes  it now no longer closes  perhaps the screws are too tight  i hope i can mess with it to get to close and open properly  however  as it stands now the product is unusable as a pocket knife i got to say  it is very sharp  so that part is good      
410,5.0,                       perfect for my    year old  all this human trafficking i say stick and jab     
411,5.0,                       good quality knife  perfect for outdoor use in the garden and landscaping projects      
412,5.0,                       nice     
413,2.0,                       a little disappointed  i love the look feel sharpness of the knife  however my problem is with the action of the blade  for a  spring assisted  blade its one of the most difficult i ve ever tried opening  even with a little lubricating i cannot for the life of me get this thing to open lock by using the thumb stud  would given a much better review if it opened like its supposed to     
414,5.0,                       this is still my favorite knife  and i still get compliments on it  i ve had it for about a year now and nothing has gone wrong  i even ordered a black one for my dad and it carries it with him every day  also says its a good knife  comes incredibly sharp and has hardly dulled      
415,5.0,                       i absolutely love this knife  it is nice and sturdy  nothing flimsy or cheep about it  and it is very sharp right out of the box  you can only use the bottle opener when its open though  but i don t mind it      
416,5.0,                       u have to push over at the top of the lock  not the bottom  finally figured it out      
417,5.0,                       good craftsmanship  doesn t rust  i keep it in my lunch cooler to cut fruit   dry compartment  im happy   price was right ordered another one for home     
418,3.0,                       this knife arrived quickly  which was a nice surprise  once it was opened  i flipped it right out  but there was an issue  the inner lock and spring assist had issues  the knife would not fling out as it should  and once it was out it wouldn t lock  i was ready to send it back  though after fiddling with it  it finally worked  and flipped out and locked as it s supposed too  i ve ordered one of there before  they are great knives for the price  i am a constant tac force buyer  i am usually very satisfied with their products  this knife has a heavier metal frame which is nice  compared to other hard plastic frames on other tac force models  also  this knife it extremely sharp  cut myself within the first few minutes  the rainbow finish was a nice touch too      
419,5.0,                       i have purchased   of these and every man i give them to love them   i will keep buying them   makes perfect christmas gifts   sharp  durable   great product      
420,5.0,                       i got this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it  it is shiny  looks amazing and fits in the hand really well      
421,4.0,                       it s a very beautiful knife i just wish it didn t get dull easily     
422,4.0,                       not bad at all just use it to open boxes or like plastic stuff pretty useful     
423,4.0,                       very hard to open and close      
424,5.0,                       great assisted opening   quick flick on the thumb tab and the knife snaps open quickly and securely amazing pocket clip   so far this has remained very secure and tight and stays put right where i slide it on haven t had a chance  nor do i want one  to test the window breaker  but it feels like it could do the job      
425,5.0,                       i love the color and the size   i love collecting knives and i was glad when i was opening the box seeing and feeling how sharp the knife was when you knife from stores sometime they are not even sharp and you have to sharpen them  it is a great price for a knife compare in stores where i am from      
426,5.0,                       love it  i take it everywhere      
427,5.0,                       it s a little slippery to hold on to but honestly for the price  it s so much better quality than expected  i ve been using it a lot for work and we re constantly cutting i do have a question  which the rainbow color  i m assuming it s a wrap   what is the best way to clean it  and would it peel the color if i were to sharpen it      
428,5.0,                       cuts deep with little to no pressure      
429,5.0,                       i doubt this knife will stay sharp  but i do love this knife regardless  the  assisted opening  is great  and makes it quick to whip out  cut a box open  and then put away  i d buy it again      
430,5.0,                       best value out there     
431,5.0,                       my boyfriend loves it  its pretty sharp and it only gets occasional use but he hasn t seen any chipping or wear on it      
432,5.0,                       glass breaker feature at the end is hardy and works     
433,4.0,                       material for wrap on the bladecould be better  but then again  it s also not the most expensive in the world  that s really the only negative thing i can say  works perfect for a knifes normal purposes      
434,5.0,                       nice but a little hard to open     
435,5.0,                       great fathers day gift     
436,5.0,                       i like it a lot   really cool looking  it s in my car for emergencies

439,5.0,                       great knife and very cool looking  too  i got the rainbow one  it opens very quickly and easily once you get the hang of it  i have used it to cut through lots of things  the grooved part at the end of the blade is great for cutting through cardboard and rope  great knife for a great price      
440,5.0,                       nice knife     
441,2.0,                       blade is very soft  not hardened steel  bent the sharp portion near the tip with very minimal use with in a few days      
442,5.0,                       i am a woman and wanted something that opens quickly  easy to manipulate  i carry it in my purse      
443,5.0,                       i ve had this knife for two years now  and i carry it everywhere  i use it for work  and around town for handy work      
444,5.0,                       this was a   dollar knife but the quality was unreal very nice feels great seems like a    dollar knife came very sharp this was great  super nice and i own a few    dollar knifes this is my favorite    great job task force i m a happy customer will by again and i may just order some more i just can t believe the great craftsmanship          
445,5.0,                       just got it and so far it is pretty amazing the lock feature works really well love the grip that i get with it on the side and i love that you can lock up the open peice with just a paperclip this thing is very fierce sobe careful where you show this at i would definitely recommend this knife     
446,5.0,                       the price after discount is very inexpensive and the product is of high quality  i also love its appearance      
447,5.0,                       this is an extremely well made knife  very sturdy as well at the colors are a very nice touch  has the weight i like as well      
448,5.0,                       thankfully  this product wasn t just nice to look at  but also very functional  i ve had mine for     years now and i use it fairly regularly  yet the blade is still sharp and i ve only sharpened it once  the iridescent blue purple is aesthetically pleasing  too      
449,4.0,                       very cool looks great  but the bottle opener doesnt work to well and chews the aluminum handle not the steel its ment to open with  other then that i love it and my fingers are sore from opening it all day      
450,5.0,                       my new favorite go to knife  just ordered three more so one can always be around  purse  kitchen  garage  etc very sharp  very good workmanship  easy to open and close  the rainbow coloring is unique and adds character     
451,4.0,                       nice color great price     
452,5.0,                       so my dad was actually in the military and knows a lot about weapons and i had him look at it when it came in the mail and he thought it was a great buy especially for the price so i deeply recommend it     
453,5.0,                       it s actually heavier than i was expecting  but that is a good thing  it is durable for sure  the spring works well and i have had it for a couple months now  and the clip to keep on your pants or some such is very tight so it will stay wherever you want it to      
454,1.0,                       got this to hang out with my friends at the mall      
455,5.0,                    lo que m s me gusta de esta cuchilla es su rapidez con que se abre sorprendiendo as  a la vista          
456,5.0,                       i love the look of this knife  it s well put together and the spring release feature is very smooth  the blade is very sharp as well  this is my second tac force knife and both are excellent knives priced under         
457,5.0,                       i get compliments about this knife  i love it  and i ve used it in the field  take care of it  and it ll last for a good while      
458,4.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          truly nice design  sharp blade and switches out very smooth  only question  is how well the knife will hold up  i deducted one star only because i think the quality is less than perfect  but that is what you should expect from a low priced knife      
459,5.0,                       i love it  people say that it is a good purchase for    bucks  i say it s a good purchase for     this knife is my best  looks cool  makes others envious  and has a opening mechanism that is as fast as a switch blade  the serrated blade is good  once you sharpen it  the smooth blade is great  and i have yet to test it on glass      
460,4.0,                       cool knife accept i think the spring assist open switch was placed upside down  see photo   and it is very stiff and difficult to open  luckily  it is not necessary to open the knife  the sharpness and color is great  it seems like a great quality knife      
461,5.0,                       i ve had this little lady here for   years  still sharp and still reliable  i put off this review for a long time but i m glad i did        so cute and has helped me so many times      
462,5.0,                       pretty cool and effective if you need to cut somebody up     
463,5.0,                       upsides  it s a perfect knife for work  cutting boxes open  slicing plastic bindings  the like  it s affordable for a rainbow knife downsides  it s a bit rough to hold  like a bit sharp or scratchy on the plastic and metal casing  but it s not that bad      
464,5.0,                       i use this knife for cutting boxes and people  haven t tried it on a person yet  but it s ready      
465,2.0,                       i purchased this based upon an article i read about accessories a man should carry in my opinion forget it  too big  too heavy and not comfortable to carry lug around get a gerber        closed       open   i carry it every day      s uses  razor sharp      
466,5.0,                       love this knife  lost my first one after a few years of having it  so i m glad to have one again      
467,5.0,                       heavy  well built tactical knife  very heavy with a surprisingly well thought out design  excellent value   would buy again      
468,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                         i received my order fast and on the date of scheduled delivery  packaging was in tact from ananzon and that hold the knife  the knife is absolutely beautiful  has a little weight on it  not too heaven but not light   great product      
469,5.0,                       usually when i look at reviews i look at the worst reviews and gauge how bad my buying experience could go from there but this product does everything it said it would  it s easy to hold easy to pen the locking feature works great i don t have one complaint       
470,5.0,                       love color     
471,5.0,                       she s a beauty  i ve been collecting pocket knifes for a decade and this is a new favorite  i highly recommend it      
472,3.0,                       it looks used to me scratches all over it  very dull  for the price it is what it is      
473,3.0,                       beautiful  well made and super sharp updated the knife doesn t lock and everytime i use it  it closes on me  very dangerous     
474,5.0,                       great for the price  sharpness didn t last that long  but you can always sharpen it      
475,5.0,                       matt son is a very avide knife collector and purchased this himself  but when it got here it is very sharp and easy to use      
476,5.0,                       my husband loved it  it s high quality  nice color and size  it s also a great price  i m thinking of buying one for myself  d     
477,4.0,                       cool looking knife  only downfall was it wouldn t stay open at first  the lip was bent to the inside  i had to use another knife to pull it out  we ll see if it works permanently      
478,5.0,                       don t like the smell of the handle   it s too manly for girls        
479,5.0,                       i m in absolute love with this knife  i work maintenance at a trampoline park and it works wonders for cutting bungee cords  cutting up boxes etc  its very sharp and works really well  plus i love the assisted opening action feature  this product i would very much recommend buying      
480,1.0,                       the knife is great for the money but the fact that the lock is terrible makes it not worth it  i had mine open up in my pocket at work and destroy my pocket and cut my leg      
481,5.0,                       great knife worth the price     
482,5.0,                       great knife      
483,5.0,                       this is my first knife  it s got a decent weight for its size  assisted opening opens easily with a satisfying click  haven t had to use bottle opener or glass breaker  but other reviews say you need to open the knife to use the bottle opener  if you haven t read that   pretty cool design  comes very sharp  clip seems very rigid on mine  might be because i just keep in my pocket or backpack  somewhat difficult to close  but that might be because it s new for my first knife and its price i give it five stars  plus i really like how the colorful blade stands out from the black handle      
484,5.0,                       easy to open  small enough for your pocket  and sharp     
485,5.0,                       great product  it arrived fast and exactly as described on the purchase site      
486,5.0,                       got it for my son  he loves it  the color is so pretty  he s so excited to go camping this year to bring it along seems to be made of good quality so i m hoping it will last him a while  although at this price   replacement if it broke after a year or so wouldn t be a bad deal      
487,1.0,                       it looks nice on the picture but i guess you get what you pay for  the lock won t line up so really not useable      
488,3.0,                       came pretty tight  cant flip it open as easy as some of the other review videos  gets stuck about halfway when opening  very shiny and sharp  would give it a solid   if it flipped open all the way      
489,2.0,                       beautiful blade   but the locking mechanism doesn t engage   the blade is a bit too long to engage the lock   so be careful      
490,5.0,                       looks amazing  quality seems great for a budget knife  there is great weight and feel to the product  haven t tested it just yet  hope it lasts  sprin assited switch blade is awesome  color is eye popping      
491,5.0,                       super sharp  nice grip   easy open and close      
492,5.0,                       love it  good secure clip  easy on the eyes      
493,5.0,                       i love it and i m planning on getting another one soon      
494,2.0,                       i got my knife on time as listed  but when i opened it  i caould not close it  no instructions or anything     
495,5.0,                       its a perfect knife  its a little hard to get open most times  you have to press decently hard to open it  but nonetheless its an amazing peice of art      
496,4.0,                       for the money this knife performs as you would expect it too   granted i only use it as a glorified box cutter but what drew me to the knife was its additional combo of window breaker and bottle opener   thankfully i have not had the opportunity to test the window breaker but the bottle opener end is a little bit clunky to use  not as smooth to use as a more traditional opener but will open it nonetheless   the blade was sharp when received and the overall color and design was fantastic      
497,5.0,                       works great for what i got it for     
498,5.0,                       love the colors     
499,4.0,                       nice knife for the money  looks cool  easy to deploy and fold      
500,5.0,                       i m a first time knife buyer so i don t know any fancy way to analyze it but this is really beautiful  it looks just like the picture and it gets the job done  came slightly dull for my taste but a few runs through the sharpener fixed it right up  works well and is really pretty      
501,5.0,                       seems like a great quality knife  unlike other reviews  it s actually quite easy to open and close and it holds up very well  the blade is nice and sharp and i love the serrated part at the base  the rainbow colors are also add a really cool touch      
502,5.0,                       this is by far the coolest knife out there  easy spring assist blade  came sharp as he ll  very comfortable to hold in your hand      
503,5.0,                       i have two   they are great      
504,5.0,                       absolutely love this  easy to use      
505,5.0,                       this little pocket knife is beautiful and i love the color on it  very sharp and locks well  it looks exactly as shown and i m honestly going to try one get this in multiple colors  worth the buy

509,5.0,                       i love this knife  it is very handy and very attractive      
510,5.0,                       very sharp  i use this for unboxing boxes and is great  i used to use cutters but they are quite sharp  thin and accident prone dangerous    this is easy to store and use and is as sharp to cut tapes        
511,5.0,                       good quality     
512,5.0,                       great pocket knife  easy to use and manage  it locks into place when open  so as to avoid any mishaps  i ordered the rainbow colored one and it looks exactly like the picture  overall great quality  feels sturdy and solid in your hand

517,5.0,                       works like it should  colors are beautiful      
518,5.0,                       very sturdy     
519,4.0,                       this seems to be a good quality knife so far  it came sharp and after using it for about a month on miscellaneous stuff   it is still holding an edge  the only complaint i have so far is the bottle opener part of the knife is a piss poor design  i really don t like the idea of having to have the knife open to use the bottle opener  that is an accident waiting to happen  on the pro side  i like that the window breaker is flat instead of a point  i ve used it a couple times as a screw driver      
520,5.0,                       i ve bought   of these already since everyone that sees it  wants it  no issues at all  very sharp  great buy     
521,5.0,                       colors were really cool  i just wish there were more instructions because i didn t know how to close the blade in for a couple weeks      
522,5.0,                       very nice  eaay to maintain     
523,5.0,                       package arrived much earlier than expected  very good knife for its price  it s sharp and it looks amazing  easy to open and close but not loose at all  having it on me makes me feel safer and it has come in handy for small projects      
524,3.0,                       good sharp blade but the belt clip doesn t really grip good  knife falls out of my pocket a lot     
525,5.0,                       fast shipping  looks incredible  nice weight  bonus bottle opener built in but need to open blade first  spring assisted opening for quick and easy opening  highly recommend  definitely would buy this one again if needed as well as others  awesome brand   awesome knife  can t beat the price     
526,5.0,                       great knife  got one for my father and then one for myself  both have held up well        
527,5.0,                       as advertised  nice mechanism  nice edge      
528,4.0,                       should come with instructions  i had to look online for instructions on how to properly operate  other than that  very nice  got one for myself and one for my mom  she loved hers as well

533,5.0,                       solid knife   holds an edge above the average knife in this price range   love the handy one handed operation   you can pull it out of your pocket or off your belt and have it open in seconds with one hand  and then put it away with your remaining   fingers    just kidding   i work with a lot of tapes at my job and this knife has proved itself over all the others for two years now   i buy extras as gifts and to keep a couple when one walks away      
534,5.0,                       highly recommend  very colorful and handy  i was accidentally shipped    instead of one so now i have knifes for days

536,5.0,                       great quality  value and looks      
537,5.0,                       love it   very heavy and sharp     
538,3.0,                       it s nice for the most part  my issue is the lock sticks along both to open and retract the blade      
539,5.0,                       i don t often buy knives  but this one is truly amazing for the price  i paid     for two knives and got free shipping on them  they are very sharp right out of the box and feel nice and heavy in the hand  the design is awesome  i just wish it didn t say police  makes it look like a toy imo   overall  great knife that is the best value for the price      
540,5.0,                       i was looking for a simple knife as i ll be hiking mountain trails this summer and wanted something to bring with just in case  i was immediately attracted to the color of this and am very happy with my purchase      
541,4.0,                       has malfunction     
542,4.0,                       very cool looking knive and very sharp  takes a little practice to open with one hand      
543,5.0,                       okay this knife is seriously ridiculous     like stupid sharp    and it looks amazing    bottle opener works well and i m assuming the glass breaker does too but havent had to use it yet  thankfully  but this is a seriously sharp knife   and it stays sharp   the body is metal  so thats a plus  the assisted action is super smooth   awesome knife   best one ive ever had      
544,5.0,                       i m an ordinary guy who likes pocket knives and this is a sharp great value and colorful      
545,5.0,                       loving this knife  it s a great size  not too big  not too small  and the color is gorgeous   i almost don t want to use this knife because it s so beautiful  but it is a knife worth using all the same  such a great little knife for a great price      
546,4.0,                       high quality knife but it s hard to open very fast  the open assist is on the back of the knife  not the blade it s a good knife to have if you need to cut a box open or cut something up but i wouldn t recommend it for self defense just for the simple fact that it s hard to open the blade very quickly      
547,5.0,                       fast shipping  perfect pocket knife  comfortable grip  fast spring assist  gave this one as a gift loved it so bought myself a orange camo one      
548,5.0,                       nice knife  sharp and super cool looking  good quality      
549,2.0,                       greetings i purchased this for my daughter and we are unable to lock the knife back in no way     we ve tried this over    times  i m asking for my money back on this purchase   no instructions at all     
550,5.0,                       overall i love this knife  not only is it beautiful  but it s very sharp and has a nice weight to it  the only problem i had initially was that the spring was stiff when i first received it  however the more i opened it the easier it became  my sister loved mine so i had order her one as well       
551,5.0,                       i really enjoy this know  i collect as well as carry and the rainbow knife is an interesting piece to take around with me  it s a large  solid knife  it also comes very sharp right out of the box which is great  added use is the bottom can be a bottle opener      
552,2.0,                       i didn t get the color i ordered  but otherwise it is good      
553,5.0,                       this thing is awesome   and the rainbow looks actually really cool the bottle opener doesn t work when the blade is in  which i thought was odd the assisted open is perfect  and locks in place right away   overall great knife  great price      
554,5.0,                       plain and simple  this is a great knife  i love it  it may be a bit large for someone wanting a true pocket knife but i am ok with it  this was an exceptional value      
555,5.0,                       i got this for a gift for someone else   naturally i  played with it a bit and like a jerk i decided to keep it for myself   really cool looking knife   the blade snaps out with ease with the flick of your pointer finger   you can t beat this price either      
556,5.0,                       for the price it s a great knife  holds an edge and has held up great  great everyday knife  if you loose it or break it  it didn t cost          
557,5.0,                       great knife for a female      
558,5.0,                       great knife for great price   great finish  great quality   great performance   and looks great       
559,5.0,                       watch it  these are sharp and will cut thru butter and stone  keep fingers away  they rip through the bales of hay they were purchased for       
560,5.0,                       great knife  vrry pretty too  came in handy for day to day situations but i also really felt protected when i had this on me late at night going home from work  and going to work in the early hours      
561,5.0,                       gave this to a friend of mine for a secret santa  rainbow version   i had a difficult time parting ways with the blade so i believe her when she said she loved the gift  i purchased a gold one for myself but i think i my have to purchase another rainbow blade for myself      
562,2.0,                       i got this knife and then everyone that saw it asked if i was gay because of the coloring  it s pretty sharp though      
563,5.0,                       fits pretty well in my pocket  perfect for everyday use like opening boxes  i ve used it for several months now and the color hasn t faded or rubbed off and the knife is still very sharp      
564,5.0,                       great for hunting  also comes in handy when you could be possibly stuck in car under water so you could break windows      
565,5.0,                       everyone complimented my knife      
566,5.0,                       great for the price     
567,5.0,                       this is the  nd one i ve bought  i got one last year and use it often  it s still in amazing shape and i love it so i ordered two more for christmas gifts      
568,5.0,                       it s badass in person      
569,5.0,                       great knife at a great price  love the color for a splash of difference      
570,5.0,                       my husband bought this for me and i love it  snap action finger triggered release opens  simple single handed closing capabilities  substantial weight  great solid belt clip while still remaining super cute      
571,5.0,                       this knife works great  and looks great  the spectrum metal makes the blade look very cool  and the plastic makes a comfortable handle  the bottle opener works well  but could be better  at first  the blade was a little bit sticky to open  but now it glides open with ease      
572,5.0,                       excelent     
573,5.0,                       great knife and durable   highly recommend this     
574,5.0,                       good quality  vibrant as the picture  i was worried the price would reflect the the quality   but the knife is sturdy and has nice weight to it  the blade itself is sharp and serves its purpose nicely      
575,2.0,                       looks great  but one major flaw on one i got  blade does not lock when deployed   would not trust to use this item if it requires the use of force      
576,5.0,                       this is great knife for the money  looks great  easy to open and i love the quick release option      
577,4.0,                       looked hella cool and performed great especially for the price  but the tip came off after   day  i wasn t doing much  just tried cutting an apple with it  i know it s for collecting  but material is cheap       but because of the very cheap price i have       
578,4.0,                       clip works well  hasn t fallen out of my pocket  using the bottle opener while the knife is closed can be tricky  definitely don t wanna do that with an open blade  blade doesn t hold an edge very long  looks cool and feels good in your hand  great value      
579,5.0,                       thumbs up     
580,5.0,                       the blade itself is very sleek and pretty and i love the flathead screwdriver and bottle opener feature      
581,4.0,                       it s a knife  it s pretty to look at  the bottle opener is especially useful and creates a great excuse for me to pull out my knife  it s not very sharp though  it ll get the job done  but it won t be cutting through limbs like a lightsaber      
582,5.0,                       we bought this as a gift for a knife lover  it was much more well made than we expected and really beautiful  unusual colors  would buy again      
583,5.0,                       took me a while to figure out how to open close it  it s my  st knife  but after reading reviews and asking a friend for help it s so simple  pretty but useful and affordable      
584,5.0,                       this literally came in like   days and is so cool and pretty  this thing is dang sharp and has a good weight to it    great       
585,5.0,                       sharp     
586,4.0,                       this is a very eye catching and beautiful pocket knife  after just a couple draws  this knife opens very quickly  it also comes fairly sharp  enough to slice through paper  overall  it has a nice feel to it  however  people with larger hands may find it a bit small to grip  a great buy      
587,5.0,                       satisfied with purchase  gave as a gift to a friend  not bad for the price  not wimpy  at all

591,1.0,                       i bought this based on reviews and i thought the rainbow finish was unique   i received it the other day and it was not even close   not rainbow finish   very cheap looking handle that looks sandblasted   cannot return it   just hope the blade part is sharp enough   totally wrong knife that i was expecting   do not order this      
592,5.0,                       great doing with you

601,5.0,                       this knife is definitely great for any use  i did have to sharpen it once after using it for a few weeks all the time but its really ergonomic and worth the price      
602,5.0,                       great     
603,4.0,                       nice looking and practical pocket knife  locking quick opening blade with a bottle opener  i do wish the bottle opener could be used without opening the blade      
604,5.0,                       great looking  easy to use  very sharp  my only complaint is that the blade has to be open to use the bottle opener   could be a bad idea after a few         
605,5.0,                       great and easy to use

607,4.0,                       knife is great but it doesnt flick and close as good as one i bought years ago     
608,5.0,                       excellent knife for the money  very well made knife  don t let the chinesium price fool you  this really is a great knife

612,1.0,                       the switch blade is unusable  i hate this knife but already threw box away or i d return   wish i had money back for knife that works     
613,5.0,                       no complaints  a great all around utility knife

616,5.0,                       love this knife  it makes me feel a bit safer when i m walking at night      
617,1.0,                       tip of the knife was slanted and not what i was expecting  i m disappointed since item has good reviews but not surprised since the price is so low the quality was sacrificed      
618,5.0,                       it looks nice and its very sharp

626,4.0,                       is a tiny bit tight  takes a lot of force to open and won t always get itself all the way open but seems to be improving with use  when not doing anything i flip it open and closed to get it a little loosened up  regardless of that  it s definitely worth the price      
627,5.0,                       great knife      
628,5.0,                       honestly i just wanted it for the design but it s a bit more quality than i expected and practical      
629,3.0,                       not the best for the money     
630,5.0,                       i ve had mine for over   months and use it almost every day for everything from lunch to prying things open  it s held up beautifully  sharpens nicely  will buy another one just so i ve got a folding knife for my pocket  car  and house

635,5.0,                       really nice     
636,3.0,                       uncomfortable to hold but i got this more to display the unusual design so thst doesn t really matter like all the other tac knives i ve picked up  i doubt this would stand up to serious use  but should be serviceablefor casual used      
637,5.0,                       i bought this knife less than     the reason i choose it because it is very light  it s very sharp of the box  test the glass breaker  it did break the glass successfully and it never fall apart  it s another great product from tac force

643,3.0,                       very hard to flip it open with one hand      
644,5.0,                       the design  color  i can grasp it easy  and take every time i go hiking   i have not had to sharpen it yet  so would be interested to see the look of it after that

655,4.0,                    bien         
656,5.0,                       out of the box the knife is beautiful  and sharp  the spring opening seemed a bit too tight at first but if you just open and close it a few times to break in the spring  and the release lever which was a bit tight at first too  and play around with it for a bit  itll be perfect  nice sturdy knife  fast and smooth opening closing  good weight to it  beautiful colors  deffinately a good conversational piece  this knife is pretty great quality especially at the price youre getting it for  i totally would buy it again     
657,5.0,                       absolutely gorgeous      
658,4.0,                       great  cheap knife  the only thing i will complain about is the scales  they are clearly cheap plastic with little grip  i would gladly pay a few more dollars to have better scales that being said  the finish and fit of the knife is excellent      
659,4.0,                       it looks great and gets the job done  it cuts boxes okay and the bottle opener works well  only complaint is that i wish the knife came sharper than it did  as sometimes it can sometimes struggle to get through a material that it should be bale to with relative ease      
660,5.0,                       it s very well made  it came really sharp and the colors are beautiful  it opens and closes very smoothly  the lock works well      
661,2.0,                       its a great looking knife  somehow though locking mechanism for the knife broke off  not sure how that happened  knife hardly ever gets used    so beware of this design flaw  also it tends to loosen up over time  have to periodically tighten up the screws      
662,4.0,                       i mostly purchased this for show but it works really well  the bottle opener is convenient  so is the glass shatter part  i really didn t think it would work but it did  my only problem is that if dirt water gets into it  it doesn t flip out as well  i should have expected that but i just didn t take precaution      
663,5.0,                       great product  love how sharp and good looking is      
664,5.0,                       its pretty

666,5.0,                       solid  blade has no wiggle when in the open position  none  careful it s sharp  fits well in the hand  closes and locks open smoothly  and least important is it s just plain cool looking      
667,5.0,                       great durable knife  light weight  fun blade color     
668,5.0,                       this knife is so sharp i have to be careful to not cut my eyes just by looking at it     
669,2.0,                       lackluster finish  mediocre workmanship      
670,5.0,                       perfect i love it     
671,4.0,                       the knife is very robust   read large   is very sharp  very nicely put together

673,5.0,                       originally bought for work  since the box cutters they give us suck  love this knife   i get so many compliments on it  i ve since bought   more  one for my purse   one as a back up     
674,5.0,                       sharp strong  haven t had it for too long so i can t really comment on if it stays sharp

677,5.0,                       second favorite knife  aside from the half serrated dragon blade this also has great quality  with a sexy chrome finish  and a bottle opener  get some drinks and cut some steaks with the boys out back      
678,5.0,                       first of all the knife is awesome and i love how it looks  the seller put it in a really protected box and thanks to the seller because i love this knife  i love the feel to the knife and how quick it is when i bought this it didn t take that long      
679,3.0,                       feels sturdy and looks nice  too easy to open and the spring mechanism does not feel like it will last long  there is no safety feature to prevent the knife from opening in certain circumstances  not bad for the price point but not great either      
680,5.0,                       solid build   no wobbling parts  very sharp  comfortable to hold and use  slips into pockets nicely      
681,5.0,                       love the size and seems durable  cuts through card board good  can t be it for the price

683,5.0,                       niece loved it for xmas gift  beautiful colors  sharp too  for the price you won t find better anywhere else but amazon     
684,5.0,                       it gets dirty pretty quick but it s a good knife     
685,4.0,                       great looking pocket knife  love the colors and size      
686,5.0,                       amazing spring super sharp amazing to work with     
687,3.0,                       it s alright  definitely other knives you can get for the same price  it s a good knife to get for a teenager     
688,5.0,                       love this knife   very sharp  strong and sleek look     only problem is that i use it at work and people keep stealing them when i set it down           
689,5.0,                       a very good looking knife that is very sharp  it opens very smoothly without a ton of effort but not so easily it can be accidentally opened     
690,5.0,                       very nice     
691,5.0,                       love the colors      
692,5.0,                       was a gift   loved it     
693,2.0,                       beautiful knife  sharp and the color was even better in person but the assisted opening was horrible on mine  i have the black and gold version which opens smoothly and flips out easily but on this particular knife  the assisted flip was terrible  it stopped half way and you had to manually open it all the way  the mechanics and spring don t seem to be working correctly would be a   but not what i was hoping for with the faultiness      
694,5.0,                       this pocket knife is amazing  i do not regret the purchase  if you want it for self defense then it s good or even other uses such as cutting a box open or a can bottle you can use it however you want      
695,5.0,                       great colour  it s a gift she s going to love it     
696,5.0,                       good for edc     
697,3.0,                       gorgeous knife  but it won t retract after it is open      
698,5.0,                       i m no knife expert  but i do know that this knife is really sharp and super cool for the price  it s even got a handy bottle opener  i payed a little extra for the rainbow finish  and i have to say it looks really cool  i also like the quick opening action and the safety lock  it s been very useful to me as an outdoors woman  i just really really like this knife      
699,4.0,                       would give it   stars but i have big hands and the bottle opener on the end get your hand every once and a while      
700,5.0,                       it was very nice  the color is really cool especially in the sun  easy to open and close  overall i was very satisfied with this pocket knife  would really recommend      
701,5.0,                       awesome i ve bought       
702,4.0,                       awesome knife  just doesn t lock but that s an easy fix      
703,5.0,                       beautiful knife      
704,4.0,                       can t beat it for the price  great design  quick open  blade is about as sharp as a butter knife  but still useable      
705,5.0,                       very very pretty knife  i honestly love the weight to this knife and it is honestly very good for the price  it s sharp and it works for what i need it for so its   stars for me      
706,3.0,                       it s a beautiful knife but sadly the spring doesn t really open the knife at all  but still beautiful and still will tell people about them  understandable that some knives will have issues   and it is still useable      
707,5.0,                       it feels very firm and sturdy  the rainbow is a fantastic color the flipping mechanism makes it quick and easy to open  it looks really sweeet when you do you just flip it with your index finger and boom the blade comes out  no need for pulling on it slowly i will probably get another one of these      
708,5.0,                       can t stop playing with it     
709,5.0,                       been using this knife for over   years opening over     boxes a day      
710,1.0,                       fell apart with minimal use   sold by amazon yet they say outside return window   don t waste your money on this   if you notice they just keep dropping the price  that s because it is trash      
711,4.0,                       pretty nice knife  it s sharp  cheap and study  it sucks that i lost it though      
712,5.0,                       this knife dulled fairly quickly  and the bottle opener is only accessible if the blade is open  which is amusing  however  it is rainbow and shiny and has not scratched yet       would buy again      
713,5.0,                       ive had it for about   years now  comes in handy  very sharp     
714,5.0,                       purchased for my son for christmas  it is a heavy blade which is a good thing  he loves the look and feel of it      
715,4.0,                       nice knife  its very pretty as the picture shows  i wanted to have something to carry in my handbag and it does the trick  opening is fairly easy  but i did have issues figuring out how to close  youtube solved that issue         
716,5.0,                       purchase this knife as a gift for my son  and he loves it  well     
717,1.0,                       the screws started falling out about a week after i bought it      
718,5.0,                       love it      
719,1.0,                       very disappointing  spring assist was defective to the point of unusability  the knife was extremely dull   duller than a cheap kitchen knife  complete waste of money  bought a kershaw leek instead   thousand times better      
720,5.0,                       love the color   it s pretty sharp  good pocket size tool     
721,5.0,                       great knife for the price  i use it daily      
722,1.0,                       the knife was hard to open  now that i got it open the knife won t lock  so it s just open unsafely  poor design  it s defective      
723,5.0,                       loooks cool pretty good knife for price     
724,3.0,                       the thing that pointed out to me the most is how much it takes to open the knife  then  the knife pops open randomly when i barely use it      
725,5.0,                       i got this to carry in my tact bag with my hand guns  the rainbow finish matches my sig  well made and a nice sharp blade  good choice for a back up knife or just an extra one to carry in your range bag     
726,5.0,                       cuts great  getting it to open gets stuck sometimes but it makes it harder for kids to open      
727,5.0,                       work perfect     
728,5.0,                       this knife is light and sharp  appearing to be durable and easily concealable  the rainbow colors are bright and make the blade more  fun  and enjoyable  great for opening glass bottles  though albeit difficult at first due to the blade needing to be extended  at least in my case   would definitely buy again      
729,5.0,                       beautiful knife  i purchased this for a wonderful friend on father s day and he absolutely loved the coloring and durability of the knife      
730,5.0,

732,5.0,                       kinda one of those things you buy and then don t use but handy to have on you      
733,5.0,                       love the color and is really sharp  ordered it around   pm and got it the next morning around   am so shipping was real quick and cheap for next day     
734,5.0,                       nice knife      
735,5.0,                       pretty and unique to look at  opens in a flash and is very sharp  you could really do some damage with this so i would be very careful in using it      
736,5.0,                       the coloring on the blade is amazing   the product arrived well packaged and the blade is actually sharp   have ordered many different knives over the last year or so and this one is high quality  easy to carry and open close      
737,5.0,                       great knife  i ve been pretty rough on it and hasn t even scratched or anything  came pretty sharp  too      
738,5.0,                       i keep this in my purse  unless i m going to the airport  pretty and practical      
739,5.0,                       the knife came in great condition and works very well  love it a lot      
740,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          great knife to have in general  way more convenient than carrying around scissors  i use this to open packages  cut things  etc  very nice blade and a quick hassle free open and close      
741,5.0,                       fun little knife stays sharp overall steal      
742,5.0,                       excellent     
743,5.0,                       awesome  the color is really cool  but more importantly  the blade is sharp  great knife      
744,5.0,                       very good     
745,5.0,                       beautiful knife  quick shipping and came just as described  it has a good weight to it as well      
746,2.0,                       the locking mechanism barely covers the blade to lock it in   the finish and everything else is nice but it is a huge safety concern      
747,2.0,                       i bought the rainbow and got the gold  i got  a replacement and got the gold one again  it s a good knife but was hoping for a rainbow to add to the collection  not gonna return it due to it still working well for my protection      
748,5.0,                       great looking knife  seems to lock in place  all the screws appear to be right  this is only my first time holding it but i must admit i am very satisfied      
749,4.0,                       loved the knife  it lasted about   years before the spring stopped working  before that  knife was great  felt solid  and looked cool  well worth the price  just bought a kershaw as a replacement but i still miss this knife and might just buy a replacement      
750,5.0,                       not only is the color epic but the blade itself is high quality for a great price  highly recommended for a simply blade      
751,5.0,                       this knife has been my every day carry for a long time   i ve never had to sharpen it and it hasn t shown any sign of wear whatsoever      
752,5.0,                       great knife       
753,5.0,                       look   work excellent      
754,4.0,                       it s a gift and happy to gift it cool peace     
755,5.0,                       i love how you can flip it out  my last knife was not able to do that  it is super light and thin  you can barely notice you have it      
756,5.0,                       good quality     
757,5.0,                       gorgeous knife  it opens very easily  only downside is it s a little hard to close  not a major issue though      
758,5.0,                       my new favorite knife  i have a lot  expensive  cheap  somewhere in between  but i love how this knife  it is very solid  feels like a quality knife  well it is  but  yeah  great purchase      
759,5.0,                       great     
760,1.0,                       doesn t sit well in any pocket  falls flat  it is clearly apparent and uncomfortable in front or back pocket jeans  the length is just wrong      
761,5.0,                       bought this as a gift for my best friend  she loved it  when i opened it up i loved it too so  got it for myself as well  excellent quality especially for the price     
762,5.0,                       love this tac force knife      
763,5.0,                       i own about a dozen knives and this is by far my favorite  this knife is well built especially for the price  highly recommended      
764,4.0,                       i can barely open it  it really hurts my fingers but other than that  it is a really good folder      
765,3.0,                       love my knife   and sharp  no problems so far      
766,5.0,                       very beautiful and easy to use  i love the colors      
767,5.0,                       easy to use knife  love the rainbow metallic coloring and its not too large of a knife  could easily conceal or just clip onto jeans      
768,4.0,                       good knife  sharp right out the package especially after a few swipes through a sharpener  only bad thing about the knife is its rather difficult to use the finger notch for opening it  it takes a good bit of pressure to open it that way which is good and bad in its own regard but it s not that big of a deal  overall a good blade      
769,5.0,                       nice quality for such a low price  very sharp and love the rainbow effect      
770,5.0,                       the colors are gorgeous  great craftsmanship     
771,5.0,                       i adore this knife  for what you pay  it is an amazing quality and the colors are vibrant and perfect  i do have an issue with the placement of the bottle opener  as it seems it cannot be used unless the knife is open which seems a little dangerous to me  but i like the opener and window breaker features  could use some serious sharpening though     
772,3.0,                       this knife is beautiful  but it s too damn hard and painful to open  the assist is too hard on the tip of my finger  it s a good knife though  but ouch      
773,5.0,                       love this knife  great buy     
774,5.0,                       so much prettier in person  came in the retail box  beautiful and easy to open and close  mine came very sharp and the blade looks polished      
775,5.0,                       great knife     
776,5.0,                       this knife is awesome  it looks beautiful and for it s price  you can t really get much better  holds an edge well  but i do recommend sharpening it relatively frequently      
777,4.0,                       doesn t flip out easy but it gets the job done and it s cute      
778,5.0,                       great knife   durable and cool looking  great box opener     
779,1.0,                       sharpness lasted less than   months of normal use   screws begin to loosen around the   month mark   not strong steel either      
780,5.0,                       really good knife very sharp almost cut my self while trying to open it very good quality felt not very heavy     
781,5.0,                       great quality  wish it had a thumb opener      
782,5.0,                       there s not one bad thing about this knife     
783,5.0,                       super clean  nice quality  not dull upon arrival  i purchased the pink  gold and rainbow knives  they all look just as good as in the pictures  very satisfied      
784,5.0,                       amazing quality metal and sharp as hell  would reccommend           
785,5.0,                       sharp just what i needed     
786,5.0,                       good knife  stays sharp and kept the rainbow design which i was worried about scratching off but it stayed fine  i had to readjust the screws because it started closing crooked and hitting the side when the blade closed but i resharpened it and it was great  handy and cool looking      
787,5.0,                       beautiful knife  also very sturdy  the spring assisted function makes it come out nice and smooth amd i cam easily close it again with one hand  which is very handy for someone like me who has small hands      
788,5.0,                       i ve never understood why people will pay upwards of      for a knife when you can get a perfectly sharp and fuctional one like this for so cheap  i highly recommend this blade     
789,5.0,                       the knife is amazing    i bought the rainbow one and the color is outstanding    it s a great value for the money  i would      recommend you buy this amazing product      
790,5.0,                       neat looking knife     
791,5.0,                       got this one for my wife and she loves it  she takes it everywhere she goes and has asked that i get one for her office and one that just stays home      
792,5.0,                       this is a very good product it didn t take long to get here   the lock feature works great in its pretty sharp       
793,5.0,                       love it use it daily  one finger action  very sharp  i bought   and kept one for me      
794,4.0,                       the only flaw so far noticed is a bit of burring on the serrated edge  but no biggie  i plenty sharp      
795,4.0,                       the blade was not very sharp but would still cut  just used the flat head on the end today to get old painted over screws out of a door hinge  the tip of the knife has not broken off or even chipped  also the  switchblade  part to get the knife to open works well just needs a bit of muscle the first few times      
796,5.0,                         very sharp horizonal cuts and thrust but relatively dull vertical cuts  relatively good durability for the price  looks really cool  flips open pretty fast and carries out everyday task with ease     
797,4.0,                       better quality than i expected  blade is easy to open and is snug  blade doesn t wiggle when in use like some cheap knives      
798,5.0,                       the spring to release the blade is loose   not tight enough      
799,5.0,                       seems to be well made and is a great looking knife  hopefully  the blade finish and edge hold up over time     
800,5.0,                       great quality

871,4.0,                       it comes very sharp and looks pretty neat  the spring assist is a little heavy to open and the nut on the back of the knife used to open the blade is a little small to be used when wearing gloves but all in all  its still a pretty nice knife

931,5.0,                       bought this for work  and i am very pleased with it  it s not large  but just the right size for breaking down boxes and opening totes  i love the design  it s attractive for a girl and would even go well for a guy  the pricing was within my budget at the time of purchase would recommend and buy again      
932,4.0,                       very sharp  took me a bit to figure out how to close the knife again and i find opening it to be a little tough but it s not bad at all  totally worth it      
933,5.0,                       it s my everyday knife  cheap and works but if i mess it up or break it i won t sweat it as i can buy another since they are cheap to buy      
934,5.0,                       this knife is excellent for the price  if this knife said  gerber  or  buck  on it  it would cost          
935,5.0,                       lost the first one  had to purchase another  good knife to have on hand     
936,5.0,                       very amazing knife would recommend           
937,4.0,                       this is a great knife i didn t give it   stars because the paint is chipping off the knife  but that doesn t affect using it      
938,5.0,                       very sharp and i love the holographic look

940,3.0,                       its a knife  not really much you could say about it  it comes pre sharpened and it looks really great in a rainbow stain  would recommend  the only probably is the knife has to be open to use the bottle opener      
941,1.0,                       this does not close  opened fine  but does not budge when i tried closing it      
942,4.0,                       i love this knife  i use it everyday at work  it seems to hold its edge well  it fits comfortably in my hand  the assisted opening works nicely but i do wish it opened a little faster  i would definitely recommend this knife      
943,5.0,                       it s nice and everything but good luck if you open it up it will be hard to close it if you find out how to     
944,5.0,                       makes a very nice gift     
945,5.0,                       very nice knife  it has a sharp look to it and a razor sharp blade  the rainbow pattern looks amazing and the spring assist is super quick  would buy again

951,5.0,                       great knife that looks awesome and functions beautifully  i was really impressed with the quality for the price  it s a little on the heavy bulky side but that doesn t bother me since i m throwing it in my purse not my pocket      
952,5.0,                       looks great  and super sharp right from the factory   can t beat it for the price  and it makes me feel like i m in cs go when i cut open my packages from amazon  a real eye catcher

956,5.0,                       i can t believe this knife is so cheap   the build quality is fantastic   i like using a heavy knife for certain things  and this definitely fits the bill      
957,5.0,                       quality  pops out nice with a solid click  looks cool  sharp

959,5.0,                       awesome for the price  had to buy another one after i realized how durable the first one was compared to the other     knives i have purchased     
960,5.0,                       haven t used it yet but it seems like it will do the job  the knife locks in place when open      
961,5.0,                       very sharp and feels nice in hand  flip is not super smooth but it s good enough      
962,4.0,                       it s good for the price  nice and sharp  it didn t lock properly at first  you really have to fully bring it out if you don t use the flip feature      
963,5.0,                       product came as detailed  very sharp and very easy to hide

966,5.0,                       great knife all around  i ve been using for a long time and its great      
967,2.0,                       this is just a show knife   the locking mechanism is way too awkward and shoddy for me to ever consider using this in earnest      
968,5.0,                       good looking blade for an amazing value   i bought a second one   only use it occasionally around the house or around town   bought this for utilitarian purposes  not defensive   great for something to keep in the car      
969,5.0,                       super sharp and very cool looking  looks even better in real life then it does in the pictures and works great for actually cutting stuff

1065,5.0,                       this was my first knife  it s really nice and sharp  i cut like two holes in my bed on accident when i was trying to open a box so it s great

1068,4.0,                       love the color   design  the flipping stub is a little too small have to press really hard to make knife flip out      
1069,5.0,                       this knife is as good as all the recent reviews say  i just used it as an add on item along with a hatchet i ordered  the knife is very solid  and when it openes it locks quick and quiet with a finger trigger  worth the money spent and then some  there s a reason it has almost   stars      
1070,5.0,                       bought to use at burning man  planned on it being wrecked after  actually held up really well  still using it and still loving it

1072,1.0,                       the knife is nice but it was scratched when i got it   it s like getting a new car with a scratch  i mean the car still works but it doesn t make you feel any better about it looking ugly      
1073,3.0,                       it came with some dents and scratches  and some of the pain had came off  when i hold the knife  i hear some of the parts squeaking  it does feel like good quality and cuts well but as a customer who bought this brand new  this needs to look brand new

1096,1.0,                       due to faulty design  when this knife is closed  part of your finger can get caught within the gaps and the knife tip will cut you

1102,4.0,                       very pretty blade  the only thing that i wish could ve been done better is the trigger lever  seems a little on the small side and requires a lot of pressure to get it going  other than that  it was worth the money

1174,4.0,                       this was a gift to a friend that s hard on knives  he loved it  the blade was nice and sharp to  the only issue i have is that you do need to have the blade open to use the bottle opener  all and all would happy get another

1180,5.0,                       great quality for the price  stylish and unique yet very useful  be careful though the blade is really sharp  one slight issue i have is the bottle opener  not very handy when you have to open up a cold one while the blade is up in the air like the way this one makes you do

1186,5.0,                       i really like how it looks  and it feels solid enough to be useful  the blade comes pretty dull  but that can easily be remedied with a quick sharpening the assisted opening was a bit stiff at first but it s slowly getting smoother  however  i have a bit of trouble opening it one handed      
1187,5.0,                       awesome knife  great quality for the price  the blade also came sharp enough to give a close shave  only complaint is it is a little stiff to open  but it can still be easily opened     
1188,5.0,                       this sucker is sharp  but when shopping for a knife  that s just what i m looking for  it s so sharp i m pretty sure it cut through the bone in my hand when it slipped and sliced it open  all in all great product  and it s super fly       
1189,5.0,                       the knife is aesthetically pleasing and works beautifully  the blade could ve been a bit sharper but a sharpening tool will fix that easily

1216,5.0,                       this knife is an absolutely great product that i would probably buy again  the only thing is at first when you get it  it may be a little hard to open but after you open it for awhile it s good  i highly recomend this spring assited knife if you are looking for one  the other cool and great thing is the design and color      
1217,4.0,                       got the wrong knife but overall it s a good knife so i am not mad

1219,5.0,                       very sharp knife that can cut through anything      
1220,5.0,                       great knife  it looks cool  easy concept  and pretty sharp  however it fills fairly quick because it s kind of a soft metal  but hey it s a cheap knife and it ll do the job      
1221,5.0,                       just as described  great quality and arrived really fast     
1222,4.0,                       it s a flashy knife but i know it won t last long just by looking at the way it is made      
1223,5.0,                       super sharp  great knife  if it gets  stuck  in the open position  underneath the blade  there is this ribbed wavy piece of metal  push that to the left and push the blade down  once you learn that  everything is great  i use for cutting fruits   protection  works well

1227,4.0,                       nice but heavy  assist is smooth and fast when opening  seems to be solid time will tell  the end has a flat point that can be used as a car window punch or flat head screw driver  nice option      
1228,5.0,                       i m very impressed  this is the first knife i ve bought  for safety reasons   it opens closes great and has no missing pieces  the rainbow is beautiful

1238,4.0,                       it can be a little hard to lock and unlock  it s pretty  incredibly sharp  overall a good knife      
1239,5.0,                       daughter loves it      
1240,5.0,                       perfect gift for someone into these things  like the colors don t regret at all      
1241,5.0,                       sturdy and beautifully designed  at this price  you can t pass it up  looks true to the picture   if not better      
1242,4.0,                       great looking knife  only problem is sometimes when it springs open it will not lock which can be very dangerous if you are unaware it did not lock and you go to cut something it can close on your fingers      
1243,5.0,                       very nice looking knife  and very sharp      
1244,5.0,                       i love this i got this as a gift for my mom and she fell in love with this knife and the rainbow effect looks just amazing i would say it s better in real life compared to the picture      
1245,4.0,                       it came in the mail today and it looks beautiful  the knife is not as sharp as i like it but it will do until i can find my sharpening tool      
1246,1.0,                       i bought this knife on feb           and i really liked it and over the last   months use it very minimal  it stayed it my pocket     of the time   today  aug        i reached in my pocket to retrieve the knife and it litterly feel apart in my hand   from what i have read on other reviews   the little screws can work their way loose and thus causing it to fall apart normally this would not be a big deal but i lost one of the screws  and now i can not fix it until i find a little enough screw that will work      
1247,2.0,                       very heavy knife  too heavy to carry in suit pocket   styling too modern for most  including me   knife is of very good quality  sharp blade  but safety lock doesn t work properly      
1248,1.0,                       horrible and clunky  it s extremely difficult to put back once you release the blade  lots of hassle for something that should be practical      
1249,4.0,                       it s a good knife super beautiful and super sharpmy only problem is that sometime the blade doesn t go down all the way      
1250,1.0,                       just don t waste your money     
1251,5.0,                       my wife loves it   super sharp and easy to use      
1252,5.0,                       it inspires fear in the hearts of fellow  but lesser  women   flashy  durable  easy to open  and hella cool      
1253,5.0,                       such a cool knife  store easy to flip open     
1254,5.0,                       very sharp and still going strong   happy with purchase      
1255,5.0,                       good sturdy knife      
1256,5.0,                       very pleased with this knife   it looks nice and seems to be sturdy      
1257,5.0,                       i love it      
1258,4.0,                       it is a very beautiful knife  works perfectly  it has a nice sharp tip  and a dull side  just   problem  when i touch the blade  it smudges and puts my fingerprint on it      
1259,5.0,                       lovely and works great      
1260,5.0,                       sturdy knife  great coloring and very sharp   the blade wants to  pop  open when you get near    degrees  so it s tough to use one handed   overall  great knife and you can t beat the price      
1261,3.0,                       good item      
1262,5.0,                       beautiful knife  great quality  will be buying one again if mine ever breaks      
1263,5.0,                       great comes very sharp a little hard to flip but the more u flip it gets to perfect flip     
1264,4.0,                       it s a sturdy knife  looks awesome  the only problem i have with it is that it takes way too much pressure to flick it open with the small protrusion near the bottom of the blade  it feels very unsafe  it s probably just better to open the knife conventionally  that is pinch the top of the blade and rotate it out  i imagine this will diminish with time however      
1265,2.0,                       cute but as soon as i opened it i couldn t close it  what s the use in carrying a knife that slices your purse up     
1266,2.0,                       it wasn t as sharp as i was expecting and the spring doesn t seem like it wants to work because no matter how hard i press down on the lever  it only opens half way     
1267,5.0,                       i looovveee it   its my new bff     
1268,3.0,                       adequate  but i would not call it anything amazing and it s certainly not as good as a     knife      
1269,5.0,                       loved it     
1270,5.0,                       i didnt really like that it was late i do love the colors and the style     
1271,5.0,                       great      
1272,4.0,                       you get what you pay for  as expected      
1273,5.0,                       love it     
1274,5.0,                       beautiful      
1275,5.0,                       you can t beat the price  awesome knife     
1276,3.0,                       had a lot of trouble opening and or closing this product  i had so file down an area that kept making it lock up when i first bought this  it works well now      
1277,4.0,                       just needs to be sharpened     
1278,5.0,                       very fast shipping  i expected it to be here on friday but it came on tuesday instead  it s a very well made product      
1279,4.0,                       good knife for the price  i use it to cut open boxes and it does better than scissors      
1280,3.0,                       its such a beautiful knife and i had to add it to my collection  at first glance  it looks like something the arbitor would use  alien looking is what i m getting at and it is quite unique in that aspect  its rather weighty for its size and when it arrived  the metal cutouts were still visible on the blade so i had to groom it before i felt like i could show it to people which was a bit of a drawback  but in the end i got what i wanted      
1281,5.0,                       all around great knife  does its job and is very sharp  can be used for pretty much anything      
1282,5.0,                       love it     
1283,5.0,                       amazing will buy again     
1284,5.0,                       awesome knife for the price     
1285,5.0,                       got what i paid for     
1286,5.0,                       my son loves this knife it moves nicely and looks great and he is picky      
1287,5.0,                       nice  practical and sharp  it is very good quality  especially for the price  definitely better than i was expecting      
1288,5.0,                       good spring good knife     
1289,5.0,                       great product especially for the price  only downside and this is knit picking is that the bottle opener part could be better  at first it s kind of hard to open the blade but you get the hang of it after a while  overall great product      
1290,5.0,                       my son  who was in the marines bought one of these two years ago because it was inexpensive and looked like a  bad ass  knife   his brother liked his knife so i bought him one for a christmas stocking stuffer   the sisters liked them so now they have them to keep creepy bad dudes away   my oldest son  the marine says this   i use this knife every day   it s my work knife  my hunting  camping  farming  fishing  and self defense knife   my everything knife   it s got a great clip on it  it looks great  it s still sharp after two years and it was cheap  our family gives it   stars       
1291,4.0,                       night strong knife  the bottle opener only works when the knife is opened though so don t trust your drunk friend with it      
1292,5.0,                       i love this knife not only by its looks but by its functionality  the spring assist is stiff enough to not let the knife fly open in your pocket but it is soft enough for easy opening  another plus side of this knife is the design of the metal tang  minimalistic but still has some substance to hold on to  the glass breaker works  but not super well     
1293,5.0,                       i like it      
1294,5.0,                       great knife  so far it is my favorite of my collection  i carry this wherever i go  the pocket clamp stays on very snug and i have yet to have an issue with it being loose  for the price this is a great knife  i like this better than my otf stiletto  the blade is very sharp and will cut through a baseball  yes i have tested it  i would recommend buying this knife  i will be buying more      
1295,5.0,                       purchased for grandson for christmas  color is extremely beautiful and i am sure he will be very happy  service was great     
1296,5.0,                       i use it to cut almost anything  very sharp and looks nice with that rainbow effect      
1297,5.0,                       the knife is of great quality and arrived very sharp  it is already better than the previous three knives i have owned  i keep it with me at all times and will be ordering more to give as gifts      
1298,3.0,                       it was a little scuffed and a few scratches other that that it was a great gift     
1299,5.0,                       this is a sharp knife   given to my son more for a keepsake rather than to use   he loves the look and design of the knife but doesn t use it for cutting anything      
1300,5.0,                       great for the price  i have used it for about   months without any problem  great for camping or anything      
1301,5.0,                       this product is very sharp right out of the box and the locking mechanism works very well  this product is very well made and is definitely worth the price      
1302,5.0,                       great knife for the price        
1303,5.0,                       nice knife good deal really happy     
1304,5.0,                       thankfully  i haven t had to use it for protection  it s super sharp and very pretty  i m glad i bought it  i use it as a box cutter now but i still take it with me just in case      
1305,5.0,                       the shiny  oily color scheme of the metal on this blade is just so wonderful  this weapon truly makes a statement      
1306,5.0,                       love love love this knife     
1307,5.0,                       looks good and has a good weight      
1308,5.0,                       very sharp and well built for it s price  i was looking for a pocket knife and i found it

1314,5.0,                       my son loved this     
1315,4.0,                       the knife is fantastic  works very well for me at work  i open a lot of boxes at work every day and the knife has held up very well  the only thing is a screw fell out of the knife  i m planning on just getting a replacement screw as the knife is still functional and working well  definitely recommend this knife      
1316,3.0,                       it s a pretty cool knife especially for how cheap it is  but the bolt that holds the blade and handle together it too tight and is hard to open and close      
1317,5.0,                       opens very fast and smooth  comes razor sharp and looks beautiful  very sturdy and well built  stays sharp and only needs sharpened every once and awhile

1370,5.0,                       really good knife for the price  it s actually pretty sharp  i like that it has a surrated part on the blade  it feels good in your hand  i ve used another knife with this type of handle that cut into your hand when you try to cut with it  this one doesn t do that at all  you do need to make sure the blade is fully opened and secured before you start using it so that it doesn t fold up on you while you re trying to use it  you could cut you re self otherwise  i wouldn t let a kid use it  or anyone that doesn t realize you need to check that the lock is in place first      
1371,5.0,                       it is stupid

1377,5.0,                       for     there isn t a better knife out there   strong  sharp  not insanely so  but decently so   aesthetically pleasing  and unique   the spring assist works well and i don t foresee anything going wrong with this knife   awesome purchase   arrived within   days of placing the order    thank you very much      
1378,5.0,                       great tactical knife for the price     
1379,2.0,                       while the knife looks great  it does not properly lock in the open position and easily closes with the slightest pressure  i have to physically move the locking bar in place but am not confident in using this knife while under pressure for fear of slicing my hand off      
1380,5.0,                       i love it  i don t use it ever though  actually i lost it under my bed for a good   months and didn t even know it was missing  it seems sturdy  it s shiny too  i feel safer when i have it on me even though i have no idea how to wield a knife  the bottle opener works well  this is one impulse buy that i do not regret      
1381,5.0,                       the blade s sharp  just the right size for my small hands   a bit hard to flick open at first but after a few times it loosened up  have not tried using it that much yet

1432,3.0,                       very sturdy knife  doesn t feel cheap at all  only complaint is that there s no seatbelt cutter even though there is a spot for one        
1433,3.0,                       just ok    kinda hard to close  also kind of hard to open  but at least the spring works on this one

1435,5.0,                       great and cheap little pocket knife  it snaps right open and came with a sharp edge  only problem i have is that to use the bottle opener you have to open the blade fully      
1436,4.0,                       it was a bit smaller than i was expecting

1438,5.0,                       love it  i had to resort to youtube videos to figure out how to close it  but other than that i am well satisfied  definitely a good purchase      
1439,1.0,                       i was so excited to purchase this knife because of how deadly  yet girly it looks   all the features of the knife were great as well  until i actually tried to use it   i bought this knife as a tool and a form of protection when i traveled to africa by myself last month and was more than a little frustrated when it did not work   i almost cut my finger off and ended up having to superglue a large cut i gave myself from this knife   the locking mechanism to hold the knife open failed to work the third time i used it  and i can no longer use the knife for fear of it closing on my hand      
1440,5.0,                       little bigger than i expected but that s just fine  shipped extremely fast for a holiday weekend  love my knife      
1441,5.0,                       love it     very sharp    others have asked where i got it from because it s so pretty

1450,5.0,                       i just got the item today and i can say that this blade is almost perfectly made and its really amazing although i can see that its not going to last long because of the opening mechanic but overall its a good pocket blade     
1451,2.0,                       gave me the wrong order   asked for rainbow but gave me red  didn t want to waste my time to get it exchanged  knife quality is not bad for the price  came in sharp      
1452,5.0,                       extremely good looking  extremely sharp   very nice quality  cant beat the value for a knife that cost under      very happy with this purchase

1456,3.0,                       would have given it more stars had they not fast assed the production of these things  and if they had came with a sharpener it would ve been    otherwise it s a fantastic product     
1457,5.0,                       good enough for the price and is fun to abuse      
1458,5.0,                       really like this knife        it arrived in great time as well     
1459,2.0,                       poor quality control   knife does not lock   i waited to long to inspect it for amazon to allow me to return it   buyer beware

1462,5.0,                       this knife is my everyday carry      is too affordable to be disappointed  with a window breaker  flathead and bottle opener  it s always good just in case sidenote  it looks like alien technology

1465,2.0,                       i purchased the rainbow one and it s cute and all but this is my  rd time opening it and now it will not close  i am afriad to try and really force it close because there isn t really a way you can hold it tightly without chance of cutting yourself

1467,5.0,                       great build quality and machining      
1468,5.0,                       this knife is one of my favorite in my collection   the quality is unbelievable for the money   i plan to order more for my collection from tac force      
1469,5.0,                       over all product is really nice  the assisted opening takes a little bit to get worn in so it s not so hard to open it  i absolutely love the sleek design and color     
1470,4.0,                       its good but still after a couple of weeks still a little stiff      
1471,5.0,                       i am very happy with this product      
1472,5.0,                       great knife   i carry it everywhere      
1473,5.0,                       good quality     
1474,3.0,                       seems kinda dull but was ok  great for looks and showing off      
1475,5.0,                       this blade is a great deal  the assisted opening is awesome  and it looks terrific

1477,5.0,                       i like this  tac force pocket knife because it comes in handy when you need it      
1478,5.0,                       this knife is awesome  looks great  feels like well made  even though it says made in china  but other than that i love it     
1479,3.0,                       bought a second tac force after having one for   years  compared to my old pink tac force  opening the knife via the spring assist was extremely much harder and stiffer compared to my old one  this was very disappointing  the spring would get stiff midway and not open  whereas on the pink one it would open immediately with much less pressure needed and it was much smoother  i m not sure if the quality has decreased over time or if i was just unlucky  i will just have to open the knife via the blade from now on      
1480,5.0,                       good

1689,4.0,                       got here quickly and looks amazing  price was a little eh   but you ll get over once you see how sharp the knife is    you should totally buy the rainbow one

1695,5.0,                       used nearly every day for seatbelt cutting and other roadside rescue recovery purposes  tactical assist makes it safer for child protection  sharp blade and the anodized metal makes it  visually exciting

1700,2.0,                       it does not lock open  making this very dangerous to use      
1701,5.0,                       very sharp  nice color      
1702,5.0,                       worth the money  it is what it looks like in the picture  definitely one of my favorite buys      
1703,5.0,                       i just got it and i already love it  really thinking of buying one more for everyday use  i highly recommend it to anyone who like knives or who want a small defense knife      
1704,3.0,                       i like it  its a really good knife  but the screws at the bottom didn t stay in for very long  they came out and now i just have tape keeping it all together      
1705,4.0,                       its a good knife for its price but it is a bit hard to open when activating the spring assist  also  the bottle opener is useless unless the knife is out      
1706,5.0,                       great knife for the price     
1707,4.0,                       it is nice at first but the blade is strong at first and it doesn t have a thumb kick but when you start to use it more often blade is more easy to brake but good pocket knife     
1708,5.0,                       great knife for the price and really fun to use with everyday tasks

1711,5.0,                       it is very sharp     
1712,4.0,                       the color is very cool  the blade is good and strong  it doesn t hold the greatest edge      
1713,5.0,                       great price for a great knife very pleased     
1714,1.0,                       black handle  rainbow half it s all silver

1719,2.0,                       nice  but its way to hard to open  impossible one handed      
1720,5.0,                       great      
1721,5.0,                       exactly like the picture advertised  even better quality than i expected since the price is so low  it works perfectly      
1722,5.0,                       love it     
1723,5.0,                       people always comment on how nice it looks      
1724,5.0,                       this knife is awesome         
1725,5.0,                       love this baby  her name is kindness  some of my friends aren t fans of the griping if they have even slightly large hands  the blade comes out almost too easily which could be a bad thing  possibly      
1726,4.0,                       drove away with it on top of my car and never saw it again but it was cool for the few days i had it      
1727,3.0,                       cool looking knife  fairly sharp for everyday use  some of the screws started to come undone a tad near the bottom of the handle and the black handle got roughed up within the first week but i mean for the price it has been worth it  took a couple of flips to break in the spring assist to really get it to pop fast   a lot of people like the color wayedit  after   months of use in a work environment the screws are starting to come out of the handle and the knife is falling apart      
1728,5.0,                       issa knife     
1729,5.0,                       this knife is beautiful and almost looks like the skeleton of a kinfe  but with all of the great perks of a knife  love it and the colors are perfect  especially rainbow        
1730,5.0,                       exactly what i expected    thank you i now feel protected     
1731,5.0,                       nice quality and nice price  i strongly recommend you to buy it      
1732,5.0,                       tac force makes great pocket knives for the price      
1733,5.0,                       i was more than satisfied with this knife  it looks just as it is advertised and works smoothly when needed     
1734,5.0,                       didnt reall need but i love in received as scheduled     
1735,5.0,                       not only is it nice looking     but it functions perfectly       
1736,5.0,                       who knows how i can sharpen this knife
