11,5.0,                       great basketball   i read a lot of reviews and had it narrowed down to this evolution basketball or the wilson ncaa official basketball and ultimately decided on this one because of the reviews   i m not disappointed   i have always wanted a nice indoor basketball   we use it in pick up recreational games as the game ball   i like the soft feel and it bounces very true   the tackiness is about perfect   i don t like balls that are too tacky      
12,5.0,                       wilson all the way  the ball is perfect      
13,4.0,                       well made and feel very comfortable and expensive  you can tell the difference between an evolution ball and a cheap brand  my son like it very much  they will last forever      
14,5.0,                       i love this basketball and so do the guys i play with  i bought one for myself   years ago  and it is still going strong  everyone always asks  where s the wilson  because that s the gameball   i had to buy one for my dad as well  because he was using a crappy indoor outdoor ball and he only plays inside  he has also gotten nothing but positive reviews the ball is soft and has a nice feel to it  it is a little stickier than other basketballs  but it does not feel like a rock like other balls do  even after   years of weekly use my evolution is in great shape  and doesn t look like it needs to be replaced anytime soon save yourself some grief  and buy one of these basketballs  you won t be disappointed      
15,5.0,                       this basketball is phenomenal   went with a different color type  so we can find our ball at practice   we had to replace a lost ball  and purchased the same one      
16,5.0,                       purchased for my daughter and a great  high quality basketball that she absolutely loves  takes it to every practice and always wants to use it  highly recommend this ball and outstanding quality      
17,5.0,                       bought it as a gift for an old timer looking for a new game ball  he absolutely loved it  simply a high quality game ball  i purchased the blue iteration  and the colors matched the product photo exactly      
18,5.0,                       you get what you pay for with this ball   it s on the pricey side but worth it      
19,5.0,                       my son wanted this basketball  i bought it for him  he likes it  i found cheaper ones  but he wanted this one  so he s happy and therefore i m happy     
20,5.0,                       it s great  purchased for my son he loved it     
21,5.0,                       bought as a gift for my son  loves it      
22,5.0,                       it s for gift     
23,1.0,                       do not buy this ball here   the one i got was so poorly constructed i could not believe it  went to local sports shop and bought one from there  night and day  same ball but much better quality  not sure if it s a bad batch or what but several buyers had the same issue      
24,5.0,                       great basketball     
25,5.0,                       great ball  my son loves it      
26,5.0,                       this basketball is fantastic the nice thing about having a high quality ball is that if you play pickup ball with it  everyone will agree to use your ball since you use this ball while shooting around  you get a good feel for it  using your own ball during games is nice because you play better      
27,5.0,                       nice indoor ball   my son has been using it for a long time  it is often the game ball when they play   still holds pressure and looks great   i would definitely recommend this product      
28,5.0,                       i bought this to use in an indoor gym where i play basketball     times a week  it is a very quality basketball with amazing grip  and i like the color combinations as well  everyone always wants to use this basketball to play     
29,3.0,                       i have reason to believe that this item is after market  it does not feel durable and did not come in the original box     
30,5.0,                       my son loved this  my mistake i ordered a girl size but he still uses it     
31,5.0,                       one of our grandsons requested this  he is on a middle school team and enjoys this basketball      
32,3.0,                       i purchased   of these for my teenagers and they just aren t very easy to use    the grip isn t good at all   the ball is always slipping out of the player s hands on the court  all of the kids  not just mine    i was disappointed the grip wasn t easier to handle   especially for kids      
33,5.0,                       the evolution has been around since i was in high school and i m     now they ve made the ball more appealing by having color options  making it easier not to lose when you use as a game ball  great quality and came as described     
34,5.0,                       my boys use these balls for aau and they re the best indoor balls we ve owned so far   had to pick up another one during cyber monday as the price was right      
35,5.0,                       great     
36,5.0,                       this it the ball that tops all balls  ive purchased the official game ball before and this one is much better  never buying any other  ball than this  great grip  always inflated  and great feel when  you shoot      
37,5.0,                       i think the ball is really nice  the grip is good and significantly better than the ordinary ball  it s a good product  i haven t had any issues with wear and tear yet      
38,5.0,                       thanks to the wuhan wheeze i have been unable to use this ball since purchase as we have been in lockdown and everything is closed  i shall use it one day when the rona has moved on     
39,3.0,                       our boys play travel basketball  rec and school ball  we needed another outdoor ball and evo has always been our go to  however  we ordered this ball in green and got blue  so my brother in law ordered one and had it delivered  in green  and again we got blue  so i can t give any higher of a rating  if anyone that is looking to get a ball in their team color or one that stands out from your standard ball bouncing around the court  you won t get that here  two different prime accounts and both with the same disappointment  the ball is still an evo so there s that      
40,5.0,                       this ball is what all of my friends  including former d   players  and i play with  for about      you get a ball that feels and plays like the official nba      ball      
41,5.0,                       pretty nice   durable   no issues to speak of   happy buying this      
42,1.0,                       the seams are horrible  the leather is laid poorly and uneven  i m sure i just got a bad apple but where as i m in iraq and it took a month to get here i ll just have to buy another  there s no good basketballs here so this one is above and beyond what we have  but definitely not inspected correctly as you can feel the leather and see it uneven along the seams      
43,5.0,                       i ve had my eyes on this ball since college and that was a long time ago   sadly  i purchased one of those gimmick balls  infuzion  that was great in concept but sucks in actual use i recently picked up playing ball again and was able to convince myself that a personal ball was needed even though my gym provided me with a loaner the grip on this thing is fantastic and reminds me of the soft touch of a luxury vehicle seat  if you are willing to spend the extra bucks  get this one and show everyone how awesome you are be warned  if you go play a pick up game  everyone will gravitate towards using this ball  don t take it with you if you are the type of person that doesn t want dirty paws touching it      
44,5.0,                       great ball     
45,5.0,                       top of the line basketball   i use it for a game ball for a competitive travel team      
46,5.0,                       best basketball on market for indoor play    holds up well  keeps its pressure   easy to handle even when you have sweaty hands handling it all the time   bounces true on return to hand   used it for over a year and hardly shows wear      
47,5.0,                       awesome basketball  got it for     but tbh i was kind of scared because it seemed that every review claimed the ball was  defective  or a  bad batch  but as i received it i can confirm the ball is      authentic and great quality but keep in mind i got it directly from amazon com as the seller     
48,5.0,                       feels perfect  i played with one while playing pick up and after the wear and tear of my old balls  i needed a new one  since they stopped making the vintage tf    s this is the next best choice  super soft in hand  and once inflated  doesn t feel like it s overly bouncy  which as a point guard  is crucial for good handles      
49,5.0,                       great basketball  if you want the best indoor basketball around buy this  i love that they have different colors now  bought these green ones because my daughter just going to high school and green is the main school color      
50,5.0,                       the ball has a soft feel and doesn t need to be over inflated to get a good bounce   easy to handle at the top of the dribble and stays round well      
51,5.0,                       great ball  holds up really well and maintains great grip     
52,5.0,                       best all around ball i bought the blue printed ball and the blue will wear down but as most people will have the black i like being able to tell which one is mine     
53,1.0,                       first   i had to replace with in a week because it kept going flat  got a replacement and now    days later it s the same problem   balls are only used in the gym   this is terrible     
54,5.0,                       my son loves it        
55,1.0,                       i had the identical model before from dick s and this one doesn t feel the same  it is not as soft to the touch and therefore feels cheap  one of the corners are already getting loose after playing less than   times  disappointing      
56,5.0,                       grandson     
57,5.0,                       wish tf    s were made like the old days  but this guy is what every person in the world has at the gym so you might as well get used to it as well      
58,2.0,                       ball was unfortunately lob sided which makes it terrible to dribble with and makes the product not nearly worth it s cost      
59,5.0,                       i ve never bought any other ball  very nice grip and worth every penny  i m usually skeptical when it comes to buying a good basketball and used to go to wal mart to get a cheap one  but i would have to say that every wilson evo ball i ve ever purchased has never gone wrong  this is an inside court ball so obviously don t use it outside or it ruins the material  great product      
60,5.0,                       best ball to play with on the court  hands down   different colored logos makes it so you know which one is yours easier      
61,5.0,                       great product     
62,1.0,                       this basketball is my favorite ball so i bought more   the ones i received are not as soft and even feel as if they are made out of a different material i am confused and wonder if what they sell on amazon are the defects that do no meet quality standards      
63,5.0,                       the black ball stands out so i know if someone is trying to steal my ball  it is soft but not too soft and it does not lose durability too quickly      
64,5.0,                       great product  easy to spot from the rest of the rest of the basketballs in the gym      
65,5.0,                       best basketball made     
66,1.0,                       i received the ball and it was mostly inflated  i completed the inflation as per the directions and the ball looked fine  so i proceeded to write my name and contact information on the side  shortly after  i took it to the gym and immediately noticed the ball was lopsided  i tried every fix in the book but the ball cannot be fixed  defective product  waste of money  i recommend going to the store to ensure you don t get a defective product      
67,5.0,                       very nice  happy with the purchase      
68,5.0,                       this is my favorite basketball and almost always is selected as the game ball when playing with friends   definitely use only indoors to keep the grib  if so you will be very happy with it     
69,5.0,                       great product  arrived on time     
70,5.0,                       ball is life    make sure to put name on it  since everyone has this ball on the court      
71,5.0,                       great indoor ball  love the feel of it      
72,5.0,                       excellent ball for the price      
73,5.0,                       solid basketball  great grip  preferred by most girls aau basketball players i have come across   i bought one for both of my daughters   ended up getting one for myself      
74,1.0,                       the ball is undersized  it states on the packaging       but it is more like       i had a replacement ball sent out thinking it was just a random production error  when the replacement arrived it was the same undersized very disappointing      
75,5.0,                       some of the negative reviews here   i swear if this world didn t have dumb people i wouldn t be able to make it through the day   this is by far the best ball you can own for indoor use   don t read some of these stupid reviews      
76,5.0,                       a great ball  and a great value for the price   spend more for supposed  higher end  balls made by companies known more for clothing and shoes  and those balls were far inferior   this is the one      
77,5.0,                       this is a really nice indoor ball   it has a very nice feel   we got the      which is good for a   u player   the    oz is a ball i would recommend for   and under   it doesn t feel like a cheap little kid ball      
78,5.0,                       great indoor ball  no complaints      
79,4.0,                       the grip on the ball is not the greatest      
80,5.0,                       for my    year old grandson  this is the only ball that would do      
81,5.0,                       ball has a great grip to it whether or hands are all sweaty or not  i suggest this to the new spalding tf      s by a long shot  and so do all my friends  as whenever i brought it to school  all the players on my team wanted to play with this for practice i wouldn t suggest using it outside  as if dust gets onto it  it s impossible for you to grip the ball and dribble shoot  also it will wear down the materials faster great indoor ball  probably the best one  as it is always picked for game ball either in league games or rec games      
82,1.0,                       the blue ones are flat and don t feel good presumably because no one buys them  amazon also won t let me return it  stick to the standard blue one     
83,2.0,                       nice ball  but had a stain on it  would expect better for the cost      
84,4.0,                       it was a gift      
85,5.0,                       fantastic ball with great grip   it s always the game ball when i play      
86,5.0,                       great basketball them at is comfortable to use and holds air for a long time      
87,5.0,                       worth every penny  perfect nba size ball  satisfied      
88,5.0,                       love this ball over the others  spalding wnba  fiba  the fiba is the worst feel for me  felt cheap  yet it says leather but need to be broken in  the spalding wnba is second  not as soft as wilson  but close  the wnba was       compared to evolution the cover is nice and soft   great for price      
89,5.0,                       i go to the gym on a weekly basis at school and wanted an indoor ball to play with  this is the first indoor basketball that i have ever bought and i can tell you that i am not disappointed  it has been a few months since i started using this ball and it is great  the ball has feels soft on your hands and the grip still feels like new even though i have been using it on a weekly basis over the course of a few months  highly recommended if looking for a basketball dedicated for indoor play      
90,5.0,                       read the reviews   this is a quality basketball   normally this isn t something that i would pay this much for without knowing the feel of it  but a couple of guys i play basketball with use this same product   good quality with a great feel grip   like another reviewer  mine had a minor flaw of what i would classify as excess rubber in the seam but was able to remove it no problem   good basketballs are expensive and this is a good ball      
91,5.0,                       i go to a gym that always has horrible basketballs laying around  i took an hour to research what i needed and found this ball  i needed something that would be indoor only  feel great in my hands  and not lose grip quickly  i don t ball too well  but it s really helped better my shot  best part is other people wanting to use my basketball during pickup games      
92,5.0,                       i personally play basketball when i can and need something to bring to the gym but i didn t want a cheap basketball from walmart so i found this one  my close friend had one and i really liked it so i had to get one  i bought the navy blue one and it s a great color      
93,5.0,                       best basketball for indoor hoopin     
94,5.0,                       the wilson evolution has been my ball of choice for years now     
95,5.0,                       fantastic basketball for indoor use  lightweight and has a great feel to it  i thought it was a bit pricey but overall very satisfied with the quality of it      
96,5.0,                       play ball two times a week and everyone brings this ball  bought it and i know why  this ball is amazing  it took me three times playing with this ball before the leather was worked in and did not stick to the grip  best ball on the market     
97,5.0,                       everyone at the gym uses this ball   it has a very soft feel  good bounce  good weight  good grip  and a reasonable price if you re buying a basketball for someone and don t know much about what makes a good ball  then buy this ball   note it s an indoor ball  so only buy it for someone who plays indoors  i play basketball twice a week and no one at my gym  lifetime fitness  will use any ball except the wilson evolution   it s good to practice with it because it s always what you end up using playing pick up games      
98,5.0,                       a very happy grandson      
99,5.0,                       so i got sick of borrowing the deformed basketballs at the gym and purchased this one   the evolution is the perfect ball   i love the grip and feel of it not to mention i ve only had to air it up once   i sometimes leave it in my car even when it is cold out and still feels like the day i bought it   it s only been used indoors   i ve had it only   months  but i can t say i have one complaint whatsoever      
100,5.0,                       great product      
101,1.0,                       poor quality   i didn t know any better until i bought another one from dicks   this one feels cheap and deflated   maybe it s from china      
102,1.0,                       nice ball  but needs to be pumped up each day  my boy takes it to the rec center to shoot hoops and four hours later is needs air again  i would send it back  but he doesn t want to be without a basketball while he is going to rec center      
103,5.0,                       christmas gift  nephew loves it     
104,5.0,                       i don t have any issues with this ball  still breaking it in  but it feels awesome  looks good  glad that i have a nice ball that i can play with indoors  got this on sale  so it s a great value  most people love the evolution  and that s because it is a great ball for the everyday indoor playing      
105,5.0,                       gift for  th grader     
106,1.0,                       i have owned three other evolution basketballs before writing this review  all my older ones were soft and felt comfortable to play with right out the getgo and along with other people s evolution  i normally purchase all my basketball s in stores but decided to buy off amazon for a change  i purchased this basketball on december         and i play basketball     times out of the week and i m still trying to break this basketball in the leather doesn t feel as soft to the touch  when you bounce it  it just sounds really heavy  and it s really freaking hard compared to my older evolution balls  upon looking through amazons reviews for this ball  it seems that i may have received a faulty replica ball  most definitely will be trying to purchase in store from now on      
107,5.0,                       my son lo es it for indoor use     
108,5.0,                       very nice ball  too bad it s pretty expensive i m thinking because it s already inflated for you  check prices on other websites        
109,5.0,                       if you are looking for that soft feel and comfortable indoor basketball  then this is perfect for you  i purchased a tf      spalding basketball      spalding tf      classic indoor basketball                        from a local sports vendor and i didn t like how  hard  the leather cover felt while shooting  it was the indoor version and was rated very well  but it just didn t have that nice feel to it  if you play basketball often  then you will know what i mean by that i purchased this ball because it is a ball i play with often at a local gym and i like the feel and comfort i get in my shot  i got exactly that same feel and comfort in this purchased product and i don t think you will be disappointed in this purchase  the ball becomes even more versatile and shooter friendly the more you play with it  so give it a couple weeks before you decide whether or not you love it      
110,5.0,                       been playing basketball for    years and this is by far the best indoor basketball i have used  takes a few games to break the ball in but once its broken in  its perfect  definitely worth the money  i would not use this ball outdoor     
111,5.0,                       for indoor  wood floor use  there is no better ball     
112,5.0,                       i don t know much about what makes a great basketball  but i got this for my son in law for christmas and he is thrilled with it and has thanked me several times for choosing such an awesome ball   he said that when he played ball with his friends  they voted to use this ball over all the others that were in the running      
113,5.0,                       this ball has the best grip and is very durable     
114,5.0,                       this took a pounding in college for two years and it still has good grip  by far better quality and last longer than the t      not biased because they cost around the same  my housemate got one year ago and his was already losing its quality  everybody at my school prefers this over the t      big sample size      
115,5.0,                       best basketball out there hands down  i have the      size and on my second ball  bought this size for my son  great shooting ball      
116,3.0,                       played college point guard and i can instantly tell the difference between a symmetrical ball and one that is lopsided   this one was still slightly lop sided   additionally  i ve played w  other wilson balls that had an amazing feel  this one felt like a rock  very hard  didn t have that sort of nice malleable feel to it    the leather felt  cheap   that s the best way i can describe it    it was  okay  but for the price i was expecting much better            i also bought the spalding ball for     and this one has a way better feel  despite it being slightly lopsided as well   but i d rather two spalding balls at     piece than one wilson at         so i ll be returning this one      
117,5.0,                       all three of my boys have this basketball   it is an indoor only ball and they each take it to practice with everyday and to play with friends at the local recreation center   all there friends want one like it      
118,5.0,                       can t go wrong with  evolution      
119,5.0,                       awesome ball  so awesome that it was stolen from me at the gym  write your name on it because this is a sought after ball     
120,5.0,                       evolution is about the best out there and we can say it lives up to its ratings  yes     bucks for a ball may sound high but you get super quality and it will outlast a ton of the cheaper balls      
121,5.0,                       great quality ball for all around programs on the court      
122,5.0,                       bought this ball twice   if you use it on the court everyone else will try to take it home      
123,5.0,                       works as it looks     
124,5.0,                       got this for our son because he plays club basketball and has lost several balls in gyms despite writing his name all over it  with this ball it s easier to spot and keep track of      
125,5.0,                       as with every product i buy  i do a lot of research before i make my decisions  i ve been a basketball player all my life and the last ball i owned was the wilson solution  the official ncaa ball   this ball  the wilson evolution  is the official high school ball  without a doubt  these are the top   indoor basketballs on the market  period  some people swear by spalding  but honestly  the feel to their indoor balls is just different  and often inconsistent  and spending       on the official nba ball is just stupid   if you are wondering the difference between the evolution and the solution  they are essentially the same ball  but the solution has moisture absorbing technology  whereas the evolution does not  this means the feel is just a tad different  i would say the solution is a tad  grippier  than the evo for this reason  if you are having a hard time deciding between the two as i was  i encourage you to try out the evo  you will not be disappointed bottom line  for indoors  i d rank the evo    and the solution     if you are a shooter  you will absolutely love the evo  it is always the game ball when i go play pickup games  never use it outdoors  take good care of it  and it will last for many years      
126,1.0,                       why i m giving this ball one star  my use of this ball is every sunday and recently i ve been leaving the ball in my vehicle  well when game day comes this stupid ball is flat  it does not retain the air at all  i m upset because my window to return this item past and now i m stuck with a useless ball      
127,5.0,                       great value for everyday and money   plays well indoors and outdoors   would buy again     
128,5.0,                       for     you can t go wrong with the wilson evolution  these balls take a few games to break in  but once they do i ve always gotten a couple years of play out of one  great value      
129,5.0,                       gift for my brother  he s happy  i just don t know why it was so expensive      
130,5.0,                       got this for my husband this christmas   he took it to his weekly basketball game with his buddies and they we all in love with it      
131,1.0,                       i bought this for my son  to have for only indoor play and it has lost half its air atlas   times in a month and a half  i would expect this from a lower end basketball  but not one that cost as much as this one does  very disappointed      
132,5.0,                       great ball that lasted through the entire aau season for my    and    year old boys  we have tried other more expensive brands like under armour and nike in the past   both ball wen t out of round and did not bounce correctly before one season was done      
133,5.0,                       my favorite ball  better than other brands i used before  good grip     
134,3.0,                       i m not sure if all new evo balls are like this  but mine bounces as if it s super flat even though it s fully pumped and doesn t handle well  i will continue to use it and pray that the wear and tear will improve the bouncing of the ball      
135,4.0,                       i think the ball is a great ball  the only thing that worries me is that it is already a little lopsided   i have not played with it outside and i have not done anything but keep it inside and then take it to the gym when we are playing and it is getting a little lopsided   i am not sure if i should send it back  but when you play with it  it feels completely fine and is soft and feels good   so i will see how it plays out over the next couple of weeks and see what i think   fyi   some people really love playing with leather balls and this one is not leather  it is a composite leather      
136,5.0,                       excellent indoor basketball  really nice feel  the real deal for those interested in a high end ball      
137,5.0,                       if you re a baller  you already know that there s no better ball than an evo     wish they could install a tracking device tho cuz we keep leaving them in gyms around the country     
138,5.0,                       ty     
139,5.0,                       best ball available     
140,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i couldn t even play one game with this ball   after a few possessions i realized something was wrong  this was a christmas gift and it was just finally brought out at the gym and it was horrible     i was so excited to use this ball i specifically wanted the wilson evolution   not spalding or the rock and i was completely disappointed      
141,5.0,                       product came earlier than expected and was exactly as described   thx      
142,5.0,                       it was great     
143,5.0,                       i used to love playing with a spaulding tf      but they simply don t make those anymore  right now i think this is the best ball on the market  deep channels and soft leather if you can t shoot with this ball you better be going for defensive player awards      
144,5.0,                       best indoor balls ever   been coaching basket for    years   always rules these as games balls and after a few years as they get old use them as practice balls  tacky and perfect     
145,5.0,                       the best basketball available for indoor play   it s the only one anyone uses anymore at the   courts where i play pickup ball they re not cheap  but they re worth it      
146,5.0,                       this is the ball that everyone wants use at all of the courts  i literally bought this one just because of the quality and feel when using it overall  this ball is consistent and easy to grip  yes  it s moreoney  but you will get the value of what it s worth     stars  buy one so you can be the cool guy with the best basketball that everyone wants to use       
147,5.0,                       i have wanted this ball forever and finally got it for a great price  the ball is great and i would really consider paying a bit of a greater price for such a great ball anytime  definitely worth the buy     
148,5.0,                       great ball  good grip      
149,5.0,                       it s perfect for my son who is   years old      
150,1.0,                       my so  very lightly used this basketball on indoor courts only  after   months  it would no longer hold air pressure  i plan to contact wilson about their warranty  i and my son are very disappointed in this basketball      
151,5.0,                       fantastic basketball     
152,5.0,                       nice  my best ball yet     
153,5.0,                       obviously  the go to indoor basketball never came across a ball that helps with shooting touch and palming then the wilson evo      
154,5.0,                       i love to play basketball  i have tied many basketballs  this is the best one to use indoor  soft feeling     
155,4.0,                       not exacly like the brown wilson evolution ball but works almost as nice  has more grip     
156,5.0,                       most popular ball  wears well  first choice among everyone i play with      
157,3.0,                       i thought this was the indoor ball turns out i got the composite ball read carefully  it s an ok ball for outside  the indoor ball is where it s at      
158,1.0,                       this product is defective through this seller      
159,2.0,                       the writing looks much more pink than red  the picture shows a distinct red crimson but actual product is more pink   at least the one i received came this way      
160,3.0,                       definitely has a different texture than the normal evolution   feels rubbery      
161,4.0,                       i bought this for my son who plays ball       we usually buy this brand al the time  however  this particular ball stop holding air two months ago  when i saw that he wasn t using it i asked why  he said it s always flat  it was too late to send it back  i don t believe it s the brand but i guess i got a defective one      
162,5.0,                       my daughter loves this basketball  it doesn t lose air and great feel   seems it will last long  as long as you use it indoors      
163,1.0,                       when i first got the ball it felt lopsided so i thought i just needed to break it in  so i played with it for about   months now and it still feels the same  i ve put air in it and deflated it like tom brady  but still the same results feels lopsided  i ve played with other wilson s and they feel soft and they bounce right back to me  kinda disappointed      
164,2.0,                       not official size  i cannot palm an official ball  but i can palm this one like i m mj      
165,4.0,                       i did not receive the ball i ordered   i returned the wrong ball which was easy  amazon sent a call tag   i had ordered the wilson evolution pebble composite design      indoor basketball   what i got was a wilson evolution microfiber design        twice i ordered it and twice i got the wrong ball   i kept the first incorrect order wilson evolution advanced microfiber design      and my   grandsons really like them   i ended up getting another one for my  th grandson at a sports store and he was happy with it   all of my grandsons play basketball year round and on their school teams so they needed a good indoor ball to practice with  the wilson evolution microfiber has worked out fine and they like it really well even though that was not the one they asked for  they say it has good bounce and it grips well  i am happy if they are happy      
166,5.0,                       good quality  nice bounce  just fine for indoor hooping satisfied with the purchase     
167,5.0,                       my son loved it      
168,5.0,                       love this ball so does everyone i play with      
169,5.0,                       overall this is a very good basketball and i am very satisfied with it   it is not as soft as i expected and as i have felt with other basketballs but still soft enough to give it a very nice feel compared with most other basketballs  also  i have felt other evolution balls that were softer than mine so it is possible it will break in some more and get even softer  i have played with it about a dozen times already    grip is great even with sweaty hands and has a great bounce to it  i e  doesn t have that abnormally high bounce you sometimes get with other balls when driving fast down the lane    definitely recommended      
170,4.0,                       the basketball itself is amazing  never new about the different colors  decided to go with the scarlet but turns out the pictures are not a direct representation of the actual color  silly me  the scarlet is closer to pink than to red  much closer  think nfl breast cancer pink but matte   so it will be going back  as far as the value for money  walmart has it for     cheaper      
171,4.0,                       great ball  the lettering is more pink than red      
172,5.0,                       i don t like how this basketball being presented without a wilson box and just gave me a bag  and no air on the basketball     how would i present something that s in the bag  it s crazy cause you give me a used basketball with words written all over it  how would i present something too someone like that  not cool  i finally received my i love it my cousin love it too     
173,5.0,                       excellent experience  product matched description  pricing is great  ease of purchase and quick delivery will recommend to all of my family and friends      
174,5.0,                       have played basketball for    years now and this is by far my favorite ball  love the cushioning and the bounce it gives  make sure to not let it get outside though as i ve seen people do that and it ruins the grip and cushioning of the ball quickly      
175,1.0,                       this deserves   stars  it is unfortunate to leave this review as previous wilson balls i have played with have been great  however  both balls i received  the original order and a replacement were both poorly put together  the seams were uneven or were off and the outter rubber or leather was coming off  i had to glue it back down      
176,3.0,                       i did not like this ball it was too hard and stiff  i don t know if wilson has changed the texture of this ball but none of the guys wanted to use this ball at the gym as their wilson evolution game balls had a softer more leathery texture      
177,1.0,                       so disappointed in this basketball  within two months of buying the ball it is already lopsided and the grip is terrible    absolutely no reason for this ball to be lopsided  it has only been used for shooting around on indoor courts and never been kicked  punted  etc  recommend buying a different ball     
178,5.0,                       excellent grip and durability  love this basketball  word coloring makes it stand out easier  to keep up with      
179,5.0,                       best ball on market     
180,4.0,                       good quality and less expensive than others like it but it loses air often  even more than ones we have of lesser quality     
181,1.0,                       i dislike that i found out from my son that he has been adding air to the ball since he received it  i noticed the other day on his way to practice that he was putting air in the ball  when i asked why he says because it s too soft  i ve been doing this since i got it      
182,5.0,                       it s the best ball for grip     
183,1.0,                       pump valve broke within few times of use     
184,5.0,                       in my opinion the best indoor game ball on the market   i tried most out before purchasing   for my aau team   spalding s have turned bad with cheaper quality  nba game ball excluded but too pricey  and the only other ball i have used that compares in my opinion is the baden elite one   my decision for team game balls came down to this and the wilson solution though as area high schools use wilson   while the solution is considered a better ball based on price  it collects dirt so fast with the moisture absorbing technology that the balls look worn down after a month s use and the kids always want to use the evolution   the evolution keeps it color and has a soft grip so that you can at least get   years out of the ball looking new using it a few times a week      
185,3.0,                       i guess this ball has poor quality comparing other evolution bb balls  that is why it is a bit cheaper  it not very bounce and the leather is less comfortable  i do not recommend the colorful evolution balls to friends      
186,1.0,                       i gave it to my husband for christmas and from the beginning it was having trouble holding air  unfortunately  he didn t tell me about the problems early and now is too late to return  don t know if it s a problem with just this ball all this kind  to be fair  wilson has always worked out for us before      
187,2.0,                       i play omb  old man basketball      mornings a week   i like the feel of this ball but i ve never had one that loses air as quickly as this one   it was a christmas present and i started using it in january   i had to pump it up a little once a week to get it up to     psi   initially i didn t think much of it  just had to  top it off   but his week  it was completely flat after sitting over the weekend   i pumped it up  and we played with it   now     hours later  it s flat again   i wiped some soapy water over the inflation valve and it s leaking around the side of the valve   if you buy this ball  be sure to order an air pump to keep in your bag   if it s like mine  you ll need it      
188,5.0,                       got this ball as a gift and the person loved it   stated it was a great ball to handle and move around that other players he plays with on a league want the ball for themselves      
189,5.0,                       best ball ever   better ball then those over priced balls   this is my third one   this is the only ball you will see in our gym   every baller is carrying this ball   they know wassup      
190,5.0,                       my daughter loves this ball this basketball  like all others  bounced because of the compressed air and gravity  when my daughter bounced the ball it went down   largely the result of gravity  when she bounced the ball hard  it went high  win win this leather ball also is elastic   the elasticity is the ball s property of being able to change shape when a deforming force is removed  when this ball s shape was deformed by hitting the ground the kinetic energy converted this deformation into potential energy and returned the ball upwards   bounce bounce meets all needs  makes baskets   definitely a winner      
191,5.0,                       the wilson evolution basketballs are the best indoor basketballs you will ever purchase and play with  i will cover some areas where they really shine grip   the microfiber composite exterior works well to grip to your finger tips when playing indoors  even if you caught some sweat on your hands from your match up or yourself  the ball simply ignores it and keeps great grip and gives you great control over the ball  this grip doesn t degrade either as the ball sees continued use durability   i go to a csu and my schools uses these balls for their communal gym balls  they replace them every year and even still they don t have to  the balls see use almost   hrs per day every day and they hold up very nicely  no deforming or anything  if it s just going to be you and a couple friends using it while you re at the gym then it should last very very long  i will say though that misuse of the ball will lead to early deformation ie  outdoor use  slamming it against hard edges  etc   a tip i would give when purchasing one is to get a color other than black  most everyone will get the black color way  while you can write your initials on the side of the ball  it s much easier to distinguish your ball off the color of the letters on it  plus it s only the letters that are colored so it doesn t take away from the orange brown aesthetic of a basketball      
192,5.0,                       nice ball     
193,5.0,                       this is a good ball  it has a good grip for anyone and is best used indoors  if you play everyday this is a must have  if you play everyday dont get the jet get the evolution  i would get the jet if you are playing outdoor and want a decent ball  but this ball you use indoor and treat it good  she will work for you  i use a sharpie to write my name on it and it has stayed on with no issue and i loved my basketball  i took my basketball everywhere i went     you know what   that basketball was like a basketball to me      
194,5.0,                       definitely my favorite basketball to hoop with  nd to only the official nba basketball but who wants to pay that much for a basketball      
195,5.0,                       my son has been using this ball for well over a year   he recently moved up from a      to a full sized ball and when given a choice between this ball and the tf       this was the clear winner   he plays competitive basketball all year  has used a variety of balls  and hasn t found a ball he likes better      
196,5.0,                       my favorite basketball i do not use it anywhere but inside  it has lasted over a year with it being played on at lest  x a week  i love this ball         
197,3.0,                       seem this balls is real hard materials  does not feel like previous ball i purchased at local store     
198,5.0,                       great basketball for the price   bought two of them for a youth basketball league and they worked great   they came inflated and ready to play      
199,5.0,                       perfect gift for our  th grader  basket ball super star      
200,5.0,                       best in door basketball out there only negative    if you dribble it outside it could get ruined     
201,5.0,                       cool color to make your ball really standout from others     
202,3.0,                       i bought this because i liked the feel and handling ease when using my friend s evolution  the ball still works and i don t plan to return it  but the workmanship is off along several of the seams  compared to my friend s ball  this one seems to have been poorly made   it still bounces well and isn t lop sided  but i m a bit disappointed in the quality as some of the seams protrude and will likely peel off soon      
203,5.0,                       i ve always loved the wilson evolution ball and it still doesn t dissapoint      
204,5.0,                       i have been searching for a baksetball of this calibur for a long time  i ve went through so many prior  after doing research  i decided to give this one a shot  by far my favorite basketball i ve ever owned  it has a smooth release and weigh is perfect for sharp shooters like myself  good grip  overall  i would purchase this basketball again once this one eventually wears out      
205,5.0,                       clean looking ball  i dont even want to bring it to the gym it looks and feels too good      
206,5.0,                       this basketball is top notch  it is soft with a good gripping surface for shooting      
207,5.0,                       although i was skeptical about purchasing a     ball   it really does make a difference   i also noticed that my son values this ball and has not lost it yet  knock on wood        
208,5.0,                       my son absolutely loves this ball  most people think it is real leather  we also own a spalding tf      zk and a reebok vr       both are really good balls  but the evolution is just better in every way possible  we have had it for   years and it is still in almost new condition  my son only uses it indoors and plays on three teams so it gets a lot of use but doesn t show it    new ball     i purchased two more of these balls in dec        one men s and one women s  the first      would not hold any air at all  i returned it for a replacement from a different amazon vendor  both new balls are great  my son and daughter both love them  best ball available for the money      
209,5.0,                       this is a great indoor ball  do not use it for outdoor use  i have a    year old who plays about     hours a day and it is holding up nicely      
210,5.0,                       its a basketball   put air in it and it will bounce just fine  unless you live on the moon  in which case you need the additional tether   shoot it towards a goal and if you re any good  it will go in  people will cheer and if you re lucky  that cute cheerleader will finally notice you  so yea   buy this thing and be the hero you ve been in your mind all your life      
211,5.0,                       i love this ball feels great in hand and great on indoor courts      
212,1.0,                       gave this to my son on      and now  on       it won t hold air  it has only been used     practices a week on indoor courts  pretty disappointing for a ball that expensive      
213,5.0,                       these are just the best basketball   i have girls who play and have several of these balls in        this black one  full size  looks cool and i know its mine      
214,5.0,                       my    year old  basketball fanatic  son bought this for himself with his saved money  he s super happy with his purchase      
215,5.0,                       my son uses it to play basketball     
216,5.0,                       my favorite ball to play with   my adult leagues all use it and most people like to play with it   can t go wrong here      
217,5.0,                       the ball may be on the pricey side  with cheap    run arounds available at your local sports shop  but the quality is wholly worth it   the durability  grip and feel of this ball is second to none   if you regularly play indoors  this ball is worth the investment      
218,2.0,                       very disappointed in wilson overall  the new  green color logo  ball i bought  to easily tell mine from others at the gym  felt much different than the regular black logo ball i bought   years ago  it failed because of air leaks   colored logo balls cost    more  but is made differently cheaper  it does not have the soft  semi cushion grip the original has and feels hard like an outdoor ball  i emailed wilsons  website and never got a reply  i just called them and the rep said the  recipe  was different now for the color logo evolution balls  which is misleading at best as you d expect it to be the same as the original   i m hoping i didn t misunderstand and he was saying all new evolution balls have been changed  i ll find out soon as i just returned the green ball and ordered a new original black ball  if that feels wrong too  i ll warn others with another review  not sure what indoor ball to buy if all evolution balls have been downgraded in quality  looked at them all and nothing looks great      
219,3.0,                       basketball is pretty nice but the black rubber parts stick out from the ball  and you can feel the ridges where they extend over the leather strips     
220,5.0,                       i gave this to my boyfriend for his birthday and he loves it      
221,5.0,                       best indoor basketball for youth size   nice feel to it   don t use outdoors      
222,3.0,                       disappointed  we had the ball about a year  it was only used indoor for a few months  was then stored in a basketball bag indoors  pulled it out to use it and it will not hold air now    we planned to use this ball much longer as it s an indoor only practice ball    a friend bought the same ball just in a different color and seems to be holding air fine  disappointed we didn t get the time out of it we were expecting      
223,3.0,                       the new ball feels lighter in weight than the balls i played before  even with tear and ware   my old ball  same evolution i am going to replace  still feels a little bit heavier   hope i will get used to this new lighter feel      
224,4.0,                       i recently bought a wilson evolution  not online  but from a sporting goods store   when i get home  i realized that the air valve was notably raised from the ball surface and that it was separated all around from the material of the basketball itself  all of which seemed to be an obvious defect  i ended up reading a bunch of reviews online  mostly on amazon  about the ball  and saw that many people complained of poor quality control  with issues like raised air valves  seams being sloppily glued together  and the synthetic leather surface peeling off  i also saw that people mentioned that the ball has a three letter code at the bottom of all the writing around the air valve  starting with either x or n  and that the n balls tend to be better finished  my ball had a code starting with x  i ended up going back to the store i bought it from and exchanged the ball  interestingly  the store had a bunch evolutions  and they were in three totally different kinds of boxes  i looked at least   different balls    all the balls with the code starting with x had problems    either the air valve was sloppily inserted  seams had glue or extra material showing where they met  or the synthetic leather surface wasn t glued down properly where it met some seams and you could see some of the white raw material from the underside that shouldn t be visible  there were two balls with the n code and both of them seemed pretty much perfect  the only issue with them is that where the writing is around the air valve  the surface of the ball is a bit indented depressed  probably because of the printing mechanism they use    it s a bit annoying  but i don t think it s a defect  and it will probably even out as i use the ball more  plus  i d rather have that than any of the problems i saw with the x balls   i m guessing that wilson must be using different factories and that s what the x and n codes mean    seems like the x factory has terrible quality control  i don t think the problem is fake balls as some people have suggested  since all the balls i looked at were in store  and many still had problems   my new n ball is great so far  so if at all possible  i d say make sure you get a ball with an n code   the only difference is the outermost layer thus this affects the dribbling critically   also    the models of the balls sold on wilson sporting goods official site is   original color   wtb     rnavy   wtb     id  optic yellow   wtb     id  royal   wtb     id  green   wtb     id  scarlet   wtb     id  laser engraved   wtb     vimportant note   there is no perfect wilson evolution even people buying it from the wilson site complain about color fading and valve popping out even if you look carefully and zoom in the pictures provided on wilson s website for the ball   i mean marketing pictures you will notice that the black line are sticked to the ball using glue and that there are other glued partsin a nutshell there is no great ball at this price range if you want something optimistic pay an extra      to buy the ncaa official ball or at least try to order the evo from the wilson website     
225,5.0,                       great basketball  all my boys have one  it s for indoor use only  per our rules      
226,5.0,                       although it is a bit pricey  my basketball obsessed son was absolutely thrilled with this ball   our town color is blue  so the ball is perfect for when he plays indoors  as no one else has this ball   great grip  cool look  very happy child      
227,3.0,                       great ball and in good condition with fast shipping   but makes a rattling noise  idk what it is but makes noise when you bounce it  probably why it is refurbished and was a recall       
228,5.0,                       great ball as usual from wilson   color letters really pop out   bounces properly      
229,5.0,                       my boyfriend loves this ball  i bought it as a gift for his birthday and he treats it like a baby  when he makes me hold it he makes sure that i dont bounce it outside  it was between this ball and the rock  i ended up going with the evolution because his basketball friends knew more about this ball and said it was amazing  he absolutely loves it     
230,5.0,                       good bb     
231,5.0,                       this ball is great for any ball player   it has great bounce and durability      
232,1.0,                       well  i ordered the wilson evolution in blue for my    year old brother  he lives with me so he will be opening christmas at my house  the items were shipped to my grandmother s so that the kids would not find them  i go and pick them up to wrap them    and you sent me a pink ball  the writing is scarlet  i don t even have any time to fix this  it looks red in the picture but it is not  any other color and we could have made it work  i am so upset  it was all he wanted and kept asking for  i had to scramble to throw christmas together for him because he came to live with me right before thanksgiving  i hope he is still okay with it but i can t imagine him being very excited to show his whole basketball team his ball with pink writing      
233,5.0,                       it s exactly what i want out of a basketball  nice grippy good material that lasts long     
234,5.0,                       kinda expensive and the color glaze did peel but still an awesome ball     
235,5.0,                       it was all blown up and ready to play basket ball   great product     
236,5.0,                       after using the spalding tf      most of my life  i noticed that every time i play pick up basketball  all the dudes have these and they always use them as the game ball  my ball never got used  i fell in love with this ball   the grip  the bounce the overall feel is fantastic  it s rare that my ball isn t picked as the game ball now      
237,5.0,                       a must have for any basketball player who plays indoors  enhance your practicing and skills  my brother who s    yrs old encouraged my    yr old to get it  my    yr old loves it  my husband  who s    yrs old now wants one      
238,1.0,                       the ball will not stay inflated  how do i return this item or exchange it      
239,5.0,                       without spending        this is by far the best basketball you can buy  the feel and quality are unmatched  go to any gym and try every other similar ball  none come close      
240,5.0,                       my    year old son loves to play with this ball whenever we go to the indoor courts  he says the grip is great and with the proper amount of air  handling is second to none  sometimes  there s a reason why some products are more expensive than others  quality is one of them  this ball is definitely a quality item      
241,5.0,                       i ve played basketball for decades and this is one of the best indoor balls i ve used  this was the third time that i purchased this ball  the first was for myself  the second was a gift  and this most recent purchase was a replacement for the first which got stolen   when properly inflated  this ball has a soft feel with a good consistent sound and bounce  the only comparably popular indoor ball i ve seen is the spalding tf         though i ve read that they changed the material and it just isn t the same as it once was  for my money  this is the ball of choice  the only drawback i ve seen is that it s so nice that people keep asking to borrow it      
242,5.0,                       ball came on time  the ball is in great condition  no  flaws on the leather or rubber  also  great price      
243,5.0,                       amazing basketball with great quality      
244,4.0,                       the more sweaty your hands get the better grip you have on the ball it seems   great ball      
245,5.0,                       very nice quality     
246,5.0,                       i m sorry but    you re not a real baller if you dont own a indoor wilson evolution ball  only exception are the tf     balls made before           
247,1.0,                       like other reviewers have stated its a lop sided ball     
248,3.0,                       i have owned many basketballs over the year and many evolutions  his looks great but it is not as soft as the other evolutions i have had  the green has smeared on a couple of the letters and some of the panels seem to be coming up  very slightly   i m not sure that this is authentic and would not buy again      
249,1.0,                       the first ball i got was great except that it wouldn t hold air overnight   i like the way it felt and bounced  i returned it and the replacement i got felt like a completely different ball   it was a piece of junk with peeling seams and a different feel to it   the writing near the inflation spot was different from the first ball   really pisses me off   i just want a good basketball      
250,5.0,                       good basketball     
251,5.0,                       excellent product  best ball ever     
252,1.0,                       came obviously used      
253,1.0,                       love these balls  except that the two i bought do not hold air         
254,5.0,                       this ball has a really nice feel   i like the deep channels and the soft touch of the material makes it easier to grip and handle   if it holds up well it will be worth buying another in the future      
255,5.0,                       these are the absolutely best basketball made   these have great grip and feel amazing in your hand  use only on a nice real court and not on any other surface      
256,1.0,                       pretty sure my ball is defective or a replica  i thought i was just overthinking it but in my league there s at least    others with the same exact ball and all of them feel different and better than mine  mine is lopsided and doesn t bounce evenly  also seems a little heavier than the others      
257,5.0,                       no issues as expected     
258,5.0,                       well worth the cost      
259,5.0,                       soft feel  great grip  incredibly durable  and lightweight  this is the best basketball that has been produced in the last for years      
260,4.0,                       great ball   rd one  shipping was fast but i thought it would come in its box but it didn t so my ball is a slightly lopsided but doesn t effect the ball      
261,5.0,                       i got this for indoor use and it works good      
262,1.0,                       used only indoors for about    days  less than an hour each time  and the outer layer is starting to peel away at the seams   ball has a good feel and weight balance but the durability is unacceptable   maybe this is just a bad ball and not representative of the product   one can plainly see that the outer layer of this ball is too thin      
263,5.0,                       bought    one for myself and the  nd for my son  very high quality and well made construction      
264,5.0,                       great basketball for kids practice     
265,5.0,                       all the reviews you have read are correct  excellent basketball  great grip and sturdy construction  im getting ready to purchase a second one just incase  i would really say the only cons to this ball are the fact that if it is used outdoors it will deteriorate quickly   but i suppose if you play outdoors and indoors alike  its still worth it to buy this ball  because of how much quality you re getting for just    dollars  and perhaps buy a cheaper outdoor ball      
266,5.0,                       probably the best basketball for indoor use there is  i havent used this outdoor so i wouldnt know the wear and tear but this ball is the best ive used indoor and i play just about every other day if possible  great grip and feel and lasts a good  while  it is totally worth every penny vs the cheaper walmart alternatives  if you want a good quality ball go with this       
267,5.0,                       this basketball was recommended to us by our daughters basketball coach and we couldn t be happier with it   my daughter loves how it feels and performs for her in the gym and on the court      
268,5.0,                       this has been by far my best indoor ball ever  i also have the nba official ball but since i play basketball at the local    hour fitness  the floors aren t well maintained as the professional courts  so the ball hasn t broken in as i expected it  the wilson evolution is a different story  it has vastly improved my jump shot since the breaking in process doesn t take that long  recommend this for all ballers and can act as a great christmas present during the holidays      
269,3.0,                       nice ball kind of hard at first  doesn t have that plush soft feeling  almost feels like outdoor ball which is not right   hopefully it breaks in and gets softer feel to it  also feels smaller in diameter for some reason also     hmmm     
270,5.0,                       i don t buy any other brand  my son loves his gift      
271,5.0,                       this is the main basketball used at pick up leagues and gyms        is the men s version   if you shop around you can find less than retail but i wanted the ball now and didn t want to wait   this ball is indoor only      
272,5.0,                       what can you add  its a wilson evolution  one of the best balls on the market  a must for the serious player      
273,1.0,                       this ball is vary small and is not official mens size  i have a evolution ball i bought from wal mart and there totally differnet sizes  i order a      and got a      do not buy if you re wanting a official mens basketball  because it is not a official mems basketball      
274,4.0,                       great ball to shoot with  my shooting percentage goes up when i use it  these evolution s don t bounce respond on the dribble like some other balls but overall i love it  i only use this indoors  noticed a while ago that my ball needle entry point comes out  most of the other evolution balls don t have this issue  guess it s a small flaw  still great ball      
275,3.0,                       says  delivered today   handed directly to a resident    once we read that   we went to our front door and looked    found the box sitting on our porch ball is great      
276,5.0,                       love these balls  my girls love its grip  thank you      
277,5.0,                       the different color options is so dope  i have the only ball at my gym that looks unique and different  with the same familiar brand name that everyone has  awesome       
278,5.0,                       i converted from a tf      to this ball  great price ball comes inflated feels so good to shoot with  players at gyms are always commenting on how nice the ball feels and this is   months after i purchased it durable as long as you only use it indoor must have for indoor basketball players      
279,4.0,                       this brand is always worth the money paid      
280,3.0,                       love the look of this ball  but the seams and quality were so much lower quality than their orange standard ball even though they are both a similar composite  plus it costs the same amount  so i d expect similar quality if the build quality was the same  i d give it   stars for sure      
281,5.0,                       best indoor ball  period widely used in hs leagues  it has the right amount of grip and  soft  texture without costing too much we use it in pickup games at the gym roughly  x wk  even as it wears down  it doesn t turn into junk there were a couple of spalding balls that i ve come across and maybe a baden that were decent  but it wasn t worth the effort to track them down when this is available      
282,5.0,                       best basketball on the market      
283,5.0,                       it s like playing ball with the clips      
284,4.0,                       this ball has a great soft feel and goes through the net like butter butt decent for the price     
285,5.0,                       the ball feels great  i ve been casual church league   local ymca league player for almost    years  the ball felt great to touch  relatively easy to palm  it really comes down to your preference but i don t mind using this at all over spaldings      
286,4.0,                       great basketball    takes a bit to break in the  leather  to have some tackiness  but great ball for the gym      
287,5.0,                       great ball   my son loves it      
288,2.0,                       got this in january and my son used it fine   put it away with covid and took it out and it was flat   pumped it up last week but it is flat again now so apparently it had a leak   concerting given how expensive this ball is      
289,5.0,                       great quality     
290,5.0,                       i bought this same ball   years ago and it is still perfect  my daughter uses it several times a week at her team practice and for competitive games   we bought this second ball so she can work on ball handling with   balls and for quicker shooting drills   this is the best indoor ball we have found      
291,3.0,                       my son plays so much hoops that he gets a new basketball every year  he loves the wilson evolution ball  it s very high quality and performs great  rather than get him the same ball that we had over the past   years  i decided to get the wilson revolution with the blue ink  his high school colors   i don t know what the blue ink had to do with the bounce  but this ball does not bounce well at all  he uses it primarily for shooting drills  but he couldn t use it for ball handling  it s the weirdest thing  and it doesn t make sense that ink color would dictate bounce  but that s the only thing different between this year s ball and the three previous years      
292,5.0,                       exactly what i hoped for     
293,2.0,                       leather and condition was great  after using it twice it is severely lopsided  i miss my tf           
294,5.0,                       for those wondering like i was  the colored versions are exactly the same as the original evolution  same feel  same grip  same ball  only difference is the color      
295,5.0,                       great basketball     
296,5.0,                       shipped on time  and was packaged well  the balk is durable  has good grip  and is well made      
297,5.0,                       such a difference in how this ball performs  it dribbles smooth  it bounces high  it out performs all of our basketballs  will never buy another ball again  love this revolution ball      
298,1.0,                       valve stem leaked     
299,5.0,                       great        
300,2.0,                       i ve played with evolution basketballs for years  for some reason this one is different  i m not sure if it was because it was shipped instead of bought from a store  but i definitely feel a difference  during warm ups with about     different evolutions it is noticeably harder and tougher to handle dribble than the other of the same type  players will purposefully pass up on shooting with it because they can tell it s off  at first i thought it might need to be  broken in   which is why i didn t immediately return it  but now it s too late and i unfortunately have an inferior ball of the same brand that i feel makes the best men s basketball  needless to say i was disappointed      
301,5.0,                       it is a little expensive but remember that it is the top of the line boys basketball  and well worth the money      
302,5.0,                       the plays as expected   who doesn t like playing with a wilson evolution basketball      
303,1.0,                       don t buy because i think it s a fake the black channels are not glued on nicely so it was sticking out  i played with a lot of basketballs and the wilson evolution is supposed to be one of the best in america  what i received did not sound like it was one of the best      
304,5.0,                       the wilson evolution is definitely one of the preferred basketballs for indoor courts  the feel is nice and for the price it s a great value  this and the spalding brands are great for indoor      
305,5.0,                       this is my favorite type of basketball to play with  likely because it s the type that i grew up playing with  panels have a good feel to them and the ball retains air superbly  i ve had mine for about    months and it still looks feel great  once it wears out i ll buy another one      
306,5.0,                       great basketball for indoor shooting     
307,2.0,                       i love wilson evolution basketballs  they have been my ball of choice since i was     this experience was not typically what i expect from them  my ball is of poor quality as it is peeling at the seems and air hole is slightly elevated cause you to feel it when you shoot  these defects show more brightly after trying to play with this thing this the first evolution ball i have brought that didn t last at least a couple of years  may have to move to spalding or fiba     
308,5.0,                       great ball but i don t know why it costs too much   hopefully it lasts a long time      
309,5.0,                       absolutely wonderful ball   worth the price for all serious players  perfectly round and great feel      
310,5.0,                       best ball there is  i made     free throws in a roll with it      
311,5.0,                       really nice basketball      
312,5.0,                       it s great     
313,5.0,                       i don t know why  but you can tell a cheap basketball from a good quality basketball easily  i originally bought my husband a basketball for his birthday that i got from target for      now  i love target and normally love everything i get from there  but my husband didn t seem satisfied with it when i gave it to him  he told me to get this specific basketball instead and when it arrived  it was very obvious that this is a good basketball in comparison to the cheap one from target  my husband plays basketball every morning and he loves this one  would highly recommend it      
314,5.0,                       highlighter basketball  no one else around me has this yellow evolution ball so it makes it super easy to know where it is at a crowded gym  plays exactly like you expect from a wilson evolution      
315,5.0,                       wilson evolution should be the only ball allowed into any gym     and with the different color writing  i can now easily identify my ball alongst everyone else s with the black letters      
316,5.0,                       best basketball out there by far      
317,5.0,                       good and unique with the blue     
318,1.0,                       beware  this is not the nhr evolution with the soft core grip   it is hard skinned and feels like an outdoor ball   i went to return and surprise  this return option was closed in about a month from receipt   i feel ripped off since i could have gone down to dick s and paid the same price for the real thing      
319,4.0,                       i ve bought a couple different basketballs the past year in search of one that holds it shape when inflated and seems to be accurate size and feel   this ball meets all of those items   the ball is regulation size and has a good grip   it does tend to be a little slick before break in  but overall high quality game ball   normally the go to during games      
320,5.0,                       my husband has played basketball since high school then college then on teams  he is now    and he plays   times a week at a gym with    yr old on up    he s the oldest  and he will only use this ball  it s the best     
321,5.0,                       great product but still needed air  not ready for use immediately      
322,5.0,                       the best basketball on the market bar none   grip lasts for a long time   soft to dribble due to the inner core   won t wear your hands out   i have played with numerous basketballs   this is clearly superior to the others  spalding  wilson   wave        grip has lasted in spite of continuous play for   months indoors      
323,5.0,                       got for grandson for christmas   he loved it   he s very proud of it  and looking forward to taking it to practice with him      
324,1.0,                       the valve loses air within   day  i have to keep inflating the ball everytime before using it  i should have returned it and get a new one     
325,5.0,                       good basketball for indoor use   great feels   very nice texture   soft   smells good out of box      
326,4.0,                       balls too small  not game size  also quality is cheap  just spend the extra     for the regular one  mine can lopsided as well  can t play with it update  although i didn t like the product  i can always appreciate good customer service  got a refund for the ball and the seller was quick to respond     
327,5.0,                       i see reviews of people that get one from a bad batch  that wobbles or doesn t feel right   i would have preferred a ball with a different highlight color to make it easy to identify but there appearied to be a higher incidence of imperfect reviews   i m very happy with the one i recieved      
328,5.0,                       i shoot like kyrie irving with this ball   ok  maybe not   but the ball has a great feel   a little softer than the older tf     s  but not as tacky as the new version of the tf        seems well built and i m glad i picked it up      
329,5.0,                       i love the feel of this ball  it is a very high quality ball  easy to grip  but not too sticky and not too slick   i love it  i will keep purchasing this same ball in the future update  i play a ton of basketball and have purchased this same ball   times now over the last few years      
330,5.0,                       we all know evo is the    ball used in pick up games at your local gym  and it is just as popular in most rec leagues as well  my old evo ball was on its last legs  and it was time for a new ball  i was a little wary about getting another evo  over the years the quality of ball to ball varies  you can get a great ball  or you can get a dud  this being almost     off of retail price had me cautious  because i was afraid of getting a crappy ball  but luckily  i hit the lotto  as others have mentioned my ball has the  n   code on it  as there have been qc complaints with balls that start with a  z  code it s soft  grippy  and i can tell right away before use that this will be a great ball  you ll know right away if you got a quality ball   my cousin just picked up a evo recently but his ball feels way different   the composite leather on his isn t soft to the touch and has this  plastic  feeling to it  and the bounce of the ball is inconsistent  we starting playing with it at our local    hr gym and everyone complained about  so we had to stop mid game and switch it out to another evo  and it was complete opposite  he got it at a authorized vendor  but like it said earlier it can vary from ball to ball if you get a ball that stats with a  n  code this ball is money      
331,5.0,                       this is the perfect basketball  my daughter is an eighth grader and these are her leagues game balls  i bought one for her for christmas so she could practice with it  it has great bounce and wonderful grip      
332,5.0,                       love this ball  it s a great quality ball and the color options are the best  it s always easy to spot your kids ball in a gym when it s personalized with a different color than what you can find at a sporting good store      
333,5.0,                       i ve used wilson for years  best basketball s on the market without a doubt      
334,5.0,                       great price for such a durable basketball  do not play with ball outdoors ever   it is designed for indoors only      
335,5.0,                       very good ball to use indoor for pratice     
336,5.0,                       daughters club team all want to use this ball  it is perfect      
337,5.0,                       hands down easily the best indoor basketball  makes you feel like mj if you have a decent shot lol  great grip and rarely need to put air in it      
338,2.0,                       good basketball but i wish i could exchange it since the color is just too bright  ughhh      
339,5.0,                       i ve had this ball for a little more than a year   we play indoor with it   to   times a week for about   to     hours each   the ball still looks like new   the grip is excellent   does a fairly good job at maintaining ball pressure   definitely worth the extra money      
340,5.0,                       nice can tell difference in from other balls     
341,5.0,                       i purchased this ball from amazon because it s practically impossible to find a good       ball at the major retailers   everyone else sells indoor outdoor  i o  balls that just don t cut it for competitive play for girls our boys    and under   i have used several full size wilson evolutions  and they are the ball of choice at almost all courts   they bounce well  have a good feel  and great grip   they don t have the  plasticy  feel of i o balls if you re looking to purchase your daughter  or young son  an inexpensive basketball  go get an i o ball for       however  if you want something that is enjoyable to use  the wilson evolution is absolutely the best bet      
342,1.0,                       i gave up on it  the  st ball s leather comes off at two places quite obviously so i returned it for a replacement  the replacement ball has glue all over the place  contacted amazon and asked the agent to leave a note for the warehouse staff letting them send me an okay quality ball  the third ball looks okay out of the box  i put my name on it because lots of folks use wilson evolution at the basketball court  while  after one game leather already came off  i can feel that whenever i dribble or shoot the ball       now i regret putting my name on it for not being able to return it i guess       this suppose to be one of the best indoor basketballs  i don t know where folks got their nice wilson evolution balls  i recommend others going to the retail stores and pick the good ones or trying on amazon and keeping your finger crossed good luck guys      
343,5.0,                       pre coronavirus  this ball served me well  now it is a relic of the past  one day i will tell my grandchildren about this strange sport of throwing ball through hoop  good times  good times      
344,5.0,                       good product given as birthday gift to    yr old  arrived on time  the boy loves it     
345,3.0,                       i received the ball today  quick shipping  however  the ball does not look as normal  see picture as i pumped it up  the valve tip still pushed out  i could not push it back in even deflated and then inflated  i asked for a replacement and will see what it will look like      
346,5.0,                       excellent basketball  love the look and grip  bounce  is true and softer feel helps keep good control on dribble     
347,5.0,                       had it for a couple of months and very great quality and worth the money     
348,1.0,                       the ball came flat and when i pumped it up it was distorted  couldn t even bounce it without it going sideways      
349,5.0,                       just received my wilson evolution from amazon today  couldn t be happier  was able to get it in just a couple days  the ball is in perfect condition  and is pumped up ready to go  can t wait to bring it to the gym      
350,5.0,                       our son loved this ball   easy to spot at the club when shooting around   all his friends thought it was so cool      
351,2.0,                       i ordered the scarlet red color for my son   the lettering is actually a dark pink and probably better suited for a girl   its also made in mexico  whereas the black lettered one  i bought in the store  is made in china   funny as it may seem  the one from china seemed to be better quality than the one made in mexico   being that my son is more in touch with his masculine side  i had to return the pink one and keep the black one i bought in the local store      
352,1.0,                       i have another evolution basketball and this thing does not have near the grip it is supposed to   seems like a knock off product   send me a new ball      
353,5.0,                       bought for my   year old grandson s birthday present   he is on a traveling team and this is the ball they use for practices and games   he was very happy with the present      
354,1.0,                       the ball was not official size  ball was smaller than official size  noticed it while compared with another ball that was official size  also shoot around with the ball seemed different then  past my   months return and realized too late for return        
355,5.0,                       good product     
356,1.0,                       the wilson evolution is an excellent basketball    butttt       i was shipped a replica ball  it is not hard to tell   all of the reviews stating that the ball was lopsided  or did not bounce evenly  were probably replica balls  you can tell if you have the official ball by observing near the needle inflation hole for all of the necessary writing  please see the below picture for confirmation      
357,5.0,                       been using this brand of basketball for indoor basketball for years  no other ball comes close when it comes to comfort and grip  the surface of the ball is a bit soft but still offers excellent feedback  while minimizing finger jam injuries better wet grip than other balls  better than tf     from my personal experience because of the softer material  still very durable as long as you keep the ball indoors only would not use this ball outdoors  seems like i tll get ripped up      
358,5.0,                       i bought this for my kid and i have to say that there is no other indoor basketball better than this   this is the top of the line indoor basketball      
359,5.0,                       love the feel and the weight is closer to the official ball  you just have to play with it some to get rid of the sticky new ball feeling one negative it still hasn t helped me shoot like curry      
360,5.0,                       best basketball of all time     
361,5.0,                       just beware of the size    had to return because it was to small     
362,5.0,                       best basketball o the market     
363,1.0,                       i have purchased this before but this time when i opened the package the ball was in the plastic bag  i am highly doubting if this is legitimate genuine wilson basketball  it looks like its a cheap knockout from chinatown      
364,4.0,                       this was a christmas gift for my    year old grand son   needless to say he just loved  loved  loved it     he spends a lot of time playing basketball and away from the video games so that s a score for me     will definitely recommend      
365,5.0,                       recommended by our elementary school league coach  the blue script was a hit with the boys  been using now for   months with no regrets or concerns      
366,5.0,                       i debated long and hard to knock a star off because i was caught off guard when it came deflated out of box  it was also folded in on itself in a way it made it a bit difficult to pump air in it initially so it could finally get its shape  had to run to store for a small pump lol   after i got her pumped and to about     psi  pump at dicks sporting goods came with a sweet pressure gauge  i walked to my local park and put up some shots and i loved every single minute of it  great ball  great handling  grip  weight  bounce  it s honestly a fantastic ball so i m giving it   stars regardless      
367,5.0,                       best ball on the market aside from a real nba ball      
368,4.0,                       bought for my   year old daughter who plays organized basketball she uses this ball at camps and practice  she loves it  and i prefer the grip of this ball to the popular spalding ball      
369,5.0,                       i m too old to be playing organized or even pickup games  i just enjoy going to the y a couple times a week to shoot around for about an hour  this ball has provided me many enjoyable hours on a hardwood court for the past eight months  since adding a little air to the ball after taking it out of its box  i don t remember needing to adjust the pressure since if i ever need to replace this basketball or purchase another one for any reason  for indoor use  only   i will simply buy a wilson evolution  though i did a fair amount of research for my initial basketball purchase  i will not feel the need to see if any better choices have surfaced in the future  i don t think it would be worth my time because i can t imagine being more satisfied with a basketball      
370,5.0,                       can t go wrong here  used by many high schools and it carries the nfhs logo  amazon s price beat lots of athletic supply houses  can t beat the prime shipping either  we are using it for our older children that are part of upward basketball at our church      
371,5.0,                       the wilson evolution      is a great training tool for boys and girls youth players in elementary and middle school  girls high school  college  and overseas athletes also use a ball this size  this ball provides wide channels for fingers and has excellent grip  this is a premium indoor basketball and worth the hype      
372,5.0,                       best ball i ve bought so far      
373,5.0,                       my favorite basketball to use indoors     
374,5.0,                       great ball for the price  i bought it based on the reviews and i m glad i did  when i play  everyone else comments on how much they like the feeling and grip on the ball      
375,4.0,                       good ball     
376,1.0,                       this ball definitely did not feel genuine which is extremely disappointing considering the     price tag  i wish amazon did more to protect consumers from knock off products  fortunately i discovered this before i used the product so i will be returning it      
377,1.0,                       we ordered the scarlet but when my grandson opened his present  it is pink    when we received it  we left it in the box thus couldn t really see the color     he immediately put his name on it before really realizing the color   so now we can t return it   disappointed      
378,5.0,                       it s a great competitive basketball and allows for confident ball handling      
379,5.0,                       well made   i hope it lasts as long as my previous ball   solid grip   colors help differentiate between owners  solid move      
380,5.0,                       been using it for a year now  great basketball  highly recommend this one     
381,5.0,                       gift for grandson  he loves it  job done      
382,5.0,                       great basketball       this is my  rd one in    years     
383,5.0,                       love the look and feel and the bounce of the basketball      
384,5.0,                       handling with the wilson evo is a pleasure because it is so soft and forgiving on your fingers  other composite balls can be really tough on your hands and some balls can even scrape and cut your fingers  not with the evo  which is a pleasure to dribble and shoot with this beautiful blend of grip and accurate bounce characteristics  your grip does change with additional sweating either  as the ball wicks moisture away from the seams  btw   i love the way the seams are laid into this ball  it is perfect  this is a great ball and i highly recommend it even with the slightly higher cost      
385,5.0,                       excellent for indoor play  they have really good grip and seem to last quite a while      
386,5.0,                       good as usual      
387,5.0,                       really good grip that s so important to any ball player and that makes for tacky feel which helps for handles and shooting the basketball      
388,5.0,                       good value for a great ball     
389,5.0,                       delivered as expected     
390,1.0,                       after only a month of use the seams are fraying leaving your hands torn to shreds after a game  poor quality      
391,5.0,                       great ball     
392,5.0,                       yes  good ball  best ball  don t know how it is outdoors because i m not the sultan of agrabah and i don t have the riches of a nation to waste such an amazing high quality ball on the dirt filled floors of outside  roadkill is found outside  why would you bring this ball to areas where roadkill happens  i heard that a plane crash outside  not going to bring my  wilson evolution game basketball  to a plane crash  never ever play with this ball outdoors  it is way too nice      
393,5.0,                       great ball   perfect for my middle school son      
394,5.0,                       it s an amazing ball  of course you have to break it un a little bit to get the full affect of the ball but overall it s an amazing ball  don t be stupid and use this ball outside  i ve seen people do this and it ruins the ball in a matter of days  keep this ball in indoor basketball courts  definitely should get this ball if you want an indoor basketball      
395,5.0,                       this is my favorite indoor ball as far as quality  the other options in this price range from nike  wilson  spalding  molton  etc  are all very good  however  my personal preference leans towards this ball      
396,5.0,                       this is my husbands favorite basketball   he plays   days a week in the mornings before work and this is the ball everyone loves to use   he has one exactly like this he got about a year ago and its worn from all the use it gets  so he s getting a new one for christmas      
397,5.0,                       great ball  kind of expensive but not compared to other balls     
398,5.0,                       dribbles very well  has a nice feel  and doesn t overly bounce  have made many baskets with this  definitely recommend      
399,1.0,                       i bought this ball recently and was extremely disappointed because it s not the same ball  the feel doesn t seem right when compared with the other evo balls at the stores  i ve read the other negative reviews and thought maybe they had bad luck with it  but after trying it out myself  someone over there at wilson definitely made a bait and switch  this feels like a cheap     ball      
400,5.0,                         star     
401,1.0,                       not happy order scarlet and got neon  needed it for today   wasnt willing to send out the correct one until they got the wrong one  even tho it was their mistake  so now i wake      
402,1.0,                       this ball was not cheap and my son went to add air and the spot you inflate broke  now it s too late to return and it was a christmas gift      
403,1.0,                       this color is slippery as hell idk why  dont buy this one buy the original color      
404,4.0,                       this is a solid game ball for varsity competition  the only downside is that it is a little hard  some balls have a softer feel  all in all it was a good purchase      
405,5.0,                       best ball in the game  i coach high school varsity and hold lots of workshops as well  so these balls get a lot of use from me and my boys  they hold up great with heavy daily use  that s important since i end up buying the balls myself for the school use   meant for indoor use only  and i have seen several reviews complaining they don t hold up outdoors  please dont expect this to work on rough concrete      
406,1.0,                       i do like the ball  but i bought a size   ball and it says       and size   on the ball  size   is supposed to be        and i wonder what do they sell for the size   balls      
407,5.0,                       great basketball for indoor play  gets a bit slippery when wet  but it s high quality      
408,5.0,                       love this ball     so beautiful and great quality      
409,2.0,                       this is my favorite ball  but the one i received was poorly assembled   the leather was coming apart at the ends so the channels were not smooth   it probably would have worked fine  but i was not comfortable with the poor quality so i returned it and picked one out in a local store for a little higher price      
410,1.0,                       how about zero stars  advertised as an evolution and then i received an ncaa replica ball   not the same thing   thanks but no thanks     
411,5.0,                       my daughter needed a new ball for practice and we took a chance on this since her last ball barely made it through last season   from day one she loved the grip and response of the ball  her teammates always wanted to use the ball during scrimmages  it was so popular with the girls that other parents were in search of the same ball  one season down and the ball is still in great shape      
412,1.0,                       item came to me with multiple issues ball was not glued properly  so pieces of the corners were coming up valve wasn t properly seated in the ball    it was coming up out of the opening and it made the ball uneven the ball barely holds air  i have to rump it at least once a week i m sure i received a defective ball because i ve played with a ton of evos and they ve never been this bad  i finally went to a store near me and bought a different one   that one is near perfect      
413,5.0,                       it s a wilson basketball it s exactly as advertised i have been enjoying it on the court dunking on all my opponents thank you     
414,5.0,                       my son is a baller and was quite excited about this new ball   it s only for use inside      
415,5.0,                       very high quality   plus  the fact that it s blue  i get people commenting on it all the time   and  i don t have to write my name or initials on the ball because everyone knows it s mine based on the color      
416,5.0,                       this is the basketball to gift your hooper      
417,5.0,                       this is by far the best ball for the money  i play a lot of ball with different players and    times out of    an evo is selected as the game ball  the have such a nice feel and you don t ever have to worry about air loss  it s worth an extra     to     more than other balls just for the quality      
418,5.0,                       the evolution is a great indoor ball that has become more popular in the local gyms  i seem to have to get a new one every year from playing     times a week  i ordered the ball with the yellow lettering  the yellow makes it easy to identify my ball at the gym  it looks cool when you shoot  great overall ball      
419,5.0,                       great basketball      
420,5.0,                       it s evo     
421,2.0,                       bought this puppy because i needed a second ball  i already own one of these in the original color scheme  thought it would be cool to order the green one to differentiate the two  bad idea  my other one is full size  this one is both smaller and heavier      
422,5.0,                       i bought this for a friend for a christmas present  i was surprised that basketballs could even cost this much  he claimed it was the best basketball for recreation  he really enjoys playing with this ball      
423,5.0,                       one of the best basketballs i have ever owned and i have been playing since i was a kid  i won t reveal my age but lets say i ve been watching mj his whole career         
424,5.0,                       great pick up indoor ball     
425,3.0,                       out the box  and this microfiber crap has a plastic feel  i don t know what feels worse  the ball when first unpackaged  or the ball when broken in      
426,5.0,                       he loved it      
427,5.0,                       this is by far the best basketball for your money  it s not as cheap as some other ones  but when you play with it you ll know where your money is going  takes some time to break in  but when it gets broken in it gets so nice  feels so nice and natural against your hands  definitely helps with ball handling   touch for shooting  i used to use the spalding tf      and swore by it  but they have since changed the material and the ball is not as nice  wilson evolution has become my go to ball for indoor use don t use this outdoors   i highly recommend      
428,2.0,                       this is a good product but the one we have has a slow leak and needs to be pumped up each day before use   it is only used indoor and has been like this since the beginning so it is unclear  what the issue may be   if it stayed inflated like most other balls do it would be a        
429,5.0,                       it was a big hit with       grade boys  i raffled it off at basketball tournament      
430,5.0,                       the wilson evolution game ball is excellent in all areas  the wilson evolution feels great in your hands when you re shooting  the wilson evolution has a nice bounce  the wilson evolution might feel worried out the box at first  but you just have to keep playing with it  and it will get better over time      
431,5.0,                       great ball      
432,3.0,                       this ball is a great ball for indoor use and competitive games  i have used one of these for over    years playing basketball growing up so i know that these balls are great and durable  however the one i received had the black lines and some of the lettering peeling off  this is somewhat frustrating because without the peeling this ball is perfect and would last me years but because it was shipped to me already peeling it won t last nearly as long before it all peels off and looks feels terrible when playing      
433,2.0,                       this ball had a small leak day one and in about   weeks goes flat    for this nice of a ball i would expect to have a much better durability    was only being used indoors        
434,1.0,                       paid for an evolution ball but got a wilson ncaa ball      
435,5.0,                       i like the balance between weight and grip     
436,3.0,                       awesome ball  even the best of the best  my particular ball isn t holding air adequately  i shouldn t have to pump it up  but am left having to put air in weekly  considering writing wilson to complain   i would complain because my experience is that this isn t normally the case with this ball  tremendous feel  tack  quality  and shoots true     
437,5.0,                       well i have owned this ball for almost   years now  if you want a basketball that lasts and plays the best this is the one to get our city has a group that gets together weekly and the only balls that get used are evolutions      
438,5.0,                       the wilson evolution    bring this ball to pretty much any indoor recreational basketball court and it ll be the preferred ball for the game  it s soft to the touch  and if you like shooting jumpshots  you really get a feel of the ball when you shoot it  it s hard to put into words the satisfaction you get from the feeling of the ball leaving your hand  but this ball really makes it perfect  i haven t had the chance to try out the nba official game ball  it s also twice as expensive   but for most amateur players like me  this will be your favorite ball      
439,5.0,                       very good quality   no surprises   same as the ones you use on the court      
440,5.0,                       just the perfect basketball for indoor play  it has the right amount of grip  weight  and feels like a natural extension of your hand  love this ball  can t say enough   make sure people don t steal it   everyone else loves it too       
441,5.0,                       love the feel with no slips on shotsgreat for highschoolersi buy several a year  always the best     
442,4.0,                       good quality ball  bounce feels great when dribbling  very easy to handle because of the soft  tacky cover  however for those who grew up loving the old spalding tf  not the new one posing as a tf   the wilson ball will feel a bit mushy  most people like the ball but almost everyone comments about how soft it is  some love it  and some hate it  i think it is a good ball  but you will always find someone in the gym or on the courts who make a comment about how they loathe the soft  mushy feel      
443,5.0,                       this is what our   year old grandson asked santa for and he loves it  its nice that it comes in two sizes for the little ones with smaller hands  it has a very nice feel to it and he s already used it many times at the gym very satisfied     
444,5.0,                       better than the tf       very good grip  do no pump the ball too much in the beginning  this will need to break in a little bit  a piece along the groove started getting loose after   weeks however it does not seem like a common issue  indoor hooping is recommended  this is the ball everyone uses when playing pick up games  everyone who plays indoors knows about this specific ball  sorry tf      during your hiatus in producing the original full leather ball  these have surpassed you as the preferable choice in basketball      
445,1.0,                       super hard and doesn t bounce very well     
446,5.0,                       great basketball for indoor play  it s better if comes with a pump for free even a cheap one lol  anyway  great product      
447,1.0,                       if you re gonna buy this ball make sure you get the black one  if you get colored versions it s cheaper quality and the edges peel  i felt the ridges and it wasn t glued we ll enough  i bought the black with gold version lettering instead and they are perfect      
448,5.0,                       best most consistent indoor ball i ve played with  soft and weighted perfectly      
449,4.0,                       very good basketball  i have been using it for several months now and it is holding up fairly well  one corner of the material is starting to lift but overall it is holding pretty well  it is recommended to keep a pump handy as you will need to pump it up a little every couple of weeks      
450,5.0,                       always a fantastic ball   had to purchase a  nd ball to have enough to coach my youth teams   thought about going with a couple other brands  but am very glad i stuck with the tried and true evolution   does not disappoint      
451,5.0,                       great quality basketball although i was surprised it came in a plastic bag   this lead me to believe it may not be the same as sold in the retail stores but  it is the same      
452,4.0,                       bought this ball and have loved playing indoor basketball with it so far  however  the stem has already started protruding  it hasn t caused any big problems yet that i have noticed but for the price of the ball  that should not happen  other than that  i love the ball      
453,5.0,                       standard wilson ball with navy blue letters  it s perfect because it s not distracting but when at the gym with a bunch of other similar balls i can tell exactly which one is mine compared to ones with black writing      
454,5.0,                       perfect for    year old player     
455,1.0,                       the ball came with a defective valve  and it would leak air  i constantly pump the ball every couple hours  my friend has the same exact ball and does not have to pump the ball constantly      
456,5.0,                       our program owns about    balls ranging from all the popular kinds   this is our game ball  because of the color   it plays like the regular evos  unlike the black ones that dont have the needed hs stamp     
457,5.0,                       the evolution is best basketball period       
458,5.0,                       i ve bought   balls  regular  red  and green  in total  but i found that both the colored ones were off  they were uneven at the seams and felt a bit smaller  the regular black one was perfect  i didn t have any issues at all it even came perfectly inflated  i can t say the same for the colored ones  i read a few reviews for the colored ones  saying the were bad as well but i ignored it  and now i ll be returning them  save yourself the extra money and get the regular one     
459,5.0,                       this has always been my favorite ball to play indoor with  i have been buying this ball for    years  great grip and perfectly soft  i have played with an nba official game ball  and this is way  way better      
460,5.0,                       the good you will not be disappointed  micro pebble fiber really makes a difference on the grip  and when you re in the game and your hands are all sweaty  you ll never have to blame a turnover on your slippery fingers again the quality of the basketball is great for fifty dollars  i ve been using mine for more than a year  and the material still hasn t worn down  or popped  or shown any signs of deflating  and i ve used it a lot also  the basketball is ready to go right out of the box  no need to dig through the junk drawer for an air pump  because all you have to do is remove the box and lace up your sneakers the kind of bad the evolution basketball is for indoor use only  so that means  don t even think about taking it outside on a nice sunny day for a game of street ball  the leather  like almost anything  won t hold up against the blacktop  believe me  i ve had friends who have tried and had to ditch the evolution for a new one in less than a month  a month is still a decent lifetime of continuous play to get out of an indoor ball  but for fifty bucks  i d advise you not to try overall you can t find a better basketball at that price  the next best ball is probably what the pros use and they cost over a hundred bucks  sure  you can find balls for maybe half the price but you ll be throwing them away in three months  but if you want one that will last you a long time and make you feel like you re in the pros  then go with the wilson evolution   smd      
461,5.0,                       came quick and absolutely great feel  if you ve played with a nice game ball before and that s what you want  then this is what you need hands down     
462,4.0,                       don t love the green but the price was     cheaper and the color in now way effects the functionality of the ball so no brained for me heard it takes a while to  break in  but excited to do that  i know these are great balls      
463,3.0,                       the red words we chose turned out pink      
464,1.0,                       i bought this basketball recently and couldn t wait to use it  unfortunately it wouldn t pump  the basketball had a faulty valve  i am very disappointed because i spent     on this and i didnt get what i paid for  i hope they refund my full amount      
465,5.0,                       great tacky ball  it grips better as it gets sweaty   and the black and gold is eye catching    help prevent others form mistaking you ball as theirs      
466,2.0,                       not like other evo basketballs i ve used  not a horrible ball but not the    dollar evo i m use to      
467,5.0,                       this is the best ball period   i play about     days a week and this is better than the nba ball   its a favorite at about every open gym i have been to   just do not use it outside   not even dribble it  it will get dirt in there and loose its grip      
468,5.0,                       perfectly balanced and holds its air   great texture and durability   love it   unfortunately  i still can t shoot like steph curry though      
469,5.0,                       perfect basketball for me to drain some   s like ray allen      
470,5.0,                       outstanding ball      
471,5.0,                       good ball   son loved it     
472,5.0,                       needed another ball for indoor and looked at walmart and here for the best price   saw the blue lettering and the price at     and pulled the trigger   the delivery was quick and it came in the original packaging  has help up nicely for the past year while playing   or   times a week      
473,5.0,                       ball has good feel  lasts well for indoor use      
474,5.0,                       great basketball     
475,5.0,                       it s a basketball  what more do you want  feels good in the hand and seems like a good ball to me      
476,5.0,                       the evolution ball is the best indoor leather ball  in the     and under price range  this is our  nd evolution ball and i would recommend to anyone who plays indoors  note   not for outdoors    this ball is always selected as  the ball  to be used in pickup and league games   just be aware due to the favorable conditions of the ball  it will be a target for some to take home for own  this is why we ordering a  nd ball   the ball was     on amazon   no shipping vs      the local sporting goods super store     
477,5.0,                       best basketball there is    and everyone knows it  so make sure you write the owner s name all over it  in huge letters  with a phone number   my son s name was on it  but fairly small  and didn t seem to matter   it was stolen during a basketball game  probably from a disgruntled member of the team we beat    they should put a gps tracking device in these things  or module like a  tile  or  cube  inside  so that you can activate it and make it start beeping loudly   i d pay another        to have that  and i would appreciate some royalties from wilson when they do it       great ball    just keep your eyes on it at all times      
478,5.0,                       great ball  only for indoor use but it s got great texture and feel  almost always chosen for the game ball for pickup games      
479,2.0,                       at first  great ball all around  but after a sum of one months use  and very light at that  several spots around the seaming and the bladder started leaking  not holding air effectively  not sure if poor quality assurance or just a poor product      
480,3.0,                       wrong size came in  now i have to reorder the ball     
481,3.0,                       great feel  weight  color  etc  but this is my  rd wilson  evolution i ve bought and this one is way more poorly co structure  the black channels were not matched up well along the edges of the orange  leather  sections     so when you spin it in your hands you can feel weird edges instead of smoothness  not good and that will likely cause the ball to wear out faster and fray in those spots      
482,5.0,                       this basketball is great  bounces very well and has been very durable both for me and my   year old who is just learning how to play  highly recommend it      
483,1.0,                       what a joke   the ball comes in oblong  nothing even close to round   highly recommend not buying this product   ended up going to local sports store and buying replacement      
484,4.0,                       came as described  well packaged  ended up not being the kind my family wanted  so had to return it  didn t like that i had to pay to return it      
485,5.0,                       i have been playing basketball for most of my life and over that time have tried many different brands  wilson  spalding mostly   after doing some research online i came across this ball and put the order through  after some court time with the ball and breaking it in the ball feels great in my hand and have good handle with the ball  i only use this indoors  this has become the game ball in my local comp and have had other players ask where i got the ball  no regrets with this purchase      
486,5.0,                       very well made my son loves it      
487,5.0,                       great ball  i ve had it for about   months now and it still gets compliments for looking new  my only gripe is that i start sweating a lot late into games and it does make this ball slippery      
488,5.0,                       i bought this as a present for my son  he really likes this basketball  the grip is excellent      
489,5.0,                       this is a terrific ball  it feels great  and since it s the one used by the high schools for their game ball it means you re practicing with what you ll be playing with  be sure you understand  though  that this ball is indoor only  if you understand that  then this ball is perfect      
490,5.0,                       my son loves it  he says it s the best basketball for indoor  i am no expert in basketballs but i have to say it does feel better than many of the other basketballs      
491,5.0,                       i chose green lettering to stand out at my gym from the other evolution balls   best decision ever  this ball is a staple  incredible for indoor gym use  after you use it a couple of hours it softens up and becomes perfect   my ball ends up getting chosen for literally every game played at the gym now      
492,5.0,                       this is by far the best indoor basketball  i ve owned many of these evolution b balls  the composite feel is amazingly soft  especially after it has been broken in  can t go wrong with the wilson evolution basketball       
493,4.0,                       great basketball the reason i m not giving   stars cause when it arrived it had a little scuff mark in it  when i pay     for something i would like for it to be in perfect condition  it s still a awesome ball and would recommend it to anyone from amateur to professional      
494,5.0,                       best ball on the market but gets kindy slick when your hands are sweaty        
495,4.0,                       feels great  needs to be pumped up pretty much each time i go to play with it but thats not a huge deal      
496,4.0,                       it does need air every couple of months but a super nice ball      
497,2.0,                       this is a great ball  don t get me wrong  it is by far the best indoor basketball i ve laid my hands on  however  it is either low durability or bad quaity control  my ball has two peeled seams already i only use it for indoors  and has never abuse it in anyway  i play about     times a week  around    minutes each time  the quality is just unacceptable for a ball like this  i would love to buy another one but if the quality is like this  i would stay away      
498,5.0,                       other than an actual official nba basketball  this is hands down the best basketball you can buy  i have had mine for many years now and it is still in great shape  it is strictly for indoor so do not take on the streets or the soft leather surface will be damaged  it has good feel  grip  seams  and durability  this is the ball everyone wants to use in a rec league or pickup game  highly recommend      
499,5.0,                       we always run games using my ball  someone stole my first one so i bought another one  that s how good of a ball it is for the money      
500,5.0,                       absolutely the best indoor ball on the market  when i first touched this ball  it was at a pickup game and after   minutes i knew i had to have it  it was the best ball  with the best feel i had ever played with  not only have i played an incredible amount of basketball with lots of different balls  i am also an incredibly skilled researcher  i literally went through       s of reviews for every ball made under       so when i say this is the best reviewed ball that is being made  it s means people who have purchased every top name ball on the market  solutions  tf      s etc   are also saying it s the best and the one that will get picked to be used the most when playing  what s the point of having and practicing with a great ball if it s never used in any games  i also have owned this ball for about   months now and feel like i can give it my wholehearted endorsement feel when i say it has the best  feel  of any ball i have ever used  hundreds of people agree with me  this ball has the perfect grip and softness and rolls perfectly off your fingers  it s has a little bit of give or sponginess in the leather which gives it the perfect amount of give on the rim  and also helps to give you that perfect grip throughout an intense game without getting slippery  unlike many other balls where you feel like it slipped or didn t roll off your hand correctly  i know every time i miss with this ball it s because i made a mistake not due to any fault of the ball endurance this ball holds up incredibly well  indoors  on a swept court  this ball is indoor only my friends and if there are little rocks on the court it will get nicked  after   months of use i was playing the other night and after the game one of the guys picked up the game ball and was talking about my  new  ball  it looks and feels just as good as the first day i played with it    honestly it feels even better  don t ask me how  but it feels better and better the more you play with it like a broken in pair of shoes price       when i purchaed it if you are on amazon  you are looking for a good price and convenience  the price is absolutely worth it on this ball  even if you buy cheap balls  this ball is worth it on endurance alone  the quality is    steps up from a budget ball and by the time your budget ball would lose it s grip and wear down  you will still have this ball with great grip    steps above the replacement ball you would normally buy this ball is awesome   endorsed by hundreds of hardcore ballers  this is overall the best ball i have ever owned and more importantly the best ball i have ever touched or played with in any game  buy with confidence and know i already did all the research for you and i ve had hands on experience with it      
501,5.0,                       this is my first basketball dedicated only to indoor play  i always played with hand me down basketballs or gym balls that were torn up or with grip that was long gone  so when this ball arrived  i was surprised at the feel of this ball compared to the old and other basketballs i ve played with  including new tf    s i researched indoor basketballs prior to purchase and settled between the tf      zk pro  and evolution  i ended up going for the evolution because i had already played with new tf    s and wasn t too impressed  the evolution feels softer in my hand and seems to have a  cushioned  feel against my hand while dribbling and shooting  the tf     has a more solid feel to it and the grip is smoother  with that being said  both balls are great game balls  it just depends on your style of play i recommend going to a sports store and trying both basketballs out before settling on one  i was lucky to play with tf    s prior to buying my own indoor ball and i am happy with my purchase      
502,5.0,                       best basketball for your money hands down  competition isn t even close  this is the only ball i will buy in the future i ve had my current ball for a while now and it s still going strong after pretty heavy use  bounces very well  only thing is it s an indoor ball  so don t use it outside  and   sells a very cheap outdoor ball that s good for its purpose  but this is the indoor ball you want      
503,5.0,                       get this basketball  the grip feels nice  the ball feels very balanced  not heavy or hollow       aint cheap  but indoor ball lasts for a long time  hard to go back to other basketball once you know what it feels like to hoop with this  must buy      
504,5.0,                       this is my third wilson evolution men s basketball and so far is the best brand the money can buy  the wilson ball is durable and has a unique feel that many players enjoy game after game and has a good warranty provided by the wilson company  a definite plus      
505,5.0,                       my grandson wants this for christmas  i like the distinctive coloring      
506,5.0,                       best basketball there is      
507,4.0,                       it wasn t as grippy as i thought  still pretty grippy  also it gets wet pretty easy   i have sweaty palms   yuck  there were some flaws  in the leather  but not very noticeable and it didn t affect it in the court  wasn t worth     though  if it was indoor outdoor  i would buy it without thought  but     is a lot for a ball like this    stars is a high rating for what i ve experienced  but the ball is still really good  it might just be my ball that has these flaws  or i might just be critical      
508,4.0,                       good indoor ball for the price     
509,5.0,                       i got what i expected  ordered    they were very similar  one had slightly different depth of groove  but well within normal  i use both balls regularly and love using them both  indoor only      
510,5.0,                       hands down best basketball i ve ever had     
511,5.0,                       my nephew loved the grip     
512,5.0,                       that s was a gift for my sonhe said it s the best ball he has ever had      
513,5.0,                       for those hesitant to spend more than        on a basketball  as i was before i purchased this   i promise it s worth every penny and a much better value than a cheaper ball  i spent     on this and am still using it    months later really great all around ball  have had it and used it almost daily  daily for the past six months  indoors since august of       the grip is no longer good for dribbling so i decided it was time to try the wilson solution and retire this one  at least for daily use  what s impressive about how it s held up is that  while the grip is no longer there for dribbling  it still works very well for shooting and your fingers don t get burned from shooting it  even when i have shooting sessions approaching two hours  it also still holds air nearly as long as it did when i first bought it  normally i toss my ball when i get a new one but this one will definitely stay with me for a while  while i ve heard and read testimony that the solution is a slightly better ball  really the only reason for the change is that the solution  typically      was only     here on amazon at the time of this review  i highly recommend the evolution for indoor play  even daily      
514,5.0,                       tons of people at my rec center complement this basketball and we use it for almost all pick up games      
515,5.0,                       this is the ball to play with if you are a die hard indoor hooper   i own several of them  i got this item on an excellent price      
516,5.0,                       the evolution is a great ball   anyone who plays indoors knows this ball   the grip is great   the bounce is great   honestly the biggest problem i have with the ball is fear of it being stolen   ha ha   obviously it s made for indoor use   but a good ball is totally worth the money if you don t abuse it haven t noticed any major issues with holding air or anything      
517,5.0,                       the wilson evolution is amazing it makes training fun when you have a good basketball  unlike other basketballs such as nike  baiden  spaulding balls it has the right grip to it  it s not too hard but also not too soft i played with plenty different indoor basketballs and the wilson one stood out the most because unlike other basketballs after a few times playing and dribbling on different surfaces the ball stays the same i can t say the same for others  i know for a fact i m not the only person who enjoys playing with the ball whenever i go to the gym and me and my friends are deciding what ball to play with everybody chooses the wilson ball over the nike   spalding balls  the condition of a basketball means a lot when you are an athlete and i can say for many years now i played with a wilson ball and the condition never changes  i recommend anybody to get a wilson ball over any other basketball because it stays in perfect condition and it is affordable as well      
518,5.0,                       i gave this to my boyfriend for his birthday and he loved it  he was so excited about the durability of this ball      
519,1.0,                       buy only basketball  run and hide from  free     day app  which is a lie  i bought deal w free app  for nephew  he never downloaded app   wasn t interested  amazon takes it upon themselves to turn free app  into auto renew and charge your account card every month  whether you downloaded it  wanted it or until you notice a       monthly subscription being charged  you have to figure out cancelling on your own there are      free basketball apps in app stores no fee and no subscriptions  amazon  that s what free is      
520,3.0,                       i really like how it looks with the added color  but it kind of feels like a knock off  not sure yet   the material doesn t feel like a regular wilson evolution  feels a lot thinner   i still use it though because it s easier to identify in a public gym with the added color      
521,5.0,                       great indoor basketball      
522,1.0,                       purchase this ball at a sporting goods retailer or from wilson directly  price is the same everywhere  the wilson evolution basketball i purchased on amazon was defective  this is normally the gold standard for indoor balls  especially in league play  i received a ball that was missing a letter oddly enough  it was printed with  official game b  ll    no a  no joke since it was shipped loose in a box with no manufacturer packaging  i suspect this was defective merchandise purchased for cheap and resold at the retail price  hard to believe that would pass quality control  missing a letter is likely not an issue but for a     basketball  i was suspicious of any other less visible defects   internal  pump seal  texture  etc      
523,5.0,                       great ball  only ball me and my friends enjoy playing with  did come pretty flat and squished but once aired  no problems      
524,5.0,                       best basketball hands down  we play with a very competitive group of guys at lds church buildings a few times a week and this ball has been the  game ball  for about a year now       recommended the best ball out there      
525,2.0,                       many folks that i play indoor league ball with use this ball   while this is one of the best ball you can play with due to the grip  it depends on the quality of the ball you buy mine unfortunately didn t last long  i played with it once weekly for   months and now the air seems to dissipate regularly which i would have to pump in some air right before playing      
526,5.0,                       the best basketball to play with      
527,5.0,                       i coach  th grade boys basketball and these are our go to basketballs  the green matches our school colors too      
528,5.0,                       my son plays for a highly ranked aau team and his coach recommended this ball   it s amazing according to my son      
529,2.0,                       came flat with a hole in it  had to return it and had no problems in that respect  the rating is on the product not the service     
530,5.0,                       i ve been playing bball leagues for over    years now   i used to own a spalding tf      zk microfiber which was a great ball as well  i needed a replacement because my spalding reached it s lifespan  some reason i can no longer find the exact ball by spalding  they have the same ball currently out in the market but the feeling and texture is not the same   so i decided to purchase this wilson evolution   after several weeks of break in period   boy this ball is awesome and always the ball of choice comes game time  if you re a shooter like me  this ball is the choice      
531,5.0,                       this is my favorite indoor ball and is the gold standard in my gym  occasionally we will use the rock but i don t like it  the grip is not as good and i don t like the feel of it in my hands  i have also tried the baden elite   the grip on that is essentially too good  it feels sticky and does not release as well when you shoot  the evolution is soft with the right amount of grip  and feels great to shoot  of course  it does tend to get stolen way too much         
532,5.0,                       this ball is the best one in all my years of playing  my only issue with it is once it gets wet sweaty it gets pretty slippery  as most balls do  so just wiped it dry and keep ballin       
533,5.0,                       my brother already owns at least three balls  but he was pumped to be getting one of these      
534,5.0,                       great ball for indoor  a bit hard at first but after breaking it in then it s all good     
535,5.0,                       my teenager likes it a lot   i read a lot of reviews and proposed another ball to him  but he still wanted this one   after getting it he was still very happy with it      
536,5.0,                       it is good but i wish it can be used outdoors but the grip loses and it starts to wear down  otherwise it is good  i would recommended if you use it indoors only      
537,5.0,                       my grandson knows a great basketball when he plays with one   he was very impressed with his new ball      
538,5.0,                       solid ball  has a good grip texture and not to pricey  really good handling ball  and i m fond of this purchase     
539,5.0,                       great  what can i say      
540,5.0,                       great for indoor  we used this for our game ball tournament  nice grip too  i haven t use it outdoors so i wouldn t know what they feel like      
541,5.0,                       most of the boys on my son s basketball team have wilson evolution balls    all with the standard black lettering   since our school color is green  i got him the ball with the green lettering  so he his stands out  and doesn t get accidentally picked up       
542,5.0,                       for anyone who plays indoors often  this ball is a must have  it is a very good quality ball for the decent price that it s at  the bounce is consistent  and it has the best grip i have ever tried  however  there is one problem  although it s not a dealbreaker  there are visible hairs on the seams of the ball  probably from the construction of the ball  otherwise  its a very good ball      
543,1.0,                       i m writing this review after years  because i m sort of fed up with the evolution balls that are sold on amazon  i ve had this ball for some time now  i used it very seldomly  but have been actively using it recently  i noticed that when i first tried to pump the ball for the first time  the insert hole would not take my needle as if there was something in there that prevented it  i had to wiggle it and get a perfect angle in order for it to be completely inserted  after some time of doing this  as the ball would go flat very frequently    the ball will just flat out go flat within an hour of playing with it  another issue with this ball is that when i compare it to the evolution balls that other s have purchased via a department store  the grip is completely different as well as the softness of the ball  i feel like i got a cheap knock off for the same price of an actual evolution ball  hopefully this will help the  next person that tries to buy this ball off of amazon  it is clearly different and the quality is not the same      
544,5.0,                       everyone comments on the grip of this ball when i bring it to a rec court and it almost always ends up being the game ball      
545,5.0,                       definitely improved from the last versions of the evolution   i was once a proud spalding tf      supporter but since they changed the way it was made it just wasn t the same   to their credit they did try to bring it back but the ball still just isn t the same   wilson has the pick up game on lockdown right now   all of the places that i play indoor preferably use this ball      
546,5.0,                       i only use this ball for indoor games at    hour fitness  it s the best ball out there  no other ball matches this level of quality and grip      
547,3.0,                       i love the evolution balls      this one seems a little stiff  not as soft as others    i am hoping that it just needs to get broken in      
548,1.0,                       i am preparing to return this ball for the third time   normally wilson makes an excellent basketball  however  when i chose to purchase one of the color options  green lettering  they have all been defective   meaning the covering is not completely melded into the seams   when you inflate the ball the covering pulls away from the seam      
549,5.0,                       bought this for my son  other than an authentic nba basketball the grip  feel and bounce of this ball is top notch  we love this ball and happy we purchased this model      
550,5.0,                       love this ball  great grip  official size  and requires minimal inflation over time  we use this ball regularly now and have for the last year or so with very little wear and tear using it indoors only  highly recommend it      
551,1.0,                       seemed like it was going to be perfect for my son  we wanted a quality ball as he is getting now serious about basketball  i was reluctant to spend so much on a ball but did so because it seemed like it was going to be a great purchase  the ball was only used a handful of times and always needed pumped up  during tryouts for the travel team  the ball went flat and wasn t holding air  nothing could be done  my son was so embarrassed and frustrated  he couldn t even complete tryouts because they aren t allowed to share balls due to covid  very disappointing      
552,2.0,                       not what i expected of a normal evo ball  this one had the hide peeling away at the edges  and altogether was not tight construction  i wonder if it was made in china or somewhere else than normal      
553,5.0,                       this is the best basketball out there  i did have a problem with the first ball that was sent to me it had all sorts of defects  amazon was very quick about resending me a ball and the second one was perfect      
554,5.0,                       best bball on the market for a reason  got this color to differentiate mine from other people s      
555,4.0,                       a bit heavier  less bounce  smaller friction compare to the nba ball  but if feels like a pro basketball  good for          
556,5.0,                       great      
557,5.0,                       great quality basketball  my grandson uses it every day  best price we found anywhere  can t go  wrong with a wilson       
558,3.0,                       it feels different than the other wilson evolution balls i ve used  it s not as soft still is soft thought  and there are mild differences like the letters or glossy instead of matte  i don t know if amazon sells older models or something but i would ve liked to know  overall though i do still love the ball      
559,3.0,                       well worth the money  i ve used this brand for years and haven t found any better  i use indoor and outdoor  great feel too     
560,5.0,                       people are trying to steal this ball  d  d     
561,5.0,                       would buy again     
562,2.0,                       ball is good but the color of the lettering is pink it s not scarlet or even close to red     
563,5.0,                       this is probably the only basketball i would buy for indoor basketball  if you re looking for an extra basketball  wait until it goes on sale as i did      
564,3.0,                       this ball is nothing like previous      evolutions i have had in the past  this ball is very slick to the touch  took ball to gym bounce is not the best and the air valve on this ball is not level with ball surface  this is for sure a b grade ball   i already put my initials on this ball so i cannot return  this is a x code ball     
565,5.0,                       my son loves playing with the evolution ball  nice quality      
566,5.0,                       this is as good as you can do nowadays for durable indoor balls that have a leather feel  this is the first wilson i ve bought as i used to love spalding balls  but i have not been disappointed     
567,1.0,                       the basketball i received does not feel like a quality ball  went to my local sporting goods store and purchased the exact same ball for the same price  and it has a much better leather feel with deep ridges  unlike the one i received in the mail  this basketball feels like plastic      
568,4.0,                       it s a great basket ball but the edges on the ball are starting to lift up      
569,5.0,                       i have yet to actually use the ball i received  but i have used wilson evolution balls before and they are the top of the top when it comes to indoor balls  i bought the yellow on discount and like that i will be able to use that to tell my ball apart from others      
570,1.0,                       after having this ball for over   years  this version isn t the same as the other evolution basketballs  it s slippery  harder and quality is not the same as other wilson basketballs  i can only say this might be a fake one  the pic is a version of a real one that actually feels grippy and soft and nice  sad that i got a knock off  you can def tell by feel      
571,5.0,                       good quality basketball  as shown     
572,5.0,                       great basketball that has the perfect leather   product definitely feels authentic and i would definitely  recommend others to buy this ball for indoor use      
573,5.0,                       my son kept losing his ball  so i liked how you had other choices of colors besides the basic black writing  this way it s easier to spot green writing instead of black      
574,3.0,                       upon opening our package we noticed that the  l  in evolution was missing the black font  kinda disappointing seeing as we paid a little more money for a nicer basketball  the basketball still works and is good quality  it just would ve been nice if all the letters were there      
575,5.0,                       good as stated      
576,5.0,                       i bought this as a gift for my nephew who is amazing at basketball  he was thrilled  it was also on sale for christmas when i bought it  so i got a great price      
577,5.0,                       nothing more to say other than this is the best indoor basketball  held up perfectly after all these years      
578,5.0,                       best ball i ve owned  it s like a wine the older it gets the better it gets      
579,5.0,                       i have owned this ball for about   years  i have played with other balls and still feel that this is hands down the best ball to bring to the court if you are a recreational player  i play about once a week and shoot around on occassion as well  so by now i m just about ready to get another of these  the reason i like this ball over others that i have tried is due to the feel  the official nba ball is fairly hard and slick until it is well broken in  unlike other cheaper balls in many of the sporting good stores  the composite material on this ball gives it a slight tacky feel and incredible suppleness  it makes handling this ball a joy versus some of the other balls like the nike elite  in my opinion  this is the ball that most people on the court would gravitate to given a choice of balls      
580,5.0,                       looks  feels and plays like a wilson   i have been hooping with this ball since i received it a few weeks ago and the feel of the cover just seems to get better and better each day   i may have lucked out considering all the complaints from some reviews   just remember to not get it wet and only play with this ball indoors so it can last a long time   highly recommend      
581,5.0,                       authentic    and picked it up for a great price  nice  feel  to it  too      
582,5.0,                       i ve bought and wore out four of these basketballs now over the last   years of coaching and training  it s a great basketball  just wish it was a little cheaper      
583,5.0,                       the ball has a great feel to it and is soft on the rim   i liked that i could select a color for the writing to have it stand out more in the gym since it s a popular brand i see out there in black text      
584,5.0,                       son loves the feel and performance     
585,5.0,                       i like the color choices on these balls it is extremely helpful on club basketball practice days with approximately       players in the gym  great grip and feel for dribbling  passing and shooting     
586,5.0,                       good product  fast shipping  recommended      
587,4.0,                       like     
588,5.0,                       love this basketball  i got it for my rec basketball team to use during practices and warm ups  the refs always ask to use it for the games too      
589,5.0,                       i have always bought spalding in the past but it was hard to ignore the views for this basketball  i gave this wilson ball a chance and am loving it  also get to show off my celtic pride with the green wording option  awesome grip and gushy      
590,5.0,                       great indoor ball   i have played with a group of guys every week for years  one guy had this same wilson evolution ball and it is the one we alway choose to use for game ball   so i got it here and it is truly the best   holds its bounce  great feel to the ball  like a quality leather feel   everyone likes playing with it      
591,5.0,                       great ball  i d buy again     
592,5.0,                       i love evo s for indoor ball  but the black evo  even though it s labeled as an indoor ball is a great outdoor ball  holds up great and gives you that nice leather feel      
593,5.0,                       delivered in two days with prime love amazon prime this is the best basketball i have ever owned use only indoors ball has very good grip for ball handling bounces good at  psi thick grooves for accurate shooting this is the ball you want for indoor ballin      
594,4.0,                       very nice good pricenot as high quality as molten ball     
595,5.0,                       this is our favorite ball to use indoors  great feel all around  the needles to pump slide in very smooth  we have purchased   of these  great buy      
596,5.0,                       after reading all the reviews  this wilson evolution ball hits the sweet spot  this ball has a good amount of grip  nice balance  good bounce  and retains the air relatively well  i think i top off the ball about twice a year at most  while using it about     times a week  whenever i bring this ball to the gym or to a local tournament  it is frequently chosen as the  game  ball so this ball has been used by a lot of ballers in full court games about     times a week for about a year  i baby the ball by ensuring that it is only used indoors  that noone sits on the ball  and i do a quick wipe down with lukewarm water at the end of the day after every use  so far  the worst that i have are some normal scuffs from regular use but otherwise  the ball still performs just as well as it did the first day that i got it i ve asked folks how they felt about it after using the basketball  most like it a lot  the few complaints that i got were that some guys would think it s a bit light or too grippy  i have to admit that it is a touch on the light side but no more than an ounce or so  if it really is a bit light  as far as grip  this ball definitely has some grip but it is not so grippy as to cut your fingers like the cheap outdoor basketballs  i think it has just the right amount of grip but everyone has their own thoughts  most folks that i ve encountered have not complained about the grip of the ball and  in fact  like the amount of grip simply put  this indoor basketball is highly recommended for anyone who wants a serious  game  quality ball without paying for the official basketball      
597,5.0,                       arrived on time and looks great is a good ball     
598,1.0,                       keep getting one that looks like an egg      
599,5.0,                       i love the ball feels good and has perfect grip  it s my new baby   i have to explain almost every time i play with it  it s not plastic it s the same composite material  some people won t even try it  but that s cool i know my ball from everyone else s and i love wilson del negro     
600,5.0,                       our   year old granddaughter plays soccer and her mom  our daughter  says she has been bouncing her soccer ball around in the house   we gave her and her younger brother a paw patrol basketball earlier but her mom said she wanted a  real  basketball   we had it delivered to her for valentine s and her mom sent us a video of her opening it  she screamed  fell on top of it on the floor and hugged it   it was the perfect gift for her   i m sure she will get lots of use of it   i would recommend it to anyone  without hesitation   thank you      
601,5.0,                       a great basketball that feels good when used indoors only   every time i take this ball to the gym to play we end up using it over all the other balls  including other peoples balls that are well maintained    i little pricey  but you get what you pay for   buy with confidence that you ll be impressed      
602,5.0,                       this is my son s high school team s official ball and apparently they are lit  so  highly recommended for at least high school varsity level  also  at our community center  when he brings his ball  it is the favorite on the court  also  a good sign      
603,5.0,                       natural grip   great feel      
604,5.0,                       i got the ball today   the ball came in it s own box  the one you see at the store   i like the feel of the ball  it s got this soft spongy feel to it  it s not hard like most of the ball i had used before  one interesting thing i had noticed was the black line is not rubber at all   it s covered with the composite leather overall  i like this ballnote   for anybody that is looking for a basketball  do not get the tf      zk pro   my local gym when it first open  got    of these  now  it s all scuff up and lopsided  i have no idea how it can be lopsided   i never seen anyone kick the ball or taken half court shot with it      
605,5.0,                       exactly what my brother wanted was right size and all       
606,5.0,                       getting the colored text version has significantly cut down on the worry of my ball walking away when i m playing basketball at the gym  no difference in feel at all  would recommend for anyone looking for an evo      
607,5.0,                       evolutions are a great basketball for a good price      
608,5.0,                       just a great basketball  nothing much else to say   the only reason not to get it is if you don t want your pickup squad to always chose your ball as the game ball of the day      
609,5.0,                       love this basketball  good grip  and great color options      
610,5.0,                       amazing   great feeling       
611,1.0,                       for the price of this ball the quality should be higher than expected  the ball was delivered deflated so i had to pump it  and i did my first dribble and after couple seconds the air hole piece pushed inside the ball causing the ball to be garbage   either this was defected or terrible quality   wasted so much money for what i would expect this to be an amazing high quality ball   terrible       
612,1.0,                       terrible  seams are lifting after a handful of times using  seems like a cheap knock off      
613,5.0,                       great indoor basketball  still using it  one of the top balls on the market     
614,5.0,                       great ball  we always use it during pickup   handling gets better  shooting gets better from just this ball   the only bad thing about this ball is that when it gets wet it gets slippery      
615,5.0,                       this is the best basketball for indoor pickup games   i bring it with me to the gym and everyone always chooses it to play   i wouldn t recommend using it outside though unless you want to ruin it  but its definitely good for the gym   some may consider it too grippy but i think its perfect      
616,2.0,                       great ball  my second evolution  but after only a couple months it has problems staying inflated  would recommend buying in store      
617,5.0,                       been looking for an evolution for a long time    at a good price  its tough because this ball is rarely on sale or discounted from its regular price of      so when i saw it was     off  i had to jump      
618,5.0,                       i have used a lot of basketballs over the past    years  and this is one of the best feeling balls i have played with  i don t play as much as i used to  or would like to  but when i do this is the ball of choice      
619,5.0,                       great purchase     
620,5.0,                       this basketball is superb   it has the tack that you need to handle  and the durability to last for several seasons before thinking about a replacement   it is a well made product that will make you happy for the purchase updates  first ball purchased in april      for     replacement ball purchased in july      for     third replacement purchased in january      for    the first two are still playable and i really wanted to have a new ball for my weekly games and ad hoc workouts   so if i get  a minimum of   years out of the new ball then an   year investment in   basketballs is less than     per year and if you use only once per week each year the cost would have been less than       per week   i ll take that any day      
621,5.0,                       my   years son love it he is playing in a club team  every kid loves evolution  i bought a different color with others  easy to find after the weekly practice      
622,5.0,                       great quality   make sure you have name on the ball   his entire team uses this ball now      
623,5.0,                       awesome basketball   it s feels so soft compared to the rubber indoor outdoor balls  spalding street    well worth            wait for sales and coupons and cashback at various vendors the grip is very good   not overly tacky  but controllable feel   this ball bounces true it is the preferred ball at practice and   yo team game day best ball i have ever owned and played with      
624,5.0,                       love this basketball      
625,5.0,                       i have had difficulty finding a basketball to replace the old style spalding t        this ball does just that   better than any other ball i purchased   now i am working on training it to go in                
626,5.0,                       the jv team always used this ball for each game because of its quality      
627,5.0,                       the grip is nice  and it s definitely durable      
628,3.0,                       ball does not feel like it s the right weight     
629,5.0,                       this ball is really good for everyday indoor use  it has a rreally nice bounce and has a pro feel to it  worth every bit      
630,5.0,                       the ball came in exactly   days and is great for my    year old  the material is perfect      
631,5.0,                       nice ball leather is nice glad i bought it     
632,5.0,                       great ball     
633,5.0,                       pricey but has held up great for daily use  will buy another for my other son      
634,5.0,                       we really like this ball  have used for   months  still in great shape  only use indoors      
635,5.0,                       this ball is the standard for all indoor balls after tf      s started invested in their crappily made rubber balls  man spalding you really messed up by making cheaper basketball balls without that faux leather  wilson stepped up their game and started making these balls right here  this stuff right here is so good  man  i m about to buy me anotha one      
636,1.0,                       this must be the cheap new model i ve heard about because within weeks of receiving it   as soon as the return period ended   it stopped holding air  it goes soft every time i play  don t buy this ball      
637,5.0,                       this is the gold standard for indoor basketballs   don t use outside       
638,5.0,                       my son loves it      
639,5.0,                       great product      
640,1.0,                       i am very disappointed with this ball  every afternoon  literally    hours  the ball loses a significant amount of air and needs to be pumped   not what i had in mind for a     ball      
641,4.0,                       works     
642,5.0,                       although this ball is made in china  wilson headquarters are a few miles from home  here in chicago  il i play these balls in my gym  and they are great  i loved them from the first time i used them  i bought one for myself  and as other reviewers have noted  they are outstanding balls to be played on an indoors court  do not play this on the street  or else they will last a couple of months  otherwise  this is easily the first choice when it comes to a ball for any use other than professional nba basketball  i believe they use spaulding  i waited until the price went down  and i paid        the company claims the ball comes ready to play out of the box  but this was not my case  the pressure on my ball was   psi  when it needed to be    so i am happy i had my super kit ready to fix that       franklin sports ball maintenance kit  pump  needles   pressure gauge                         which i highly recommend you buy  this is nothing you should be worried about  as i am assuming mostly anybody has a gauge  thus  i am not taking a star off for it  this is a solid   stars product that i highly recommend without hesitation  great deal  and great ball      
643,5.0,                       really the best ball there is for indoor basketball   it s soft to touch  and retains air well   no spalding can hold a candle to it   this made me a fan of wilson balls   we typically bring this ball for shoot around  and somehow it always ends up as the game ball      
644,5.0,                       the team really thank amazon for the promptness and quality of this product      
645,1.0,                       these balls were terrible  after three months some did not hold air  others developed deformities  not the quality i expected they made me put a star in     stars      
646,5.0,                       this ball is perfect for indoor use only  wears out tho after about    mo if you play ball at least  x a week  it will start to lose grip  at that point just get another one and donate the old one to a ymca or somn      
647,5.0,                       the wilson evolution in my opinion is the best indoor ball out there   playing alot of pickup ball at local gyms i ve pretty much tries every ball at some point and this one is the best  good grip  soft feel  and nice bounce   this ball is not the top of the line wilson  its just behind the solution game ball which is the one they use for the final four games   i ve owned that ball as well and out of the box i d give the edge to the solution  but the problem there is durability   while its a dream when new  it will begin to get slick and lose its grip much more quickly than the evolution   to me the evolution  being almost as good a ball  with much better durability is the clear choice      
648,5.0,                       this is a great basketball  i bought it for my sons for xmas  they played with it regularly at the ymca in charlottesville until it was stolen from there  a kid brought a sharpie  crossed out my last name  written too small by my son  and wrote all sorts of other stuff on the ball  the guy at the y refused to review the tape  choosing rather to cover for thieves  write your name big on this ball if you ll take it anywhere thieves play      
649,4.0,                       i ve bought two of these and love the basketball   it s the standard for indoor hoops at the places i play   my second one has had a slow leak from the beginning   don t know if it was defective  or if i did something to make it start leaking      
650,5.0,                       great ball to play with  the grip is excellent and nice to play outdoor     
651,5.0,                       i was lucky and got a version of the evo that always becomes the game ball in all my league games   my roomate purchased one when he thought he lost mine  we later found it  and the quality was drastically different   his is still a good ball but mine is clearly the better one   aside from quality control  the evolution has been and always will be my favorite basketball of all time and the price point is perfect      
652,5.0,                       these are the best basketballs around  i use these with my junior high and high school basketball teams  great quality ball that will last years if they are taken care of  we use other balls at away games  other schools play with baden or nike balls and the quality just isn t as good as the evolutions      
653,1.0,                       was pretty excited to get this ball to start getting back into basketball again  but was sad to find that there was some kind of object rattling around inside the ball  it sounds like a small bead  i guess it doesn t really impact the performance  but it s pretty annoying to hear and have the rattling while handling the ball      
654,2.0,                       product great  but ordered green and got blue     
655,5.0,                       kids who know  want this basketball      
656,5.0,                       the evolution is the standard   we use the ball in all of our adult leagues   everyone prefers it for pickup ball   it has a great feel  great weight   every baller should own one      
657,5.0,                       greta quality     
658,5.0,                       my son loves this ball  wilson balls hold up very well      
659,1.0,                       i purchased this ball recommended by friends  i am very disappointed  the ball is oddly hard and i compared it with same brand other balls which are much better feel to touch  the quality of the leather is absolutely horrible  and as far as i m concerned this ball is indeed a replica  couldn t have seen this coming from amazon  i wish i would still be able to return  fake fake fake stay away     
660,5.0,                       i bought  of these my kids seem to b able to handle these very well     
661,5.0,                       arrived exactly as described      
662,5.0,                       it s a good ball     
663,5.0,                       i ve tried every ball besides the nba official ball  simply the best basketball i ve ever played with and is always the go to ball for gym pick up games      
664,1.0,                       beware  this ball is different than the ones that i have used before  the feel is different and does not bounce as well  check the print by the valve  it is different from the original   chex just get it from the store  you know what you are getting  you are paying more for this basketball because of the feel and bounce  this ball will disappoint you  mark my words      
665,5.0,                       my grandson loved it     
666,5.0,                       this is the best indoor ball i have ever used  there is a reason why almost everyone uses this brand  great ball  never use outside      
667,1.0,                       it s fake  doesn t feel like an evolution ball  dont buy     
668,5.0,                       great basketball for indoor purposes good leather and excellent grip      
669,1.0,                       have to change my review to   star  i can no longer inflate the ball   always properly stored inside and indoor use only   the needle goes in fine but cannot add air      
670,3.0,                       nice blue color logo  much harder grip than the   evilutions i ve had before  might return  not sure yet      
671,5.0,                       love this ball   my previous one from   years ago was still going strong but only recently started to not hold air well so i bought a new one when it went on sale      
672,5.0,                       best ball you can use indoors     
673,3.0,                       we ordered this ball for my son  thinking the word  wilson  was in red  it s magenta  we returned it      
674,2.0,                       even though the appearance speaks of this being a wilson evolution ball  i question its authenticity  it feels like a     outdoor ball you d buy at a wal mart  i ve had numerous wilson evolution basketballs  and this definitely is not one  potential fake product  disappointing      
675,5.0,                       best indoor ball  period      
676,5.0,                       needed a decent ball for my  th grade son  everyone tries to take this one at practice  including the coach lol i was super pumped to see it as a black friday deal  or cyber monday   one or the other   he keeps ending up on the  celtics  team so the green has been fitting  i didn t necessarily want green but the sale was too good to pass up  it s a great ball      
677,5.0,                       like     
678,5.0,                       love the basketball nice quality and all our friends love the colors on it     
679,5.0,                       im a natural gym rat  played with all types basketballs in my career  the wilson evolution is one of the best  nice feel on the ball and a very durable ball      
680,5.0,                       come how it was supposed to     
681,5.0,                       great ball   never get mixed up at the court with anyone else s ball     
682,4.0,                       i run a community basketball program for seniors  i purchased a spaulding tf      classic and a wilson evolution from a sporting goods store to allow my group to compare the balls  everyone loved the evolution  the spaulding is rarely used  so after one saturday session  i purchased   more evolutions for the  group through amazon  they ve been a huge hit  the balls have a nice feel to them  they re a little softer than the spaulding  i can t comment on how they might last under constant use  it s only been about   months  but so far so good also  they were      through here vs      from the sporting goods store  not an insignificant price difference  i would recommend the evolution      
683,5.0,                       i like the feel of this ball for indoor use      
684,5.0,                       love it  looks pretty cool with the blue stitching  plus cant mix it up with other basketballs since this one has a different color      
685,5.0,                       i got this for a friend as a gift  as far as i know it works great  this is my favorite brand of indoor ball to play with  i just wish it was cheaper      
686,1.0,                       continues to go flat despite being the best ball available  i recommend buying it new      
687,5.0,                       the best ball for high schoolers      
688,5.0,                       great basketball  phenomenal grip      
689,5.0,                       my son uses this basketball a lot for his practices   the best part is the color because it s easily recognized and hasn t gotten stolen like many of his other balls      
690,5.0,                       i m the only one in the gym with a red lettering evolution  which makes it that much harder to steal      
691,3.0,                       great ball and love the feel  however     this is my second one  got a replacment after the first one became lopsided within  a little over a week    it s great in the beginning but not a couple weeks later it s already become lopsided again  i ve taken care of this ball to the t  never bounce it off the court  always bring it inside and placed on a shelf  never kick or slam the ball on anything  don t know why they become so easily lopsided  in any case  great ball though a little frustrating that it s an expensive ball and doesn t hold up for very long      
692,5.0,                       nice feel  good indoor ball     
693,4.0,                       currently i have this evolution that i ordered here from amazon  another one i gotten from walmart  original tf      i bought used from ebay  the rock  and the bade elite basketball   there seems to be different colors from the amazon one to the walmart one   anywho  people who are saying this must be a bad batch or whatever might need to reconsider   any composite leather basketball is going to feel slick and not grippable at the beginning   this is the case for all the balls i own right now except for tf      because it was used   you must break them in    it doesn t take   day or   week  it takes months   i m talking about     month and depends on how much you play with them   at first at the local gym i go to  everyone had the wilson evolution and it felt totally different with mine   so i asked them where did you get the ball thinking that i had a bad batch or something   it felt buttery smooth and felt like real leather and had a nice tact and feel to it   they told me you had to break them in   all these guys at least had the ball for    month   one kid had the ball for only   month and felt buttery smooth and i m assuming he played alot on them   the best wilson evolution ball i felt was a ball that a guy had for    years   it s the ball game every game because everyone likes it but i would say out of the box  i believe the rock had the nicest feeling   it was the most tackiest and felt nice   of course  that ball has to be broken in as well and other people at the local has lot of the rock as well and feels nice once it s broken in      
694,1.0,                       loses air nightly  have to pump daily  effective product  son wrote name on it and tossed packaging or i would return it  buy it at brick and mortar store  defective here     
695,5.0,                       ball feels so smooth and light  definitely improved my game from practicing with this ball in an indoor court compared to those used balls that gyms provide    my ball game has improved drastically     
696,5.0,                       my girls love these balls  great colors      
697,5.0,                       my boy has gotten an under armour then a nike last year  but nike would lose air every single day so it s very frustrating to spend time pumping and re pumping day after dayhe started talking about this wilson evolution ball after his friends checked out one from their lifetime fitness member service  so i started checking out pricesamazon prime shipped this ball to us in two days  fully aired  in its original packageboth my boy and myself are very happy with this purchase  worth every penny of it  much better than ua and nike balls     
698,1.0,                       i love the evolution but thought this would be dark red as it was described as scarlet   it s not red it s pink      
699,5.0,                       we always argue which one is the best  wilson evolution or spalding tf      both are great balls  the wilson evolution is one of our favorites in one court  and the tf      in other  i would highly recommend it      
700,5.0,                       she now has an official game ball that she can use all the time  now we have even more excuse to hit them courts   ballislife     
701,3.0,                       we ve had this ball for   years  only used indoors and no more than   dozen times  the ball never softened up  still hard as a rock  i m not sure this is a real evolution      
702,5.0,                       i ve had it for a few months and i use very regularly  it has the perfect texture for indoors and it keeps the air pressure pretty well too      
703,5.0,                       i really like the color  i had this ball in the past and it s good that someone took it while a poco game    i had to buy another one and this color stands out      
704,5.0,                       positive experience     
705,1.0,                       my ball came with a slow leak i would have air it up everyday     
706,5.0,                       was using a indoor outdoor wilson ball and decided to buy a dedicated indoor ball   very nice leather  has a nice bounce to it and suprising its held its air pressure since the first time i pumped it  never had to adjust or repump like my buddy who has an older iteration of this ball  i came from using a tf       which my bulldog destroyed    the channels also feel nice and deep on this ball compared to others i ve tried  def happy with my purchase      
707,5.0,                       i play in a weekly pickup game and this is the only basketball we ll use   it has great grip without feeling sticky and is both light and responsive   if you plan on playing indoors more than just occasionally  you owe it to yourself to pick up one of these balls      
708,3.0,                       good ball but after some use it started to get all oval and egg shaped  wish they would last a lot longer than they do      
709,5.0,                       i had read some previous reviews about them not being inflated  or not holding air   no complaints with ours   we bought    my son practices with them every single day   great indoor   outdoor ball      
710,4.0,                       best ball around   this is my  nd one   the guys i play b ball with every week all have gotten one  we have     to choose from each week because they re so popular  the only bad weird thing about this ball is  as it gets older  it gets heavier   across the board   we have several older ones where i play and all are heavier than the new ones   it s strange     everyone notices it      
711,5.0,                       the best game ball you can get for          
712,4.0,                       let me start by saying  i never write reviews  i m the guy that just doesn t feel like it  however  i play a lot of basketball and feel the need to warn anyone looking to purchase this ball  i like the evolution  it is the new standard at every gym i play at  i ordered this one with the green lettering  simply  so i could tell it apart from everyone else s because everyone has the same ball these days  as soon as i opened the box and took the ball out  i knew something was off  the ball looked small  there was no way this ball was official size         i hadn t even taken it out of the packaging and it could tell it wasn t  once i took it out i compared it a to an official size top flight and it was noticeably smaller  i thought maybe it s the green lettering and an optical illusion  so i brought it to the gym to compare it other evolution balls  theory confirmed  everyone i had look at it all said the same thing   it does look a little smaller   it s almost it was    and not       i ve exchanged it  but this time i chose the royal blue   i ll update this review once it comes in  for the record  the ball itself looks and feels great  the size definitely threw me off though      
713,5.0,                       great ball   it seems to handle humidity a little better than some other indoor balls   i had my first for   years of bi weekly pick up before it lost it s shape slightly      
714,5.0,                       i really like the evolution balls  we always use them in pickup morning ball  i bought the colored blue one so i would be able to quickly identify which ball was mine   works perfectly and everyone knows which ball is mine right away great buy  would recommend  red was out of stock when i bought it but blue is a really nice royal blue color      
715,4.0,                       very good basketball with a good feel   only issue was the color is more like pink   was looking for closer to red   the ball was for my daughter and she loves the ball  but she did make comment the emblem looks more pink  which she is not a fan of      
716,5.0,                       my sons needed a ball for court practice only   this was the best one i could find in the      size   they like it  and it seems to be favored by the rest of the teammates   that about says it all        
717,5.0,                       nice     
718,5.0,                       very grippy and soft    nd one i ve bought off of amazon because the first one someone walked off with        
719,5.0,                       best indoor ball money can buy  i tried multiple others and they just don t compare  lots of grip and control and not a lot of bounce of the rim  great ball      
720,5.0,                       love the neon accents   present for my adult son and he loved it   great ball      
721,5.0,                       these are the best indoor ball you can buy   i now own   for all the players in my family and almost all of their teammates have purchased them as well   great grip that doesn t seem to take on the dirt from the floor   soft feel  but firm bounce      
722,5.0,                       the only ball we play with in doors     
723,5.0,                         update          even better after being used for a while   it s now broken in and is the ball that is used for all pickup games at the ymca   people get mad when i leave and they have to use a different ball just played with it for the first time   probably the best ball i have ever owned   excellent grip  very soft  came inflated to the perfect amount   if you don t mind paying a little for an indoor only ball   this is the one      
724,4.0,                       i could not believe how expensive basketballs were   i used my shop with points and my son loved it      
725,5.0,                       best ball i ve ever owned  for indoor use  i wouldn t pick anything else  by far the highest quality indoor ball on the market  i ve owned ones that last year s with regular use      indoor only      
726,5.0,                       this basketball is well worth the price   the grip  construction  and bounce of this ball are exceptional and better than expected   the feel and play of the ball off the floor and rim while dribbling and shooting is far above average enhancing the experience of playing the game of basketball   would recommended this basketball for anyone looking for a high quality basketball without breaking the bank   having used several different brands and types of basketballs in the past    years  i find this one to be the best i have used  we have used this basketball daily for about one month now and it still remains just like new      
727,3.0,                       so i just got my ball today and i opened it up and there s writing on the ball   colley   i m assuming this is a used ball instead of a new one  anyone else have this issue  i mean a ball is a ball but i would have rather had it look new with no sharpie writing on it      
728,4.0,                       was a gift for my son and he is a fan     
729,5.0,                       finally a basketball that my son can use over and over without needing to be pumped with air after each use  great basketball      
730,5.0,                       nice to have the ball with different colors for the brand lettering     
731,5.0,                       great      
732,1.0,                       not sure if these were fakes or seconds or what but the quality of these balls was very poor  the seams were uneven  the ball felt dead even though inflated to proper psi  i have played with other evolution balls and they were great  i compared this one to one my friend has  purchased at dick s  and you can clearly see the difference in quality  the dicks ball has perfect seams none are raised or low  the ball has great responsiveness from the dribble and just feels like a much nicer ball to play with  i returned the first one i got and the second one wasn t any better so i returned it as well  ended up getting the ball from dicks and that ball is nice      
733,1.0,                       i think i got a seconds  or a knock off  one of the seams is already delaminating   and the ball is off a bit     it is not as soft or responsive as other wilson evolution balls i play with  on a court with pros  year after year    decade after decade   ballin     
734,3.0,                       this is a great ball and one i order once a year  you d be hard pressed to find a better indoor game ball  particularly for the price however  this particular ball that was shipped had a minor flaw  the rubber valve for the pump needles was manufactured poorly  it was slightly too small and also fastened to the ball too loosely  so after i pump it up and pull the needle out  air leaks out  more than typical  and the rubber protrudes from the ball just a bit more than it should the ball is still playable  but the valve issue is noticeable while gripping the ball to shoot      
735,5.0,                       this ball is worth the price  it is well made  the ball bounces with accurate integrity  the ridge that stretches from the back rib lines is smooth and allows an accurate bounce      
736,5.0,                       evolution s are my favorite basketballs          
737,5.0,                       my son      loves this basketball   he says the coach always wants to use it for the game ball   however  his advanced skills coach says the most important thing to consider when buying a ball is buying one you re willing to use anywhere  indoors and out    he emphasizes the most important thing you need to do to get better is to practice   inside  outside  everywhere you go   get a    ball  wear it out and get another one having said that  i m glad i got him the great quality ball for indoor bragging rights      
738,5.0,                       it s a great ball although it feel alittle on the light side  and it s slippery when you get sweat in it     
739,5.0,                       husband wanted this ball specifically and he s been loving it  we could not find it anywhere near us in store so ordered it here  it s great      
740,5.0,                       bought this for my    year old son who plays indoor and outdoor basketball  he specifically wanted this ball for indoor use and said it works great  he did have to add a little air to it when it arrived as he said it was a little flat  and he had to add more air to it maybe   weeks later  i asked him if there was something wrong with the ball  i know nothing about basketball but that just seemed like it was losing air too fast imo  but he said the ball is used a lot so it s not uncommon to have to add air often  i ll take his word for it i guess  he said it s perfect for indoors  he can grip it well and it does whatever it s supposed to do  previously  i had bought him a spalding indoor outdoor ball but he said that one was better for outdoor use after using it for awhile which is why he made me buy him another ball for indoor only  he seems to think basketballs are super cheap i guess but that s a whole other story  the reason he specifically wanted this ball was because when he was at the gym  some stranger that they were playing with had this ball and he liked how he could handle it better than the spalding      
741,5.0,                       best unofficial indoor basketball on the market     
742,4.0,                       i am used to playing with the spalding leather nba balls  but gave this one a chance based on the rave reviews   the ball feels tacky and has decent grip  but it still  feels   smells  bounces and plays like a synthetic ball   i m fortunate to have some hardwood next door to play on   the ball shoots well because it has good grip   however  i still miss the old wilson jet and jet iii balls from high school   i think those were the best leather balls ever made  and certainly better than any ball spalding  nike  molten  or rawlings ever made the evolution is a decent ball  good  but not great      
743,4.0,                       i love these basketballs  it s the only ones i used and mostly everyone else too  i wanted a custom color to help distinguish my ball from others  i write my name on it too but the color helps prevent anyone else from accidentally taking it  however  the red looks more pink  everyone that sees the ball  refers to it as the  pink ball  and not the red ball  someone even called it the  breast cancer awareness ball  lol  i wish they had a purple one since it was my school color  the quality of the basketball is as good as you d expect  just be aware if you re getting the scarlet color      
744,1.0,                       it was a nice ball when we first received it  however   months later it will not hold air  it has only been used on gym floors and kept indoors      
745,5.0,                       grandson loves this ball      
746,5.0,                       this is for indoor only  one bounce on the sidewalk and it busted     
747,5.0,                       love it     
748,2.0,                       i tried for a month to break this in    but it just isn t the same ball as the ones that others bring to your gym  it doesn t have the same grip or general feel  and looses air very quickly   better than your average ball still  but not what i paid for and not worth          
749,5.0,                       fantastic ball  would buy again      
750,5.0,                       this was a gift for our grandson  it has an excellent feel to it and is a great step up from his previous basketball  well worth the extra     if your budget can afford it      
751,5.0,                       very good indoor basketball     
752,5.0,                       i ve grown up using t     balls in middle school and high school basketball games  but this seems to be the go to ball nowadays   everyone at    hour fitness that i play basketball at uses this ball to play   it has a nice grip when dry  not too grippy like rubber balls   has a good bounce  not too bouncy nor deflated   and it holds air very well   i ve had it for months and haven t had to put air in it yet   it is not lop sided or goes lop sided easily like many balls out there do    spalding comes to mind make sure you keep it dry wiped off  don t use it outdoors or leave in sun  and it should last a loooooong time   it s always in the trunk of my car when i am not using it  and i park my car outside in the      degree summer sun and this ball is still performing like it should      
753,5.0,                       feels exactly the same just a different color so it s easy to distinguish which basketball is yours  would buy again      
754,5.0,                       great indoor ball     
755,5.0,                       these wilson evolution basketballs are great for indoor use  i ve bought several and they are all well made  the grip is excellent and lasts for a while  it also seems to retain air well  worth the investment if you will be playing several times a week  these are for indoor use  it will not last on the outdoor courts      
756,5.0,                       this is the ball to get   you will not be disappointed   in my opinion this is the current top ball in this class      
757,5.0,                       exactly as described      
758,5.0,                       ballislife     
759,1.0,                       the ball is fake or something isnt right  i ve had one before and it was never like this  it has no bounce to it     
760,5.0,                       a good quality ball is important  others have deteriorated quickly but this is built to last worth the extra cost     
761,5.0,                       it s a very good ball and it s the official size  but it s funny when people see the different color and say it feels smaller but i m like it s the same size bro stop hating on my greatness     
762,5.0,                       great buy  exactly as advertised     
763,5.0,                       great ball   my son loves it     
764,5.0,                       the evolution is the best indoor ball my sons have used  after years of club and high school team play    my old one still has great grip and feel   we purchased another as a gift to someone who wants a  real ball    i m happy to recommend it   just be sure you only use it indoors in gyms      
765,4.0,                       playing basketball for    years  this ball has good feel  good grip even with sweaty hands  needs breaking in  to remove shine  all the guys prefer this over the spalding      
766,5.0,                       i ve seen this ball used in many gyms across colleges  this has a great grip and lasts pretty long  every time i touch the ball i feel all of the bump and grips to my hand even when it feels dry   excellent game time ball and pick up game  you want to write your name on this one because if you leave it at a gym it may not come back to you      
767,5.0,                       probably the best ball i ve ever played with  feels great  holds air well  and the guys always choose this ball to play with when we play pickup ball  you can t go wrong      
768,5.0,                       this is the best indoor basketball for most of league play and pickup games  the touch  feel  grip are good excellent  highly recommended for indoor games      
769,5.0,                       i love the color way option but it s definitely a little pricey for an indoor ball  or ball period   from a parent s perspective   my daughter loved it  of course  the grip is decent
